Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors, mainly the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh, right, the formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, but wait, the albedo is the same for both planets, so that part might cancel out. So I can ignore the albedo for now because it's the same in both cases.

The star's parameters are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff 6300 K. The planets each have their own mass and radius, but for equilibrium temperature, those probably don't matter because T_eq is more about distance and the star's output, not the planet's size or mass. So I can probably focus on the distance each planet is from the star.

The problem mentions that both planets are detected using transit and RV methods. The RV method gives the mass and the distance via the Doppler shift. So the RV shift is related to the planet's mass and its orbital period and distance. The transit method gives the radius, but for this question, it's probably the RV data that's more important because it relates to the Doppler shift.

Wait, the question says that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å in the same line. Oh, right, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But wait, in RV measurements, the shift is often given as the semi-amplitude K. So K is the maximum velocity the star moves due to the planet.

Wait, but in the question, it's given as a wavelength shift. So delta lambda is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The original line is at 6300 Å. So the fractional shift is delta_lambda / lambda. Let's calculate that.

For Planet1: 0.03 / 6300 = 4.76e-6.
For Planet2: 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.35e-6.

Hmm, but wait, the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

But wait, no, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ), but that's probably too complicated. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/ ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps a better approach is to use the Doppler shift to find the velocity of the star. Since the shift is given as delta_lambda, which is related to velocity. So for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star. So, K = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c, but wait, actually, because delta_lambda is the shift, which is the change in wavelength, and the formula is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is delta_lambda = lambda * (v/c), so delta_lambda/lambda = v/c. So v = c * (delta_lambda/lambda).

So for Planet1: v1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) ≈ c * 4.76e-6 ≈ (3e8 m/s) * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1428 m/s. Wait, wait a second, let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.03 Å is 3e-8 meters, and 6300 Å is 6300e-10 meters = 6.3e-7 meters. So delta_lambda is 3e-8 m, lambda is 6.3e-7 m. So delta_lambda / lambda is (3e-8)/(6.3e-7) ≈ 0.0476. So the fractional shift is about 0.0476.

Wait, but wait, in Doppler shift, the formula is (v/c) = delta_lambda/lambda. So v = (delta_lambda/lambda) * c. So for Planet1, v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Let me compute that:

0.03 / 6300 = 0.0000047619 ≈ 4.7619e-6.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s): 4.7619e-6 * 3e8 = 142,857 m/s? Wait, that can’t be right because that’s way too high. Wait, wait, no, 4.76e-6 times 3e8 is (4.76e-6)*(3e8) = 1.428e3 m/s, which is 1428 m/s. That's a reasonable velocity for a star due to a planet.

Similarly, for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04 Å.

So delta_lambda / lambda = 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.349e-6.

v2 = (6.349e-6) * 3e8 ≈ 1.9047e3 m/s, which is approximately 1904.7 m/s.

So both K1 (Planet1's semi-amplitude) is ~1428 m/s and K2 is ~1905 m/s.

Now, the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period and the mass of the star. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (star is 1.5 solar masses, planets are 5 and 7 Earth masses; M_earth is about 3e-6 solar masses, so M_p is negligible compared to M_star). So the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (c * M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ) )^(1/1?), wait maybe I should write the approximate formula.

Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (2 c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But perhaps a better approach is to find the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2, since we have both K1 and K2, and perhaps the periods P1 and P2.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the periods. Hmm, so perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, the star's parameters are given, including Teff. The star's luminosity can be found using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So L = sigma * (4 pi R_star^2) * Teff^4.

Once we have L, the equilibrium temperature of each planet depends on their distance from the star. The formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4).

But wait, another version is T_eq = ( L (1 - albedo) / (16 pi sigma a^2) )^(1/4 ). Since L = sigma T_eff^4 * 4 pi R_star^2, substituting gives T_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 ) / (2^(1/2) )? Wait, maybe I should rederive it.

The incident flux from the star at distance a is L / (4 pi a^2 ). The planet reflects some of it (albedo A) and absorbs the rest. The absorbed power is (1 - A) * (L/(4 pi a^2 )) * pi R_p^2, where R_p is the planet's radius. The planet emits as a blackbody with surface area 4 pi R_p^2, so the power radiated is 4 pi R_p^2 sigma T_eq^4.

Setting them equal: (1 - A) * (L/(4 pi a^2 )) * pi R_p^2 = 4 pi R_p^2 sigma T_eq^4.

Simplify: (1 - A) * L / (4 pi a^2 ) * pi R_p^2 = 4 pi R_p^2 sigma T_eq^4.

Cancel R_p^2 from both sides: (1 - A) L pi / 4 pi a^2 = 4 sigma T_eq^4.

Simplify: (1 - A) L / (4 a^2 ) = 4 sigma T_eq^4.

Multiply both sides by 4 a^2: (1 - A) L = 16 sigma a^2 T_eq^4.

So T_eq^4 = ( (1 - A) L ) / (16 sigma a^2 )

Take the fourth root:

T_eq = [ ( (1 - A) L ) / (16 sigma a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

But L is 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4. So substitute:

T_eq = [ (1 - A) * 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4 / (16 sigma a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(1 - A) * 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4 / (16 sigma a^2 ) = (1 - A) * pi R_star^2 Teff^4 / (4 a^2 )

So T_eq^4 = ( (1 - A) pi R_star^2 Teff^4 ) / (4 a^2 )

Take the fourth root:

T_eq = Teff * [ ( (1 - A) pi R_star^2 ) / (4 a^2 ) ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express T_eq as:

T_eq = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, let me try that.

Starting from the equation:

T_eq^4 = ( (L (1 - A) ) ) / ( 16 pi sigma a^2 )

But L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4.

So substitution gives:

T_eq^4 = [ (4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4 (1 - A) ) ] / (16 pi sigma a^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [4 pi R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A) sigma ] / [16 pi sigma a^2 ]

Cancel pi and sigma:

= [4 R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A) ] / [16 a^2 ]

= [ R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A) ] / [4 a^2 ]

So T_eq^4 = (R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A)) / (4 a^2 )

Take the fourth root:

T_eq = Teff * (R_star) / (2 a ) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Which simplifies to:

T_eq = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is the same, so when taking the ratio T1/T2, that term cancels.

So the ratio T1 / T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1 )) / ( R_star/(2 a2 )) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1 )

Which implies T_ratio = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So the key is to find the ratio of a1 to a2, then take the square root.

But to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets, we need to relate the RV data. Because K is related to the planet's mass and the distance.

So the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which depends on the mass of the planet, the period, and the star's mass. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi / sqrt(1 - e^2) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, and sin i is approximately 1 (assuming i ≈ 90 degrees, which is often the case for transiting planets).

Simplifying, K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ) * (2 pi) / ( sqrt(1 - 0) )) )

Wait, actually, the correct formula is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so denominator becomes M_star^(2/3). Also, sin i ≈1, so:

K ≈ ( (2 pi G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of the orbital distance a.

Another approach: for circular orbits, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P via Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 pi^2 / G (M_star + M_p)) ) a^3

But since M_p << M_star, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 / (G M_star)) a^3

So, a^3 = G M_star P^2 / (4 pi^2 )

Wait, no, more accurately,

a^3 = (G (M_star + M_p) P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

But since M_p is negligible, a^3 ≈ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

So, a ≈ [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

But I don't have P for each planet, only the K (semi-amplitude). Hmm.

Alternatively, since K is known for both planets, and the masses are known, perhaps we can relate the velocities to the semi-major axes.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But this seems complicated without knowing P.

Wait, but from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star )

So P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )

So substituting P into the K equation.

Let me denote M_star as M, M_p as m, and P as period.

So substituting P from Kepler's law into K's formula:

K = [ (2 pi G ) / c^3 ]^(1/3) * ( m ) / [ (M + m )^(2/3) * ( (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M )) )^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of another way.

Alternatively, can I express K in terms of a?

Yes, because from the relation between K and a.

We can write:

K = (v) = (2 pi a )/(P) * ( (G (M + m) )/(4 pi^2 ) )^(1/3 ) * (something?), but perhaps another approach.

Wait, from the formula of K:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (m sin i) / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) * (1/P )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) )

So P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) ) )

Substituting P into K's expression:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (m) / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) * (1/( sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) ) ) ) )^(1/3 )

That's a bit messy, but let's compute it step by step.

Let me write it as:

K = [ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * m / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) ] * [ (G (M + m )) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Wait, because 1/P^(1/3) is [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) ) ) ]^(-1/6 )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of a.

We have:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (m ) / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3 )

And from Kepler's law,

P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) )

So 1/P = [ ( G (M + m) )/(4 pi^2 a^3 ) ]^(1/2 )

Thus,

1/P^(1/3 ) = [ ( G (M + m) )/(4 pi^2 a^3 ) ]^(1/6 )

Substituting back into K:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * m / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) * [ ( G (M + m) )/(4 pi^2 a^3 ) ]^(1/6 )

Now, let's combine the exponents.

Let me compute each part:

(2 pi G )^(1/3 ) = (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 )

m is just m.

Denominator: (M + m )^(2/3 )

The other term: [ G (M + m) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ]^(1/6 ) = G^(1/6) (M + m )^(1/6) (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6) a^(-3/6 )

Simplify exponents:

G^(1/3) * G^(1/6) = G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) = G^(1/2 )

(M + m )^(2/3 ) * (M + m )^(1/6 ) = (M + m )^(5/6 )

Wait, no: denominator has (M + m )^(2/3 ), and the other term has (M + m )^(1/6 ), but in the numerator because it's in the exponent.

Wait, no, the term is [G (M + m) ] in numerator, so when raised to 1/6, it's G^(1/6) (M + m )^(1/6 ).

So putting it all together:

K = (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 ) * m * [ G^(1/6 ) (M + m )^(1/6 ) ) ] / [ (M + m )^(2/3 ) * (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) * a^(1/2 ) ) ]

Wait, let me compute each factor.

First, the G terms: G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) = G^(1/2 )

The (M + m ) terms: (M + m )^(1/6 ) / (M + m )^(2/3 ) ) = (M + m )^(1/6 - 4/6 ) = (M + m )^(-3/6 ) = (M + m )^(-1/2 )

The constants: (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6 )

Wait, 4 pi^2 is (2^2 pi^2 ), so (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6 ) = (2^2 )^(-1/6 ) * (pi^2 )^(-1/6 ) = 2^(-1/3 ) pi^(-1/3 )

So putting it all together:

K = [ (2 pi )^(1/3 ) ] * [ (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6 ) ] * [ G^(1/2 ) ] * m * (M + m )^(-1/2 ) ) / ( a^(1/2 ) )

Let me compute the constants:

(2 pi )^(1/3 ) * (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6 )

= (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )) ) * (4^(-1/6) pi^(-2/6) )

4 is 2^2, so 4^(-1/6 ) = (2^2 )^(-1/6 ) = 2^(-1/3 )

Similarly, pi^(-2/6 ) = pi^(-1/3 )

So the constants become:

2^(1/3 ) * 2^(-1/3 ) * pi^(1/3 ) * pi^(-1/3 ) = 1.

So the constants multiply to 1.

So K simplifies to:

K = [ G^(1/2 ) * m ] / [ (M + m )^(1/2 ) * a^(1/2 ) ) ]

Which can be written as:

K = [ G m / ( (M + m ) a ) ]^(1/2 )

Hmm, that's a more manageable form.

So K = sqrt( G m / ( (M + m ) a ) )

But since m << M, M + m ≈ M, so:

K ≈ sqrt( G m / ( M a ) )

Which can be rearranged to:

K^2 = G m / ( M a )

So a = G m / ( M K^2 )

Wait, let's see:

From K^2 = G m / (M a )

=> a = G m / ( M K^2 )

So a is proportional to (m) / (K^2 )

So for two planets, a1 and a2:

a1 = G M_p1 / ( M_star * K1^2 )

a2 = G M_p2 / ( M_star * K2^2 )

So the ratio a1 / a2 = ( M_p1 / K1^2 ) / ( M_p2 / K2^2 )

= ( M_p1 K2^2 ) / ( M_p2 K1^2 )

Because G and M_star cancel out.

So a1/a2 = ( M_p1 * K2^2 ) / ( M_p2 * K1^2 )

Wait, because a1 is proportional to (m_p / K^2 ), so a1/a2 = (m1 / K1^2 ) / (m2 / K2^2 ) ) = ( m1 * K2^2 ) / ( m2 * K1^2 )

So, then the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( ( a2 ) / ( a1 ) )

But a1/a2 = ( m1 K2^2 ) / ( m2 K1^2 )

So a2/a1 = ( m2 K1^2 ) / ( m1 K2^2 )

Therefore,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( ( m2 K1^2 ) / ( m1 K2^2 ) )

= ( K1 / K2 ) * sqrt( m2 / m1 )

So T1 / T2 = ( K1 / K2 ) * sqrt( m2 / m1 )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

We have:

K1 = 1428 m/s (from Planet1)
K2 = 1905 m/s (from Planet2)
m1 = 7 Earth masses
m2 = 5 Earth masses

So,

K1/K2 = 1428 / 1905 ≈ 0.75.

sqrt(m2/m1) = sqrt(5/7) ≈ sqrt(0.7143) ≈ 0.845.

So T1/T2 = 0.75 * 0.845 ≈ 0.634.

Wait, but wait, that's the ratio T1/T2. But the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So is it T1/T2 or T2/T1?

Wait, in the formula, T1 is for Planet1, T2 for Planet2. So if T1/T2 is 0.634, that would mean Planet1 is cooler than Planet2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck.

The formula was T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But a2 is the distance of Planet2, a1 for Planet1.

If a2 > a1, then T1 would be less than T2 because T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

So if a2 > a1, T1 < T2.

So if the ratio a2/a1 is greater than 1, T1/T2 is less than 1.

In any case, from the earlier steps, T1/T2 = ( K1/K2 ) * sqrt( m2/m1 )

Which is (1428/1905) * sqrt(5/7) ≈ 0.75 * 0.845 ≈ 0.634.

So T1 is about 0.634 times T2, so the ratio is approximately 0.63.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

Hmm, 0.63 isn't exactly any of the options. The closest options are C (0.53) and A (0.98).

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate the numbers.

Compute K1 and K2 correctly.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating K1 and K2.

So delta_lambda is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

The line is at 6300 Å.

So delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6300 = 0.0000047619 ≈ 4.7619e-6.

Similarly, for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.349e-6.

So then, v1 = c * (delta_lambda/lambda) = (3e8 m/s) * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

v2 = 3e8 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1904.7 m/s.

So K1 is 1428.57 m/s, K2 is 1904.7 m/s.

Now, compute K1/K2 = 1428.57 / 1904.7 ≈ 0.75.

m1 is 7 Earth masses, m2 is 5 Earth masses.

Compute sqrt(m2/m1) = sqrt(5/7) ≈ 0.845.

So T1/T2 ≈ 0.75 * 0.845 ≈ 0.634.

Hmm, but the options don't have 0.63. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that a is proportional to (m_p) / (K^2 ), but maybe I should have used the ratio correctly.

Wait, let me rederive the a1 and a2.

We have a = G m_p / ( M K^2 )

So a1 = (G m1 )/( M K1^2 )

a2 = (G m2 )/( M K2^2 )

The ratio a1/a2 = ( m1 K2^2 ) / ( m2 K1^2 )

So a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 )

Compute the squares:

1904.7^2 ≈ (approx 1900)^2 = 3,610,000. Let me compute more accurately:

1904.7 * 1904.7: 1900^2 = 3,610,000, 2 * 1900 *4.7 = 2*1900*4.7= 1900*9.4= 17,860, and 4.7^2≈22.09. So total ≈ 3,610,000 +17,860 +22.09 ≈ 3,627,882.09.

Similarly, 1428.57^2: 1428.57 is approximately 1000 + 428.57. Alternatively, 1428.57^2 = (1400 +28.57)^2 = 1400^2 + 2*1400*28.57 + 28.57^2.

1400^2 = 1,960,000.

2*1400*28.57 ≈ 2800 *28.57 ≈ 80,000 (since 28.57 * 2800 = 28.57 * 28 * 100 ≈ (28*28.57 is 800) 800 *100=80,000 )

28.57^2 ≈ 816.3.

So total ≈1,960,000 +80,000 +816.3 ≈2,040,816.3.

So,

a1/a2 = (7 * 3,627,882 ) / (5 * 2,040,816 )

Compute numerator: 7 * 3,627,882 ≈ 25,395,174

Denominator:5 * 2,040,816 ≈10,204,080

So ratio a1/a2 ≈ 25,395,174 / 10,204,080 ≈ 2.488.

So a1 is about 2.488 times a2.

Wait, but wait, no: a1 = (G m1 )/( M K1^2 ), a2 = (G m2 )/( M K2^2 )

So a1 / a2 = (m1 K2² )/( m2 K1² )

Which is (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 )

So yes, as calculated above, a1/a2 ≈ 2.488.

So a1 is about 2.488 times a2.

So a1 = 2.488 * a2.

Now, going back to T_eq ratio.

T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1/2.488 ) ≈ sqrt(0.402) ≈ 0.634.

So same as before.

So the ratio is approximately 0.634.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C, 0.53, but that's lower than 0.63.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for T_eq.

Let me double-check the formula derivation.

Alternative approach:

T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, all else being equal.

So, T_eq ∝ 1/ sqrt(a )

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So if a1 is larger than a2, then T1 would be smaller than T2.

In our case, a1 is larger than a2 (since a1/a2 ≈2.488), so T1 = T2 * sqrt( a2/a1 ) = T2 * sqrt( 1/2.488 ) ≈ T2 * 0.634.

So Planet1's equilibrium temperature is about 63% of Planet2's.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's about 0.53, which is a bit lower than 0.634.

Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the K1 and K2.

Wait, let me recompute K1 and K2.

K1 is calculated from delta_lambda = 0.03 Å, lambda = 6300 Å.

So delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = 0.0000047619.

v1 = c * delta_lambda/lambda = 3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly, K2 is 0.04 / 6300 = 0.0000063492. So v2 = 3e8 * 0.0000063492 ≈ 1904.7 m/s.

So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I used the wrong formula for K.

Wait, perhaps the formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i)/( (M_star) * a ) )^(1/2 )

Wait, earlier I had K = sqrt( G m_p / ( M a ) )

Which is same as sqrt( G m_p / ( M a ) )

So, a = G m_p / ( M K^2 )

So that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps I should consider the masses in solar masses.

Because m_p is in Earth masses, and M is in solar masses.

Wait, the star's mass is 1.5 solar masses.

Wait, let me compute m1 and m2 in solar masses.

Each Earth mass is about 3.003e-6 solar masses.

So m1 =7 *3e-6 =2.1e-5 solar masses.

m2=5 *3e-6=1.5e-5 solar masses.

But in the calculation for a1/a2, the M (star's mass) is in the denominator, but since it's same for both, M cancels.

So perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but in the expression a = G m_p / (M K^2 ), so G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, M in kg, K in m/s.

But since we're taking the ratio a1/a2, the G and M terms cancel, so the ratio is (m1 * K2^2 )/( m2 * K1^2 )

So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let's think differently.

Since the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which is K.

Assuming that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (m_p / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation that K is proportional to (m_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )

Hmm, perhaps another approach.

The RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, considering that the ratio K1/K2 = (m1 a2^(1/3) ) / (m2 a1^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps K is proportional to (m_p) / ( a^(1/3) ) )

So K1 / K2 = ( m1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( m2 / a2^(1/3) )

=> K1/K2 = ( m1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( m2 a1^(1/3) )

So, let me solve for a1/a2.

(K1/K2) = ( m1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( m2 a1^(1/3) )

=> (K1/K2) = ( m1 / m2 ) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

=> (a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (K1 K2)/( m1 m2 )

Wait, perhaps rearranging:

=> (a2/a1 ) = [ (K1/K2) * (m2/m1) ]^3

Wait, let me re-arrange.

From K1/K2 = (m1 a2^(1/3) ) / (m2 a1^(1/3) )

Multiply both sides by (m2 a1^(1/3) ) / m1 a2^(1/3) ):

(K1/K2) * (m2 a1^(1/3) )/(m1 a2^(1/3) ) ) =1.

So,

( ( K1 m2 ) / ( K2 m1 ) ) * ( a1 / a2 )^(1/3 ) ) = 1.

Thus,

( a1 / a2 )^(1/3 ) = ( K2 m1 ) / ( K1 m2 )

=> a1/a2 = [ ( K2 m1 )/( K1 m2 ) ]^3

So,

a1/a2 = ( (1905 *7 ) / (1428.57 *5 ) )^3

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1905 *7 ≈ 13,335.

Denominator: 1428.57 *5 ≈7,142.85.

So,

(13335 / 7142.85 ) ≈ 1.866.

Cube of 1.866 ≈ (1.866)^3 ≈ approximately 6.48.

Wait, let's compute 1.866^3:

1.866 * 1.866 = approx 3.48 (since 1.8^2=3.24, 1.86^2=3.46, 1.866^2≈3.48 ).

Then, 3.48 *1.866 ≈ approx 3.48 *1.8 = 6.264, 3.48*0.066≈0.229 → total ≈6.49.

So a1/a2 ≈6.49.

Then, T_ratio = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/6.49) ≈ sqrt(0.154) ≈ 0.392.

So T1 is about 0.39 times T2.

Wait, that's about 0.39, which is lower than 0.53. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest would be option C) ~0.53, but that's higher than 0.39.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. This alternative method gives a different result. So I'm getting conflicting results. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Because I'm getting two different results, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Alternative approach:

Using the formula K = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But I can express this as K ∝ (M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (m1 a2^(-1/3) ) / ( m2 a1^(-1/3) ) )

Which is K1/K2 = (m1 / m2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

Rearranging,

( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 ) = ( K1 K2 ) / ( m1 m2 )

Wait, let me re-express:

( a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (K1 m2 ) / ( K2 m1 )

So,

a2/a1 = [ (K1 m2 )/( K2 m1 ) ]^3

So, a2/a1 = ( (1428.57 * 5 ) / (1904.7 * 7 ) )^3

Compute numerator: 1428.57 *5 = 7142.85

Denominator: 1904.7 *7 = 13332.9

So,

(7142.85 / 13332.9 ) ≈0.536.

So,

a2/a1 ≈ (0.536 )^3 ≈0.154.

So a2/a1 ≈0.154 → a1/a2≈6.49.

Which brings us back to the earlier result.

So T_ratio = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.154) ≈0.392.

So Planet1's T_eq is 0.39 times Planet2's.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the RV semi-amplitude but about the Doppler shift in the forbidden line. Forbidden lines are usually in emission, but in this case, since the star's line is observed, the shift would relate to the star's velocity.

So, the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å is being used to detect the Doppler shift.

So, the shift is due to the star moving towards or away from us because of the planet's gravitational pull.

So, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity shift observed, which is the same as the RV semi-amplitude.

Thus, the calculation should be as before.

But perhaps another factor is involved. Let's think about the star's velocity due to the planet. The formula for K is given by:

K = [ (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/1) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 )

But perhaps the correct formula is:

K = ( ( 2 pi G ) / ( c^3 ) )^(1/3 ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But without knowing the period, it's hard to proceed. Wait, but maybe we can relate the periods using Kepler's law.

Wait, from Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_star + M_p ) )

But since M_p is negligible, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star )

So,

P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )

Thus,

P^(1/3 ) = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/6 )

= (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) a^(1/2 ) G^(-1/6 ) M_star^(-1/6 )

Substituting back into K's formula:

K = ( (2 pi G ) / c^3 )^(1/3 ) * ( M_p sin i ) / [ ( M_star )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Substituting P^(1/3 ) from above:

K = [ (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) / c ] * ( M_p ) / [ M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ] * [ ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) a^(-1/2 ) ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (2 pi )^(1/3 ) G^(1/3 ) / c ] * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * [ G^(1/6 ) M_star^(1/6 ) a^(-1/2 ) ] / [ (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ]

Combine like terms:

G exponents: 1/3 +1/6= 1/2.

M_star exponents: -2/3 +1/6 = -1/2.

M_p is M_p.

Denominator terms: (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = (2^2 pi^2 )^(1/6 )=2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 )

So,

K = [ (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/2 ) M_p ] / [ c * 2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 ) M_star^(1/2 ) a^(1/2 ) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify:

(2 pi )^(1/3 ) / 2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 ) )= [ (2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 )) ) ] / [ 2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 ) ) ] =1.

So,

K = G^(1/2 ) M_p / ( c M_star^(1/2 ) a^(1/2 ) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) )

Since M_p is much smaller, (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3 )≈1.

Thus,

K ≈ sqrt( G M_p ) / ( c sqrt( M_star a ) )

Rearranging,

K^2 = G M_p / ( c² M_star a )

=> a = G M_p / ( c² M_star K² )

So a is proportional to M_p / K².

Thus,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1 K2² ) / ( M_p2 K1² )

Which is the same as earlier.

So back to the same result as before: a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 ) ≈2.488.

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/2.488 ) ≈0.634.

But the options don't have this. So I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's luminosity affects the equilibrium temperature, but I think I considered that already.

Wait, Teff is given as 6300 K, so L is proportional to R_star^2 Teff^4.

Wait, the star's radius is 1.2 solar radii, Teff 6300 K.

So L = sigma * 4 pi R_star^2 Teff^4.

But when calculating T_eq, it's based on the star's Teff and radius.

Wait, but in the T_eq formula, the star's parameters are already accounted for, so when taking the ratio, those terms cancel.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the RV shift to find the ratio of the velocities, and then from that, the ratio of the masses times the cube of the periods, but without knowing the periods, perhaps I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the shift in the line can be used to find the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, for [OI] line at 6300 Å, shift is 0.03 Å for planet1.

So, delta_lambda = 0.03, lambda =6300.

So v1 = c * (delta_lambda/lambda ) = c * (0.03/6300) = c * 4.76e-6.

v1 ≈3e8 m/s *4.76e-6 ≈1428 m/s.

Similarly, v2=0.04/6300 *3e8 ≈1905 m/s.

So, v1=1428 m/s, v2=1905 m/s.

The RV semi-amplitude K is equal to v.

In the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 pi G )/(2 c^3) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But without knowing P, perhaps it's impossible to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 can be used along with the ratio of the masses to find the ratio of the distances a1 and a2.

Wait, from the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of a.

Wait, from the previous derivation, K = sqrt( G M_p / ( M a ) )

So, K^2 = G M_p / ( M a )

So,

a = G M_p / ( M K^2 )

Thus, the ratio a1/a2 = ( M_p1 K2^2 ) / ( M_p2 K1^2 )

Which is exactly what I did earlier.

So, with M_p1=7, K1=1428.57, M_p2=5, K2=1904.7.

Thus,

a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 ) ≈ (7 * 3.6e6 ) / (5 * 2.04e6 )

Wait, 1904.7^2 ≈3.6e6, 1428.57^2≈2.04e6.

So,

a1/a2 ≈ (7 *3.6e6 ) / (5 *2.04e6 ) → (25.2e6) / (10.2e6 ) ≈2.47.

Thus, a1≈2.47 a2.

Thus, T1 = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) * (1 - A )^0.25.

Similarly, T2 = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) * (1 - A )^0.25.

Taking the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/(2 a1) * 2 a2/( R_star ) ) ?? Wait, no, because R_star is same.

Wait, more accurately, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So again, T1/T2= sqrt( a2 / a1 )= sqrt(1 / 2.47 )≈0.63.

But the given options don't include this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact numbers more precisely.

Compute a1/a2:

m1=7, m2=5.

K1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.7 m/s.

So,

a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 )

Compute (1904.7)^2: 1904.7 *1904.7.

Let me compute it accurately.

1904.7^2 = (2000 - 95.3)^2 = 2000^2 - 2*2000*95.3 + 95.3^2.

=4,000,000 - 381,200 + 9,082.09 ≈3,628, 882.09.

Similarly, (1428.57)^2 = (1428.57)^2.

1428.57 is approximately 1400 + 28.57.

(1400 +28.57)^2 =1400^2 + 2*1400*28.57 +28.57^2.

1400^2 =1,960,000.

2*1400*28.57=2800 *28.57≈2800 *28=78,400; 2800*0.57=1,600 → total≈78,400 +1,600=80,000.

28.57^2≈816.3.

So, (1428.57)^2≈1,960,000 +80,000 +816.3=2,040,816.3.

Now,

a1/a2 = (7 * 3,628,882.09 ) / (5 * 2,040,816.3 )

Compute numerator:7 *3,628,882.09 =25,402,174.63.

Denominator:5 * 2,040,816.3=10,204,081.5.

So,

a1/a2=25,402,174.63 /10,204,081.5 ≈2.49.

Now, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/2.49 )=sqrt(0.4016 )=0.634.

Hmm, so about 0.634.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's luminosity is not the same as the Sun's, so when computing the equilibrium temperature, I must factor in the star's luminosity compared to the Sun.

The star's luminosity is L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4.

But for the purpose of T_eq, the formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but I thought that was correct.

Wait, let me compute with numbers.

Compute T_eq for each planet:

T_eq = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But since albedo is same for both, (1 - A) cancels when taking the ratio.

So,

T_eq ratio = sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

As before.

Hmm, so that can't be the problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the K velocities.

Wait, when using the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, which has a wavelength of 6300 Å.

The shift is given as a shift of 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

But the formula for Doppler shift is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c.

So, for Planet1:

v1 = c * (0.03 /6300 )=3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 ≈1428.57 m/s.

For Planet2:

v2=3e8 * (0.04/6300 )=3e8 * 6.3492e-6 ≈1904.7 m/s.

So, yes, that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the RV method gives the mass function, which depends on the inclination angle. Since we don't know the inclination, but for transiting planets, we can assume i≈90 degrees, so sin i=1.

So, it's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the shift to be in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the shift is the total shift, including both the star's reflex motion and the planet's orbital speed, but that doesn't make sense because the planet's speed is negligible compared to the star's.

Alternatively, perhaps the shift is for the entire orbit, so the semi-amplitude is half of that. But no, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum shift, so that's correct.

So, I think the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio using the square of the velocities.

Wait, from K1=1428.57, K2=1904.7.

So, K1/K2= 1428.57/1904.7≈0.75.

Masses are m1=7, m2=5.

So, (m2/m1)=5/7≈0.714.

So, T_ratio= (K1/K2) * sqrt(m2/m1 )=0.75 * sqrt(0.714 )=0.75 *0.845≈0.634.

So, again, same result.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the equilibrium temperature formula should include the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.

The correct formula is:

T_eq = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a^2) ]^(1/4 )

Since L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4,

T_eq = [ (4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify:

= [ ( R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

= Teff * [ R_star^2 / (4 a^2 ) ]^(1/4 ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )

= Teff * ( R_star / (2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )

Which is the same as before. So that's correct.

Thus, the ratio remains T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )=0.634.

But options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, the closest would be option C) 0.53, but that's significantly lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a1/a2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem states that the shift is up to 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. So that's the maximum shift, which is the semi-amplitude K. So my calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the inverse ratio. Because if a1 is larger than a2, then T1 would be smaller. So the ratio T1/T2 is less than 1. So in the options, the only one less than 1 is A) ~0.98 and C) ~0.53.

But 0.63 is between 0.53 and 0.98, closer to 0.53. But 0.63 is still higher than 0.53.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for T2/T1, which would be 1/0.634≈1.578.

Looking at the options, B) is ~1.30, which is lower than 1.58.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the formula for the RV semi-amplitude.

Wait, another formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3 ) )^(1/3 ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) )

But without knowing periods, it's hard to proceed.

Alternative approach: since we can't find a1 and a2, perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer based on the given options.

But I'm not seeing any mistake in the calculation. Perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.53, but my calculation doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the a1/a2 ratio.

Wait, a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 )

Compute 1904.7^2 =3,628, 882.09.

1428.57^2=2,040,816.3.

So,

(7 *3,628,882.09 )=25,402,174.63.

(5 *2,040,816.3)=10,204,081.5.

So,

a1/a2=25,402,174.63 /10,204,081.5 ≈2.49.

T_ratio= sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/2.49 )≈0.634.

Hmm, same result.

Another thought: perhaps I should compute the inverse ratio.

If a1 is larger than a2, T_eq is lower. So T1 is lower, so T1/T2 is 0.634, so the ratio is about 0.63. The options don't have that, but perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K.

Wait, perhaps I should compute K in terms of the shift in wavelength.

Wait, the line is at 6300 Å, so the shift is 0.03 Å, which is a delta_lambda of 0.03.

So the velocity is v = (delta_lambda/lambda) * c.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance a.

So, T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a )

So, if I find a1 and a2, I can find T_eq.

But without knowing the periods, perhaps I can relate a1 and a2 via the RV method.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star )

So,

P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )

Thus,

(2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) = ( 2 pi )/ [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ) ]^(1/6 )

= (2 pi )^(1) )^(1/6 ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) a^(-3/6 )

= (2^(1) pi^1 )^(1/6 ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) a^(-0.5 )

Hmm, perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio K1/K2 in terms of a1 and a2.

From the formula K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But since P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ), substituting P:

K = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( 2 pi / [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ) ]^(1/2 ) )^(1/3 )

Simplify the P term:

= (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * [ ( G M_star ) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Thus,

K = ( G M_p )^(1) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) a^(-3/6 )

= G^(1) M_p^(1) M_star^(-2/3 ) a^(-1/3 ) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 ) G^(1/6 ) M_star^(1/6 ) a^(-1/2 )

Combine exponents:

G: 1 + 1/6 =7/6.

M_p:1.

M_star: (-2/3 ) +1/6 = (-4/6 +1/6 )= -3/6= -0.5.

a: (-1/3 ) + (-1/2 )= (-2/6 -3/6 )= -5/6.

So,

K = (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(7/6 ) M_p M_star^(-0.5 ) a^(-5/6 )

But this seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio K1/K2 can be expressed as:

(K1/K2 ) = [ ( M_p1 a2^(-5/6 ) ) / ( M_p2 a1^(-5/6 ) ) ) ] * [ ( M_star2^(0.5 ) ) / ( M_star1^(0.5 ) ) ) ] * [ ( G etc ) terms cancel ]

Wait, but I'm not making progress.

Perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the star's parameters and focus on the planet's mass and the RV shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to (M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) ), leading to a different ratio.

But I think I've exhausted all options, and the answer is approximately 0.63, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, looking back at the question, the equilibrium temperatures are being asked. Do I need to account for the star's luminosity?

Yes, but I think I did. Because T_eq depends on the star's Teff and radius, which are given.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's luminosity is different from the Sun’s, so when computing T_eq, I should scale accordingly.

Wait, the star's luminosity is L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4.

So, for the Sun, L_sun =4 pi R_sun^2 sigma T_sun^4.

Thus, L = (R_star / R_sun )^2 (Teff / T_sun )^4 * L_sun.

So, the ratio of L to L_sun is (1.2)^2 * (6300/5778 )^4 ≈ (1.44 ) * (0.7 )^4 ≈1.44 * 0.2401 ≈0.346.

So, L=0.346 L_sun.

But in the T_eq formula, it's already incorporated because T_eq is based on the star's Teff and radius, which are used in the calculation.

So, when comparing T_eq for both planets, the ratio is only dependent on their distances.

Hmm, perhaps the options are expecting the ratio of (R_star/(2 a ))^0.5, which is the same as sqrt(R_star/(2 a )).

But that's what I've been using.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the inverse of the square root of the distance, but I'm not finding any mistake.

Given the time I've spent and not finding an error in the approach, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.63, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the ratio of the velocities and use that to find the ratio of the distances, thus the temperature ratio.

Wait, another approach:

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's law, a^3 = (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

So, a^(1/3 )= [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/9 )

Thus,

K = ( G M_p )^(1) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * [ (G M_star )^(-1/9 ) P^(-2/9 ) ) ]

Simplify exponents:

G: 1 -1/9 = 8/9.

M_p:1.

M_star: -2/3 -1/9 = -7/9.

P: -2/9.

Thus,

K = (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(8/9 ) M_p M_star^(-7/9 ) P^(-2/9 )

But without knowing P, this is not helpful.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 0.63, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the ratio using more precise numbers.

Compute a1/a2:

7 * (1904.7)^2 =7 *3,628,882 =25,402,174.

5 * (1428.57)^2 =5 *2,040,816 =10,204,080.

So,

a1/a2=25,402,174 /10,204,080 =2.49.

Thus, T1/T2= sqrt(1/2.49 )=sqrt(0.4016 )=0.634.

The options don't include this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53, but I can't reconcile it with the calculations.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) can be related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) using the formula:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p}{K^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_{p1} K_2^2}{M_{p2} K_1^2}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(K_1\) and \(K_2\)
The RV semi-amplitude is derived from the Doppler shift formula:

\[
K = c \cdot \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}
\]

For Planet1:
\[
K_1 = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot \frac{0.03}{6300} \approx 1428.57 \, \text{m/s}
\]

For Planet2:
\[
K_2 = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot \frac{0.04}{6300} \approx 1904.7 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \(a_1 / a_2\)
The masses of the planets are \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\oplus}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\oplus}\). Substituting into the formula for \(a_1 / a_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_{p1} K_2^2}{M_{p2} K_1^2}
\]

First, calculate \(K_1^2\) and \(K_2^2\):
\[
K_1^2 = (1428.57)^2 \approx 2.0408 \times 10^6, \quad K_2^2 = (1904.7)^2 \approx 3.6289 \times 10^6
\]

Now compute:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{7 \cdot 3.6289 \times 10^6}{5 \cdot 2.0408 \times 10^6} \approx \frac{25.402 \times 10^6}{10.204 \times 10^6} \approx 2.49
\]

### Step 3: Compute the temperature ratio
Using the ratio \(a_1 / a_2 = 2.49\), the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2.49}} \approx \sqrt{0.4016} \approx 0.634
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated ratio \(T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.634\) does not match any of the provided options exactly. The closest option is **C) ~0.53**, but this is lower than the computed value. Given the constraints of the problem and the available options, **C) ~0.53** is the most reasonable choice.

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors, mainly the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh, right, the formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, but wait, the albedo is the same for both planets, so that part might cancel out. So I can ignore the albedo for now because it's the same in both cases.

The star's parameters are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff 6300 K. The planets each have their own mass and radius, but for equilibrium temperature, those probably don't matter because T_eq is more about distance and the star's output, not the planet's size or mass. So I can probably focus on the distance each planet is from the star.

The problem mentions that both planets are detected using transit and RV methods. The RV method gives the mass and the distance via the Doppler shift. So the RV shift is related to the planet's mass and its orbital period and distance. The transit method gives the radius, but for this question, it's probably the RV data that's more important because it relates to the Doppler shift.

Wait, the question says that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å in the same line. Oh, right, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But wait, in RV measurements, the shift is often given as the semi-amplitude K. So K is the maximum velocity the star moves due to the planet.

Wait, but in the question, it's given as a wavelength shift. So delta lambda is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The original line is at 6300 Å. So the fractional shift is delta_lambda / lambda. Let's calculate that.

For Planet1: 0.03 / 6300 = 4.76e-6.
For Planet2: 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.35e-6.

Hmm, but wait, the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

But wait, no, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ), but that's probably too complicated. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/ ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps a better approach is to use the Doppler shift to find the velocity of the star. Since the shift is given as delta_lambda, which is related to velocity. So for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star. So, K = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c, but wait, actually, because delta_lambda is the shift, which is the change in wavelength, and the formula is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is delta_lambda = lambda * (v/c), so delta_lambda/lambda = v/c. So v = c * (delta_lambda/lambda).

So for Planet1: v1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) ≈ c * 4.76e-6 ≈ (3e8 m/s) * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1428 m/s. Wait, wait a second, let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.03 Å is 3e-8 meters, and 6300 Å is 6300e-10 meters = 6.3e-7 meters. So delta_lambda is 3e-8 m, lambda is 6.3e-7 m. So delta_lambda / lambda is (3e-8)/(6.3e-7) ≈ 0.0476. So the fractional shift is about 0.0476.

Wait, but wait, in Doppler shift, the formula is (v/c) = delta_lambda/lambda. So v = (delta_lambda/lambda) * c. So for Planet1, v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Let me compute that:

0.03 / 6300 = 0.0000047619 ≈ 4.7619e-6.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s): 4.7619e-6 * 3e8 = 142,857 m/s? Wait, that can’t be right because that’s way too high. Wait, wait, no, 4.76e-6 times 3e8 is (4.76e-6)*(3e8) = 1.428e3 m/s, which is 1428 m/s. That's a reasonable velocity for a star due to a planet.

Similarly, for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04 Å.

So delta_lambda / lambda = 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.349e-6.

v2 = (6.349e-6) * 3e8 ≈ 1.9047e3 m/s, which is approximately 1904.7 m/s.

So both K1 (Planet1's semi-amplitude) is ~1428 m/s and K2 is ~1905 m/s.

Now, the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period and the mass of the star. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (star is 1.5 solar masses, planets are 5 and 7 Earth masses; M_earth is about 3e-6 solar masses, so M_p is negligible compared to M_star). So the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (c * M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ) )^(1/1?), wait maybe I should write the approximate formula.

Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (2 c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But perhaps a better approach is to find the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2, since we have both K1 and K2, and perhaps the periods P1 and P2.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the periods. Hmm, so perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, the star's parameters are given, including Teff. The star's luminosity can be found using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So L = sigma * (4 pi R_star^2) * Teff^4.

Once we have L, the equilibrium temperature of each planet depends on their distance from the star. The formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4).

But wait, another version is T_eq = ( L (1 - albedo) / (16 pi sigma a^2) )^(1/4 ). Since L = sigma T_eff^4 * 4 pi R_star^2, substituting gives T_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 ) / (2^(1/2) )? Wait, maybe I should rederive it.

The incident flux from the star at distance a is L / (4 pi a^2 ). The planet reflects some of it (albedo A) and absorbs the rest. The absorbed power is (1 - A) * (L/(4 pi a^2 )) * pi R_p^2, where R_p is the planet's radius. The planet emits as a blackbody with surface area 4 pi R_p^2, so the power radiated is 4 pi R_p^2 sigma T_eq^4.

Setting them equal: (1 - A) * (L/(4 pi a^2 )) * pi R_p^2 = 4 pi R_p^2 sigma T_eq^4.

Simplify: (1 - A) * L / (4 pi a^2 ) * pi R_p^2 = 4 pi R_p^2 sigma T_eq^4.

Cancel R_p^2 from both sides: (1 - A) L pi / 4 pi a^2 = 4 sigma T_eq^4.

Simplify: (1 - A) L / (4 a^2 ) = 4 sigma T_eq^4.

Multiply both sides by 4 a^2: (1 - A) L = 16 sigma a^2 T_eq^4.

So T_eq^4 = ( (1 - A) L ) / (16 sigma a^2 )

Take the fourth root:

T_eq = [ ( (1 - A) L ) / (16 sigma a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

But L is 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4. So substitute:

T_eq = [ (1 - A) * 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4 / (16 sigma a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(1 - A) * 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4 / (16 sigma a^2 ) = (1 - A) * pi R_star^2 Teff^4 / (4 a^2 )

So T_eq^4 = ( (1 - A) pi R_star^2 Teff^4 ) / (4 a^2 )

Take the fourth root:

T_eq = Teff * [ ( (1 - A) pi R_star^2 ) / (4 a^2 ) ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express T_eq as:

T_eq = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, let me try that.

Starting from the equation:

T_eq^4 = ( (L (1 - A) ) ) / ( 16 pi sigma a^2 )

But L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4.

So substitution gives:

T_eq^4 = [ (4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4 (1 - A) ) ] / (16 pi sigma a^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [4 pi R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A) sigma ] / [16 pi sigma a^2 ]

Cancel pi and sigma:

= [4 R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A) ] / [16 a^2 ]

= [ R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A) ] / [4 a^2 ]

So T_eq^4 = (R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A)) / (4 a^2 )

Take the fourth root:

T_eq = Teff * (R_star) / (2 a ) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Which simplifies to:

T_eq = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is the same, so when taking the ratio T1/T2, that term cancels.

So the ratio T1 / T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1 )) / ( R_star/(2 a2 )) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1 )

Which implies T_ratio = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So the key is to find the ratio of a1 to a2, then take the square root.

But to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets, we need to relate the RV data. Because K is related to the planet's mass and the distance.

So the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which depends on the mass of the planet, the period, and the star's mass. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi / sqrt(1 - e^2) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, and sin i is approximately 1 (assuming i ≈ 90 degrees, which is often the case for transiting planets).

Simplifying, K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ) * (2 pi) / ( sqrt(1 - 0) )) )

Wait, actually, the correct formula is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so denominator becomes M_star^(2/3). Also, sin i ≈1, so:

K ≈ ( (2 pi G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of the orbital distance a.

Another approach: for circular orbits, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P via Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 pi^2 / G (M_star + M_p)) ) a^3

But since M_p << M_star, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 / (G M_star)) a^3

So, a^3 = G M_star P^2 / (4 pi^2 )

Wait, no, more accurately,

a^3 = (G (M_star + M_p) P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

But since M_p is negligible, a^3 ≈ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

So, a ≈ [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

But I don't have P for each planet, only the K (semi-amplitude). Hmm.

Alternatively, since K is known for both planets, and the masses are known, perhaps we can relate the velocities to the semi-major axes.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But this seems complicated without knowing P.

Wait, but from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star )

So P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )

So substituting P into the K equation.

Let me denote M_star as M, M_p as m, and P as period.

So substituting P from Kepler's law into K's formula:

K = [ (2 pi G ) / c^3 ]^(1/3) * ( m ) / [ (M + m )^(2/3) * ( (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M )) )^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of another way.

Alternatively, can I express K in terms of a?

Yes, because from the relation between K and a.

We can write:

K = (v) = (2 pi a )/(P) * ( (G (M + m) )/(4 pi^2 ) )^(1/3 ) * (something?), but perhaps another approach.

Wait, from the formula of K:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (m sin i) / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) * (1/P )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) )

So P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) ) )

Substituting P into K's expression:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (m) / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) * (1/( sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) ) ) ) )^(1/3 )

That's a bit messy, but let's compute it step by step.

Let me write it as:

K = [ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * m / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) ] * [ (G (M + m )) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Wait, because 1/P^(1/3) is [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) ) ) ]^(-1/6 )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of a.

We have:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (m ) / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3 )

And from Kepler's law,

P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M + m) )

So 1/P = [ ( G (M + m) )/(4 pi^2 a^3 ) ]^(1/2 )

Thus,

1/P^(1/3 ) = [ ( G (M + m) )/(4 pi^2 a^3 ) ]^(1/6 )

Substituting back into K:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * m / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) * [ ( G (M + m) )/(4 pi^2 a^3 ) ]^(1/6 )

Now, let's combine the exponents.

Let me compute each part:

(2 pi G )^(1/3 ) = (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 )

m is just m.

Denominator: (M + m )^(2/3 )

The other term: [ G (M + m) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ]^(1/6 ) = G^(1/6) (M + m )^(1/6) (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6) a^(-3/6 )

Simplify exponents:

G^(1/3) * G^(1/6) = G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) = G^(1/2 )

(M + m )^(2/3 ) * (M + m )^(1/6 ) = (M + m )^(5/6 )

Wait, no: denominator has (M + m )^(2/3 ), and the other term has (M + m )^(1/6 ), but in the numerator because it's in the exponent.

Wait, no, the term is [G (M + m) ] in numerator, so when raised to 1/6, it's G^(1/6) (M + m )^(1/6 ).

So putting it all together:

K = (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 ) * m * [ G^(1/6 ) (M + m )^(1/6 ) ) ] / [ (M + m )^(2/3 ) * (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) * a^(1/2 ) ) ]

Wait, let me compute each factor.

First, the G terms: G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) = G^(1/2 )

The (M + m ) terms: (M + m )^(1/6 ) / (M + m )^(2/3 ) ) = (M + m )^(1/6 - 4/6 ) = (M + m )^(-3/6 ) = (M + m )^(-1/2 )

The constants: (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6 )

Wait, 4 pi^2 is (2^2 pi^2 ), so (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6 ) = (2^2 )^(-1/6 ) * (pi^2 )^(-1/6 ) = 2^(-1/3 ) pi^(-1/3 )

So putting it all together:

K = [ (2 pi )^(1/3 ) ] * [ (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6 ) ] * [ G^(1/2 ) ] * m * (M + m )^(-1/2 ) ) / ( a^(1/2 ) )

Let me compute the constants:

(2 pi )^(1/3 ) * (4 pi^2 )^(-1/6 )

= (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )) ) * (4^(-1/6) pi^(-2/6) )

4 is 2^2, so 4^(-1/6 ) = (2^2 )^(-1/6 ) = 2^(-1/3 )

Similarly, pi^(-2/6 ) = pi^(-1/3 )

So the constants become:

2^(1/3 ) * 2^(-1/3 ) * pi^(1/3 ) * pi^(-1/3 ) = 1.

So the constants multiply to 1.

So K simplifies to:

K = [ G^(1/2 ) * m ] / [ (M + m )^(1/2 ) * a^(1/2 ) ) ]

Which can be written as:

K = [ G m / ( (M + m ) a ) ]^(1/2 )

Hmm, that's a more manageable form.

So K = sqrt( G m / ( (M + m ) a ) )

But since m << M, M + m ≈ M, so:

K ≈ sqrt( G m / ( M a ) )

Which can be rearranged to:

K^2 = G m / ( M a )

So a = G m / ( M K^2 )

Wait, let's see:

From K^2 = G m / (M a )

=> a = G m / ( M K^2 )

So a is proportional to (m) / (K^2 )

So for two planets, a1 and a2:

a1 = G M_p1 / ( M_star * K1^2 )

a2 = G M_p2 / ( M_star * K2^2 )

So the ratio a1 / a2 = ( M_p1 / K1^2 ) / ( M_p2 / K2^2 )

= ( M_p1 K2^2 ) / ( M_p2 K1^2 )

Because G and M_star cancel out.

So a1/a2 = ( M_p1 * K2^2 ) / ( M_p2 * K1^2 )

Wait, because a1 is proportional to (m_p / K^2 ), so a1/a2 = (m1 / K1^2 ) / (m2 / K2^2 ) ) = ( m1 * K2^2 ) / ( m2 * K1^2 )

So, then the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( ( a2 ) / ( a1 ) )

But a1/a2 = ( m1 K2^2 ) / ( m2 K1^2 )

So a2/a1 = ( m2 K1^2 ) / ( m1 K2^2 )

Therefore,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( ( m2 K1^2 ) / ( m1 K2^2 ) )

= ( K1 / K2 ) * sqrt( m2 / m1 )

So T1 / T2 = ( K1 / K2 ) * sqrt( m2 / m1 )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

We have:

K1 = 1428 m/s (from Planet1)
K2 = 1905 m/s (from Planet2)
m1 = 7 Earth masses
m2 = 5 Earth masses

So,

K1/K2 = 1428 / 1905 ≈ 0.75.

sqrt(m2/m1) = sqrt(5/7) ≈ sqrt(0.7143) ≈ 0.845.

So T1/T2 = 0.75 * 0.845 ≈ 0.634.

Wait, but wait, that's the ratio T1/T2. But the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So is it T1/T2 or T2/T1?

Wait, in the formula, T1 is for Planet1, T2 for Planet2. So if T1/T2 is 0.634, that would mean Planet1 is cooler than Planet2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck.

The formula was T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But a2 is the distance of Planet2, a1 for Planet1.

If a2 > a1, then T1 would be less than T2 because T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

So if a2 > a1, T1 < T2.

So if the ratio a2/a1 is greater than 1, T1/T2 is less than 1.

In any case, from the earlier steps, T1/T2 = ( K1/K2 ) * sqrt( m2/m1 )

Which is (1428/1905) * sqrt(5/7) ≈ 0.75 * 0.845 ≈ 0.634.

So T1 is about 0.634 times T2, so the ratio is approximately 0.63.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

Hmm, 0.63 isn't exactly any of the options. The closest options are C (0.53) and A (0.98).

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate the numbers.

Compute K1 and K2 correctly.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating K1 and K2.

So delta_lambda is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

The line is at 6300 Å.

So delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6300 = 0.0000047619 ≈ 4.7619e-6.

Similarly, for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.349e-6.

So then, v1 = c * (delta_lambda/lambda) = (3e8 m/s) * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

v2 = 3e8 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1904.7 m/s.

So K1 is 1428.57 m/s, K2 is 1904.7 m/s.

Now, compute K1/K2 = 1428.57 / 1904.7 ≈ 0.75.

m1 is 7 Earth masses, m2 is 5 Earth masses.

Compute sqrt(m2/m1) = sqrt(5/7) ≈ 0.845.

So T1/T2 ≈ 0.75 * 0.845 ≈ 0.634.

Hmm, but the options don't have 0.63. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that a is proportional to (m_p) / (K^2 ), but maybe I should have used the ratio correctly.

Wait, let me rederive the a1 and a2.

We have a = G m_p / ( M K^2 )

So a1 = (G m1 )/( M K1^2 )

a2 = (G m2 )/( M K2^2 )

The ratio a1/a2 = ( m1 K2^2 ) / ( m2 K1^2 )

So a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 )

Compute the squares:

1904.7^2 ≈ (approx 1900)^2 = 3,610,000. Let me compute more accurately:

1904.7 * 1904.7: 1900^2 = 3,610,000, 2 * 1900 *4.7 = 2*1900*4.7= 1900*9.4= 17,860, and 4.7^2≈22.09. So total ≈ 3,610,000 +17,860 +22.09 ≈ 3,627,882.09.

Similarly, 1428.57^2: 1428.57 is approximately 1000 + 428.57. Alternatively, 1428.57^2 = (1400 +28.57)^2 = 1400^2 + 2*1400*28.57 + 28.57^2.

1400^2 = 1,960,000.

2*1400*28.57 ≈ 2800 *28.57 ≈ 80,000 (since 28.57 * 2800 = 28.57 * 28 * 100 ≈ (28*28.57 is 800) 800 *100=80,000 )

28.57^2 ≈ 816.3.

So total ≈1,960,000 +80,000 +816.3 ≈2,040,816.3.

So,

a1/a2 = (7 * 3,627,882 ) / (5 * 2,040,816 )

Compute numerator: 7 * 3,627,882 ≈ 25,395,174

Denominator:5 * 2,040,816 ≈10,204,080

So ratio a1/a2 ≈ 25,395,174 / 10,204,080 ≈ 2.488.

So a1 is about 2.488 times a2.

Wait, but wait, no: a1 = (G m1 )/( M K1^2 ), a2 = (G m2 )/( M K2^2 )

So a1 / a2 = (m1 K2² )/( m2 K1² )

Which is (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 )

So yes, as calculated above, a1/a2 ≈ 2.488.

So a1 is about 2.488 times a2.

So a1 = 2.488 * a2.

Now, going back to T_eq ratio.

T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1/2.488 ) ≈ sqrt(0.402) ≈ 0.634.

So same as before.

So the ratio is approximately 0.634.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C, 0.53, but that's lower than 0.63.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for T_eq.

Let me double-check the formula derivation.

Alternative approach:

T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, all else being equal.

So, T_eq ∝ 1/ sqrt(a )

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So if a1 is larger than a2, then T1 would be smaller than T2.

In our case, a1 is larger than a2 (since a1/a2 ≈2.488), so T1 = T2 * sqrt( a2/a1 ) = T2 * sqrt( 1/2.488 ) ≈ T2 * 0.634.

So Planet1's equilibrium temperature is about 63% of Planet2's.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's about 0.53, which is a bit lower than 0.634.

Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the K1 and K2.

Wait, let me recompute K1 and K2.

K1 is calculated from delta_lambda = 0.03 Å, lambda = 6300 Å.

So delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = 0.0000047619.

v1 = c * delta_lambda/lambda = 3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly, K2 is 0.04 / 6300 = 0.0000063492. So v2 = 3e8 * 0.0000063492 ≈ 1904.7 m/s.

So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I used the wrong formula for K.

Wait, perhaps the formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i)/( (M_star) * a ) )^(1/2 )

Wait, earlier I had K = sqrt( G m_p / ( M a ) )

Which is same as sqrt( G m_p / ( M a ) )

So, a = G m_p / ( M K^2 )

So that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps I should consider the masses in solar masses.

Because m_p is in Earth masses, and M is in solar masses.

Wait, the star's mass is 1.5 solar masses.

Wait, let me compute m1 and m2 in solar masses.

Each Earth mass is about 3.003e-6 solar masses.

So m1 =7 *3e-6 =2.1e-5 solar masses.

m2=5 *3e-6=1.5e-5 solar masses.

But in the calculation for a1/a2, the M (star's mass) is in the denominator, but since it's same for both, M cancels.

So perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but in the expression a = G m_p / (M K^2 ), so G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, M in kg, K in m/s.

But since we're taking the ratio a1/a2, the G and M terms cancel, so the ratio is (m1 * K2^2 )/( m2 * K1^2 )

So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let's think differently.

Since the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which is K.

Assuming that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (m_p / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation that K is proportional to (m_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )

Hmm, perhaps another approach.

The RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, considering that the ratio K1/K2 = (m1 a2^(1/3) ) / (m2 a1^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps K is proportional to (m_p) / ( a^(1/3) ) )

So K1 / K2 = ( m1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( m2 / a2^(1/3) )

=> K1/K2 = ( m1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( m2 a1^(1/3) )

So, let me solve for a1/a2.

(K1/K2) = ( m1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( m2 a1^(1/3) )

=> (K1/K2) = ( m1 / m2 ) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

=> (a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (K1 K2)/( m1 m2 )

Wait, perhaps rearranging:

=> (a2/a1 ) = [ (K1/K2) * (m2/m1) ]^3

Wait, let me re-arrange.

From K1/K2 = (m1 a2^(1/3) ) / (m2 a1^(1/3) )

Multiply both sides by (m2 a1^(1/3) ) / m1 a2^(1/3) ):

(K1/K2) * (m2 a1^(1/3) )/(m1 a2^(1/3) ) ) =1.

So,

( ( K1 m2 ) / ( K2 m1 ) ) * ( a1 / a2 )^(1/3 ) ) = 1.

Thus,

( a1 / a2 )^(1/3 ) = ( K2 m1 ) / ( K1 m2 )

=> a1/a2 = [ ( K2 m1 )/( K1 m2 ) ]^3

So,

a1/a2 = ( (1905 *7 ) / (1428.57 *5 ) )^3

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1905 *7 ≈ 13,335.

Denominator: 1428.57 *5 ≈7,142.85.

So,

(13335 / 7142.85 ) ≈ 1.866.

Cube of 1.866 ≈ (1.866)^3 ≈ approximately 6.48.

Wait, let's compute 1.866^3:

1.866 * 1.866 = approx 3.48 (since 1.8^2=3.24, 1.86^2=3.46, 1.866^2≈3.48 ).

Then, 3.48 *1.866 ≈ approx 3.48 *1.8 = 6.264, 3.48*0.066≈0.229 → total ≈6.49.

So a1/a2 ≈6.49.

Then, T_ratio = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/6.49) ≈ sqrt(0.154) ≈ 0.392.

So T1 is about 0.39 times T2.

Wait, that's about 0.39, which is lower than 0.53. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest would be option C) ~0.53, but that's higher than 0.39.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. This alternative method gives a different result. So I'm getting conflicting results. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Because I'm getting two different results, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Alternative approach:

Using the formula K = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But I can express this as K ∝ (M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (m1 a2^(-1/3) ) / ( m2 a1^(-1/3) ) )

Which is K1/K2 = (m1 / m2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

Rearranging,

( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 ) = ( K1 K2 ) / ( m1 m2 )

Wait, let me re-express:

( a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (K1 m2 ) / ( K2 m1 )

So,

a2/a1 = [ (K1 m2 )/( K2 m1 ) ]^3

So, a2/a1 = ( (1428.57 * 5 ) / (1904.7 * 7 ) )^3

Compute numerator: 1428.57 *5 = 7142.85

Denominator: 1904.7 *7 = 13332.9

So,

(7142.85 / 13332.9 ) ≈0.536.

So,

a2/a1 ≈ (0.536 )^3 ≈0.154.

So a2/a1 ≈0.154 → a1/a2≈6.49.

Which brings us back to the earlier result.

So T_ratio = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.154) ≈0.392.

So Planet1's T_eq is 0.39 times Planet2's.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the RV semi-amplitude but about the Doppler shift in the forbidden line. Forbidden lines are usually in emission, but in this case, since the star's line is observed, the shift would relate to the star's velocity.

So, the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å is being used to detect the Doppler shift.

So, the shift is due to the star moving towards or away from us because of the planet's gravitational pull.

So, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity shift observed, which is the same as the RV semi-amplitude.

Thus, the calculation should be as before.

But perhaps another factor is involved. Let's think about the star's velocity due to the planet. The formula for K is given by:

K = [ (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/1) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 )

But perhaps the correct formula is:

K = ( ( 2 pi G ) / ( c^3 ) )^(1/3 ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But without knowing the period, it's hard to proceed. Wait, but maybe we can relate the periods using Kepler's law.

Wait, from Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_star + M_p ) )

But since M_p is negligible, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star )

So,

P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )

Thus,

P^(1/3 ) = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/6 )

= (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) a^(1/2 ) G^(-1/6 ) M_star^(-1/6 )

Substituting back into K's formula:

K = ( (2 pi G ) / c^3 )^(1/3 ) * ( M_p sin i ) / [ ( M_star )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Substituting P^(1/3 ) from above:

K = [ (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) / c ] * ( M_p ) / [ M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ] * [ ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) a^(-1/2 ) ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (2 pi )^(1/3 ) G^(1/3 ) / c ] * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * [ G^(1/6 ) M_star^(1/6 ) a^(-1/2 ) ] / [ (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ]

Combine like terms:

G exponents: 1/3 +1/6= 1/2.

M_star exponents: -2/3 +1/6 = -1/2.

M_p is M_p.

Denominator terms: (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = (2^2 pi^2 )^(1/6 )=2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 )

So,

K = [ (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/2 ) M_p ] / [ c * 2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 ) M_star^(1/2 ) a^(1/2 ) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify:

(2 pi )^(1/3 ) / 2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 ) )= [ (2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 )) ) ] / [ 2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 ) ) ] =1.

So,

K = G^(1/2 ) M_p / ( c M_star^(1/2 ) a^(1/2 ) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) )

Since M_p is much smaller, (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3 )≈1.

Thus,

K ≈ sqrt( G M_p ) / ( c sqrt( M_star a ) )

Rearranging,

K^2 = G M_p / ( c² M_star a )

=> a = G M_p / ( c² M_star K² )

So a is proportional to M_p / K².

Thus,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1 K2² ) / ( M_p2 K1² )

Which is the same as earlier.

So back to the same result as before: a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 ) ≈2.488.

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/2.488 ) ≈0.634.

But the options don't have this. So I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's luminosity affects the equilibrium temperature, but I think I considered that already.

Wait, Teff is given as 6300 K, so L is proportional to R_star^2 Teff^4.

Wait, the star's radius is 1.2 solar radii, Teff 6300 K.

So L = sigma * 4 pi R_star^2 Teff^4.

But when calculating T_eq, it's based on the star's Teff and radius.

Wait, but in the T_eq formula, the star's parameters are already accounted for, so when taking the ratio, those terms cancel.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the RV shift to find the ratio of the velocities, and then from that, the ratio of the masses times the cube of the periods, but without knowing the periods, perhaps I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the shift in the line can be used to find the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, for [OI] line at 6300 Å, shift is 0.03 Å for planet1.

So, delta_lambda = 0.03, lambda =6300.

So v1 = c * (delta_lambda/lambda ) = c * (0.03/6300) = c * 4.76e-6.

v1 ≈3e8 m/s *4.76e-6 ≈1428 m/s.

Similarly, v2=0.04/6300 *3e8 ≈1905 m/s.

So, v1=1428 m/s, v2=1905 m/s.

The RV semi-amplitude K is equal to v.

In the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 pi G )/(2 c^3) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But without knowing P, perhaps it's impossible to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 can be used along with the ratio of the masses to find the ratio of the distances a1 and a2.

Wait, from the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of a.

Wait, from the previous derivation, K = sqrt( G M_p / ( M a ) )

So, K^2 = G M_p / ( M a )

So,

a = G M_p / ( M K^2 )

Thus, the ratio a1/a2 = ( M_p1 K2^2 ) / ( M_p2 K1^2 )

Which is exactly what I did earlier.

So, with M_p1=7, K1=1428.57, M_p2=5, K2=1904.7.

Thus,

a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 ) ≈ (7 * 3.6e6 ) / (5 * 2.04e6 )

Wait, 1904.7^2 ≈3.6e6, 1428.57^2≈2.04e6.

So,

a1/a2 ≈ (7 *3.6e6 ) / (5 *2.04e6 ) → (25.2e6) / (10.2e6 ) ≈2.47.

Thus, a1≈2.47 a2.

Thus, T1 = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) * (1 - A )^0.25.

Similarly, T2 = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) * (1 - A )^0.25.

Taking the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/(2 a1) * 2 a2/( R_star ) ) ?? Wait, no, because R_star is same.

Wait, more accurately, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So again, T1/T2= sqrt( a2 / a1 )= sqrt(1 / 2.47 )≈0.63.

But the given options don't include this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact numbers more precisely.

Compute a1/a2:

m1=7, m2=5.

K1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.7 m/s.

So,

a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 )

Compute (1904.7)^2: 1904.7 *1904.7.

Let me compute it accurately.

1904.7^2 = (2000 - 95.3)^2 = 2000^2 - 2*2000*95.3 + 95.3^2.

=4,000,000 - 381,200 + 9,082.09 ≈3,628, 882.09.

Similarly, (1428.57)^2 = (1428.57)^2.

1428.57 is approximately 1400 + 28.57.

(1400 +28.57)^2 =1400^2 + 2*1400*28.57 +28.57^2.

1400^2 =1,960,000.

2*1400*28.57=2800 *28.57≈2800 *28=78,400; 2800*0.57=1,600 → total≈78,400 +1,600=80,000.

28.57^2≈816.3.

So, (1428.57)^2≈1,960,000 +80,000 +816.3=2,040,816.3.

Now,

a1/a2 = (7 * 3,628,882.09 ) / (5 * 2,040,816.3 )

Compute numerator:7 *3,628,882.09 =25,402,174.63.

Denominator:5 * 2,040,816.3=10,204,081.5.

So,

a1/a2=25,402,174.63 /10,204,081.5 ≈2.49.

Now, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/2.49 )=sqrt(0.4016 )=0.634.

Hmm, so about 0.634.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's luminosity is not the same as the Sun's, so when computing the equilibrium temperature, I must factor in the star's luminosity compared to the Sun.

The star's luminosity is L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4.

But for the purpose of T_eq, the formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but I thought that was correct.

Wait, let me compute with numbers.

Compute T_eq for each planet:

T_eq = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But since albedo is same for both, (1 - A) cancels when taking the ratio.

So,

T_eq ratio = sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

As before.

Hmm, so that can't be the problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the K velocities.

Wait, when using the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, which has a wavelength of 6300 Å.

The shift is given as a shift of 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

But the formula for Doppler shift is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c.

So, for Planet1:

v1 = c * (0.03 /6300 )=3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 ≈1428.57 m/s.

For Planet2:

v2=3e8 * (0.04/6300 )=3e8 * 6.3492e-6 ≈1904.7 m/s.

So, yes, that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the RV method gives the mass function, which depends on the inclination angle. Since we don't know the inclination, but for transiting planets, we can assume i≈90 degrees, so sin i=1.

So, it's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the shift to be in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the shift is the total shift, including both the star's reflex motion and the planet's orbital speed, but that doesn't make sense because the planet's speed is negligible compared to the star's.

Alternatively, perhaps the shift is for the entire orbit, so the semi-amplitude is half of that. But no, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum shift, so that's correct.

So, I think the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio using the square of the velocities.

Wait, from K1=1428.57, K2=1904.7.

So, K1/K2= 1428.57/1904.7≈0.75.

Masses are m1=7, m2=5.

So, (m2/m1)=5/7≈0.714.

So, T_ratio= (K1/K2) * sqrt(m2/m1 )=0.75 * sqrt(0.714 )=0.75 *0.845≈0.634.

So, again, same result.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the equilibrium temperature formula should include the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.

The correct formula is:

T_eq = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a^2) ]^(1/4 )

Since L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4,

T_eq = [ (4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify:

= [ ( R_star^2 Teff^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

= Teff * [ R_star^2 / (4 a^2 ) ]^(1/4 ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )

= Teff * ( R_star / (2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )

Which is the same as before. So that's correct.

Thus, the ratio remains T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )=0.634.

But options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, the closest would be option C) 0.53, but that's significantly lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a1/a2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem states that the shift is up to 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. So that's the maximum shift, which is the semi-amplitude K. So my calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the inverse ratio. Because if a1 is larger than a2, then T1 would be smaller. So the ratio T1/T2 is less than 1. So in the options, the only one less than 1 is A) ~0.98 and C) ~0.53.

But 0.63 is between 0.53 and 0.98, closer to 0.53. But 0.63 is still higher than 0.53.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for T2/T1, which would be 1/0.634≈1.578.

Looking at the options, B) is ~1.30, which is lower than 1.58.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the formula for the RV semi-amplitude.

Wait, another formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3 ) )^(1/3 ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) )

But without knowing periods, it's hard to proceed.

Alternative approach: since we can't find a1 and a2, perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer based on the given options.

But I'm not seeing any mistake in the calculation. Perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.53, but my calculation doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the a1/a2 ratio.

Wait, a1/a2 = (7 * (1904.7)^2 ) / (5 * (1428.57)^2 )

Compute 1904.7^2 =3,628, 882.09.

1428.57^2=2,040,816.3.

So,

(7 *3,628,882.09 )=25,402,174.63.

(5 *2,040,816.3)=10,204,081.5.

So,

a1/a2=25,402,174.63 /10,204,081.5 ≈2.49.

T_ratio= sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/2.49 )≈0.634.

Hmm, same result.

Another thought: perhaps I should compute the inverse ratio.

If a1 is larger than a2, T_eq is lower. So T1 is lower, so T1/T2 is 0.634, so the ratio is about 0.63. The options don't have that, but perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K.

Wait, perhaps I should compute K in terms of the shift in wavelength.

Wait, the line is at 6300 Å, so the shift is 0.03 Å, which is a delta_lambda of 0.03.

So the velocity is v = (delta_lambda/lambda) * c.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance a.

So, T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a )

So, if I find a1 and a2, I can find T_eq.

But without knowing the periods, perhaps I can relate a1 and a2 via the RV method.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star )

So,

P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )

Thus,

(2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) = ( 2 pi )/ [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ) ]^(1/6 )

= (2 pi )^(1) )^(1/6 ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) a^(-3/6 )

= (2^(1) pi^1 )^(1/6 ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) a^(-0.5 )

Hmm, perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio K1/K2 in terms of a1 and a2.

From the formula K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But since P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ), substituting P:

K = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( 2 pi / [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ) ]^(1/2 ) )^(1/3 )

Simplify the P term:

= (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * [ ( G M_star ) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Thus,

K = ( G M_p )^(1) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) a^(-3/6 )

= G^(1) M_p^(1) M_star^(-2/3 ) a^(-1/3 ) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 ) G^(1/6 ) M_star^(1/6 ) a^(-1/2 )

Combine exponents:

G: 1 + 1/6 =7/6.

M_p:1.

M_star: (-2/3 ) +1/6 = (-4/6 +1/6 )= -3/6= -0.5.

a: (-1/3 ) + (-1/2 )= (-2/6 -3/6 )= -5/6.

So,

K = (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(7/6 ) M_p M_star^(-0.5 ) a^(-5/6 )

But this seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio K1/K2 can be expressed as:

(K1/K2 ) = [ ( M_p1 a2^(-5/6 ) ) / ( M_p2 a1^(-5/6 ) ) ) ] * [ ( M_star2^(0.5 ) ) / ( M_star1^(0.5 ) ) ) ] * [ ( G etc ) terms cancel ]

Wait, but I'm not making progress.

Perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the star's parameters and focus on the planet's mass and the RV shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to (M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) ), leading to a different ratio.

But I think I've exhausted all options, and the answer is approximately 0.63, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, looking back at the question, the equilibrium temperatures are being asked. Do I need to account for the star's luminosity?

Yes, but I think I did. Because T_eq depends on the star's Teff and radius, which are given.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's luminosity is different from the Sun’s, so when computing T_eq, I should scale accordingly.

Wait, the star's luminosity is L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4.

So, for the Sun, L_sun =4 pi R_sun^2 sigma T_sun^4.

Thus, L = (R_star / R_sun )^2 (Teff / T_sun )^4 * L_sun.

So, the ratio of L to L_sun is (1.2)^2 * (6300/5778 )^4 ≈ (1.44 ) * (0.7 )^4 ≈1.44 * 0.2401 ≈0.346.

So, L=0.346 L_sun.

But in the T_eq formula, it's already incorporated because T_eq is based on the star's Teff and radius, which are used in the calculation.

So, when comparing T_eq for both planets, the ratio is only dependent on their distances.

Hmm, perhaps the options are expecting the ratio of (R_star/(2 a ))^0.5, which is the same as sqrt(R_star/(2 a )).

But that's what I've been using.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the inverse of the square root of the distance, but I'm not finding any mistake.

Given the time I've spent and not finding an error in the approach, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.63, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the ratio of the velocities and use that to find the ratio of the distances, thus the temperature ratio.

Wait, another approach:

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's law, a^3 = (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

So, a^(1/3 )= [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/9 )

Thus,

K = ( G M_p )^(1) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * [ (G M_star )^(-1/9 ) P^(-2/9 ) ) ]

Simplify exponents:

G: 1 -1/9 = 8/9.

M_p:1.

M_star: -2/3 -1/9 = -7/9.

P: -2/9.

Thus,

K = (2 pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(8/9 ) M_p M_star^(-7/9 ) P^(-2/9 )

But without knowing P, this is not helpful.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 0.63, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the ratio using more precise numbers.

Compute a1/a2:

7 * (1904.7)^2 =7 *3,628,882 =25,402,174.

5 * (1428.57)^2 =5 *2,040,816 =10,204,080.

So,

a1/a2=25,402,174 /10,204,080 =2.49.

Thus, T1/T2= sqrt(1/2.49 )=sqrt(0.4016 )=0.634.

The options don't include this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53, but I can't reconcile it with the calculations.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) can be related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) using the formula:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p}{K^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_{p1} K_2^2}{M_{p2} K_1^2}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(K_1\) and \(K_2\)
The RV semi-amplitude is derived from the Doppler shift formula:

\[
K = c \cdot \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}
\]

For Planet1:
\[
K_1 = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot \frac{0.03}{6300} \approx 1428.57 \, \text{m/s}
\]

For Planet2:
\[
K_2 = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot \frac{0.04}{6300} \approx 1904.7 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \(a_1 / a_2\)
The masses of the planets are \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\oplus}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\oplus}\). Substituting into the formula for \(a_1 / a_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_{p1} K_2^2}{M_{p2} K_1^2}
\]

First, calculate \(K_1^2\) and \(K_2^2\):
\[
K_1^2 = (1428.57)^2 \approx 2.0408 \times 10^6, \quad K_2^2 = (1904.7)^2 \approx 3.6289 \times 10^6
\]

Now compute:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{7 \cdot 3.6289 \times 10^6}{5 \cdot 2.0408 \times 10^6} \approx \frac{25.402 \times 10^6}{10.204 \times 10^6} \approx 2.49
\]

### Step 3: Compute the temperature ratio
Using the ratio \(a_1 / a_2 = 2.49\), the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2.49}} \approx \sqrt{0.4016} \approx 0.634
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated ratio \(T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.634\) does not match any of the provided options exactly. The closest option is **C) ~0.53**, but this is lower than the computed value. Given the constraints of the problem and the available options, **C) ~0.53** is the most reasonable choice.

ANSWER: C
