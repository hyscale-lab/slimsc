Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my RV details, but let me think this through.

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Around each, they found a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of these two planets, based on the shifts in their spectral lines observed via the RV method.

So, the data given is the periodic wavelength shifts. For planet #1, it's 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the planets' orbital periods?

I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The shift in wavelength is related to the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta lambda over lambda equals the velocity over c, where c is the speed of light. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Wait, I think the formula goes like delta lambda / lambda = v / c. So the velocity of the star (v) is proportional to the wavelength shift. So if planet #1 causes a 5 mA shift and planet #2 a 7 mA shift, does that mean the velocity amplitude (v) is in the same ratio? Because the same spectral line would have the same lambda, so if delta lambda is 5 and 7 respectively, then the velocities would be in a 5:7 ratio.

But wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right! The semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds))) )^(1/3)

Wait, that's probably getting too complicated. Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The equation is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is way less than the Sun's), the term (1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1, so it can be ignored. So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) divided by (M_star)^(1/3) multiplied by 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me rephrase. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (8 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

But again, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And for circular orbits, e is 0, so that term is 1. Also, the inclination i is 90 degrees for transiting planets, but in this case, since they're using RV, they don't necessarily know i, but in the question, both planets have similar masses, so perhaps the sin i is the same for both? Wait, no, because they're different stars, but the RV method would give K as (M_p sin i) / ... So if the sin i is the same for both, then the K ratio would relate to (M_p)/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, but in the problem, both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So the K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). Because K = (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3))) ) * some constants.

Wait, let me get the formula straight. The RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (v) ) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P)) )^something.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I think I can derive it. The RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is:

K = ( (2 π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) )

But since both planets have similar masses to Neptune, much less than the Sun, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And e=0, so denominator is 1. So,

K ≈ ( (2 π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But since M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same (both stars are like the Sun), then K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Wait, so if K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1 / K^(3)

So, if planet #2 has a larger K (since 7 mA is larger than 5 mA, meaning a larger velocity shift), then K2 = 7/5 K1.

Wait, wait. The RV shift is directly proportional to the velocity. So if planet #1 causes a 5 mA shift and planet #2 a 7 mA shift, their velocities (K) are in the ratio 5:7. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But from the formula, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher K means shorter period. So P ∝ 1/K.

Wait, no: because if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P^(1/3) is proportional to 1/K, so P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So, P1 = (some constant) * (1/K1^3 )

Similarly, P2 = (some constant) * (1/K2^3 )

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (1/K2^3 ) / (1/K1^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Since K2 = (7/5) K1, then K1/K2 = 5/7.

So, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, that's approximately 0.36.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So, P2 = 0.36 * P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the answer would be about 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait a minute, let me check the logic. The larger the K, the shorter the period. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K means shorter P. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter, not longer. So the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1? So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are: option A is ~0.36, which is P2/P1. So the answer would be A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit and is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_\text{star} + M_p)^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]

For this problem, both stars have the same mass (\( M_\text{star} \)), and both planets have similar masses (\( M_p \)), so the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes (\( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \)) depends only on their orbital periods (\( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \)):

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

From the problem, the RV shifts are in the ratio \( K_2 : K_1 = 7 : 5 \). Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), the orbital periods are inversely proportional to the cube of the RV semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.36
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

So if planet #1 causes a 5 mA shift and planet #2 a 7 mA shift, does that mean the velocity amplitude (v) is in the same ratio? Because the same spectral line would have the same lambda, so if delta lambda is 5 and 7 respectively, then the velocities would be in a 5:7 ratio.

Wait, that's probably getting too complicated. Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The equation is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

K ≈ ( (2 π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But since M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same (both stars are like the Sun), then K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Wait, so if K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1 / K^(3)

So, if planet #2 has a larger K (since 7 mA is larger than 5 mA, meaning a larger velocity shift), then K2 = 7/5 K1.

Wait, wait. The RV shift is directly proportional to the velocity. So if planet #1 causes a 5 mA shift and planet #2 a 7 mA shift, their velocities (K) are in the ratio 5:7. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But from the formula, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher K means shorter period. So P ∝ 1/K.

Wait, no: because if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P^(1/3) is proportional to 1/K, so P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So, P1 = (some constant) * (1/K1^3 )

Similarly, P2 = (some constant) * (1/K2^3 )

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (1/K2^3 ) / (1/K1^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Since K2 = (7/5) K1, then K1/K2 = 5/7.

So, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, that's approximately 0.36.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So, P2 = 0.36 * P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the answer would be about 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait a minute, let me check the logic. The larger the K, the shorter the period. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K means shorter P. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter, not longer. So the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1? So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are: option A is ~0.36, which is P2/P1. So the answer would be A.

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

From the problem, the RV shifts are in the ratio \( K_2 : K_1 = 7 : 5 \). Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), the orbital periods are inversely proportional to the cube of the RV semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.36
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
