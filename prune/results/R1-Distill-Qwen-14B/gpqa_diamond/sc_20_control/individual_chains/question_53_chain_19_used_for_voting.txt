Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, which means there's an OCO group somewhere in the molecule. The 1H NMR has six signals, which break down into two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals for –CH3 groups. No signals for –CH2 groups.

First, I need to figure out the structure based on the spectral data. Let's start by thinking about what an ester looks like. An ester has the structure R-O-CO-R', so in the aromatic ring, maybe one substituent is an ester group. Since it's a di-substituted ring, there's another group attached.

The aromatic ring is 6-membered, so probably benzene, but it's substituted. The substituents are likely in positions that make the molecule either para, meta, or ortho. But since it's di-substituted, the positions will affect the NMR signals. The aromatic region has two signals, which suggests that the two substituents are either in para positions (which would result in two sets of equivalent protons) or some other arrangement that leads to two distinct aromatic proton environments.

Wait, if it's para, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a pair. But the NMR shows two signals, each for two aromatic protons. So maybe the substituents are such that each has their own set of equivalent protons. But wait, two substituents—so perhaps each substituent is in such a position that the ring protons are split into two different environments. For example, if substituents are in the para position, but maybe one is an ester and the other is something else.

Wait, but the molecule is di-substituted, so let's think about the substituents. One substituent is an ester group. What's the other substituent? The NMR shows vinyl protons, so maybe a vinyl group is present, like a substituent that has a double bond, such as a substituent like CH2CH2, but that's not right. Wait, vinyl protons are from a CH2=CH group, so perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. Alternatively, maybe an ester group with a vinyl substituent.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests that these protons are split by neighboring groups. A vinyl proton can split into a doublet if it's adjacent to another proton in a trans configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached.

Wait, let me think. The NMR has two types of vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, which might imply coupling with one neighboring proton. The other is a doublet of quartets, which suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents include an ester and a vinyl group. Let's consider the structure. So, for example, an ester group attached to the ring, and another group which is a vinyl group (like CH2CH2O something, but maybe not). Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH3, but that would give more complex splitting.

Wait, no, the substituent could be an ester and another group. Let me think about the substituents. The ester group is one substituent, and the other substituent could be a vinyl group attached to the ring, perhaps as an ethyl group or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that has a vinyl group. For example, the ester is attached to a vinyl group. Let's say the structure is something like benzene with an ester group and a vinyl group attached as substituents.

Wait, but the substituents are on the aromatic ring. So, substituents are groups attached to the benzene. So, one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, the ester is a substituent group attached to the ring. The other substituent could be a vinyl group, perhaps as a substituent that's part of another group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester group (like OCOOR) and a methyl group. But that doesn't explain the vinyl protons. Hmm. Or wait, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent. For example, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group attached to a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group. Like, the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, something like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Wait, but then the substituent would be a vinyl ester group attached to the ring. That might complicate things.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals. The aromatic protons show two signals. If the substituents are para to each other, then each pair of aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving two signals. So, if we have two substituents in para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two distinct environments, each giving a singlet? Or maybe as a pair of doublets?

Wait, no, in para substitution, the two substituents would produce equivalent environments for the two sets of aromatic protons. So, each set of two protons would be equivalent, so each would have a single peak. Thus, the two aromatic signals would each be a pair of protons, perhaps as doublets, but that depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are meta to each other, but that might produce more complex splitting. But the question says two signals, each for two aromatic protons, so maybe that's para.

But wait, the di-substituted ring could have substituents in positions that produce two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (meta), but that might not lead to the simplest splitting. Alternatively, if substituents are at positions 1 and 2 (ortho), which would lead to two sets of equivalent protons.

But perhaps that's getting too detailed. Let's go back to the NMR information. The aromatic region has two signals, each for two protons. So, each set of two equivalent protons, perhaps as a doublet or something else.

The vinyl protons: two signals, one a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically split by their adjacent protons. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-, the protons on the CH2 and CH would each couple with each other. But since the substituent is attached to the ring, perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2-O-CO-R attached to the ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures that fit the NMR data.

The presence of an ester group (IR) suggests the presence of -O-CO-O- or something similar. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R', so the group is like O-CO-R attached to an oxygen that's connected to another R group.

So, the substituents on the ring are likely an ester group and another group. Let's think about the substituents.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. The other substituent could be a vinyl group, perhaps part of another ester or a different group.

Wait, but the NMR has two signals from –CH3 groups. So two different –CH3 groups. That suggests two different methyl groups in the structure.

Hmm, so perhaps the ester is something like O-CO-CH2CH2-CH3? No, that would have a CH2 group, which would show a signal, but the problem says there are no –CH2 groups. So, that can't be. So, perhaps the ester is O-CO-CH2CH3? That would introduce a CH2 group, which is not present. So maybe the ester is O-CO-CH(CH3)2? No, that would have a CH(CH3)2 group, but that would involve a –CH2– group.

Wait, no, if the ester is O-CO-O-R, but no, that's not right. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is a methyl group, the ester would be O-CO-OCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the ester group is R-O-CO-R', so the substituent is O-CO-R' attached to the ring via the oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the ester is attached as a substituent to the ring, and that R' is a group containing a vinyl group and another methyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group and another group that has a vinyl and methyl group.

Wait, let's try to think of a structure that would fit all the given NMR data.

The aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. One substituent is an ester (O-CO-R), and the other substituent could be a substituent that includes a vinyl group and methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group, like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R? No, that's not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is attached to a vinyl group. For example, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But then, the CH2 in CH2=CH would be part of a vinyl group, but I'm not sure how that would fit with the NMR signals.

Wait, the NMR has two –CH3 signals, which are separate. So two different methyl groups. So, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a methyl group, and another substituent that has another methyl group.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. Let me try to imagine a benzene ring with two substituents: one ester group and another group that includes a vinyl and two methyl groups. Or maybe the substituents are themselves more complex.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2. So, the molecular weight is in the range of 156-168.

Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. A benzene ring has 3 degrees (as it's three double bonds). An ester group (which has a carbonyl) adds one more. So that's 4. If there's a vinyl group (a double bond), that's another, making 5. So the formula must account for that.

Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each formula.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For option D: C11H12O2. C=11, H=12.

DoU = (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

So 6 DoU. Benzene ring (3), ester (1) carbonyl, and a vinyl (1) makes 5. So one more DoU. Maybe a ring or another double bond or another carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The NMR shows two signals for –CH3. So are there two different methyl groups in the molecule? Maybe one from the ester and another from another substituent.

Let me think of a possible structure: Benzene ring with an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group attached as a substituent. Wait, but that doesn't explain the –CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH3 (ethyl), but that would have a –CH2– group, which isn't present. So that can't be.

Wait, the substituent may be a vinyl group connected to a methyl group. For example, CH2=CHCH3. No, that would have a –CH2– group, which is not allowed as per the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methacrylate group or something similar.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like benzene with an ester group (like O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl group attached as another substituent. But then, the vinyl group would have protons that are split into specific signals.

Wait, but the ester could be connected to a vinyl group. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R. No, I think I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester where the R group is a cyclopropane or something else, but that might not fit.

Wait, let me think again about the NMR.

The aromatic protons: two signals, each integrating for two protons. So, the ring has two substituents that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets of two each. This suggests a para substitution. Because in para, the substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

So, substituents are at para positions. One substituent is an ester group (O-CO-R), and the other substituent has a vinyl group and maybe some methyl groups.

Wait, but the NMR also has two –CH3 signals. So, two different methyl groups.

Another possibility: the substituents are an ester group and a group containing a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, where R is a methyl group attached to the ester. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl methyl ester? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-OCH2CH3) and a vinyl group. But then, where are the –CH3 groups?

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals in the NMR. Six signals in total.

Two aromatic protons (so two different environments, each with two equivalent protons).
Two vinyl protons: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, two different types of vinyl protons.
Two –CH3 groups: two different environments, each with a –CH3.

So, the structure has:

- Benzene ring with two substituents (para)
- Each substituent contributes to the NMR signals.

Let me imagine substituents A and B in para positions.

Substituent A: Could be an ester group, like O-CO-R.
Substituent B: Could be a group that includes a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl methyl ether, but that would have a –O– group. Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. But that would have –CH2– groups, which aren't present.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a group like CH2=CH2-O-R. But that would have –CH2– groups.

Hmm. Another thought: maybe the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the ring. For example, CH2=CHCH2-O-R, but again, that introduces –CH2– groups, which are not allowed.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a group where the methyl groups are directly attached. For example, in substituent A, the ester is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), and substituent B is a group that has a vinyl group and another methyl group.

Alternatively, maybe substituent B is a glycidyl group (an epoxide), but that may complicate the structure.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a chlorovinyl group, but that may not explain the –CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is an ester group, and substituent B is a methoxy group attached to a vinyl group. But then, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with an ester and a vinyl group, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an allyl group attached to an ester. Like O-CO-R where R is an allyl group. But that may not fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: think of the possible structures from the molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2: Degrees of unsaturation? Let me calculate.

DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

That's 5 DoU. Benzene ring (3), ester (1), and a double bond (1). So, that could fit.

Option B: C12H14O2.

DoU = (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6.

So, 6 DoU. Benzene (3), ester (1), and two more (maybe a double bond and another ring? Or two double bonds.)

Option C: C12H12O2.

DoU = (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7.

That would be 7 DoU, which is a lot. Maybe three rings or more double bonds.

Option D: C11H12O2.

DoU= (24-12)/2=6. So, 6 DoU.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is 3 DoU, ester is 1, and vinyl is 1, totaling 5. So, one more DoU. That could be a ring or another double bond.

But the NMR doesn't suggest any additional rings. So, perhaps another double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe a cyclopropane or another ring, but that's unlikely.

Wait, but the problem mentions a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, the ring is benzene, and two substituents. So, the substituents may contribute to the DoU.

Wait, if substituent A is an ester (O-CO-O-R), and substituent B is a vinyl group, which adds a double bond (1 DoU). That's 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5 DoU. So, the formula would need 5 DoU. Which options have 5 DoU?

Looking back, option A: DoU=5, option D: DoU=6.

So, option A is C11H14O2.

Wait, but the molecular formula would have to include the substituents. Let me think about the structure:

If substituent A is an ester group, like O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), but that would add OCH3, so that's an additional CH3 group.

Substituent B would be a vinyl group connected to something else, perhaps a methyl group. But wait, if substituent B is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, that might require a –CH2– group, which isn't present.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group without any CH2. For example, a vinyl group attached to a benzyl group, but that might not add any CH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible structures that match the NMR.

The NMR shows six signals:

1. Two aromatic H signals (so two different environments, each with two H's)
2. Two vinyl H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)
3. Two –CH3 groups (each in a different environment)

So, the substituents must account for these.

Let me imagine substituent A is an ester group, O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. So substituent A is O-CO-OCH3.

Substituent B is a group that includes a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, substituent B could be a vinyl methyl group, but that would require a –CH2– group, which isn’t present.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH2, but that's just ethylene, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but again, that would have –CH2–.

Hmm, maybe substituent B is a cyclopentyl group? No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group with a methyl group attached to the ring, but that would require a –CH2–.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the vinyl protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two protons, but perhaps from two different sources. So, maybe the vinyl group is adjacent to a substituent that has two neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a substituent that has branching, leading to multiple coupling partners.

Wait, let me think of the vinyl group as part of a substituent like CH2=CH- attached to something else. For example, if the substituent is CH2=CH-O-R, then the vinyl protons would couple with each other and perhaps with any adjacent protons.

But again, this brings in –CH2– groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH- attached directly to the ring, but that would have –CH2– groups.

Wait, maybe it's a substituent where the vinyl group is attached to a methyl ester. For example, O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that still has –CH2– groups.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the H NMR signals.

The vinyl protons: one is a doublet (maybe each proton is coupled to one other proton), and the other is a doublet of quartets (coupled to two protons, perhaps from adjacent groups).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCH3, but that would have –CH2– groups.

Wait, no, the substituent must be such that there are no –CH2– groups. So, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that would have –CH2–. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH(CH3)2, but that would have –CH– groups but not –CH2–.

Wait, but that would be a branching point. So, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, but without any –CH2– groups. That seems difficult.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropenyl group, which is a three-membered ring with a double bond. But that's probably too exotic and not likely for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the vinyl group is directly attached to the ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that again has –CH2–.

Another idea: the substituent is a group where the vinyl group is part of a ring. But that's getting into more complex structures.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an acetylenic group, but that would show different NMR signals.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

The options are C11H14O2, C12H14O2, C12H12O2, C11H12O2.

The ester group has the formula O-CO-O-R, so the ester contributes to the oxygen count. Let me try to model the structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl group connected to another ester or another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R. But that introduces –CH2– groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. Then, the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's model the molecular formula for option A: C11H14O2.

The benzene ring is C6H4. The substituents must add up to C5H10O2.

Wait, substituent A: let's say it's an ester group, O-CO-O-R. So, R would be a group that adds to the structure.

If R is a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), substituent A contributes O-CO-OCH3, which is C3H5O2. So, substituent A is C3H5O2.

Substituent B would then be C2H5O? Because total substituent carbons are 5 (C6 + 3 + 2 = 11). Wait, that can't be right because substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (which is 3 carbons), substituent B would have to be 2 carbons.

But substituent B must be a group that has a vinyl group and a methyl group, but without any –CH2–.

Hmm, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, but that's not possible without –CH2–.

Wait, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH-O-, but that would have –CH2–.

Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl methyl group, but that requires –CH2–.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps another approach.

The NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So, two different –CH3 groups. So, perhaps the ester has a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), and another substituent has another –CH3.

Wait, then substituent B could be a methyl group connected to a vinyl group, but without a –CH2– group. Hmm, like CH2=CHCH3? But that has –CH2–.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH3-C≡C-CH2-O-R? Probably not, as that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe substituent B is a group like CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that brings back –CH2– groups.

Hmm. Another approach: let's think about the possible structures that have an ester group and a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring, and two methyl groups.

Wait, if the substituents are an ester and a vinyl methyl group, but without any –CH2–. So the substituent would be CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But that would have –CH2–.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but that would have a carbonyl, which is part of the ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the vinyl group is attached to an ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but again, that's –CH2–.

I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look for the molecular formula that makes sense.

Let me think about the ester group. The general formula for an ester is R-O-CO-R'. The benzene ring contributes C6H4. Each substituent adds to the formula.

Suppose substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester). That's C3H5O2.

Substituent B is, say, a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, but that would require a –CH2–, which isn't allowed. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that again brings in –CH2–.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a benzyl group, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, but that doesn't add any –CH3.

Wait, another idea: the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that's –CH2–.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of protons.

The NMR shows:

- Aromatic: 2 H (each from two sets)
- Vinyl: 2 H
- CH3: 2 H (each from two sets)

So, total H: 2+2+2+2 = 8 H. Wait, but the actual molecular formula would have more H's, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic ring has 4 H, but that's not the case here because the two substituents are causing the aromatic H to split into two sets, each with two H's.

Wait, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring is di-substituted, leading to two sets of two equivalent H's each.

So, the ring has four H's in total, each in two sets of two. So, 4 H in the aromatic region.

The vinyl group contributes 2 H (as per the two signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets).

The –CH3 groups contribute 2 H each, but wait, each CH3 would have three H's. Oh wait, no, each –CH3 is a group with three H's. So, two –CH3 groups would contribute 6 H's.

Wait, but in the NMR description, it says two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. So perhaps each –CH3 is a singlet, but the question states that it's two signals, each for –CH3. So, each –CH3 is split into a different environment, but each as a singlet.

So, the total H count would be:

Aromatic: 4 H
Vinyl: 2 H
CH3: 6 H
Total: 12 H.

Looking at the options:

Option D: C11H12O2. H=12. So, that would match.

Option A: H=14. So, 14 H.

Wait, let's check the H count.

Each substituent contributes H's.

Benzene ring: 6 H in total, but substituents reduce this.

If two substituents are attached, the ring has 4 H left, which is split into two sets of two.

So, 4 H from aromatic.

Vinyl group has 2 H.

Each –CH3 group has 3 H, but since we have two –CH3 groups, that's 6 H.

So, 4 +2+6=12 H.

Looking at the options, which have H=12? Option D is C11H12O2. So, the molecular formula would have 12 H.

But wait, the molecular formula for option D is C11H12O2. So, the molecular weight would be 11*12 +12 +32= 132+12+32=176.

But let's check the possible structure: benzene with two substituents, each contributing to the formula.

Substituent A: O-CO-OCH3. That's 3 carbons, 5 H (O-CO-OCH3 has OCH3, which is 3 H).

Substituent B: Let's say it's a group that contributes 2 carbons and 7 H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, which would be CH2=CHCH3. But that would have –CH2–, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to something else without any –CH2–. For example, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that again has –CH2–.

Hmm. Maybe substituent B is a group like CH2=CH2, but that's just ethylene, which doesn't add any substituents.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH3-C≡C-CH2-O-R. But that introduces more complexity.

I think I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps I should just go with the H count.

If option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H, which matches the NMR data (4+2+6=12), that would make sense. So, the formula would be option D.

But another thought: the presence of an ester group (which has a carbonyl) and a vinyl group (which has a double bond) accounts for two of the DoU beyond the benzene ring.

So, 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) + 1 (vinyl) =5 DoU. The formula needs 5 DoU. Looking at the options, option D has 6 DoU (DoU=6). So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, let me re-calculate the DoU for the options.

Option D: C11H12O2.

DoU= (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6.

So, 6 DoU.

So, benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) + one more DoU. What could that be? Maybe another double bond or a ring.

But the structure doesn't suggest another double bond or ring. So that's confusing.

Option A: C11H14O2.

DoU= (24-14)/2=5. So, 5 DoU. Which fits the three from benzene, one from ester, and one from vinyl. So, that works.

So, the formula would have 5 DoU, which matches.

But the NMR shows 12 H, and option A has H=14. So, where would the extra H come from?

Wait, substituent A: O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons, 5 H).

Substituent B: let's say it's a group with 8 H. That might not make sense.

Alternatively, substituent B could have more H's.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, but that brings in –CH2–. So that's not allowed.

Wait, another approach. The molecular formula of the entire compound is CxHyO2.

Benzene: C6H6.

Substituents: each substituent adds to the formula.

Let's say substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (adds 3 C, 5 H, 2 O).

Substituent B is CH2=CH2 (adds 2 C, 4 H, 0 O).

So, total would be C6 +3 +2 =11 C.

H:6 (benzene) - 2 (substituents each take one H, as substituents replace H's) → 6 - 2*1 =4. Then substituents add 5 (from A) +4 (from B) =9. So total H=4 +9=13.

But option A is C11H14O2. That would require 14 H. So, I'm missing some.

Another substituent possibility: substituent B is CH2=CHCH3 (propenyl), which adds 3 C and 5 H.

So, substituent A: 3 C, 5 H.

Substituent B:3 C,5 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12 → option B is C12H14O2.

H: benzene 6H. Each substituent replaces one H, so 6-2=4 H. Substituents add 5+5=10. Total H=4+10=14.

Which matches option A: C11H14O2? No, option B is C12H14O2.

Wait, substituent B is propenyl: CH2=CHCH3. Adding 3 C and 5 H.

So, substituent A: 3 C,5 H.

Substituent B:3 C,5 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12.

Total H:6 (benzene) -2 (substituents) +5+5=14.

So, molecular formula would be C12H14O2, which is option B.

So, that would fit the H count of 14, which is option B's formula.

But earlier, the DoU for option B is 6. So, benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) + another DoU (maybe a ring or another double bond). But in this structure, substituent B is a vinyl group (propenyl), which is a double bond, so that's one DoU. Ester is another. Benzene is 3. So, that's 5 DoU, but formula has 6.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent calculation. Let me check again.

Each substituent adds to the DoU:

Substituent A: O-CO-OCH3. The ester group contributes one DoU (the carbonyl).

Substituent B: CH2=CHCH3. The double bond contributes one DoU.

So, total DoU from substituents: 2.

Benzene:3.

Total DoU:5.

But option B has DoU=6. So, where does the sixth come from?

Perhaps substituent B introduces an additional ring or another double bond.

Wait, substituent B as a cyclopropenyl group would add another DoU. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is a cyclic ester or something else. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck again, but perhaps the correct approach is to select option B, as it fits the H count.

Wait, but according to the NMR, the compound has no –CH2 groups. If substituent B is CH2=CHCH3, that would have –CH2– groups, which is not allowed. So that structure is invalid.

Hmm, so perhaps substituent B doesn't have –CH2–. So, substituent B must be a group without any –CH2–. How can that be?

Wait, maybe substituent B is a group like CH3-C≡C-CH2-O-R. No, that has –CH2–.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that brings in –CH2–.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group where the vinyl group is attached directly to the ring without any –CH2–. For example, a substituent like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that would have –CH2–.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that brings in –CH2–.

I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B, C12H14O2, because it fits the H count.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, the molecule must have two different methyl groups.

If substituent A is O-CO-OCH3, that's one methyl group. Then, substituent B must have another methyl group, perhaps as a substituent on a vinyl group. But that would require a –CH2– group, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group where the methyl is attached directly, like a geminal substituent, but that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe substituent B is a group like CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that has –CH2–.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think the best approach is to go with option D, C11H12O2, because it fits the H count of 12 (4 aromatic, 2 vinyl, 6 from two CH3 groups).


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on spectral data. The compound contains an ester group (indicated by the FTIR spectrum) and exhibits specific signals in the 1H NMR spectrum: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups, with no –CH2 groups present.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Ester Group**: The presence of an ester group (R-O-CO-R') is confirmed by the FTIR spectrum. This contributes one degree of unsaturation (DoU) and adds oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.

2. **1H NMR Signals**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals, each integrating for two protons, suggest a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, splitting the aromatic protons into two distinct environments.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) indicate the presence of a vinyl group (CH=CH) with specific coupling patterns.
   - **–CH3 Groups**: Two signals for –CH3 groups, indicating two distinct methyl groups in the structure.

3. **Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU.
   - The ester group contributes 1 DoU.
   - The vinyl group contributes 1 DoU.
   - Total DoU = 5, matching molecular formulas with 5 degrees of unsaturation.

4. **Hydrogen Count**:
   - Aromatic protons: 4 H (2 sets of 2 H each).
   - Vinyl protons: 2 H.
   - –CH3 groups: 6 H (2 groups of 3 H each).
   - Total H = 12.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (C11H14O2)**: Hydrogen count is 14, which does not match the NMR data (12 H required). Eliminated.
   - **Option B (C12H14O2)**: Hydrogen count is 14, which also does not match. Eliminated.
   - **Option C (C12H12O2)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 7, which is inconsistent with the structure (only 5 DoU are present). Eliminated.
   - **Option D (C11H12O2)**: Hydrogen count is 12, matching the NMR data. Degrees of unsaturation = 6, but the structure accounts for only 5 DoU. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or interpretation, but based on the given data, this is the most consistent option.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula that best fits the spectral data and hydrogen count is **C11H12O2**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, which means there's an OCO group somewhere in the molecule. The 1H NMR has six signals, which break down into two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals for –CH3 groups. No signals for –CH2 groups.

First, I need to figure out the structure based on the spectral data. Let's start by thinking about what an ester looks like. An ester has the structure R-O-CO-R', so in the aromatic ring, maybe one substituent is an ester group. Since it's a di-substituted ring, there's another group attached.

The aromatic ring is 6-membered, so probably benzene, but it's substituted. The substituents are likely in positions that make the molecule either para, meta, or ortho. But since it's di-substituted, the positions will affect the NMR signals. The aromatic region has two signals, which suggests that the two substituents are either in para positions (which would result in two sets of equivalent protons) or some other arrangement that leads to two distinct aromatic proton environments.

Wait, if it's para, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a pair. But the NMR shows two signals, each for two aromatic protons. So maybe the substituents are such that each has their own set of equivalent protons. But wait, two substituents—so perhaps each substituent is in such a position that the ring protons are split into two different environments. For example, if substituents are in the para position, but maybe one is an ester and the other is something else.

Wait, but the molecule is di-substituted, so let's think about the substituents. One substituent is an ester group. What's the other substituent? The NMR shows vinyl protons, so maybe a vinyl group is present, like a substituent that has a double bond, such as a substituent like CH2CH2, but that's not right. Wait, vinyl protons are from a CH2=CH group, so perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. Alternatively, maybe an ester group with a vinyl substituent.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests that these protons are split by neighboring groups. A vinyl proton can split into a doublet if it's adjacent to another proton in a trans configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached.

Wait, let me think. The NMR has two types of vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, which might imply coupling with one neighboring proton. The other is a doublet of quartets, which suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents include an ester and a vinyl group. Let's consider the structure. So, for example, an ester group attached to the ring, and another group which is a vinyl group (like CH2CH2O something, but maybe not). Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH3, but that would give more complex splitting.

Wait, no, the substituent could be an ester and another group. Let me think about the substituents. The ester group is one substituent, and the other substituent could be a vinyl group attached to the ring, perhaps as an ethyl group or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that has a vinyl group. For example, the ester is attached to a vinyl group. Let's say the structure is something like benzene with an ester group and a vinyl group attached as substituents.

Wait, but the substituents are on the aromatic ring. So, substituents are groups attached to the benzene. So, one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, the ester is a substituent group attached to the ring. The other substituent could be a vinyl group, perhaps as a substituent that's part of another group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester group (like OCOOR) and a methyl group. But that doesn't explain the vinyl protons. Hmm. Or wait, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent. For example, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group attached to a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group. Like, the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, something like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Wait, but then the substituent would be a vinyl ester group attached to the ring. That might complicate things.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals. The aromatic protons show two signals. If the substituents are para to each other, then each pair of aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving two signals. So, if we have two substituents in para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two distinct environments, each giving a singlet? Or maybe as a pair of doublets?

Wait, no, in para substitution, the two substituents would produce equivalent environments for the two sets of aromatic protons. So, each set of two protons would be equivalent, so each would have a single peak. Thus, the two aromatic signals would each be a pair of protons, perhaps as doublets, but that depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are meta to each other, but that might produce more complex splitting. But the question says two signals, each for two aromatic protons, so maybe that's para.

But wait, the di-substituted ring could have substituents in positions that produce two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (meta), but that might not lead to the simplest splitting. Alternatively, if substituents are at positions 1 and 2 (ortho), which would lead to two sets of equivalent protons.

But perhaps that's getting too detailed. Let's go back to the NMR information. The aromatic region has two signals, each for two protons. So, each set of two equivalent protons, perhaps as a doublet or something else.

The vinyl protons: two signals, one a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically split by their adjacent protons. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-, the protons on the CH2 and CH would each couple with each other. But since the substituent is attached to the ring, perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2-O-CO-R attached to the ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures that fit the NMR data.

The presence of an ester group (IR) suggests the presence of -O-CO-O- or something similar. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R', so the group is like O-CO-R attached to an oxygen that's connected to another R group.

So, the substituents on the ring are likely an ester group and another group. Let's think about the substituents.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. The other substituent could be a vinyl group, perhaps part of another ester or a different group.

Wait, but the NMR has two signals from –CH3 groups. So two different –CH3 groups. That suggests two different methyl groups in the structure.

Hmm, so perhaps the ester is something like O-CO-CH2CH2-CH3? No, that would have a CH2 group, which would show a signal, but the problem says there are no –CH2 groups. So, that can't be. So, perhaps the ester is O-CO-CH2CH3? That would introduce a CH2 group, which is not present. So maybe the ester is O-CO-CH(CH3)2? No, that would have a CH(CH3)2 group, but that would involve a –CH2– group.

Wait, no, if the ester is O-CO-O-R, but no, that's not right. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is a methyl group, the ester would be O-CO-OCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the ester group is R-O-CO-R', so the substituent is O-CO-R' attached to the ring via the oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the ester is attached as a substituent to the ring, and that R' is a group containing a vinyl group and another methyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group and another group that has a vinyl and methyl group.

Wait, let's try to think of a structure that would fit all the given NMR data.

The aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. One substituent is an ester (O-CO-R), and the other substituent could be a substituent that includes a vinyl group and methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group, like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R? No, that's not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is attached to a vinyl group. For example, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But then, the CH2 in CH2=CH would be part of a vinyl group, but I'm not sure how that would fit with the NMR signals.

Wait, the NMR has two –CH3 signals, which are separate. So two different methyl groups. So, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a methyl group, and another substituent that has another methyl group.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. Let me try to imagine a benzene ring with two substituents: one ester group and another group that includes a vinyl and two methyl groups. Or maybe the substituents are themselves more complex.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2. So, the molecular weight is in the range of 156-168.

Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. A benzene ring has 3 degrees (as it's three double bonds). An ester group (which has a carbonyl) adds one more. So that's 4. If there's a vinyl group (a double bond), that's another, making 5. So the formula must account for that.

Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each formula.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For option D: C11H12O2. C=11, H=12.

DoU = (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

So 6 DoU. Benzene ring (3), ester (1) carbonyl, and a vinyl (1) makes 5. So one more DoU. Maybe a ring or another double bond or another carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The NMR shows two signals for –CH3. So are there two different methyl groups in the molecule? Maybe one from the ester and another from another substituent.

Let me think of a possible structure: Benzene ring with an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group attached as a substituent. Wait, but that doesn't explain the –CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH3 (ethyl), but that would have a –CH2– group, which isn't present. So that can't be.

Wait, the substituent may be a vinyl group connected to a methyl group. For example, CH2=CHCH3. No, that would have a –CH2– group, which is not allowed as per the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methacrylate group or something similar.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like benzene with an ester group (like O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl group attached as another substituent. But then, the vinyl group would have protons that are split into specific signals.

Wait, but the ester could be connected to a vinyl group. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R. No, I think I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester where the R group is a cyclopropane or something else, but that might not fit.

Wait, let me think again about the NMR.

The aromatic protons: two signals, each integrating for two protons. So, the ring has two substituents that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets of two each. This suggests a para substitution. Because in para, the substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

So, substituents are at para positions. One substituent is an ester group (O-CO-R), and the other substituent has a vinyl group and maybe some methyl groups.

Wait, but the NMR also has two –CH3 signals. So, two different methyl groups.

Another possibility: the substituents are an ester group and a group containing a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, where R is a methyl group attached to the ester. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl methyl ester? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-OCH2CH3) and a vinyl group. But then, where are the –CH3 groups?

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals in the NMR. Six signals in total.

Two aromatic protons (so two different environments, each with two equivalent protons).
Two vinyl protons: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, two different types of vinyl protons.
Two –CH3 groups: two different environments, each with a –CH3.

So, the structure has:

- Benzene ring with two substituents (para)
- Each substituent contributes to the NMR signals.

Let me imagine substituents A and B in para positions.

Substituent A: Could be an ester group, like O-CO-R.
Substituent B: Could be a group that includes a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl methyl ether, but that would have a –O– group. Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. But that would have –CH2– groups, which aren't present.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a group like CH2=CH2-O-R. But that would have –CH2– groups.

Hmm. Another thought: maybe the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the ring. For example, CH2=CHCH2-O-R, but again, that introduces –CH2– groups, which are not allowed.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a group where the methyl groups are directly attached. For example, in substituent A, the ester is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), and substituent B is a group that has a vinyl group and another methyl group.

Alternatively, maybe substituent B is a glycidyl group (an epoxide), but that may complicate the structure.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a chlorovinyl group, but that may not explain the –CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is an ester group, and substituent B is a methoxy group attached to a vinyl group. But then, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with an ester and a vinyl group, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an allyl group attached to an ester. Like O-CO-R where R is an allyl group. But that may not fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: think of the possible structures from the molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2: Degrees of unsaturation? Let me calculate.

DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

That's 5 DoU. Benzene ring (3), ester (1), and a double bond (1). So, that could fit.

Option B: C12H14O2.

DoU = (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6.

So, 6 DoU. Benzene (3), ester (1), and two more (maybe a double bond and another ring? Or two double bonds.)

Option C: C12H12O2.

DoU = (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7.

That would be 7 DoU, which is a lot. Maybe three rings or more double bonds.

Option D: C11H12O2.

DoU= (24-12)/2=6. So, 6 DoU.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is 3 DoU, ester is 1, and vinyl is 1, totaling 5. So, one more DoU. That could be a ring or another double bond.

But the NMR doesn't suggest any additional rings. So, perhaps another double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe a cyclopropane or another ring, but that's unlikely.

Wait, but the problem mentions a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, the ring is benzene, and two substituents. So, the substituents may contribute to the DoU.

Wait, if substituent A is an ester (O-CO-O-R), and substituent B is a vinyl group, which adds a double bond (1 DoU). That's 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5 DoU. So, the formula would need 5 DoU. Which options have 5 DoU?

Looking back, option A: DoU=5, option D: DoU=6.

So, option A is C11H14O2.

Wait, but the molecular formula would have to include the substituents. Let me think about the structure:

If substituent A is an ester group, like O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), but that would add OCH3, so that's an additional CH3 group.

Substituent B would be a vinyl group connected to something else, perhaps a methyl group. But wait, if substituent B is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, that might require a –CH2– group, which isn't present.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group without any CH2. For example, a vinyl group attached to a benzyl group, but that might not add any CH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible structures that match the NMR.

The NMR shows six signals:

1. Two aromatic H signals (so two different environments, each with two H's)
2. Two vinyl H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)
3. Two –CH3 groups (each in a different environment)

So, the substituents must account for these.

Let me imagine substituent A is an ester group, O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. So substituent A is O-CO-OCH3.

Substituent B is a group that includes a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, substituent B could be a vinyl methyl group, but that would require a –CH2– group, which isn’t present.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH2, but that's just ethylene, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but again, that would have –CH2–.

Hmm, maybe substituent B is a cyclopentyl group? No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group with a methyl group attached to the ring, but that would require a –CH2–.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the vinyl protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two protons, but perhaps from two different sources. So, maybe the vinyl group is adjacent to a substituent that has two neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a substituent that has branching, leading to multiple coupling partners.

Wait, let me think of the vinyl group as part of a substituent like CH2=CH- attached to something else. For example, if the substituent is CH2=CH-O-R, then the vinyl protons would couple with each other and perhaps with any adjacent protons.

But again, this brings in –CH2– groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH- attached directly to the ring, but that would have –CH2– groups.

Wait, maybe it's a substituent where the vinyl group is attached to a methyl ester. For example, O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that still has –CH2– groups.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the H NMR signals.

The vinyl protons: one is a doublet (maybe each proton is coupled to one other proton), and the other is a doublet of quartets (coupled to two protons, perhaps from adjacent groups).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCH3, but that would have –CH2– groups.

Wait, no, the substituent must be such that there are no –CH2– groups. So, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that would have –CH2–. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH(CH3)2, but that would have –CH– groups but not –CH2–.

Wait, but that would be a branching point. So, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, but without any –CH2– groups. That seems difficult.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropenyl group, which is a three-membered ring with a double bond. But that's probably too exotic and not likely for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the vinyl group is directly attached to the ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that again has –CH2–.

Another idea: the substituent is a group where the vinyl group is part of a ring. But that's getting into more complex structures.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an acetylenic group, but that would show different NMR signals.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

The options are C11H14O2, C12H14O2, C12H12O2, C11H12O2.

The ester group has the formula O-CO-O-R, so the ester contributes to the oxygen count. Let me try to model the structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl group connected to another ester or another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R. But that introduces –CH2– groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. Then, the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's model the molecular formula for option A: C11H14O2.

The benzene ring is C6H4. The substituents must add up to C5H10O2.

Wait, substituent A: let's say it's an ester group, O-CO-O-R. So, R would be a group that adds to the structure.

If R is a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), substituent A contributes O-CO-OCH3, which is C3H5O2. So, substituent A is C3H5O2.

Substituent B would then be C2H5O? Because total substituent carbons are 5 (C6 + 3 + 2 = 11). Wait, that can't be right because substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (which is 3 carbons), substituent B would have to be 2 carbons.

But substituent B must be a group that has a vinyl group and a methyl group, but without any –CH2–.

Hmm, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, but that's not possible without –CH2–.

Wait, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH-O-, but that would have –CH2–.

Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl methyl group, but that requires –CH2–.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps another approach.

The NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So, two different –CH3 groups. So, perhaps the ester has a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), and another substituent has another –CH3.

Wait, then substituent B could be a methyl group connected to a vinyl group, but without a –CH2– group. Hmm, like CH2=CHCH3? But that has –CH2–.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH3-C≡C-CH2-O-R? Probably not, as that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe substituent B is a group like CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that brings back –CH2– groups.

Hmm. Another approach: let's think about the possible structures that have an ester group and a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring, and two methyl groups.

Wait, if the substituents are an ester and a vinyl methyl group, but without any –CH2–. So the substituent would be CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But that would have –CH2–.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but that would have a carbonyl, which is part of the ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the vinyl group is attached to an ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but again, that's –CH2–.

I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look for the molecular formula that makes sense.

Let me think about the ester group. The general formula for an ester is R-O-CO-R'. The benzene ring contributes C6H4. Each substituent adds to the formula.

Suppose substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester). That's C3H5O2.

Substituent B is, say, a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, but that would require a –CH2–, which isn't allowed. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that again brings in –CH2–.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a benzyl group, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, but that doesn't add any –CH3.

Wait, another idea: the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that's –CH2–.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of protons.

The NMR shows:

- Aromatic: 2 H (each from two sets)
- Vinyl: 2 H
- CH3: 2 H (each from two sets)

So, total H: 2+2+2+2 = 8 H. Wait, but the actual molecular formula would have more H's, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic ring has 4 H, but that's not the case here because the two substituents are causing the aromatic H to split into two sets, each with two H's.

Wait, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring is di-substituted, leading to two sets of two equivalent H's each.

So, the ring has four H's in total, each in two sets of two. So, 4 H in the aromatic region.

The vinyl group contributes 2 H (as per the two signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets).

The –CH3 groups contribute 2 H each, but wait, each CH3 would have three H's. Oh wait, no, each –CH3 is a group with three H's. So, two –CH3 groups would contribute 6 H's.

Wait, but in the NMR description, it says two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. So perhaps each –CH3 is a singlet, but the question states that it's two signals, each for –CH3. So, each –CH3 is split into a different environment, but each as a singlet.

So, the total H count would be:

Aromatic: 4 H
Vinyl: 2 H
CH3: 6 H
Total: 12 H.

Looking at the options:

Option D: C11H12O2. H=12. So, that would match.

Option A: H=14. So, 14 H.

Wait, let's check the H count.

Each substituent contributes H's.

Benzene ring: 6 H in total, but substituents reduce this.

If two substituents are attached, the ring has 4 H left, which is split into two sets of two.

So, 4 H from aromatic.

Vinyl group has 2 H.

Each –CH3 group has 3 H, but since we have two –CH3 groups, that's 6 H.

So, 4 +2+6=12 H.

Looking at the options, which have H=12? Option D is C11H12O2. So, the molecular formula would have 12 H.

But wait, the molecular formula for option D is C11H12O2. So, the molecular weight would be 11*12 +12 +32= 132+12+32=176.

But let's check the possible structure: benzene with two substituents, each contributing to the formula.

Substituent A: O-CO-OCH3. That's 3 carbons, 5 H (O-CO-OCH3 has OCH3, which is 3 H).

Substituent B: Let's say it's a group that contributes 2 carbons and 7 H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, which would be CH2=CHCH3. But that would have –CH2–, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to something else without any –CH2–. For example, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that again has –CH2–.

Hmm. Maybe substituent B is a group like CH2=CH2, but that's just ethylene, which doesn't add any substituents.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH3-C≡C-CH2-O-R. But that introduces more complexity.

I think I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps I should just go with the H count.

If option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H, which matches the NMR data (4+2+6=12), that would make sense. So, the formula would be option D.

But another thought: the presence of an ester group (which has a carbonyl) and a vinyl group (which has a double bond) accounts for two of the DoU beyond the benzene ring.

So, 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) + 1 (vinyl) =5 DoU. The formula needs 5 DoU. Looking at the options, option D has 6 DoU (DoU=6). So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, let me re-calculate the DoU for the options.

Option D: C11H12O2.

DoU= (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6.

So, 6 DoU.

So, benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) + one more DoU. What could that be? Maybe another double bond or a ring.

But the structure doesn't suggest another double bond or ring. So that's confusing.

Option A: C11H14O2.

DoU= (24-14)/2=5. So, 5 DoU. Which fits the three from benzene, one from ester, and one from vinyl. So, that works.

So, the formula would have 5 DoU, which matches.

But the NMR shows 12 H, and option A has H=14. So, where would the extra H come from?

Wait, substituent A: O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons, 5 H).

Substituent B: let's say it's a group with 8 H. That might not make sense.

Alternatively, substituent B could have more H's.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, but that brings in –CH2–. So that's not allowed.

Wait, another approach. The molecular formula of the entire compound is CxHyO2.

Benzene: C6H6.

Substituents: each substituent adds to the formula.

Let's say substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (adds 3 C, 5 H, 2 O).

Substituent B is CH2=CH2 (adds 2 C, 4 H, 0 O).

So, total would be C6 +3 +2 =11 C.

H:6 (benzene) - 2 (substituents each take one H, as substituents replace H's) → 6 - 2*1 =4. Then substituents add 5 (from A) +4 (from B) =9. So total H=4 +9=13.

But option A is C11H14O2. That would require 14 H. So, I'm missing some.

Another substituent possibility: substituent B is CH2=CHCH3 (propenyl), which adds 3 C and 5 H.

So, substituent A: 3 C, 5 H.

Substituent B:3 C,5 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12 → option B is C12H14O2.

H: benzene 6H. Each substituent replaces one H, so 6-2=4 H. Substituents add 5+5=10. Total H=4+10=14.

Which matches option A: C11H14O2? No, option B is C12H14O2.

Wait, substituent B is propenyl: CH2=CHCH3. Adding 3 C and 5 H.

So, substituent A: 3 C,5 H.

Substituent B:3 C,5 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12.

Total H:6 (benzene) -2 (substituents) +5+5=14.

So, molecular formula would be C12H14O2, which is option B.

So, that would fit the H count of 14, which is option B's formula.

But earlier, the DoU for option B is 6. So, benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) + another DoU (maybe a ring or another double bond). But in this structure, substituent B is a vinyl group (propenyl), which is a double bond, so that's one DoU. Ester is another. Benzene is 3. So, that's 5 DoU, but formula has 6.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent calculation. Let me check again.

Each substituent adds to the DoU:

Substituent A: O-CO-OCH3. The ester group contributes one DoU (the carbonyl).

Substituent B: CH2=CHCH3. The double bond contributes one DoU.

So, total DoU from substituents: 2.

Benzene:3.

Total DoU:5.

But option B has DoU=6. So, where does the sixth come from?

Perhaps substituent B introduces an additional ring or another double bond.

Wait, substituent B as a cyclopropenyl group would add another DoU. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is a cyclic ester or something else. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck again, but perhaps the correct approach is to select option B, as it fits the H count.

Wait, but according to the NMR, the compound has no –CH2 groups. If substituent B is CH2=CHCH3, that would have –CH2– groups, which is not allowed. So that structure is invalid.

Hmm, so perhaps substituent B doesn't have –CH2–. So, substituent B must be a group without any –CH2–. How can that be?

Wait, maybe substituent B is a group like CH3-C≡C-CH2-O-R. No, that has –CH2–.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that brings in –CH2–.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group where the vinyl group is attached directly to the ring without any –CH2–. For example, a substituent like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that would have –CH2–.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that brings in –CH2–.

I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B, C12H14O2, because it fits the H count.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, the molecule must have two different methyl groups.

If substituent A is O-CO-OCH3, that's one methyl group. Then, substituent B must have another methyl group, perhaps as a substituent on a vinyl group. But that would require a –CH2– group, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group where the methyl is attached directly, like a geminal substituent, but that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe substituent B is a group like CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that has –CH2–.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think the best approach is to go with option D, C11H12O2, because it fits the H count of 12 (4 aromatic, 2 vinyl, 6 from two CH3 groups).


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on spectral data. The compound contains an ester group (indicated by the FTIR spectrum) and exhibits specific signals in the 1H NMR spectrum: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups, with no –CH2 groups present.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Ester Group**: The presence of an ester group (R-O-CO-R') is confirmed by the FTIR spectrum. This contributes one degree of unsaturation (DoU) and adds oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.

2. **1H NMR Signals**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals, each integrating for two protons, suggest a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, splitting the aromatic protons into two distinct environments.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) indicate the presence of a vinyl group (CH=CH) with specific coupling patterns.
   - **–CH3 Groups**: Two signals for –CH3 groups, indicating two distinct methyl groups in the structure.

3. **Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU.
   - The ester group contributes 1 DoU.
   - The vinyl group contributes 1 DoU.
   - Total DoU = 5, matching molecular formulas with 5 degrees of unsaturation.

4. **Hydrogen Count**:
   - Aromatic protons: 4 H (2 sets of 2 H each).
   - Vinyl protons: 2 H.
   - –CH3 groups: 6 H (2 groups of 3 H each).
   - Total H = 12.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (C11H14O2)**: Hydrogen count is 14, which does not match the NMR data (12 H required). Eliminated.
   - **Option B (C12H14O2)**: Hydrogen count is 14, which also does not match. Eliminated.
   - **Option C (C12H12O2)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 7, which is inconsistent with the structure (only 5 DoU are present). Eliminated.
   - **Option D (C11H12O2)**: Hydrogen count is 12, matching the NMR data. Degrees of unsaturation = 6, but the structure accounts for only 5 DoU. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or interpretation, but based on the given data, this is the most consistent option.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula that best fits the spectral data and hydrogen count is **C11H12O2**.
