Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the experiment involves a bicistronic vector with some specific constructs. The main issue is that when they look for a green signal under the microscope, they don't see it. So I need to figure out why.

Let me break down the setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one transcript. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream of it. 

Wait, I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to the translation of a second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA. So the ligand is translated first, then the receptor. 

But there are stop cassettes in between. The ligand ORF has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette after it, and the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272 after it. Oh, right, these stop cassettes prevent the expression of the downstream gene unless a Cre-recombinase is present to excise the stop. So the ligand is under CBA, which is constitutively active, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, but only after the stop is removed.

So the idea is that when Cre is expressed, it recombines the lox sites. LoxP is recognized by Cre, and lox2272 is recognized by another recombinase, but wait, the question says the lox2272 is between receptor and eGFP. Since they used SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, which is a transgenic line that expresses Cre under the SOX10 promoter. SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, like Schwann cells and melanocytes. So the Cre should be active in neural crest cells and their progeny.

But why isn't the eGFP showing up? Let's think about the expression.

The vector is a bicistronic construct, so when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed as separate proteins. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP.

They transfected primary astrocyte cultures and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, so presumably, the proteins are expressed and detected. But in the mouse model, they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate the Cre in neural crest-derived cells. So why no green signal (eGFP) in the offspring?

Wait, in the mouse, the construct is homozygous. So each allele has the same setup. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would recombine the lox sites. But in the vector, the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. So if the Cre is active, it would recombine loxP sites but not lox2272, since that's a different recombinase site. Oh wait, the lox2272 is a variant that requires a different Cre (maybe Cre/loxP is the main system, and lox2272 is for a different recombinase, perhaps like Dre or another). Wait, no, I think lox2272 is another site for Cre, but they have a different arrangement. Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a site that can only be cut by Cre when paired with another lox2272, whereas loxP can be cut by Cre when paired with any lox site. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, the vector uses loxP-stop in the ligand region and lox2272-stop in the receptor region. So when Cre is present, it can recombine loxP sites. But the lox2272 would require another recombinase, perhaps? Or maybe Cre can still recognize lox2272? I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Alternatively, maybe the setup is that the ligand's ORF is under CBA, so it's expressed regardless, but the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which may depend on the removal of the stop cassette. So if the stop isn't removed, the receptor won't be expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, the Cre would have to excise both stops. Wait, no, each gene has its own stop cassette. The ligand's ORF has a loxP-stop, and the receptor has lox2272-stop. So for the ligand to be expressed, the loxP needs to be cut, which Cre can do. Similarly, the receptor's lox2272 needs to be cut, but if the same Cre can't do that, then the receptor won't be expressed.

Wait, I think Cre uses loxP sites. Lox2272 is a mutant lox site that can only be cut when paired with another lox2272. Alternatively, perhaps Cre can't recombine lox2272, so only the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's stop remains.

So in the mouse, if the Cre is active in neural crest cells, the ligand's stop is excised, so ligand (with mCherry) is expressed. But the receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor isn't expressed, so the eGFP isn't either.

But wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, which has the loxP and lox2272 stops. When Cre is expressed, it will cut the loxP sites, but if the lox2272 isn't cut, the receptor won't be expressed.

So in the mouse, the ligand is expressed (so mCherry would be visible in those cells), but the receptor-eGFP is not expressed, so no green signal.

Wait, but the question says that the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre. So Cre is active in the neural crest cells. So why isn't the receptor expressed?

So the possible reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 site, meaning the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Hence, the eGFP isn't either.

Wait, but the options: let's look at the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would affect their expression, but if they're not in frame, maybe the eGFP isn't expressed correctly, but in that case, the Western blot wouldn't detect it either, right? But the question says the Western blot after plasmid transfection showed some signal, because the total proteins give a signal proportional to actin. So maybe the expression constructs work when transfected in cell culture, but not in the mouse. Maybe something about the expression in the mouse.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working as intended. The receptor is after the IRES. The IRES allows for internal initiation of translation, but maybe without the stop cassette being removed, the receptor isn't translated.

Wait, in the vector, the ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor with the stop. Wait no, the vector is ligand ORF at 5', then a stop in loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, then the stop in lox2272, then eGFP.

So the mRNA is ligand-stop (loxP) - IRES - receptor (lox2272-stop) - eGFP.

Wait, no, wait. The ligand is 5', then a stop (loxP) cassette, then IRES, then receptor, then another stop (lox2272) cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, no, I think the vector is arranged as ligand-ORF followed by a stop cassette, then IRES, then receptor-ORF followed by another stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, the problem says: "the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. [...] Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette."

So the structure is: ligand ORF (with stop after it in loxP), then mCherry. Then IRES, then receptor ORF, then stop in lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, no, I think the fusion is that the ligand's ORF is fused to mCherry. So it's ligand-mCherry, but with a stop after the ligand. Wait, maybe the ligand is first, then a stop (so the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the stop comes after). No, perhaps it's that the ligand is at the beginning, followed by a loxP stop cassette, then mCherry? Or perhaps it's that the ligand is cloned first, then a loxP stop, then the IRES, then the receptor, then another stop, then eGFP.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the vector.

The vector is bicistronic, so a single mRNA has two coding regions: the ligand and the receptor. The ligand is first, under CBA promoter, then an IRES, then the receptor, under the control of the IRES. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Between receptor and eGFP, a stop with lox2272.

Wait, maybe the setup is that the ligand is fused to mCherry, but the ligand's ORF has a stop cassette in between. So upon Cre activity, the stop is removed, so the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is after the IRES, and the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor to be expressed, with eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is only expressed if the lox2272 is cut. Because the stop is in the lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop isn't removed, the receptor is expressed, but not eGFP. Or wait, the stop is in the lox2272 cassette. So if the stop is not removed, then the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, preventing eGFP expression. But if the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, and the eGFP is also expressed as part of the same mRNA via the IRES.

Wait, no, the eGFP is at the C-terminus. So the receptor is fused to eGFP. So the ORF is receptor-eGFP. Between the receptor and eGFP is the stop cassette. Oh! So the construct is: ligand (with stop cassette), IRES, receptor (with stop cassette and eGFP after? Or is the eGFP in frame with the receptor?)

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The vector has the ligand ORF at 5', fused to mCherry. Then, after the ligand, there's a stop cassette (loxP), then the IRES, then the receptor ORF. Then after the receptor, a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, no. The question says: "the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus." So the ligand is ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is receptor-eGFP. Then, between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop cassette (so perhaps the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed unless the stop is removed). Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette.

Wait, maybe it's arranged so that the ligand and mCherry are in a single ORF, but separated by a stop. So when the stop is removed, ligand and mCherry are co-expressed.

Similarly, the receptor and eGFP are in a single ORF, separated by a stop. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are expressed together.

So the vector is:

Ligand ORF - stop (loxP) - IRES - Receptor ORF - stop (lox2272) - eGFP.

Wait, but how is mCherry involved? Oh, I think I misread. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, meaning the ligand is in frame with mCherry. Then between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP cassette. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if the stop is in between, you can't have a fusion. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct arrangement is:

Ligand (with stop cassette), then IRES, then receptor (with stop cassette), then eGFP.

But the question says that the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP.

So, the vector is:

Ligand-mCherry, then a stop cassette (loxP), then IRES, then receptor-eGFP, then a stop cassette (lox2272).

Wait, no. The way the question is phrased, the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. So the ORF is ligand followed by mCherry, but between them is a stop in a loxP cassette. So the initial construct would produce a transcript that includes both ligand and mCherry, but the stop would prevent their co-expression unless the stop is cut.

Similarly, the receptor is at 3', fused to eGFP, with a stop in a lox2272 cassette between them.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the ligand is fused to mCherry, the ORF would have ligand followed by mCherry. So after the ligand ORF, you have a stop in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the ligand-mCherry is not expressed because the stop prevents translation beyond the ligand. Wait, no, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but with a stop in between.

This is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are used to prevent read-through. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But when Cre is present, it cuts the lox sites, removing the stops, allowing the downstream proteins to be expressed.

In the mouse model, when the Cre is expressed (from SOX10-Cre), it should cut the loxP and lox2272 stops, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as fusions with ligand and receptor, respectively.

But the problem is that in the mouse, after crossing, they don't see the green signal (eGFP) in the offspring.

So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship.

That would mean they're secreted and act on neighboring cells. But why would that stop eGFP expression? The Western blot showed that the proteins are expressed, so I don't think this is the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.

If it's stuck, then it wouldn't reach the cell surface, so wouldn't fluoresce. But then, why would the Western blot show it if it's stuck in the Golgi? Because the total proteins would include it, but if it's not properly trafficked, the blot might still detect it. But the question says the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, so perhaps the protein is expressed but not functional. But this doesn't directly explain why the eGFP is not expressed.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.

If the enhancer was missing, then the promoters wouldn't drive expression. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, so it should be expressed. The receptor is under the IRES, which is after the ligand. If the enhancer is missing, both might not be expressed. But in the Western blot, they saw signals, so this seems unlikely.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

If the ORF isn't in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But if the frame is off, the eGFP wouldn't be produced, so the Western blot wouldn't detect it. But the question says the Western blot detected the proteins, so this is less likely.

Wait, but the Western blot was after plasmid transfection into primary astrocyte culture. So in culture, the proteins were expressed, but in the mouse, they're not. So maybe in the mouse, the Cre isn't working as intended.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in neural crest cells. But the construct has loxP and lox2272 stops. SOX10-Cre would provide Cre, which can cut loxP sites but not lox2272.

So in the mouse, the ligand's stop is excised, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, which SOX10-Cre can't cut. So the receptor-eGFP remains under the stop, so the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, no eGFP.

So the reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, which one fits?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. No, that would affect expression in all cases.

Option B suggests the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. But why would Cre affect that?

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassette for the receptor-eGFP isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the construct for the receptor-eGFP has a stop in lox2272. SOX10-Cre only cuts loxP, not lox2272. So the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed.

So the correct reason is that the Cre can't remove the stop for the receptor-eGFP.

Looking at the options, none of the options directly state this. But looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Doesn't explain the lack of GFP.

Option B: receptor stuck in Golgi. Unlikely, as the blot would detect.

Option C: enhancer missing. Unlikely, since the blot showed expression.

Option D: not in frame. Unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. In the vector, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under the IRES, but requires the stop to be removed to be expressed.

Wait, the construct is: ligand (CBA-driven) with a stop cassette, then IRES, then receptor with another stop. So for the receptor to be expressed, its stop must be removed. But the stop is in lox2272, and SOX10-Cre only cuts loxP. So the stop isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, no eGFP.

But none of the options directly address the inability of Cre to excise the lox2272 stop. Wait, looking at the options again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. But that would mean that the eGFP isn't expressed, so the Western blot wouldn't show it. But the question says the Western blot detected the proteins. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the stop is lox2272, which is a different site, so the Cre can't cut it. So the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Hence, no eGFP.

But the options don't directly address that.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the receptor-eGFP is on the same transcript but after the stop, so without the stop being cut, the eGFP isn't translated. But since the vector is bicistronic, the IRES allows the receptor to be translated independently. So the stop after the receptor would only affect the eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is that the receptor is in frame with eGFP, but the stop is in between. So for the eGFP to be expressed, the stop must be removed. If the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the Cre can't cut the lox2272, so the eGFP remains unexpressed.

So which option matches that? It's not any of the options, but let's look again.

Wait, another angle: the eGFP is after the receptor, but the stop is in the lox2272. So the eGFP can't be expressed without cutting that stop. If the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But what if the issue is that the eGFP is under a different promoter or lacks its own start codon? No, the setup says it's fused to the C-terminus.

Alternatively, the eGFP is in a separate transcript, but that's not the case with bicistronic vectors.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the lox2272 site isn't recognized by the Cre used, so the stop isn't cut, and the eGFP isn't expressed. But the Western blot would still show the receptor if the stop was before it, but if the stop is after the receptor, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't.

But in the problem, the Western blot detected the proteins, so perhaps the proteins are expressed in the cells, but in the mouse model, they aren't.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is under a different regulatory element that's not active. Or perhaps in the mouse, the Cre isn't active, but the question says they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest-derived cells.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so each allele has the same setup. But when Cre is active, the loxP sites are cut, allowing the ligand to be expressed. The lox2272, which requires another recombinase, is not cut, so the receptor-eGFP remains under the stop.

So in the mouse, the ligand is expressed (so mCherry would show up in those cells), but the receptor-eGFP isn't, hence no green signal.

But the options don't have an option about Cre not cutting the lox2272.

Wait, what if the vector was designed with loxP in the ligand's stop, and lox2272 in the receptor's stop. Then, when Cre is introduced, only the ligand's stop is cut, but the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So looking at the options, none directly state this, but the correct reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 site, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, perhaps option D is the best fit. Because if the stop is left in, the eGFP isn't expressed. Or perhaps option D is about the frame. Alternatively, is the eGFP correctly in frame?

Wait, if the eGFP is in the same frame after the receptor, then it would be expressed as a fusion. If the stop is in the way, then eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't cut, which is due to the Cre not recognizing lox2272. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are used to excise the stop cassettes. If the vector uses loxP for the ligand's stop and lox2272 for the receptor's stop, then the Cre would only cut the loxP sites, excising the ligand's stop. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says that the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, which only cuts loxP. So the ligand's stop is excised, but the receptor's isn't. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't.

In that case, why is there no eGFP signal? Because the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele would have the same setup. So in each allele, the ligand's stop is excised, allowing ligand-mCherry expression, but the receptor's stop isn't, so receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

Thus, in the offspring, mCherry might be expressed, but eGFP isn't. But the question says they looked for eGFP and didn't find it.

But in the answer options, the only option that relates is D, but D is about frame. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in frame only if the stop is removed.

Wait, another possibility: the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor. So the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So when the stop is cut, the eGFP is expressed as a fusion to the receptor. If the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But if the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop isn't cut because Cre can't cut lox2272.

But looking at the options, none directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is under the control of the IRES, which requires the stop to be removed. But IRES allows for translation without a promoter, so once the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP would be expressed.

Another angle: the vector uses a bicistronic approach where the IRES drives the receptor expression. If the stop is not removed, the IRES may not function properly. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe in the vector, the ligand is expressed under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES, which is after the ligand. So the stop in the ligand doesn't affect the receptor's expression, but the stop in the receptor does.

But the stop in the receptor is in lox2272. If the Cre can't cut it, the receptor isn't expressed.

But again, none of the options directly address this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in the correct reading frame after the stop is removed. But that's option D. However, in the mouse, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed, which would match if the stop wasn't cut.

But I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the question states that the mouse was homozygous for the construct, and crossed to SOX10-Cre. The result is that the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the Cre should be active in neural crest cells, which would excise the loxP stops, allowing the ligand to be expressed, but not the lox2272 stops, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Therefore, in the offspring, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

But the options don't have this as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But why would that only happen in the mouse and not in the Western blot? Because the western was done in cell culture, perhaps the plasmid doesn't have the same stop cassettes. Or perhaps, in the mouse, the construct has issues.

Wait, maybe in the vector, the lox2272 isn't correctly placed, so the eGFP is not in frame. But the Western blot (in culture) shows the proteins are expressed. So maybe in culture, the eGFP is expressed, but in the mouse, it's not. Why?

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 isn't compatible with the Cre used. So the stop isn't cut, thus, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but without the stop being cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the presence of the stop would prevent that.

Hmm, maybe the answer is option D. But I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another thought: The vector is bicistronic, so the mRNA is single. The IRES allows for translation of the second ORF (receptor-eGFP). So if the stop after the receptor is present, the IRES can't function, so receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't either.

But why would the stop affect the IRES? Because the stop would prevent the ribosome from reading through to the IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand's ORF is terminated, and the IRES isn't reached. But with Cre, the stop is cut, allowing the IRES to function, leading to receptor-eGFP expression.

But in the mouse, the Cre can't cut the lox2272, so the stop remains. Therefore, the IRES isn't reached, so receptor isn't expressed. Thus, eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says the mouse is homozygous, so both alleles have this issue. So no eGFP.

So the reason is that the stop after the receptor isn't cut, so the IRES can't function. Which option is this?

Looking again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would prevent their expression. But the stop is the issue, not the frame.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But that would be a design flaw.

Alternatively, if the eGFP isn't in frame, it's not expressed. But that would have been a problem in all cases, including the Western blot. But the question says that the Western blot detected the proteins, so maybe the eGFP is expressed, but not correctly.

Wait, the Western blot after plasmid transfection shows the proteins. So in the cell culture, the stop cassettes are cut, leading to expression. But in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't active, but the question says they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest.

Wait, perhaps the mouse's Cre isn't active, so the stop isn't cut. But the problem states that the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES doesn't function in the mouse, perhaps due to species differences. But the mouse is a mammal, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is dependent on the stop being removed for function. So without the stop, the IRES can't drive translation of the receptor.

But this brings me back to the same point: if the stop isn't cut, the receptor isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. So I'm a bit stuck.

Perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the vector has loxP in the ligand's stop and lox2272 in the receptor's stop. SOX10-Cre can only cut loxP, so the ligand's stop is cut, but the receptor's isn't. Thus, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. So eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 stop.

But the options don't have this. So maybe the answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

If the eGFP is not in frame, then when the stop is cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. But in the Western blot after transfection, they saw the proteins, so the eGFP must have been expressed in culture. So maybe the plasmid doesn't have the stop in the same way as the mouse construct. Or perhaps in the mouse, the eGFP is not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D because the stop isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the vector uses loxP sites for both stops, but the question states that the first stop is loxP and the second is lox2272. So if the Cre can only cut loxP, then only the first stop is cut, allowing the ligand to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Thus, the correct answer would be that the Cre can't cut the lox2272. But none of the options state that.

Given the options, perhaps the best fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. But that would mean that the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But why would that prevent eGFP expression in the same cell? The fluorescence would be in other cells, but the question states that they don't see a green signal, implying the GFP isn't expressed in their own cells.

Wait, another angle: if the ligand and receptor are paracrine, then the ligand is secreted, but the receptor is on the cell surface. But the vector is for the same cell expressing both. But I'm not sure how that would prevent eGFP expression.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the information, the eGFP isn't expressed because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 stop. Since this isn't an option, I have to pick the closest option, which is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but in the vector, the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, so if the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the absence of eGFP implies that the stop remains, meaning the Cre didn't cut the lox2272.

But none of the options address this, so perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, since no green signal is observed, and the only possible reason from the options is that the eGFP isn't expressed. The stop remains, so the construct wasn't cut. Thus, the answer must be that the Cre can't cut the lox2272, but since this isn't an option, maybe option D is the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps option A is right, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the stop after the receptor is preventing eGFP from being expressed correctly.

But given the options, I'll have to choose the best fit. The most likely reason is that the stop isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Since the options don't have that, I think the intended answer is option D. Or perhaps option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option C, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: the IRES is used to initiate translation of the receptor. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says the Western blot after transfection shows the proteins, so the IRES must be working in culture.

Perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is not cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. But without the stop being cut, the eGFP isn't expressed, which would explain why it's not seen.

Thus, considering the options, I think the intended answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand-fused mCherry and a receptor-fused eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. Stop cassettes (loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor) prevent expression of the downstream proteins unless Cre recombinase is present to excise them. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which should express Cre in neural crest-derived cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the microscope.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop cassette.  
   - The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop cassette.  
   - SOX10-Cre should excise the loxP stop to express the ligand-mCherry but cannot excise the lox2272 stop, leaving the receptor-eGFP under the stop cassette.

2. **Expression in Culture vs. Mouse**:  
   - In primary astrocyte culture (Western blot), the proteins are expressed, indicating that the stop cassettes are excised in this setting.  
   - In the mouse, SOX10-Cre can excise the loxP stop but not the lox2272 stop, leaving the receptor-eGFP unexpressed.

3. **Critical Issue**:  
   - The absence of eGFP expression in the mouse is due to the inability of SOX10-Cre to excise the lox2272 stop cassette. This prevents the receptor-eGFP from being expressed.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **A) Paracrine relationship**: This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression in the same cells.  
   - **B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi**: This would not prevent expression entirely, as the Western blot detected proteins.  
   - **C) Missing enhancer**: The CBA promoter is strong, and the Western blot shows expression, making this unlikely.  
   - **D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame**: If the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed. However, this issue would have been observed in both culture and the mouse, not just the mouse.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the lox2272 stop cassette is not excised by SOX10-Cre, preventing eGFP expression. While none of the options explicitly address this, the closest match is **D**, as the lack of eGFP expression could result from a failure in proper translation due to the stop cassette remaining intact.

ANSWER: D

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the experiment involves a bicistronic vector with some specific constructs. The main issue is that when they look for a green signal under the microscope, they don't see it. So I need to figure out why.

Let me break down the setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one transcript. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream of it. 

Wait, I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to the translation of a second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA. So the ligand is translated first, then the receptor. 

But there are stop cassettes in between. The ligand ORF has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette after it, and the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272 after it. Oh, right, these stop cassettes prevent the expression of the downstream gene unless a Cre-recombinase is present to excise the stop. So the ligand is under CBA, which is constitutively active, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, but only after the stop is removed.

So the idea is that when Cre is expressed, it recombines the lox sites. LoxP is recognized by Cre, and lox2272 is recognized by another recombinase, but wait, the question says the lox2272 is between receptor and eGFP. Since they used SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, which is a transgenic line that expresses Cre under the SOX10 promoter. SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, like Schwann cells and melanocytes. So the Cre should be active in neural crest cells and their progeny.

But why isn't the eGFP showing up? Let's think about the expression.

The vector is a bicistronic construct, so when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed as separate proteins. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP.

They transfected primary astrocyte cultures and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, so presumably, the proteins are expressed and detected. But in the mouse model, they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate the Cre in neural crest-derived cells. So why no green signal (eGFP) in the offspring?

Wait, in the mouse, the construct is homozygous. So each allele has the same setup. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would recombine the lox sites. But in the vector, the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. So if the Cre is active, it would recombine loxP sites but not lox2272, since that's a different recombinase site. Oh wait, the lox2272 is a variant that requires a different Cre (maybe Cre/loxP is the main system, and lox2272 is for a different recombinase, perhaps like Dre or another). Wait, no, I think lox2272 is another site for Cre, but they have a different arrangement. Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a site that can only be cut by Cre when paired with another lox2272, whereas loxP can be cut by Cre when paired with any lox site. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, the vector uses loxP-stop in the ligand region and lox2272-stop in the receptor region. So when Cre is present, it can recombine loxP sites. But the lox2272 would require another recombinase, perhaps? Or maybe Cre can still recognize lox2272? I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Alternatively, maybe the setup is that the ligand's ORF is under CBA, so it's expressed regardless, but the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which may depend on the removal of the stop cassette. So if the stop isn't removed, the receptor won't be expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, the Cre would have to excise both stops. Wait, no, each gene has its own stop cassette. The ligand's ORF has a loxP-stop, and the receptor has lox2272-stop. So for the ligand to be expressed, the loxP needs to be cut, which Cre can do. Similarly, the receptor's lox2272 needs to be cut, but if the same Cre can't do that, then the receptor won't be expressed.

Wait, I think Cre uses loxP sites. Lox2272 is a mutant lox site that can only be cut when paired with another lox2272. Alternatively, perhaps Cre can't recombine lox2272, so only the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's stop remains.

So in the mouse, if the Cre is active in neural crest cells, the ligand's stop is excised, so ligand (with mCherry) is expressed. But the receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor isn't expressed, so the eGFP isn't either.

But wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, which has the loxP and lox2272 stops. When Cre is expressed, it will cut the loxP sites, but if the lox2272 isn't cut, the receptor won't be expressed.

So in the mouse, the ligand is expressed (so mCherry would be visible in those cells), but the receptor-eGFP is not expressed, so no green signal.

Wait, but the question says that the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre. So Cre is active in the neural crest cells. So why isn't the receptor expressed?

So the possible reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 site, meaning the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Hence, the eGFP isn't either.

Wait, but the options: let's look at the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would affect their expression, but if they're not in frame, maybe the eGFP isn't expressed correctly, but in that case, the Western blot wouldn't detect it either, right? But the question says the Western blot after plasmid transfection showed some signal, because the total proteins give a signal proportional to actin. So maybe the expression constructs work when transfected in cell culture, but not in the mouse. Maybe something about the expression in the mouse.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working as intended. The receptor is after the IRES. The IRES allows for internal initiation of translation, but maybe without the stop cassette being removed, the receptor isn't translated.

Wait, in the vector, the ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor with the stop. Wait no, the vector is ligand ORF at 5', then a stop in loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, then the stop in lox2272, then eGFP.

So the mRNA is ligand-stop (loxP) - IRES - receptor (lox2272-stop) - eGFP.

Wait, no, wait. The ligand is 5', then a stop (loxP) cassette, then IRES, then receptor, then another stop (lox2272) cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, no, I think the vector is arranged as ligand-ORF followed by a stop cassette, then IRES, then receptor-ORF followed by another stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, the problem says: "the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. [...] Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette."

So the structure is: ligand ORF (with stop after it in loxP), then mCherry. Then IRES, then receptor ORF, then stop in lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, no, I think the fusion is that the ligand's ORF is fused to mCherry. So it's ligand-mCherry, but with a stop after the ligand. Wait, maybe the ligand is first, then a stop (so the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the stop comes after). No, perhaps it's that the ligand is at the beginning, followed by a loxP stop cassette, then mCherry? Or perhaps it's that the ligand is cloned first, then a loxP stop, then the IRES, then the receptor, then another stop, then eGFP.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the vector.

The vector is bicistronic, so a single mRNA has two coding regions: the ligand and the receptor. The ligand is first, under CBA promoter, then an IRES, then the receptor, under the control of the IRES. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Between receptor and eGFP, a stop with lox2272.

Wait, maybe the setup is that the ligand is fused to mCherry, but the ligand's ORF has a stop cassette in between. So upon Cre activity, the stop is removed, so the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is after the IRES, and the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor to be expressed, with eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is only expressed if the lox2272 is cut. Because the stop is in the lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop isn't removed, the receptor is expressed, but not eGFP. Or wait, the stop is in the lox2272 cassette. So if the stop is not removed, then the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, preventing eGFP expression. But if the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, and the eGFP is also expressed as part of the same mRNA via the IRES.

Wait, no, the eGFP is at the C-terminus. So the receptor is fused to eGFP. So the ORF is receptor-eGFP. Between the receptor and eGFP is the stop cassette. Oh! So the construct is: ligand (with stop cassette), IRES, receptor (with stop cassette and eGFP after? Or is the eGFP in frame with the receptor?)

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The vector has the ligand ORF at 5', fused to mCherry. Then, after the ligand, there's a stop cassette (loxP), then the IRES, then the receptor ORF. Then after the receptor, a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, no. The question says: "the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus." So the ligand is ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is receptor-eGFP. Then, between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop cassette (so perhaps the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed unless the stop is removed). Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette.

Wait, maybe it's arranged so that the ligand and mCherry are in a single ORF, but separated by a stop. So when the stop is removed, ligand and mCherry are co-expressed.

Similarly, the receptor and eGFP are in a single ORF, separated by a stop. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are expressed together.

So the vector is:

Ligand ORF - stop (loxP) - IRES - Receptor ORF - stop (lox2272) - eGFP.

Wait, but how is mCherry involved? Oh, I think I misread. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, meaning the ligand is in frame with mCherry. Then between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP cassette. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if the stop is in between, you can't have a fusion. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct arrangement is:

Ligand (with stop cassette), then IRES, then receptor (with stop cassette), then eGFP.

But the question says that the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP.

So, the vector is:

Ligand-mCherry, then a stop cassette (loxP), then IRES, then receptor-eGFP, then a stop cassette (lox2272).

Wait, no. The way the question is phrased, the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. So the ORF is ligand followed by mCherry, but between them is a stop in a loxP cassette. So the initial construct would produce a transcript that includes both ligand and mCherry, but the stop would prevent their co-expression unless the stop is cut.

Similarly, the receptor is at 3', fused to eGFP, with a stop in a lox2272 cassette between them.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the ligand is fused to mCherry, the ORF would have ligand followed by mCherry. So after the ligand ORF, you have a stop in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the ligand-mCherry is not expressed because the stop prevents translation beyond the ligand. Wait, no, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but with a stop in between.

This is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are used to prevent read-through. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But when Cre is present, it cuts the lox sites, removing the stops, allowing the downstream proteins to be expressed.

In the mouse model, when the Cre is expressed (from SOX10-Cre), it should cut the loxP and lox2272 stops, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as fusions with ligand and receptor, respectively.

But the problem is that in the mouse, after crossing, they don't see the green signal (eGFP) in the offspring.

So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship.

That would mean they're secreted and act on neighboring cells. But why would that stop eGFP expression? The Western blot showed that the proteins are expressed, so I don't think this is the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.

If it's stuck, then it wouldn't reach the cell surface, so wouldn't fluoresce. But then, why would the Western blot show it if it's stuck in the Golgi? Because the total proteins would include it, but if it's not properly trafficked, the blot might still detect it. But the question says the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, so perhaps the protein is expressed but not functional. But this doesn't directly explain why the eGFP is not expressed.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.

If the enhancer was missing, then the promoters wouldn't drive expression. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, so it should be expressed. The receptor is under the IRES, which is after the ligand. If the enhancer is missing, both might not be expressed. But in the Western blot, they saw signals, so this seems unlikely.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

If the ORF isn't in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But if the frame is off, the eGFP wouldn't be produced, so the Western blot wouldn't detect it. But the question says the Western blot detected the proteins, so this is less likely.

Wait, but the Western blot was after plasmid transfection into primary astrocyte culture. So in culture, the proteins were expressed, but in the mouse, they're not. So maybe in the mouse, the Cre isn't working as intended.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in neural crest cells. But the construct has loxP and lox2272 stops. SOX10-Cre would provide Cre, which can cut loxP sites but not lox2272.

So in the mouse, the ligand's stop is excised, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, which SOX10-Cre can't cut. So the receptor-eGFP remains under the stop, so the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, no eGFP.

So the reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, which one fits?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. No, that would affect expression in all cases.

Option B suggests the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. But why would Cre affect that?

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassette for the receptor-eGFP isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the construct for the receptor-eGFP has a stop in lox2272. SOX10-Cre only cuts loxP, not lox2272. So the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed.

So the correct reason is that the Cre can't remove the stop for the receptor-eGFP.

Looking at the options, none of the options directly state this. But looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Doesn't explain the lack of GFP.

Option B: receptor stuck in Golgi. Unlikely, as the blot would detect.

Option C: enhancer missing. Unlikely, since the blot showed expression.

Option D: not in frame. Unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. In the vector, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under the IRES, but requires the stop to be removed to be expressed.

Wait, the construct is: ligand (CBA-driven) with a stop cassette, then IRES, then receptor with another stop. So for the receptor to be expressed, its stop must be removed. But the stop is in lox2272, and SOX10-Cre only cuts loxP. So the stop isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, no eGFP.

But none of the options directly address the inability of Cre to excise the lox2272 stop. Wait, looking at the options again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. But that would mean that the eGFP isn't expressed, so the Western blot wouldn't show it. But the question says the Western blot detected the proteins. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the stop is lox2272, which is a different site, so the Cre can't cut it. So the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Hence, no eGFP.

But the options don't directly address that.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the receptor-eGFP is on the same transcript but after the stop, so without the stop being cut, the eGFP isn't translated. But since the vector is bicistronic, the IRES allows the receptor to be translated independently. So the stop after the receptor would only affect the eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is that the receptor is in frame with eGFP, but the stop is in between. So for the eGFP to be expressed, the stop must be removed. If the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the Cre can't cut the lox2272, so the eGFP remains unexpressed.

So which option matches that? It's not any of the options, but let's look again.

Wait, another angle: the eGFP is after the receptor, but the stop is in the lox2272. So the eGFP can't be expressed without cutting that stop. If the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But what if the issue is that the eGFP is under a different promoter or lacks its own start codon? No, the setup says it's fused to the C-terminus.

Alternatively, the eGFP is in a separate transcript, but that's not the case with bicistronic vectors.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the lox2272 site isn't recognized by the Cre used, so the stop isn't cut, and the eGFP isn't expressed. But the Western blot would still show the receptor if the stop was before it, but if the stop is after the receptor, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't.

But in the problem, the Western blot detected the proteins, so perhaps the proteins are expressed in the cells, but in the mouse model, they aren't.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is under a different regulatory element that's not active. Or perhaps in the mouse, the Cre isn't active, but the question says they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest-derived cells.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so each allele has the same setup. But when Cre is active, the loxP sites are cut, allowing the ligand to be expressed. The lox2272, which requires another recombinase, is not cut, so the receptor-eGFP remains under the stop.

So in the mouse, the ligand is expressed (so mCherry would show up in those cells), but the receptor-eGFP isn't, hence no green signal.

But the options don't have an option about Cre not cutting the lox2272.

Wait, what if the vector was designed with loxP in the ligand's stop, and lox2272 in the receptor's stop. Then, when Cre is introduced, only the ligand's stop is cut, but the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So looking at the options, none directly state this, but the correct reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 site, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, perhaps option D is the best fit. Because if the stop is left in, the eGFP isn't expressed. Or perhaps option D is about the frame. Alternatively, is the eGFP correctly in frame?

Wait, if the eGFP is in the same frame after the receptor, then it would be expressed as a fusion. If the stop is in the way, then eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't cut, which is due to the Cre not recognizing lox2272. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are used to excise the stop cassettes. If the vector uses loxP for the ligand's stop and lox2272 for the receptor's stop, then the Cre would only cut the loxP sites, excising the ligand's stop. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says that the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, which only cuts loxP. So the ligand's stop is excised, but the receptor's isn't. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't.

In that case, why is there no eGFP signal? Because the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele would have the same setup. So in each allele, the ligand's stop is excised, allowing ligand-mCherry expression, but the receptor's stop isn't, so receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

Thus, in the offspring, mCherry might be expressed, but eGFP isn't. But the question says they looked for eGFP and didn't find it.

But in the answer options, the only option that relates is D, but D is about frame. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in frame only if the stop is removed.

Wait, another possibility: the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor. So the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So when the stop is cut, the eGFP is expressed as a fusion to the receptor. If the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But if the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop isn't cut because Cre can't cut lox2272.

But looking at the options, none directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is under the control of the IRES, which requires the stop to be removed. But IRES allows for translation without a promoter, so once the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP would be expressed.

Another angle: the vector uses a bicistronic approach where the IRES drives the receptor expression. If the stop is not removed, the IRES may not function properly. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe in the vector, the ligand is expressed under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES, which is after the ligand. So the stop in the ligand doesn't affect the receptor's expression, but the stop in the receptor does.

But the stop in the receptor is in lox2272. If the Cre can't cut it, the receptor isn't expressed.

But again, none of the options directly address this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in the correct reading frame after the stop is removed. But that's option D. However, in the mouse, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed, which would match if the stop wasn't cut.

But I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the question states that the mouse was homozygous for the construct, and crossed to SOX10-Cre. The result is that the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the Cre should be active in neural crest cells, which would excise the loxP stops, allowing the ligand to be expressed, but not the lox2272 stops, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Therefore, in the offspring, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

But the options don't have this as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But why would that only happen in the mouse and not in the Western blot? Because the western was done in cell culture, perhaps the plasmid doesn't have the same stop cassettes. Or perhaps, in the mouse, the construct has issues.

Wait, maybe in the vector, the lox2272 isn't correctly placed, so the eGFP is not in frame. But the Western blot (in culture) shows the proteins are expressed. So maybe in culture, the eGFP is expressed, but in the mouse, it's not. Why?

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 isn't compatible with the Cre used. So the stop isn't cut, thus, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but without the stop being cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the presence of the stop would prevent that.

Hmm, maybe the answer is option D. But I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another thought: The vector is bicistronic, so the mRNA is single. The IRES allows for translation of the second ORF (receptor-eGFP). So if the stop after the receptor is present, the IRES can't function, so receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't either.

But why would the stop affect the IRES? Because the stop would prevent the ribosome from reading through to the IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand's ORF is terminated, and the IRES isn't reached. But with Cre, the stop is cut, allowing the IRES to function, leading to receptor-eGFP expression.

But in the mouse, the Cre can't cut the lox2272, so the stop remains. Therefore, the IRES isn't reached, so receptor isn't expressed. Thus, eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says the mouse is homozygous, so both alleles have this issue. So no eGFP.

So the reason is that the stop after the receptor isn't cut, so the IRES can't function. Which option is this?

Looking again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would prevent their expression. But the stop is the issue, not the frame.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But that would be a design flaw.

Alternatively, if the eGFP isn't in frame, it's not expressed. But that would have been a problem in all cases, including the Western blot. But the question says that the Western blot detected the proteins, so maybe the eGFP is expressed, but not correctly.

Wait, the Western blot after plasmid transfection shows the proteins. So in the cell culture, the stop cassettes are cut, leading to expression. But in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't active, but the question says they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest.

Wait, perhaps the mouse's Cre isn't active, so the stop isn't cut. But the problem states that the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES doesn't function in the mouse, perhaps due to species differences. But the mouse is a mammal, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is dependent on the stop being removed for function. So without the stop, the IRES can't drive translation of the receptor.

But this brings me back to the same point: if the stop isn't cut, the receptor isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. So I'm a bit stuck.

Perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the vector has loxP in the ligand's stop and lox2272 in the receptor's stop. SOX10-Cre can only cut loxP, so the ligand's stop is cut, but the receptor's isn't. Thus, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. So eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 stop.

But the options don't have this. So maybe the answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

If the eGFP is not in frame, then when the stop is cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. But in the Western blot after transfection, they saw the proteins, so the eGFP must have been expressed in culture. So maybe the plasmid doesn't have the stop in the same way as the mouse construct. Or perhaps in the mouse, the eGFP is not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D because the stop isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the vector uses loxP sites for both stops, but the question states that the first stop is loxP and the second is lox2272. So if the Cre can only cut loxP, then only the first stop is cut, allowing the ligand to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Thus, the correct answer would be that the Cre can't cut the lox2272. But none of the options state that.

Given the options, perhaps the best fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. But that would mean that the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But why would that prevent eGFP expression in the same cell? The fluorescence would be in other cells, but the question states that they don't see a green signal, implying the GFP isn't expressed in their own cells.

Wait, another angle: if the ligand and receptor are paracrine, then the ligand is secreted, but the receptor is on the cell surface. But the vector is for the same cell expressing both. But I'm not sure how that would prevent eGFP expression.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the information, the eGFP isn't expressed because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 stop. Since this isn't an option, I have to pick the closest option, which is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but in the vector, the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, so if the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the absence of eGFP implies that the stop remains, meaning the Cre didn't cut the lox2272.

But none of the options address this, so perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, since no green signal is observed, and the only possible reason from the options is that the eGFP isn't expressed. The stop remains, so the construct wasn't cut. Thus, the answer must be that the Cre can't cut the lox2272, but since this isn't an option, maybe option D is the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps option A is right, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the stop after the receptor is preventing eGFP from being expressed correctly.

But given the options, I'll have to choose the best fit. The most likely reason is that the stop isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Since the options don't have that, I think the intended answer is option D. Or perhaps option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option C, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: the IRES is used to initiate translation of the receptor. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says the Western blot after transfection shows the proteins, so the IRES must be working in culture.

Perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is not cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. But without the stop being cut, the eGFP isn't expressed, which would explain why it's not seen.

Thus, considering the options, I think the intended answer is option D.


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand-fused mCherry and a receptor-fused eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. Stop cassettes (loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor) prevent expression of the downstream proteins unless Cre recombinase is present to excise them. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which should express Cre in neural crest-derived cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the microscope.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop cassette.  
   - The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop cassette.  
   - SOX10-Cre should excise the loxP stop to express the ligand-mCherry but cannot excise the lox2272 stop, leaving the receptor-eGFP under the stop cassette.

2. **Expression in Culture vs. Mouse**:  
   - In primary astrocyte culture (Western blot), the proteins are expressed, indicating that the stop cassettes are excised in this setting.  
   - In the mouse, SOX10-Cre can excise the loxP stop but not the lox2272 stop, leaving the receptor-eGFP unexpressed.

3. **Critical Issue**:  
   - The absence of eGFP expression in the mouse is due to the inability of SOX10-Cre to excise the lox2272 stop cassette. This prevents the receptor-eGFP from being expressed.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **A) Paracrine relationship**: This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression in the same cells.  
   - **B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi**: This would not prevent expression entirely, as the Western blot detected proteins.  
   - **C) Missing enhancer**: The CBA promoter is strong, and the Western blot shows expression, making this unlikely.  
   - **D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame**: If the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed. However, this issue would have been observed in both culture and the mouse, not just the mouse.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the lox2272 stop cassette is not excised by SOX10-Cre, preventing eGFP expression. While none of the options explicitly address this, the closest match is **D**, as the lack of eGFP expression could result from a failure in proper translation due to the stop cassette remaining intact.
