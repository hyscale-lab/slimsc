Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and all that stuff. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Hmm, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The dissociation steps are:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3 = 1.8e-12. Oh right, so each step is much weaker than the previous.

Now, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When dissolved, it should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So the K+ is a spectator ion, but the H2PO4^- is important because it can act as an acid or a base.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it should give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Na+ is also a spectator, so the HPO4^2- is the key here.

Wait a second, so we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. That must form a buffer solution. Oh yeah, a buffer is a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, which resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. In this case, H2PO4^- is the weak acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base.

Right, so this is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. To find the concentration of PO4^3-, I might need to consider the equilibrium.

Wait, no, wait. Because the question is about PO4^3-, which would come from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Let me think. HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donate H+ to become PO4^3-) or as a base (accept H+ to become H2PO4^-). The Ka for the third dissociation is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, which is really small. So the concentration of PO4^3- should be really low.

But wait, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So I'm in a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- for the dominant equilibrium (Ka2), and then the HPO4^2- will also dissociate a little into PO4^3- (Ka3), but since Ka3 is so much smaller, the PO4^3- concentration is going to be minimal.

So perhaps I should first calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, then find the [PO4^3-] from the HPO4^2- dissociation.

Let me break it down. First, find the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007338 mol.

Since it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-, the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007338 mol in 0.2 L. So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007338 / 0.2 = 0.03669 M.

Wait, wait. Wait—no, because the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So yes, that's correct.

Now, Na2HPO4·2H2O: the mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005616 mol.

This salt dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005616 / 0.2 = 0.02808 M.

So, in the solution, we have:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M

Now, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, but the question is about PO4^3-.

Wait, but another approach: since HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+, and the Ka3 is very small, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. So perhaps I can calculate it using the Ka3 expression.

The Ka3 is for HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

So, the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

But I don't know [H+], but maybe I can find it from the buffer solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So first, use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer to find pH, which will give me [H+].

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the context of buffer solutions, the acid is the protonated form and the base is the deprotonated form.

So when considering the dissociation H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So the pKa for this step is pKa2, which is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the values:

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03669 M.

So the ratio is 0.02808 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.766.

Taking log(0.766) → Let me compute that. Log(0.7) is about -0.155, log(0.766) is approximately -0.115. Hmm, maybe more accurately: 10^(-0.115) is about 0.77, so log(0.766) is around -0.115. Or perhaps better to compute using calculator steps.

Alternatively, using precise calculation:

0.02808 / 0.03669 = 0.766.

ln(0.766) is about -0.266. Wait no, that's natural log. To find log base 10:

log(0.766) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ pKa2 + (-0.115) → pKa2 is 7.208, so pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.115 ≈ 7.093.

So [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 10^(-7.093) is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093). 10^(-0.093) is approximately 0.823. So 1e-7 * 0.823 is 8.23e-8, yes.

Now, back to the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M,

[H+] = 8.23e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.23e-8)

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 ≈ 5.054e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So 5.054e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.054 / 8.23) * 1e-6 → 5.054 /8.23 ≈ 0.614 → 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7

B) 5.48e-7

C) 2.81e-7

D) 3.97e-7

Hmm, 6.14e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7). But maybe I made a calculation mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's recompute [H+]. The Henderson-Hasselbalch gave pH ≈7.093, so [H+] is 10^-7.093.

Let me compute 10^(-7.093) more accurately. 10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.093) is about 0.824.

Wait, 10^(-0.093):

Let me compute it more accurately. Let's think of 10^x where x is -0.093.

We know that 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, and 10^(-0.093) would be a bit higher. Let's use a calculator approach.

Compute ln(0.824) is about -0.193, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, use the Taylor series for log(1+x) or use natural logs.

But maybe I can compute 10^(-0.093) as follows.

Let me think: 10^0.093 = ?

Because 10^0.1 is about 1.2589. 0.093 is 0.007 less than 0.1.

So 10^0.093 ≈ 1.2589 / 10^(0.007). 10^0.007 is approx 1.016, so 1.2589 / 1.016 ≈ 1.238.

So 10^(-0.093) ≈ 1/1.238 ≈ 0.8076.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8076 ≈ 8.076e-8 M.

Wait, that's a bit lower than my initial estimate. Let me recalculate [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.076e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.054e-14.

Denominator: 8.076e-8.

So 5.054e-14 / 8.076e-8 = (5.054 / 8.076) * 1e-6.

5.054 /8.076 ≈ 0.626.

0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.26e-7 M. Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7.

That's very close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another thought: when calculating the moles, perhaps the solution is more concentrated than I thought. Let me double-check the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = ?

136.09 is approximately 136.1.

1.00 / 136.1 ≈ 0.007338 mol, yes.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005616 mol, correct.

So in 0.2 L, concentrations are 0.03669 M and 0.02808 M, respectively.

Wait, another point: when calculating pH, maybe I should have used a more accurate value for log(0.766).

Let me compute log(0.766) more precisely.

We know that log(0.766) = log(7.66e-1) = log(7.66) -1.

Log(7.66) is between log(7)=0.8451 and log(8)=0.9031. Let me compute it more accurately.

7.66 = 7 + 0.66.

Use the linear approximation between 7 and 8.

Alternatively, use a calculator-like approach.

Wait, 10^0.8 is 6.3096.

10^0.85 is about 7.0794.

10^0.86 is about 7.245.

10^0.87 is about 7.41.

10^0.88 is 7.585.

10^0.885 is approximately 7.66?

Wait, 10^0.88 is 7.585, so to reach 7.66, it's about 0.88 + (7.66-7.585)/(7.68-7.585) → but perhaps better to use a calculator.

Alternatively, using the natural logarithm:

We can use the formula log(x) = ln(x)/ln(10).

So ln(0.766) = ln(1 - 0.234) ≈ -0.234 - (0.234)^2/2 - (0.234)^3/3 ≈ -0.234 - 0.0273 - 0.0041 ≈ -0.2654.

So log(0.766) = (-0.2654)/(2.3026) ≈ -0.1152.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.1152 = 7.0928.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0928) ≈ 8.14e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute 10^(-7.0928):

Compute 10^(-7) = 1e-7.

10^(-0.0928) is 10^(-0.0928) ≈ 0.825.

So 8.25e-8.

Wait, 0.825e-7 is 8.25e-8. So [H+] ≈ 8.25e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.25e-8).

Compute numerator again: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

Denominator: 8.25e-8.

So 5.0544e-14 / 8.25e-8 = (5.0544 /8.25) * 1e-6.

5.0544 /8.25 ≈ 0.6123.

So 0.6123e-6 = 6.123e-7 M.

Hmm, which is about 6.12e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or something else? Oh, but I don't think that's expected here. It's probably an ideal solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about which species are present. Wait, another approach: the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.

But the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are known, so perhaps I can use the third dissociation to find PO4^3-.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is more complicated because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- contribute to the H+ concentration.

Wait, but the buffer solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is the main contributor to H+.

But perhaps the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the [H+] I calculated from the buffer is 8.25e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+]

Which is (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.25e-8.

So let me compute that more accurately.

1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = (1.8 * 0.02808) * 1e-12 = 0.050544e-12 = 5.0544e-14.

Divide by 8.25e-8:

5.0544e-14 / 8.25e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.25) * 1e-6.

5.0544 ÷ 8.25 → let's compute:

8.25 * 0.612 = 5.0505.

So 0.612 * 8.25 = 5.0505.

So 5.0544 is 5.0544 → 5.0544 -5.0505 = 0.0039.

So 0.0039 /8.25 ≈ 0.0004727.

So total is 0.612 + 0.0004727 ≈ 0.61247 → about 0.6125.

So 0.6125e-6 → 6.125e-7 M.

Which is ~6.125e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2000 liters, so more precise calculations might be needed.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 = approx 0.0073379 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 1/177.99 = approx 0.005616 mol.

So in 0.2000 L, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0073379 / 0.2 = 0.0366895 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005616 / 0.2 = 0.02808 M.

So that part is correct.

Now, the buffer equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076, so pKa2 is ~7.2076.

So ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02808 / 0.0366895 ≈ 0.766.

log(0.766) ≈ -0.1152. So pH = 7.2076 - 0.1152 ≈7.0924.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0924) ≈8.16e-8 M.

Wait, 10^(-7.0924) → 10^(-7) is 1e-7, and 10^(-0.0924) is about 0.816. So [H+] is 8.16e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.16e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

Denominator: 8.16e-8.

So 5.0544e-14 /8.16e-8 = (5.0544/8.16) *1e-6.

5.0544 ÷8.16 → let me compute that.

8.16 × 0.619 = ?

8 ×0.619=4.952, 0.16×0.619≈0.099. So total ≈5.051.

So 0.619 gives 5.051, which is very close to 5.0544.

So 5.0544/8.16 ≈0.619.

Thus, [PO4^3-] ≈0.619e-6 →6.19e-7 M.

Hmm, 6.19e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7) but a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the [H+] calculation.

Using [H+] = 8.16e-8 M.

Compute [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.16e-8.

1.8e-12 *0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

5.0544e-14 / 8.16e-8 = 5.0544 /8.16 * 1e-6.

5.0544 ÷8.16 = exactly?

Compute 8.16 ×0.619 = 5.05464.

Because 8 ×0.619=4.952, 0.16×0.619=0.09904 → total 5.05104.

Wait, 0.619 ×8.16 = 0.619 *8 =4.952, 0.619 *0.16 =0.09904. Sum: 4.952 +0.09904=5.05104.

But the numerator is 5.0544, which is 5.0544-5.05104=0.00336 more.

So 0.00336 /8.16 = approx 0.0004118.

So 0.619 + 0.0004118 ≈0.6194.

So 0.6194e-6 =6.194e-7 M.

So approximately 6.19e-7, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7.

But perhaps a slight miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the student is supposed to consider that the solution is a buffer and that the main contribution to PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the solution is a buffer and if the ratio affects the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02808 M, and the Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the PO4^3- concentration can be approximated as sqrt( (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])) ), assuming that [H+] is approximately sqrt(Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/ [HPO4^2-] ) ) but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Wait, the expression is [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But [H+] is determined by the buffer solution. So the earlier approach holds.

Wait, but let me think if the buffer actually affects the [H+] in a way that when HPO4^2- is present, the [H+] is lower, thus making [PO4^3-] higher.

Wait, no, because the buffer solution's [H+] is determined by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider that the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and the presence of HPO4^2- may have some effect on the [H+], but in reality, the buffer is the main determinant.

I think the initial approach is correct. So the [PO4^3-] should be around 6.19e-7, close to option A.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the equilibrium involving HPO₄²⁻. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation reactions are:

1. **KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻**  
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007338 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.007338}{0.2} \approx 0.03669 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻**  
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005616 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.005616}{0.2} \approx 0.02808 \, \text{M} \).

The solution is a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the equilibrium governed by \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{pH} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) + \log \left( \frac{0.02808}{0.03669} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.208 - 0.115 \approx 7.093
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is then:

\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.16 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻ using the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻:

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

Substituting the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02808)}{8.16 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02808) \approx 5.054 \times 10^{-14}.
\]

Then, divide by the denominator:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.054 \times 10^{-14}}{8.16 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.19 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

This value is very close to option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)). Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is:

**Answer: A**
