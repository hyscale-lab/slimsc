Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that allows us to include higher-dimensional operators beyond the Standard Model in a systematic way. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetries involved here.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, let me think about each symmetry.

Lorentz symmetry: This includes all the transformations that mix space and time, like rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. So for any operator in SMEFT to be part of a consistent theory, they must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, the theory would predict non-covariant effects, which are not observed as far as I know. So I think Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Poincare symmetry: That's a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations (like shifting space and time). So Poincare includes the idea that the laws of physics are the same everywhere and in every frame. But wait, SMEFT operators are constructed with higher-dimensional terms. For example, dimension 6 operators would have two additional derivatives, say. But do these operators respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes momentum conservation. If an operator doesn't respect momentum conservation, like if it's non-local, that would be a problem. But SMEFT is a local effective theory, right? So all operators must be local. So operators in SMEFT should respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2 (Poincare) must also be respected. But wait, let me think again. Are all the SMEFT operators automatically Poincare invariant?

Alternatively, I remember that SMEFT is constructed in a way that ensures that the theory respects the Poincare algebra. Because the operators are local and constructed from the SM fields, which themselves respect Poincare symmetry. So yes, Poincare symmetry (option 2) must be respected.

Wait, but I think that in the SMEFT setup, the operators are written in a way that's invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry, but what about Poincare? Oh, wait, Poincare includes translations, which are part of the symmetry. So if the operators are built from fields that transform correctly, including under translations, then the operators would be Poincare invariant. So option 2 is a must.

So that means options 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincare) are required. Now, what about the others?

CP symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. Many interactions in the SM respect CP symmetry, but there are some that don't, like in the CKM matrix leading to CP violation in the Standard Model. But in SMEFT, the operators are written to be CP even or odd? Wait, the operators are constructed to be renormalizable-like, but the question is whether all operators must respect CP symmetry. I don't think so. Because in the SM, some terms can violate CP, and in SMEFT, you can have operators that violate CP as well. For example, operators like (H† H)^2 might have a certain CP property, but others could have different behaviors. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 (CP) is not a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. This is a big one. I remember that in quantum field theory, all interactions must respect CPT symmetry. Because without it, you get into trouble with things like unitarity and causality. So any operator in a valid QFT must transform correctly under CPT. So in SMEFT, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is a must.

So putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a second—Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if the operators respect Poincare symmetry, they automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is, do we have to list Lorentz and Poincare separately?

Wait, the options are 1. Lorentz, 2. Poincare. So if Poincare is a superset, then any operator respecting Poincare would automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So the operators must respect all of the symmetries that are part of the Poincare group (which includes Lorentz and translations), and separately, they must respect CPT.

Wait, but wait—does the SMEFT include all Poincare symmetries? Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which is part of Poincare. So for the operators, they must respect Lorentz (so 1 is correct) and Poincare (so 2 is correct). But wait, isn't Poincare a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz? So if an operator respects Poincare, it already respects Lorentz. So the question is whether all operators must respect both 1 and 2, or just 2.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that Poincare includes translations, so it's more than just Lorentz. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it could mean that it doesn't respect Lorentz or translations. But in SMEFT, all operators are written in a way that they're local, so translation invariance is maintained. So operators must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, implying they respect Poincare.

So the question is, which of the four symmetries must be respected by all operators. The options are 1,2,3,4.

I think the correct answer includes 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but earlier I thought that option 2 (Poincare) includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So perhaps the question is whether operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or one implies the other.

Wait, the options are 1 and 2 as separate. So if I answer that both must be respected, that would be correct only if the operators must respect both. But if Poincare implies Lorentz, then it's redundant. So perhaps in the SMEFT framework, operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which covers Lorentz as a subset. So if the question is which must be respected, the correct answer would include Poincare (2), and also CPT (4), but not Lorentz (1) as a separate requirement because it's already included in Poincare.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me look for another angle. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Additionally, the theory is also Poincare-invariant, so operators must respect Poincare. And because it's a quantum field theory, operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So the operators must respect 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But wait, the options don't have an option with 1,2,4. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

Oh, option C is 1,2,4. So that would mean Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So is that correct?

But wait, Poincare includes Lorentz, so if you require Poincare, Lorentz is already required. So if the answer is 1,2,4, then that's correct.

Wait, but in SMEFT, you can't have operators that violate Lorentz, but you can have operators that violate Poincare? No, because SMEFT is a Poincare-invariant theory. So the operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz.

So the correct answer would include 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But wait, the question is which of the following must be respected.

Wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the operators must be invariant under Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So the correct answer would be 1,2,4. So option C.

Wait, but wait again. I'm getting a bit confused because I thought that Poincare includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz. So why is Lorentz listed as a separate option?

So perhaps the answer includes both 1 and 2. But that would be redundant because if you have 2, you have 1. But perhaps the question is testing whether you know that Poincare is a bigger symmetry, so operators must respect both?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2: So Lorentz and Poincare.

B) 3,4: CP and CPT.

C) 1,2,4: Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

D) 1,3,4: Lorentz, CP, CPT.

I think that SMEFT operators must be Poincare-invariant, which includes Lorentz and translation. So they must respect Poincare, which is option 2. Also, they must respect CPT, which is option 4. But do they have to respect Lorentz independently?

Wait, no, because if an operator respects Poincare, it necessarily respects Lorentz. So perhaps the correct answer is 2 (Poincare) and 4 (CPT), but that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

C) 1,2,4: So that would imply Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

So if Poincare implies Lorentz, then including 1 and 2 in the answer would be correct because both are required. But actually, if 2 is included, 1 isn't an additional requirement. So perhaps the correct answer is C) 1,2,4.

Alternatively, maybe the question is structured so that Lorentz is a separate condition, and Poincare is another. So the operators must respect both.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what the SMEFT framework dictates. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 must be respected. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. So SMEFT operators must respect both.

But SMEFT is a local effective theory, so it's automatically translation-invariant. So operators respect translation symmetry, which is part of Poincare. So if SMEFT respects Poincare, then all operators respect Poincare symmetry.

So, the question is whether operators must respect Lorentz symmetry in addition to Poincare. But since Poincare includes Lorentz, perhaps the correct answer includes both, but that's a bit redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the question treats Lorentz and Poincare as separate.

But in any case, the right answer must include 1 and 2, because the operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory and thus must respect Lorentz. Additionally, they must be Poincare-invariant, so 2 is a must. Plus, CPT is a must because it's a symmetry in QFT.

So that would make the answer C) 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another approach: Which symmetries are part of the Standard Model that SMEFT must respect?

The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant, gauge-invariant, and CPT-invariant theory. SMEFT is an effective theory built from the SM fields and respects the same symmetries. So operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3).

So that would make option C) the correct answer.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a Lorentz-invariant and Poincaré-invariant effective theory constructed from the Standard Model (SM) fields and higher-dimensional operators. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry includes transformations like rotations and boosts, ensuring the theory is consistent under changes of reference frames. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a local effective theory, it automatically respects translation symmetry, and thus all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. While Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincaré symmetry, both are explicitly listed in the question, so they are treated as separate requirements.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). While the Standard Model respects CP symmetry in most cases, there are exceptions (e.g., CP violation in the CKM matrix). SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as CP violation can arise in SMEFT through specific operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. This is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, ensuring unitarity and causality. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1, 2, 4
