Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle and figuring out the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle theta, which is 30 degrees. Also, I need to determine the form of the function f, which depends on lambda and theta.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they radiate energy, and this is related to antenna radiation or dipole radiation. The power radiated in such cases depends on the angle and the wavelength. 

Wait, the problem says the charge distribution is spheroid, so it's not a perfect dipole, but maybe it's similar to an oscillating dipole in terms of radiation. Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern has a certain dependence on the angle. The maximum power is usually along the equator (perpendicular to the dipole), but wait no, wait. Wait a dipole's radiation is strongest in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis. So if the dipole is along the z-axis, maximum radiation is at theta = 90 degrees, right? The power drops off as you go towards the poles (theta = 0 and 180). 

But wait, the problem states that the charge distribution is spheroid. Hmm, a spheroid is like a slightly flattened sphere, so maybe it's an oscillating dipole in a more symmetric setup. But regardless, maybe the radiation pattern is similar to a dipole's in terms of angular dependence.

The radiated power per unit solid angle is given by a function f(lambda, theta). The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees. Also, figure out the form of f, whether it's lambda^-3, lambda^-4, etc.

Wait, I think the radiated power in the far field (radiation zone) depends on the Fourier transform of the current distribution. The power is proportional to the square of the field, which for a dipole varies as (sinθ)^2 over r^2. So the intensity, which is the power per unit area, is proportional to (sinθ)^2. But wait, when considering per unit solid angle, which is dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ, the power per unit solid angle would be (sinθ)^2 divided by (4π) or something like that. Wait, let me think again.

The intensity (power per unit area) for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2 / r^2. But when you consider the power per unit solid angle, you integrate over a surface area element. The area element is r² sinθ dθ dφ. So the power per unit solid angle would be intensity divided by (r² sinθ dθ dφ) per unit solid angle. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity multiplied by the area element per solid angle. Since the solid angle is dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ, the intensity is the power per area, so the power per solid angle is intensity * (dA / dΩ) where dA is the area element. But dA for a sphere is r² sinθ dθ dφ, so dA/dΩ is r². But in the far field, the intensity usually goes as 1/r². So the power per solid angle would be (intensity) * (r²) = (1/r^2) * r² = a constant. Hmm, that can't be right because I remember that the total power radiated is the integral of intensity over all solid angles.

Wait another approach. The power radiated is given by the Poynting vector. For an oscillating dipole, the Poynting vector S is proportional to (d^2 p/dt^2) * (something) and the fields fall off as 1/r. The intensity (S) is the power per unit area, which is proportional to (sinθ)^2 / r^2. So the power per unit solid angle would be S divided by the area per solid angle, which is r² sinθ dθ dφ. Wait, not quite. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The power per unit solid angle (the radiated power per unit solid angle) is the intensity multiplied by the area element per solid angle. The area element is r² sinθ dθ dφ, and the solid angle is sinθ dθ dφ. So the area element divided by solid angle is r². So the power per unit solid angle is S * r². But S is proportional to 1/r², so S * r² is a constant, independent of r. So for the far field, the power per unit solid angle is a constant, meaning it's the same in all directions. But that can't be right because the intensity varies with angle.

Wait, so maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think in terms of the radiation pattern. The power per unit solid angle is the intensity normalized by the maximum intensity. Or perhaps the function f tells us how the power varies with angle and wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is the radiation pattern, which depends on the angle. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and goes as sin^2(theta). So the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta). But the problem states that the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So wait, when you have the intensity (power per unit area), and the area per solid angle is r² sin theta d theta d phi, which is just r² times the solid angle. But the power per unit solid angle would be the intensity multiplied by the area per solid angle. But the intensity is proportional to (1/r²) * sin^2(theta). So, the power per solid angle is (1/r² sin^2(theta)) * r² sin(theta) d theta d phi / (sin theta d theta d phi) ? Wait, no, that seems off. Maybe I should think in terms of the radiated power.

Wait, the total power radiated is the integral over all solid angles of the power per solid angle. So, if the function f is the power per solid angle, then integrating f over all solid angles (4π steradians) should give the total power. So the function f is the intensity normalized by the maximum intensity, perhaps. For the dipole, the maximum is at theta=90 degrees, which is sin^2(theta)=1, so the maximum is 1. Then, the function f would be proportional to sin^2(theta). So at theta=30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin^2=0.25. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power is 0.25, which is 1/4.

But wait, the question says the maximum power is A. So at theta=30 degrees, the fraction would be (sin^2(30°)) / (sin^2(90°)) ) = (0.25)/(1) = 0.25, or 25% of A. So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, about the dependence on lambda. The radiated power, I think, depends on the square of the acceleration of the charge, and for oscillating charges, the power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. Wait, wait. Let me think about the dipole radiation formula.

The power radiated by an accelerating charge (like in an antenna) is given by Poynting's theorem. The Poynting vector S is proportional to (d^2 p/dt^2)^2 / r^2, where p is the dipole moment. The time variation of p depends on the frequency, which relates to the wavelength. So for a sinusoidal oscillation, p varies as cos(omega t). The second derivative d^2p/dt^2 would be proportional to -omega^2 p_0 cos(omega t), so when squared, it's proportional to omega^4 p_0^2.

So, S is proportional to omega^4 / r^2. But omega is 2π c / lambda, so omega^4 is (2π c)^4 / lambda^4. So S is proportional to 1/lambda^4. 

Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. Earlier, we found that for a dipole, the power per solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta), and the total power is proportional to 1/lambda^4. So the function f would be (some constant) times (sin^2(theta)) / lambda^4.

Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f would be proportional to (sin^2(theta)) * (1/lambda^4). So, if the maximum power is A, then A would be the maximum of f. So A would be f(theta=90°) = (1) * (1/lambda^4) multiplied by some constants. So the function f is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Putting it all together, at theta=30 degrees, the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is lambda^-4. Looking at the options, option C is 1/4, lambda^-4. So the answer should be C.

To analyze the problem, we consider an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), depends on the wavelength \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\) relative to the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence**:  
   For an oscillating charge distribution, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\). This is a characteristic feature of dipole-like radiation. The maximum power is radiated at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \(\sin^2(90^\circ) = 1\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \( 1/4 \).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength**:  
   The radiated power is inversely proportional to \(\lambda^4\). This arises from the fact that the power radiated by an oscillating charge depends on the fourth power of the angular frequency \(\omega\), and \(\omega \propto 1/\lambda\). Therefore, the function \( f \) has the form \( f \propto \lambda^{-4} \).

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   From the above analysis, the fraction of the maximum power at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \( 1/4 \), and the form of \( f \) is \(\lambda^{-4}\). This matches option **C**.

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \( 1/4 \), and the function \( f \) has the form \(\lambda^{-4}\).
