Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says that there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time tr is v. We're to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is after tr.

Wait, so the charge was at a certain point at time tr, and the field it generates propagates to the point r. So the potentials at r at time t depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time tr. Right, because electromagnetic fields propagate at speed c, so the time delay is the time it takes for the field to travel from the charge's position at tr to r.

I remember that the scalar potential and vector potential are given by retarded potentials. So I should probably use the retarded time concept here.

Scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) times something, integrated over the charge's history, but since it's a point charge, maybe it's just the point charge potential but adjusted for the retarded time.

Wait, the scalar potential for a point charge is usually V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge to the field point. But since the charge is moving, the r' would be the distance at the retarded time. Or is it more complicated?

Wait, the scalar potential due to a moving charge is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/|r - r'(t_r)|], where t_r is the retarded time. But since the charge is moving, r' is its position at t_r. Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler because the charge is a point charge, so the potential is similar to the static case but with r' adjusted.

Wait, looking at the options, some of them have just 1/r, others have more complicated denominators. Let's see, option C and D have denominators with d c minus or plus d dot v. Hmm.

Wait, what's d? The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to r. So if the charge was at point r' at time tr, then d = r - r'.

But maybe I can model this. At time t, the field at r is due to the charge's state at time t - (r·v)/c, where v is the speed of light? Wait, no, that's more for the retarded time in the case where the charge is moving at a constant velocity. Or is it?

Wait, actually, the retarded time t_r is t - |r - r'|/c. But since r' is the position of the charge at t_r, which depends on its velocity. But if the charge is moving with a velocity v that's constant, then r' = r0 + v t_r. So r - r' = (r - r0) - v t_r.

Wait, but maybe for a non-relativistic case, we can approximate the position, but perhaps I should think in terms of the expressions given.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d|), but I'm not sure. Oh wait, because d is from the charge's position at tr to r, so the distance is |d|, so V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). But looking at the options, option A has V as q/(4πε₀ r), which is static case. Hmm, but when the charge is moving, does the distance change? Or is d the proper distance?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the vector potential. The vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) something. Because the vector potential for a moving charge is proportional to the velocity.

In the static case, A is zero because the scalar potential dominates. But when the charge is moving, there's a contribution to A. The general form I remember is that the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * (something over (distance squared or so)).

Wait, let's recall the expressions. The scalar potential is V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|r - r'|)], where r' is the charge's position at the retarded time.

The vector potential is A(r,t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) * [v(t_r)]/(|r - r'|) * (r - r')? Or maybe it's (v(t_r)) * (r - r') / |r - r'|²?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the vector potential is (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * v(t_r) * (r - r')/( |r - r'| ). Wait, but that might not be right.

Wait, another approach: the potentials satisfy certain equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field. So for a charge moving with velocity v, the electric field is found using V and the time derivative of A, and the magnetic field is from the curl of A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: V is static, A is v squared over c squared times V. That would be (v²/c²) (q/(4πε₀ r)), but that might not make sense because the vector potential is usually proportional to velocity, not velocity squared.

Option B: V is same as in A, and A is (v/c²) V. So A would be (v/(4πε₀ c²)) (q/r). Hmm, but units-wise, A should have units of T·m²/A or similar, which involves velocity and charge over length. Let's see: [v] is m/s, [c²] is m²/s², so (v/c²) is 1/(m). Then, [V] is (C)/(C·N·m²/C²·m) → Wait, scalar potential V has units of volts, which is J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C. So if A is (v/c²) V, then [A] would be (m/s)/(m²/s²) * V's units. Let me compute:

v/c² = (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) = s/m. So [A] would be (s/m) * (kg·m²/(C·s²)) ). Hmm, because V is q/(4πε₀ r), and ε₀ has units of F/m = C²/(N·m²). So [V] is (C) / (C²/(N·m²) * m )) → (C * N·m² / C² ) / m → (N·m² / C ) / m → (kg·m²/s² · m² )/( C · m ) → Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused with units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the expressions. The vector potential for a point charge moving with velocity v is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [ (r - r') / |r - r'|^2 ] evaluated at the retarded time. But wait, because the potentials are functions of r and t, so we might have to express it in terms of the vector d and other terms.

Wait, in the options, option C is V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ_o q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). Hmm, but what is d here? d is the vector from the field generating point (charge's position at tr) to r.

So, if d is r - r'(tr), then |d| is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r.

But perhaps another approach: the denominator in V is d c - d·v. Let me think about that. Because d·v is the dot product of the displacement vector and the velocity vector. So if the charge is moving with velocity v at time tr, then the displacement vector is d = r - r'(tr). The term (d c - d·v) would be c |d| - (d·v). Wait, but how does that come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is |d|^2 - (d·v)^2/(c^2), but that's not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: When the charge is moving, the fields are affected by the motion, and the potentials are determined by the retarded time. So perhaps we can express d in terms of the displacement at time tr, and the velocity.

Wait, the time delay between the charge's position at tr and the observation at t is Δt = (distance between r and r') / c. So, the time delay is t - tr = |d| / c, assuming that the charge's position at tr is r'(tr), and the field travels at speed c.

But wait, the exact expression for the retarded time is t_r = t - |d|/c, but that's an approximation for when the velocity is much less than c. Alternatively, perhaps it's t_r = t - (d · v)/c², but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should recall the retarded time formula. The retarded time t_r is given by t_r = t - (r - r'(t_r)) · v(t_r) / (c^2). Or maybe it's t_r = t - (r - r'(t_r))/c · something.

Wait, no. The exact expression for the retarded time is when the light emitted by the charge at t_r reaches the observation point r at time t. So, the position of the charge at t_r is r' = s(t_r). The displacement vector from the charge to r is r - r' = d. So the light travel time is |d| / c, so t_r = t - |d|/c. But that's only if the charge isn't moving, because if it's moving, then the light path is a bit more complicated.

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's think about the expressions for potentials.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d| ), because d is the displacement vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). But looking at the options, option C and D have denominators like (d c - d·v). So perhaps |d| is not simply the magnitude of d, but something else.

Wait, no, because the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v), which is a scalar. So, for example, d c is the vector d multiplied by scalar c, but that would have units of velocity times length, which doesn't make sense. Wait, probably not. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is |d| c - d · v, which is a scalar. Let me see: |d| c is the product of distance and speed of light, and d·v is the dot product of displacement vector and velocity, which has units of m/s * m = m²/s.

Wait, but |d| c would be in m * m/s = m²/s, same as d·v. So |d| c - d·v is a scalar in m²/s.

So if the denominator is |d| c - d·v, then the scalar potential V would be (q c)/(4πε₀ (|d| c - d·v )). Wait, but option C says V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v )). Hmm, but d is a vector. Oh, wait, that can't be right because you can't have a denominator as a vector. So perhaps the denominator is |d| c - d·v, which is a scalar.

Wait, looking at the options, option C's denominator is (d c - d · v), which would be a vector multiplied by scalar c, minus the dot product (which is scalar). That doesn't make sense dimensionally. So perhaps that's a typo, and the denominator is |d| c - d · v. So V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (|d| c - d · v )).

Wait, but why would there be a c in the numerator and denominator? Hmm, perhaps because of the consideration of time delay and velocity's impact on the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is the invariant quantity (c^2 (t - t_r) )^2 - (r - r' )^2, but that's more related to the retarded potential integration.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the expression for the scalar and vector potentials when the charge is moving.

I remember that for the scalar potential, the expression is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|r - r'(t_r)|)], and for the vector potential, A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) * [ (v(t_r) )/( |r - r'(t_r)| ) * ( (r - r'(t_r)) )/( |r - r'(t_r)| ) ) ].

Wait, but (r - r')/|r - r'| is the unit vector in the direction from the charge to r. So A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² |r - r'|) ) * (r - r')/ |r - r'|.

Wait, so A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² |r - r'|²) ) * (r - r').

But in the options, the vector potential is expressed as a vector proportional to v. So perhaps in the given options, the vector potential is written as (μ₀ q v)/(4π (d c - d·v)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, in options C and D, the denominators are (d c - d·v) and (d c + d·v), respectively. So perhaps the denominator in V is (d c - d·v ), but I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between d and r - r'. Since d = r - r'(tr), the term (d c - d·v) can be written as c d - (d · v). Wait, but d · v is (r - r')·v, which is a scalar.

Wait, but perhaps this is part of the expression for the invariant quantity in the denominator. Alternatively, maybe the term (d c - v · d) is related to the time delay multiplied by c minus the displacement due to the charge's velocity.

Wait, another approach: to find the scalar potential V, let's think about the expression when the charge is moving. The scalar potential is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) ∫ [φ(r', t') ] ... but for a point charge, it's just V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀ |d| ), but perhaps that's only the static case. When the charge is moving, does this change?

Wait, no, the scalar potential is still given by 1/(4πε₀) times the charge over the distance, but evaluated at the retarded time. So V is q/(4π ε₀ |d| ), which in the options would match option A's V.

Option A says V = q/(4πε₀ r). Wait, but r here is probably |r|, the distance from origin to r. But in our case, d is the displacement from the charge to r, so |d| would be the actual distance. So if the charge is at origin, then |d| is |r|, but if it's elsewhere, then not. Hmm, but the problem says the charge is moving along s(t), so the origin is the same reference frame as the charge.

Wait a minute, perhaps the point where the field is generated is at tr, so the displacement vector d is from that point (r'(tr)) to r. So if the origin is the same frame, then r is the vector from origin to observation point, and r' is the vector from origin to the charge's position at tr. So d = r - r'(tr).

Thus, the distance |d| is the actual separation between the charge at tr and the observation point at t. So in that case, the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d| ), which is just option A's expression if r = |d|. But in option A, V is q/(4π ε₀ r ), which would be the case if d = r, meaning r'(tr) is at the origin. That's only true if the charge is at the origin at time tr. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify that. So that might not be correct.

Therefore, perhaps option C or D is the correct one.

Looking at option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)), which I can think of as (q c) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - d · v ) ].

Wait, but why the denominator would have c |d| minus d · v? Hmm, perhaps because the time delay is ( |d| / c ), and the velocity component affects the distance. Alternatively, maybe it's due to the Lorentz contraction or something relativistic, but that's probably beyond what's needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is the invariant quantity (c (t - t_r ))^2 - |d|^2, but that would be (c (t - (t - |d|/c )) )^2 - |d|^2 = ( |d| )^2 - |d|^2 = 0, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the expression for the potentials in terms of the displacement and velocity.

Another thought: The expression for the scalar potential might involve a factor of (1 - (v/c)^2 ), but that's more in relativity. Hmm, but the problem doesn't suggest any relativistic effects, so maybe it's non-relativistic.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is |d| (c - v_r ), where v_r is the component of velocity along d. So v_r = (v · d)/|d|.

So |d| (c - v_r ) = |d| c - (v · d).

Yes, that makes sense. So the denominator becomes |d| c - (v · d), which is a scalar.

So the scalar potential V would be (q c) / [4 π ε₀ ( |d| c - (v · d) ) ].

Similarly, the vector potential A would be (μ₀ q v ) / [4 π ( |d| c - (v · d) ) ].

Looking at option C, it has V as (q c)/(4 π ε₀ (d c - d · v )) and A as (μ₀ q c v) / (4 π (d c - d · v )). 

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a vector multiplied by scalar c minus a scalar. That can't be right because dimensions wouldn't match. So perhaps it's a typo and it should be |d| c - d · v.

Assuming that, then option C's V and A would have the correct form. So V is q c / [4 π ε₀ ( |d| c - d · v ) ], and A is (μ₀ q c v) / [4 π ( |d| c - d · v ) ].

Comparing to the options, option C says:

V(r,t) = ( qc )/(4 π ε₀ (d c - d · v )),

A(r,t) = ( μ₀ qc v )/(4 π (d c - d · v )).

So if the denominator is actually |d| c - d · v, then option C makes sense. Because in that case, both V and A have the same denominator, which is |d| c - (d · v).

But wait, in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - d · v ), which would be a vector multiplied by scalar c, minus a scalar. That can't be correct. So perhaps option C is incorrect in that aspect, and the correct denominator should be |d| c - (d · v).

Wait, then perhaps the correct option is option C because they have the correct numerator and the same denominator structure, but perhaps the denominator is actually |d| c - d · v.

But looking at the options, option C is:

V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)),

A = (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

So if d is a vector, then d c is a vector, and d·v is a scalar. So the denominator in option C would be a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So that can't be right. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The denominator must be a scalar, so another possibility is that the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) · something, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which is a scalar. So option C would have V = (q c)/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - d · v )), and A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d · v )).

But looking at the options, option C's denominator is written as (d c - d·v), which isn't the same as (c |d| - d · v). So perhaps the options are written in a slightly different way, perhaps using (d c - d · v) as a scalar.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo and the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ). Then, option C would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vector potential's form. The vector potential is usually proportional to the velocity. Looking at the options, option B has A proportional to (v/c²) V, which would mean A is (v/(c²)) (q/(4πε₀ r)).

Wait, but in reality, the vector potential due to a moving charge is something like A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) (r - r')/( |r - r'|³ ) ?

No, I think the correct expression is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c²) * [ (v(t_r) )/( |d| ) ] * (d ) / |d|,

since d is r - r'(tr). So, A is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

So, A = [μ₀ q v ] / (4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

But in the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v ) / (4 π (d c - d·v )).

But it's unclear. Alternatively, since in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a vector, but I think the correct denominator must be scalar.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in option C is actually |d| c - (d · v ), which would make sense.

So, given that, in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - d · v ), but perhaps that's a mistake, and it should be |d| c - (d · v ), making option C the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| + (d · v)), but that would be option D if the denominator is (d c + d · v ), which is again a vector plus a scalar. So, that also doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator using the exact expression for the scalar potential.

The scalar potential is V = q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ). But wait, when the charge is moving, does this change? Because the electric field depends on the charge's velocity, but the scalar potential is just the Coulomb potential at the point evaluated at the retarded time.

Wait, but in reality, the scalar potential for a moving charge is still (q/(4 π ε₀ |d| )), and the vector potential arises due to the motion. So perhaps option A is correct for V, but then what about A?

Option A says A is (v²/c²) V. So, A = (v^2/c^2) (q/(4 π ε₀ r )).

Wait, but the units don't seem to match. Let me check the units.

V has units of volts (V = J/C = N·m/C). A has units of Tesla·m²/A. Let's see, in option A: v^2/c^2 is (m²/s²)/(m²/s²) ) = dimensionless. So A would have the same units as V, which can't be right because A is a vector with units of T·m²/A.

Wait, but option B: A is (v/c²) V. Let's compute the units of that. v is m/s, c² is m²/s². So v/c² is (m/s)/(m²/s² ) = s/(m). V is volts (J/C = N·m/C). So A would have units (s/m) * (N·m/C ) = (N·s)/(C·m ). But N is kg·m/s², so (kg·m/s² * s )/( C·m ) ) = kg/( C·s ). Hmm, which is not the same as Tesla·m²/A. Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so Tesla·m²/A is (kg·m²)/(s²·A²). So option B's A doesn't have the right units.

So perhaps option B is incorrect. Let me go back to the vector potential. The correct expression for A is (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * (v(t_r) ) * (r - r'(t_r))/( |r - r'(t_r)|³ ). Or perhaps (v(t_r) ) / ( |r - r'(t_r)|² ). Wait, it's been a while.

Wait, the vector potential for a point charge in a general motion is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c²) * [ v(t_r) ] * (r - r'(t_r)) / |r - r'(t_r)|³ * (c² dt_r - (r - r'(t_r)) · dv )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c²) * [ (v(t_r) ) ] / |d| * (d ) / |d|,

since d is r - r'(t_r).

So, A = (μ₀ q v(t_r) )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

So, in terms of d, it's (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

Hmm, looking at the options, perhaps none of them match that exactly. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C has A as [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π (d c - d · v) ].

Wait, if the denominator is |d| c - (d · v ), then (d c - d · v ) is a vector times scalar c minus a scalar, which is not correct. So perhaps that's a mistake in the option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct denominator is |d| c + (d · v ), which would match option D's denominator. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in the non-relativistic case, the scalar potential is just V = q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), and the vector potential is A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * (d / |d| ), so A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

But looking at the options, none exactly match that, but perhaps option C is the closest.

Wait, option C has V = (qc)/(4 π ε₀ (d c - d · v )) and A = (μ₀ qc v )/(4 π (d c - d · v )).

So, if the denominator is |d| c - (d · v ), then:

V = (q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - d · v ) ]

A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (c |d| - d · v ) ]

Which would mean that A = (μ₀/(4 π ε₀ c )) * V * v.

But since μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1, because μ₀ ε₀ c² = (4 π × 1e-7 H/m) ) × (8.85e-12 F/m) ) × (9e16 m²/s²) ) ≈ 1.

Wait, indeed, 1/(μ₀ ε₀ c² ) = 1, so μ₀/(4 π ε₀ c ) = 1/(4 π c² ) * (μ₀ c² )/( ε₀ ) )? Wait, perhaps it's easier to think μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1 → μ₀ = 1/( ε₀ c² ).

So, μ₀/(4 π ε₀ c ) = (1/( ε₀ c² )) / (4 π ε₀ c ) ) = 1/(4 π ε₀² c³ ). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let me compute the factors in option C.

Option C's A:

A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (c |d| - d · v ) ]

= [ μ₀ q v ] / [4 π ( (c |d| - d · v ) / c ) ]

= [ μ₀ q v ] / [4 π ( (|d| c - d · v ) ) / c ) ]

= [ μ₀ q v c ] / [4 π (|d| c - d · v ) ]

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for A is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) times (d / |d| ), which is (μ₀ q v d )/(4 π c² |d|² ). But in option C, A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d · v )).

So, if in option C, the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), then A would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d · v )).

Which can be written as (μ₀ q v )/(4 π ) * [ c / (c |d| - d · v ) ]

Hmm, not sure if that's the right expression.

Another thought: when the charge is moving, the potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V contributes to the electric field as -∇V, and the vector potential contributes to E as -∂A/∂t and to B as ∇ × A.

So, perhaps I can derive the expressions.

The electric field due to a point charge is:

E = -∇ V - ∂A/∂t.

The magnetic field is B = ∇ × A.

In the case of a point charge moving with velocity v, the electric field should be E = (q/(4 π ε₀ )) ( [ (v × B_0 ) ] / c² ), where B_0 is the static field. Wait, no, that's more for magnetostatics.

Alternatively, perhaps the fields are:

E = E_electric + E_magnetic.

The electric field due to the scalar potential is E_scalar = -∇ V.

The magnetic field is due to the vector potential, B = ∇ × A.

But for a point charge, the magnetic field due to its motion is B = (μ₀ q v × r )/(4 π c² r³ ), which is the standard result.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Another approach: the potentials must satisfy the wave equations, but since the charge is moving non-relativistically, we can use the retarded potentials in the non-relativistic approximation.

So, the scalar potential is V = q/(4 π ε₀ ) * [ 1 / |d| ].

The vector potential is A = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c² ) * [ v(t_r) ] / |d| * (d / |d| ), which is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

But in the given options, the vector potential in option C is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - d · v )).

So, if the denominator is |d| c - (d · v ), then:

A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( |d| c - d · v ) ]

But according to what I derived, A should be (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

So comparing:

Option C's A: (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( |d| c - d · v )).

My derived A: (μ₀ q v d )/(4 π c² |d|² )

Hmm, so they are different.

Wait, perhaps if I factor in more terms from the non-relativistic approximation, such as the time derivative of the vector potential.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should just look for which option correctly includes both the scalar and vector potentials, each with their respective dependencies on velocity.

Since in the static case, V is q/(4 π ε₀ r ), and A is zero. But when the charge moves, A becomes non-zero. So the correct answer should have V as q/(4 π ε₀ r ) times some factor, and A as a term involving v.

Looking at the options:

Option A: V is static, A is proportional to v².

Option B: V is static, A proportional to v.

Option C and D: V and A have more complex denominators.

In reality, when the charge is moving, the scalar potential V remains (q/(4 π ε₀ |d| )) while the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

But none of the options directly match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the correct expressions for the potentials when the charge is moving.

The scalar potential is V = (q/(4 π ε₀ )) * (1/|r - r'(t_r)| ).

The vector potential is A = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c² ) * ( v(t_r) ) * ( (r - r'(t_r)) / |r - r'(t_r)|³ ) ).

So, in terms of d and |d|, this becomes:

V = (q/(4 π ε₀ |d| )).

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * (d / |d| ).

= (μ₀ q v d )/(4 π c² |d|³ ).

Hmm, but none of the options have this form. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the denominator in the potentials includes a term for the velocity, but in a non-relativistic approach, the velocity term is small, and we can expand it.

Wait, the time delay is approximately ( |d| ) / c, but if the charge is moving, the position at time t_r is r' = r0 + v t_r, so r - r' = d = (r - r0 ) - v t_r.

But perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, the displacement d can be approximated as d ≈ (r - r0 ) - v (t - |d|/c ).

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the potentials is |d| (1 - (v · d)/(c² |d| )) ), which would come from considering the motion's effect on the distance.

So,

|d| (1 - (v · d)/(c² |d| )) ) = |d| - (v · d)/c².

But that's a scalar. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that fits into the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is ( |d| c - (v · d) ), which would be |d| c - (d · v ).

So, if that's the case, then V becomes (q c )/(4 π ε₀ ( |d| c - d · v )).

And A would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( |d| c - d · v )).

Which matches option C, except that in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a vector. So unless the option has a typo, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, assuming that the denominator is |d| c - (d · v ), and the option has a typo.

So, considering all this, I'd say option C is the correct one. Because the V and A expressions in option C have the correct structure, even if the denominator is written with d instead of |d|, which might be a typographical error.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Analysis

1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a point charge \( q \) is generally given by \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|} \), where \( \vec{d} \) is the displacement vector from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).
   - When the charge is moving, the distance \( |\vec{d}| \) is affected by the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \). The denominator becomes modified to account for the motion, leading to a term like \( |\vec{d}|c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. This ensures consistency with relativistic effects and the propagation of fields.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential for a moving charge is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \). It is given by \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{\vec{d}}{|\vec{d}|^2} \), evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \).
   - The denominator in \( \vec{A} \) is the same as in \( V \), ensuring consistency between the two potentials. Thus, \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v} \) and depends on the same modified distance term \( |\vec{d}|c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
     This assumes the static case for \( V \), which is incorrect for a moving charge. Additionally, \( \vec{A} \) being proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \) is inconsistent with the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \). **Incorrect.**
   - **Option B:** \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
     While \( \vec{A} \) has the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \), the scalar potential \( V \) is again static and does not account for the motion of the charge. **Incorrect.**
   - **Option C:** \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
     This option correctly incorporates the modified denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which accounts for the charge's motion. Both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) are consistent with the expected forms. **Correct.**
   - **Option D:** \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
     The denominator \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is unphysical, as it does not align with the expected form of the modified distance term. **Incorrect.**

### Conclusion

Option C is the correct choice, as it accurately represents both the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge, with the appropriate dependence on the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \), the velocity \( \vec{v} \), and the speed of light \( c \).

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says that there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time tr is v. We're to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is after tr.

Wait, so the charge was at a certain point at time tr, and the field it generates propagates to the point r. So the potentials at r at time t depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time tr. Right, because electromagnetic fields propagate at speed c, so the time delay is the time it takes for the field to travel from the charge's position at tr to r.

I remember that the scalar potential and vector potential are given by retarded potentials. So I should probably use the retarded time concept here.

Scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) times something, integrated over the charge's history, but since it's a point charge, maybe it's just the point charge potential but adjusted for the retarded time.

Wait, the scalar potential for a point charge is usually V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge to the field point. But since the charge is moving, the r' would be the distance at the retarded time. Or is it more complicated?

Wait, the scalar potential due to a moving charge is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/|r - r'(t_r)|], where t_r is the retarded time. But since the charge is moving, r' is its position at t_r. Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler because the charge is a point charge, so the potential is similar to the static case but with r' adjusted.

Wait, looking at the options, some of them have just 1/r, others have more complicated denominators. Let's see, option C and D have denominators with d c minus or plus d dot v. Hmm.

Wait, what's d? The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to r. So if the charge was at point r' at time tr, then d = r - r'.

But maybe I can model this. At time t, the field at r is due to the charge's state at time t - (r·v)/c, where v is the speed of light? Wait, no, that's more for the retarded time in the case where the charge is moving at a constant velocity. Or is it?

Wait, actually, the retarded time t_r is t - |r - r'|/c. But since r' is the position of the charge at t_r, which depends on its velocity. But if the charge is moving with a velocity v that's constant, then r' = r0 + v t_r. So r - r' = (r - r0) - v t_r.

Wait, but maybe for a non-relativistic case, we can approximate the position, but perhaps I should think in terms of the expressions given.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d|), but I'm not sure. Oh wait, because d is from the charge's position at tr to r, so the distance is |d|, so V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). But looking at the options, option A has V as q/(4πε₀ r), which is static case. Hmm, but when the charge is moving, does the distance change? Or is d the proper distance?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the vector potential. The vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) something. Because the vector potential for a moving charge is proportional to the velocity.

In the static case, A is zero because the scalar potential dominates. But when the charge is moving, there's a contribution to A. The general form I remember is that the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * (something over (distance squared or so)).

Wait, let's recall the expressions. The scalar potential is V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|r - r'|)], where r' is the charge's position at the retarded time.

The vector potential is A(r,t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) * [v(t_r)]/(|r - r'|) * (r - r')? Or maybe it's (v(t_r)) * (r - r') / |r - r'|²?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the vector potential is (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * v(t_r) * (r - r')/( |r - r'| ). Wait, but that might not be right.

Wait, another approach: the potentials satisfy certain equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field. So for a charge moving with velocity v, the electric field is found using V and the time derivative of A, and the magnetic field is from the curl of A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: V is static, A is v squared over c squared times V. That would be (v²/c²) (q/(4πε₀ r)), but that might not make sense because the vector potential is usually proportional to velocity, not velocity squared.

Option B: V is same as in A, and A is (v/c²) V. So A would be (v/(4πε₀ c²)) (q/r). Hmm, but units-wise, A should have units of T·m²/A or similar, which involves velocity and charge over length. Let's see: [v] is m/s, [c²] is m²/s², so (v/c²) is 1/(m). Then, [V] is (C)/(C·N·m²/C²·m) → Wait, scalar potential V has units of volts, which is J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C. So if A is (v/c²) V, then [A] would be (m/s)/(m²/s²) * V's units. Let me compute:

v/c² = (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) = s/m. So [A] would be (s/m) * (kg·m²/(C·s²)) ). Hmm, because V is q/(4πε₀ r), and ε₀ has units of F/m = C²/(N·m²). So [V] is (C) / (C²/(N·m²) * m )) → (C * N·m² / C² ) / m → (N·m² / C ) / m → (kg·m²/s² · m² )/( C · m ) → Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused with units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the expressions. The vector potential for a point charge moving with velocity v is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [ (r - r') / |r - r'|^2 ] evaluated at the retarded time. But wait, because the potentials are functions of r and t, so we might have to express it in terms of the vector d and other terms.

Wait, in the options, option C is V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ_o q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). Hmm, but what is d here? d is the vector from the field generating point (charge's position at tr) to r.

So, if d is r - r'(tr), then |d| is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r.

But perhaps another approach: the denominator in V is d c - d·v. Let me think about that. Because d·v is the dot product of the displacement vector and the velocity vector. So if the charge is moving with velocity v at time tr, then the displacement vector is d = r - r'(tr). The term (d c - d·v) would be c |d| - (d·v). Wait, but how does that come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is |d|^2 - (d·v)^2/(c^2), but that's not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: When the charge is moving, the fields are affected by the motion, and the potentials are determined by the retarded time. So perhaps we can express d in terms of the displacement at time tr, and the velocity.

Wait, the time delay between the charge's position at tr and the observation at t is Δt = (distance between r and r') / c. So, the time delay is t - tr = |d| / c, assuming that the charge's position at tr is r'(tr), and the field travels at speed c.

But wait, the exact expression for the retarded time is t_r = t - |d|/c, but that's an approximation for when the velocity is much less than c. Alternatively, perhaps it's t_r = t - (d · v)/c², but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should recall the retarded time formula. The retarded time t_r is given by t_r = t - (r - r'(t_r)) · v(t_r) / (c^2). Or maybe it's t_r = t - (r - r'(t_r))/c · something.

Wait, no. The exact expression for the retarded time is when the light emitted by the charge at t_r reaches the observation point r at time t. So, the position of the charge at t_r is r' = s(t_r). The displacement vector from the charge to r is r - r' = d. So the light travel time is |d| / c, so t_r = t - |d|/c. But that's only if the charge isn't moving, because if it's moving, then the light path is a bit more complicated.

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's think about the expressions for potentials.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d| ), because d is the displacement vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). But looking at the options, option C and D have denominators like (d c - d·v). So perhaps |d| is not simply the magnitude of d, but something else.

Wait, no, because the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v), which is a scalar. So, for example, d c is the vector d multiplied by scalar c, but that would have units of velocity times length, which doesn't make sense. Wait, probably not. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is |d| c - d · v, which is a scalar. Let me see: |d| c is the product of distance and speed of light, and d·v is the dot product of displacement vector and velocity, which has units of m/s * m = m²/s.

Wait, but |d| c would be in m * m/s = m²/s, same as d·v. So |d| c - d·v is a scalar in m²/s.

So if the denominator is |d| c - d·v, then the scalar potential V would be (q c)/(4πε₀ (|d| c - d·v )). Wait, but option C says V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v )). Hmm, but d is a vector. Oh, wait, that can't be right because you can't have a denominator as a vector. So perhaps the denominator is |d| c - d·v, which is a scalar.

Wait, looking at the options, option C's denominator is (d c - d · v), which would be a vector multiplied by scalar c, minus the dot product (which is scalar). That doesn't make sense dimensionally. So perhaps that's a typo, and the denominator is |d| c - d · v. So V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (|d| c - d · v )).

Wait, but why would there be a c in the numerator and denominator? Hmm, perhaps because of the consideration of time delay and velocity's impact on the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is the invariant quantity (c^2 (t - t_r) )^2 - (r - r' )^2, but that's more related to the retarded potential integration.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the expression for the scalar and vector potentials when the charge is moving.

I remember that for the scalar potential, the expression is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|r - r'(t_r)|)], and for the vector potential, A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) * [ (v(t_r) )/( |r - r'(t_r)| ) * ( (r - r'(t_r)) )/( |r - r'(t_r)| ) ) ].

Wait, but (r - r')/|r - r'| is the unit vector in the direction from the charge to r. So A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² |r - r'|) ) * (r - r')/ |r - r'|.

Wait, so A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² |r - r'|²) ) * (r - r').

But in the options, the vector potential is expressed as a vector proportional to v. So perhaps in the given options, the vector potential is written as (μ₀ q v)/(4π (d c - d·v)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, in options C and D, the denominators are (d c - d·v) and (d c + d·v), respectively. So perhaps the denominator in V is (d c - d·v ), but I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between d and r - r'. Since d = r - r'(tr), the term (d c - d·v) can be written as c d - (d · v). Wait, but d · v is (r - r')·v, which is a scalar.

Wait, but perhaps this is part of the expression for the invariant quantity in the denominator. Alternatively, maybe the term (d c - v · d) is related to the time delay multiplied by c minus the displacement due to the charge's velocity.

Wait, another approach: to find the scalar potential V, let's think about the expression when the charge is moving. The scalar potential is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) ∫ [φ(r', t') ] ... but for a point charge, it's just V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀ |d| ), but perhaps that's only the static case. When the charge is moving, does this change?

Wait, no, the scalar potential is still given by 1/(4πε₀) times the charge over the distance, but evaluated at the retarded time. So V is q/(4π ε₀ |d| ), which in the options would match option A's V.

Option A says V = q/(4πε₀ r). Wait, but r here is probably |r|, the distance from origin to r. But in our case, d is the displacement from the charge to r, so |d| would be the actual distance. So if the charge is at origin, then |d| is |r|, but if it's elsewhere, then not. Hmm, but the problem says the charge is moving along s(t), so the origin is the same reference frame as the charge.

Wait a minute, perhaps the point where the field is generated is at tr, so the displacement vector d is from that point (r'(tr)) to r. So if the origin is the same frame, then r is the vector from origin to observation point, and r' is the vector from origin to the charge's position at tr. So d = r - r'(tr).

Thus, the distance |d| is the actual separation between the charge at tr and the observation point at t. So in that case, the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d| ), which is just option A's expression if r = |d|. But in option A, V is q/(4π ε₀ r ), which would be the case if d = r, meaning r'(tr) is at the origin. That's only true if the charge is at the origin at time tr. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify that. So that might not be correct.

Therefore, perhaps option C or D is the correct one.

Looking at option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)), which I can think of as (q c) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - d · v ) ].

Wait, but why the denominator would have c |d| minus d · v? Hmm, perhaps because the time delay is ( |d| / c ), and the velocity component affects the distance. Alternatively, maybe it's due to the Lorentz contraction or something relativistic, but that's probably beyond what's needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is the invariant quantity (c (t - t_r ))^2 - |d|^2, but that would be (c (t - (t - |d|/c )) )^2 - |d|^2 = ( |d| )^2 - |d|^2 = 0, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the expression for the potentials in terms of the displacement and velocity.

Another thought: The expression for the scalar potential might involve a factor of (1 - (v/c)^2 ), but that's more in relativity. Hmm, but the problem doesn't suggest any relativistic effects, so maybe it's non-relativistic.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is |d| (c - v_r ), where v_r is the component of velocity along d. So v_r = (v · d)/|d|.

So |d| (c - v_r ) = |d| c - (v · d).

Yes, that makes sense. So the denominator becomes |d| c - (v · d), which is a scalar.

So the scalar potential V would be (q c) / [4 π ε₀ ( |d| c - (v · d) ) ].

Similarly, the vector potential A would be (μ₀ q v ) / [4 π ( |d| c - (v · d) ) ].

Looking at option C, it has V as (q c)/(4 π ε₀ (d c - d · v )) and A as (μ₀ q c v) / (4 π (d c - d · v )). 

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a vector multiplied by scalar c minus a scalar. That can't be right because dimensions wouldn't match. So perhaps it's a typo and it should be |d| c - d · v.

Assuming that, then option C's V and A would have the correct form. So V is q c / [4 π ε₀ ( |d| c - d · v ) ], and A is (μ₀ q c v) / [4 π ( |d| c - d · v ) ].

Comparing to the options, option C says:

V(r,t) = ( qc )/(4 π ε₀ (d c - d · v )),

A(r,t) = ( μ₀ qc v )/(4 π (d c - d · v )).

So if the denominator is actually |d| c - d · v, then option C makes sense. Because in that case, both V and A have the same denominator, which is |d| c - (d · v).

But wait, in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - d · v ), which would be a vector multiplied by scalar c, minus a scalar. That can't be correct. So perhaps option C is incorrect in that aspect, and the correct denominator should be |d| c - (d · v).

Wait, then perhaps the correct option is option C because they have the correct numerator and the same denominator structure, but perhaps the denominator is actually |d| c - d · v.

But looking at the options, option C is:

V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)),

A = (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

So if d is a vector, then d c is a vector, and d·v is a scalar. So the denominator in option C would be a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So that can't be right. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The denominator must be a scalar, so another possibility is that the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) · something, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which is a scalar. So option C would have V = (q c)/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - d · v )), and A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d · v )).

But looking at the options, option C's denominator is written as (d c - d·v), which isn't the same as (c |d| - d · v). So perhaps the options are written in a slightly different way, perhaps using (d c - d · v) as a scalar.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo and the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ). Then, option C would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vector potential's form. The vector potential is usually proportional to the velocity. Looking at the options, option B has A proportional to (v/c²) V, which would mean A is (v/(c²)) (q/(4πε₀ r)).

Wait, but in reality, the vector potential due to a moving charge is something like A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) (r - r')/( |r - r'|³ ) ?

No, I think the correct expression is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c²) * [ (v(t_r) )/( |d| ) ] * (d ) / |d|,

since d is r - r'(tr). So, A is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

So, A = [μ₀ q v ] / (4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

But in the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v ) / (4 π (d c - d·v )).

But it's unclear. Alternatively, since in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a vector, but I think the correct denominator must be scalar.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in option C is actually |d| c - (d · v ), which would make sense.

So, given that, in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - d · v ), but perhaps that's a mistake, and it should be |d| c - (d · v ), making option C the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| + (d · v)), but that would be option D if the denominator is (d c + d · v ), which is again a vector plus a scalar. So, that also doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator using the exact expression for the scalar potential.

The scalar potential is V = q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ). But wait, when the charge is moving, does this change? Because the electric field depends on the charge's velocity, but the scalar potential is just the Coulomb potential at the point evaluated at the retarded time.

Wait, but in reality, the scalar potential for a moving charge is still (q/(4 π ε₀ |d| )), and the vector potential arises due to the motion. So perhaps option A is correct for V, but then what about A?

Option A says A is (v²/c²) V. So, A = (v^2/c^2) (q/(4 π ε₀ r )).

Wait, but the units don't seem to match. Let me check the units.

V has units of volts (V = J/C = N·m/C). A has units of Tesla·m²/A. Let's see, in option A: v^2/c^2 is (m²/s²)/(m²/s²) ) = dimensionless. So A would have the same units as V, which can't be right because A is a vector with units of T·m²/A.

Wait, but option B: A is (v/c²) V. Let's compute the units of that. v is m/s, c² is m²/s². So v/c² is (m/s)/(m²/s² ) = s/(m). V is volts (J/C = N·m/C). So A would have units (s/m) * (N·m/C ) = (N·s)/(C·m ). But N is kg·m/s², so (kg·m/s² * s )/( C·m ) ) = kg/( C·s ). Hmm, which is not the same as Tesla·m²/A. Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so Tesla·m²/A is (kg·m²)/(s²·A²). So option B's A doesn't have the right units.

So perhaps option B is incorrect. Let me go back to the vector potential. The correct expression for A is (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * (v(t_r) ) * (r - r'(t_r))/( |r - r'(t_r)|³ ). Or perhaps (v(t_r) ) / ( |r - r'(t_r)|² ). Wait, it's been a while.

Wait, the vector potential for a point charge in a general motion is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c²) * [ v(t_r) ] * (r - r'(t_r)) / |r - r'(t_r)|³ * (c² dt_r - (r - r'(t_r)) · dv )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c²) * [ (v(t_r) ) ] / |d| * (d ) / |d|,

since d is r - r'(t_r).

So, A = (μ₀ q v(t_r) )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

So, in terms of d, it's (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

Hmm, looking at the options, perhaps none of them match that exactly. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C has A as [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π (d c - d · v) ].

Wait, if the denominator is |d| c - (d · v ), then (d c - d · v ) is a vector times scalar c minus a scalar, which is not correct. So perhaps that's a mistake in the option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct denominator is |d| c + (d · v ), which would match option D's denominator. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in the non-relativistic case, the scalar potential is just V = q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), and the vector potential is A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * (d / |d| ), so A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

But looking at the options, none exactly match that, but perhaps option C is the closest.

Wait, option C has V = (qc)/(4 π ε₀ (d c - d · v )) and A = (μ₀ qc v )/(4 π (d c - d · v )).

So, if the denominator is |d| c - (d · v ), then:

V = (q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - d · v ) ]

A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (c |d| - d · v ) ]

Which would mean that A = (μ₀/(4 π ε₀ c )) * V * v.

But since μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1, because μ₀ ε₀ c² = (4 π × 1e-7 H/m) ) × (8.85e-12 F/m) ) × (9e16 m²/s²) ) ≈ 1.

Wait, indeed, 1/(μ₀ ε₀ c² ) = 1, so μ₀/(4 π ε₀ c ) = 1/(4 π c² ) * (μ₀ c² )/( ε₀ ) )? Wait, perhaps it's easier to think μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1 → μ₀ = 1/( ε₀ c² ).

So, μ₀/(4 π ε₀ c ) = (1/( ε₀ c² )) / (4 π ε₀ c ) ) = 1/(4 π ε₀² c³ ). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let me compute the factors in option C.

Option C's A:

A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (c |d| - d · v ) ]

= [ μ₀ q v ] / [4 π ( (c |d| - d · v ) / c ) ]

= [ μ₀ q v ] / [4 π ( (|d| c - d · v ) ) / c ) ]

= [ μ₀ q v c ] / [4 π (|d| c - d · v ) ]

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for A is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) times (d / |d| ), which is (μ₀ q v d )/(4 π c² |d|² ). But in option C, A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d · v )).

So, if in option C, the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), then A would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d · v )).

Which can be written as (μ₀ q v )/(4 π ) * [ c / (c |d| - d · v ) ]

Hmm, not sure if that's the right expression.

Another thought: when the charge is moving, the potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V contributes to the electric field as -∇V, and the vector potential contributes to E as -∂A/∂t and to B as ∇ × A.

So, perhaps I can derive the expressions.

The electric field due to a point charge is:

E = -∇ V - ∂A/∂t.

The magnetic field is B = ∇ × A.

In the case of a point charge moving with velocity v, the electric field should be E = (q/(4 π ε₀ )) ( [ (v × B_0 ) ] / c² ), where B_0 is the static field. Wait, no, that's more for magnetostatics.

Alternatively, perhaps the fields are:

E = E_electric + E_magnetic.

The electric field due to the scalar potential is E_scalar = -∇ V.

The magnetic field is due to the vector potential, B = ∇ × A.

But for a point charge, the magnetic field due to its motion is B = (μ₀ q v × r )/(4 π c² r³ ), which is the standard result.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Another approach: the potentials must satisfy the wave equations, but since the charge is moving non-relativistically, we can use the retarded potentials in the non-relativistic approximation.

So, the scalar potential is V = q/(4 π ε₀ ) * [ 1 / |d| ].

The vector potential is A = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c² ) * [ v(t_r) ] / |d| * (d / |d| ), which is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

But in the given options, the vector potential in option C is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - d · v )).

So, if the denominator is |d| c - (d · v ), then:

A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( |d| c - d · v ) ]

But according to what I derived, A should be (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

So comparing:

Option C's A: (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( |d| c - d · v )).

My derived A: (μ₀ q v d )/(4 π c² |d|² )

Hmm, so they are different.

Wait, perhaps if I factor in more terms from the non-relativistic approximation, such as the time derivative of the vector potential.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should just look for which option correctly includes both the scalar and vector potentials, each with their respective dependencies on velocity.

Since in the static case, V is q/(4 π ε₀ r ), and A is zero. But when the charge moves, A becomes non-zero. So the correct answer should have V as q/(4 π ε₀ r ) times some factor, and A as a term involving v.

Looking at the options:

Option A: V is static, A is proportional to v².

Option B: V is static, A proportional to v.

Option C and D: V and A have more complex denominators.

In reality, when the charge is moving, the scalar potential V remains (q/(4 π ε₀ |d| )) while the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * d.

But none of the options directly match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the correct expressions for the potentials when the charge is moving.

The scalar potential is V = (q/(4 π ε₀ )) * (1/|r - r'(t_r)| ).

The vector potential is A = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c² ) * ( v(t_r) ) * ( (r - r'(t_r)) / |r - r'(t_r)|³ ) ).

So, in terms of d and |d|, this becomes:

V = (q/(4 π ε₀ |d| )).

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d|² ) * (d / |d| ).

= (μ₀ q v d )/(4 π c² |d|³ ).

Hmm, but none of the options have this form. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the denominator in the potentials includes a term for the velocity, but in a non-relativistic approach, the velocity term is small, and we can expand it.

Wait, the time delay is approximately ( |d| ) / c, but if the charge is moving, the position at time t_r is r' = r0 + v t_r, so r - r' = d = (r - r0 ) - v t_r.

But perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, the displacement d can be approximated as d ≈ (r - r0 ) - v (t - |d|/c ).

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the potentials is |d| (1 - (v · d)/(c² |d| )) ), which would come from considering the motion's effect on the distance.

So,

|d| (1 - (v · d)/(c² |d| )) ) = |d| - (v · d)/c².

But that's a scalar. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that fits into the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is ( |d| c - (v · d) ), which would be |d| c - (d · v ).

So, if that's the case, then V becomes (q c )/(4 π ε₀ ( |d| c - d · v )).

And A would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( |d| c - d · v )).

Which matches option C, except that in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a vector. So unless the option has a typo, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, assuming that the denominator is |d| c - (d · v ), and the option has a typo.

So, considering all this, I'd say option C is the correct one. Because the V and A expressions in option C have the correct structure, even if the denominator is written with d instead of |d|, which might be a typographical error.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Analysis

1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a point charge \( q \) is generally given by \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|} \), where \( \vec{d} \) is the displacement vector from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).
   - When the charge is moving, the distance \( |\vec{d}| \) is affected by the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \). The denominator becomes modified to account for the motion, leading to a term like \( |\vec{d}|c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. This ensures consistency with relativistic effects and the propagation of fields.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential for a moving charge is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \). It is given by \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{\vec{d}}{|\vec{d}|^2} \), evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \).
   - The denominator in \( \vec{A} \) is the same as in \( V \), ensuring consistency between the two potentials. Thus, \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v} \) and depends on the same modified distance term \( |\vec{d}|c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
     This assumes the static case for \( V \), which is incorrect for a moving charge. Additionally, \( \vec{A} \) being proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \) is inconsistent with the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \). **Incorrect.**
   - **Option B:** \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
     While \( \vec{A} \) has the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \), the scalar potential \( V \) is again static and does not account for the motion of the charge. **Incorrect.**
   - **Option C:** \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
     This option correctly incorporates the modified denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which accounts for the charge's motion. Both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) are consistent with the expected forms. **Correct.**
   - **Option D:** \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
     The denominator \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is unphysical, as it does not align with the expected form of the modified distance term. **Incorrect.**

### Conclusion

Option C is the correct choice, as it accurately represents both the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge, with the appropriate dependence on the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \), the velocity \( \vec{v} \), and the speed of light \( c \).

**Answer: C**
