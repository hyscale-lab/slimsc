Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The options are six stars (a to f), and I need to count how many meet this condition.

I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT. Its performance depends on several factors like the brightness of the star, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. The S/N ratio is crucial because a higher S/N means the star's signal is strong enough to be detected above the noise.

Let's break down each star:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. It's one of the brightest in the sky. So it's probably detectable because bright stars provide a higher S/N quickly. But wait, I should check its magnitude. Oh right, Canopus is a first-magnitude star, maybe around 0.7 or something. Definitely bright enough.

b) Polaris: The North Star. It's not extremely bright but still pretty visible. I think it's around magnitude 2 or so. So it's not as bright as Canopus but maybe still detectable in an hour. I'll need to compare with the others.

c) Star with V magnitude 15, 10 pc away. Wait, V magnitude is apparent or absolute? The question says absolute magnitude. Oh wait, no, wait: the absolute magnitude is given, so we need to calculate the apparent magnitude. Because the S/N depends on how bright the star appears from Earth.

So, the formula to find apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. M is absolute magnitude.

So for option c: M=15, d=10 pc.

Calculating m = 15 +5 +5 log10(10) = 15+5 +5*(1) = 25? Wait, no, wait. The formula is m - M =5 log10(d) -5. So m = M +5 log10(d) -5 +5? Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5, where d is in parsecs. So for d=10, log10(10)=1, so m=15 +5*1 -5=15+5-5=15. So apparent magnitude is 15.

But that's way too faint. The fainter a star, the higher the magnitude. Wait, the faintest stars we can see are around magnitude 6-7 with the naked eye, so 15 is extremely faint. But wait, the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used on an 8m telescope. What's the typical limit for spectrographs?

I think telescopes can go much fainter. Let's think about the depth. Exposure time is 1 hour. I think the S/N depends on the flux, which is related to the magnitude. The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux)^(1/2) * sqrt(t) / R, where R is the noise factor. But maybe a simpler approach is knowing that each magnitude is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness.

But perhaps another approach: the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity. VLT is a big telescope. So for a 1-hour exposure, what's the faintest star it can reach?

Wait, I found in some notes that ESPRESSO can reach down to about V=25 for a 10-second exposure. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the signal per pixel.

Alternatively, the question provides the absolute magnitude (M) of each star, so I can compute their apparent magnitude and then determine if ESPRESSO can achieve S/N >=10 in 1 hour.

So for each star:

a) Canopus: M is around -5.76, I think. So apparent magnitude: depends on distance. Wait, but the question doesn't give the distance for a and b. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Wait, looking back, a) is Canopus, which is a real star with known magnitude and distance.

Wait, let me correct that. The options for a, b, etc.:

a) Canopus: It's a bright star, so its apparent magnitude is low (like around 0.7). I don't have the exact number, but I know it's very bright.

b) Polaris: Also a bright star, but not as bright as Canopus. Its apparent magnitude is about 2, maybe a bit less.

c) Absolute V =15, distance 10 pc: So m=15 +5*(1) -5 =15+5-5=15. So m=15.

d) M=15, d=200 pc: m=15 +5*log10(200) -5. log10(200) is about 2.301. So 5*2.301=11.505. m=15 +11.505 -5=21.505. So m≈21.5.

e) M=15, d=5 pc: m=15 +5*log10(5) -5. log10(5)=0.69897. 5*0.69897≈3.495. m=15 +3.495 -5=13.495≈13.5.

f) M=15, d=50 pc: m=15 +5*log10(50) -5. log10(50)=1.69897. 5*1.69897≈8.495. m=15+8.495-5=18.495≈18.5.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

a) Canopus: app mag ~0.7

b) Polaris: app mag ~2.0

c) 15

d) 21.5

e) 13.5

f) 18.5

Now, which of these can ESPRESSO achieve S/N >=10 in 1 hour?

I need to find the formula for S/N as a function of magnitude. I remember that the S/N ratio for a star is given by: S/N = (K * 10^(-0.4 * m)) * sqrt(t), where K is some constant depending on the instrument's efficiency and other factors.

Wait, but I think more accurately, the formula is:

S/N = (S / sqrt(N)) ) * sqrt(t)

Where S is the source's flux, N is the noise (from the sky, instrument, etc.), and t is the exposure time.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to use the relation between magnitude and S/N. I think that for each magnitude, the S/N increases by a factor of sqrt(2.512) when the exposure time is the same, because each magnitude is a factor of 2.512 in flux, and S/N scales as sqrt(flux).

Wait, for a given exposure time, if the magnitude increases by 5, the flux decreases by 100 (since 2.512^5≈100), so the S/N decreases by a factor of 10.

Alternatively, a 5-mag difference gives a factor of 10 in S/N.

So, if a star at m=V can reach S/N=10, then a star at m=V+5 would reach S/N=3.16 (since 10/sqrt(100)=10/10=1? Wait, no, because S/N scales with sqrt(flux). So flux goes down by a factor of 100 (5 magnitudes), so S/N goes down by 10.

So, for a star at m=20, if a star at m=15 gives S/N=10, then m=20 would give S/N=10 / (2.512)^(2) ≈10/(6.34)≈1.58.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.

The formula for S/N is proportional to sqrt(F * t), where F is flux. The flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m). So S/N ∝ sqrt(10^(-0.4 m)) * sqrt(t) = 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t).

So, for a given S/N, let's say the minimum S/N is 10. So we can find the maximum m that allows S/N ≥10.

Let me define a threshold: when S/N =10.

We can set 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t) ≥10.

Wait, that's not right, because the actual formula would have a constant of proportionality. Let me think in terms of a reference.

Suppose that for a star of apparent magnitude m0, the S/N is 10 with an exposure time t0. Then, for another star of magnitude m, the required exposure time t is found by:

(S/N)_m / (S/N)_m0 = (10^(-0.2 (m - m0))) ) * sqrt(t / t0)

But perhaps it's easier to find the formula in terms of m and t.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the formula for the minimum magnitude that can achieve S/N=10 in 1 hour.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph has a certain collecting area (the VLT 8m telescope), and a certain efficiency. Let's say the system has an efficiency factor. Let's think about the formula.

The S/N for a star is given by:

S/N = (Q * sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.4 m)) ) / (R * sqrt(N_pix))

Where Q is the quality factor (depends on the instrument), R is the readout noise, and N_pix is the number of pixels.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula provided in the ESPRESSO documentation, but I don't have it here. Alternatively, I can use an approximate formula.

I remember that the S/N can be approximated by:

S/N = (1.1 * 10^(-0.3 m)) * sqrt(t) )

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps a rule of thumb: for a 10m telescope, an hour exposure can reach about 25th magnitude in V band, but ESPRESSO is on an 8m telescope.

Wait, but 1 hour is a long exposure. So for an 8m telescope, perhaps the depth is around m=20 or so.

Wait, I think I've read that ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 for stars around V=20 in 10 seconds. But that's for very short exposure. For 1 hour, which is 3600 seconds, that's 36 times longer. So the S/N would scale by sqrt(3600/10) = sqrt(360)= about 18.97. So if in 10 seconds, a star at V=20 gives S/N=10, in 1 hour, same star would give S/N=10 * (3600/10)^0.5 = 10*sqrt(360)= ~ 10*18.97≈189.7, which is way above 10. But that's if the star is bright enough for the initial 10 seconds.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time. So, for 1 hour (3600 sec), which is 360 times longer than 10 seconds, the S/N increases by sqrt(360)= ~18.97 times. So if a star at V=20 gives S/N=10 in 10 seconds, in 3600 seconds, it would be 10 * 18.97 ≈ 189.7, which is way above 10. So even stars at m=20 would be easily detected in an hour.

Wait, but in reality, ESPRESSO's sensitivity might vary. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t / t0), where m0 is the reference magnitude, and t0 is the reference time.

Another approach: Let's find an approximate formula. Assume that for a star of magnitude m, the S/N after time t seconds is:

S/N = A * 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t)

Where A is a constant that depends on the instrument and telescope.

We need S/N >=10 → A * 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t) >=10.

We can find A based on known values. Let's say for a star at m=10 observed for t=1000 seconds (about 16 minutes), what S/N would ESPRESSO achieve?

Wait, but perhaps I can find what the S/N is for a star of m=15 with 1-hour exposure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up some example. For instance, the VLT's spectrograph (like UVES) can reach S/N ~10 for stars around V=20 in 1 hour. But ESPRESSO is a new, improved spectrograph.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's try to think differently.

Assume that the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux (which depends on the star's brightness). So brighter stars (lower m) give higher S/N.

For each star in options a-f, compute their apparent magnitude (as I did earlier) and then see if m <= some value where S/N >=10.

If I can find the maximum m that can achieve S/N=10, then I can count how many of the stars have m <= that value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the exposure time is 1 hour, so t=3600 seconds.

Assume that for a star of m=15, the S/N is 10 in 1 hour. Then, a star at m=20 would have S/N = 10 / (2.512^2) ≈ 10/6.34 ≈ 1.58, which is below 10. So that star wouldn't be detectable. But wait, that's not correct because S/N scales with sqrt(flux), which is 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)).

Wait, perhaps the formula is S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t/t0) * S/N0.

Assume that S/N0 is 10, and t0 is 1 hour. Then for the same m0, any star with m <= m0 would have S/N >=10.

Wait, but without knowing m0, this isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum m that ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 in 1 hour is about 20.

So from the earlier calculations:

a) m ~0.7 → definitely detectable.

b) m ~2 → detectable.

c) m=15 → if 15 is below the threshold, detectable.

d) m=21.5 → above, not detectable.

e) m=13.5 → detectable.

f) m=18.5 → detectable.

Wait, if the threshold is m=20, then stars with m <=20 would have S/N >=10.

So, which of the stars a to f have m <=20?

a: 0.7 → yes.

b: 2 → yes.

c:15 → yes.

e:13.5 → yes.

f:18.5 → yes.

d:21.5 → no.

So that's a, b, c, e, f—5 stars in total. Wait, that would make option B)5 the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the threshold might be around m=20. So stars with m=15,13,18 are all below 20. So 5 stars.

But wait, what about b) Polaris? Polaris has m=2, which is way below 20, so it's detectable.

Wait, so that would mean 5 stars (a, b, c, e, f) are detectable, and d is not. So the count is 5, option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity for a 1-hour exposure.

Looking it up, I remember that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N ratios of 100 for G-type stars (like the Sun) in a few minutes. But for fainter stars, it requires longer exposures.

Wait, but if a star is so bright that its S/N is way above 10, it's still detectable. So the question is about whether the S/N is at least 10.

So, for each star, calculate m and see if it's bright enough to have S/N >=10.

But without the exact formula, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the only star that is too faint is d) with m=21.5. So the other five should be detectable.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the threshold is m=20, then d) is too faint. But what about the others? Are all of a-f except d detectable?

Wait, for a star at m=15, would ESPRESSO achieve S/N >=10 in 1 hour?

If the VLT with ESPRESSO can achieve, say, m=20 in 1 hour, then yes.

So a) m=0.7 → yes.

b) m=2 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=18.5 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → no.

So that's five stars (a, b, c, e, f), so answer B)5.

But wait, I'm not sure if all these stars are actually within the detectable range. Let me think about the absolute magnitudes.

Wait, the absolute magnitude is given as 15 for c, e, f, d. So the apparent magnitude depends on distance.

So, a's Canopus is a real star. Let me check its actual apparent magnitude. Canopus is about magnitude -0.7, so m=0.7.

Polaris is about m=1.97, so about 2.

So, a and b have m=0.7 and 2, which are bright enough.

For c, e, f, their apparent magnitudes are 15,13.5,18.5.

If ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 for m=20, then all except d are okay.

So that's five stars, so option B)5 is the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude of the star, which is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux of the star, which is proportional to \( 10^{-0.4m} \). For a 1-hour exposure, ESPRESSO is sensitive enough to detect stars with apparent magnitudes down to approximately \( m \approx 20 \), as this is a reasonable threshold based on the instrument's performance.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Canopus (a):** Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude of \( m \approx 0.7 \). This is well within the detectable range.

2. **Polaris (b):** Polaris has an apparent magnitude of \( m \approx 2.0 \), which is also bright enough for detection.

3. **Star c:** This star has an absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \) and is located at \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \). Its apparent magnitude is:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15
   \]
   Since \( m = 15 \) is below the threshold of \( m \approx 20 \), it is detectable.

4. **Star d:** This star has \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \). Its apparent magnitude is:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 = 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505
   \]
   Since \( m = 21.5 \) exceeds the threshold of \( m \approx 20 \), it is not detectable.

5. **Star e:** This star has \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \). Its apparent magnitude is:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 = 15 + 5(0.699) - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495
   \]
   Since \( m = 13.5 \) is below the threshold, it is detectable.

6. **Star f:** This star has \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \). Its apparent magnitude is:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 = 15 + 5(1.699) - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495
   \]
   Since \( m = 18.5 \) is below the threshold, it is detectable.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are a, b, c, e, and f. Star d is not detectable due to its faintness. Therefore, a total of 5 stars are detectable.

Answer: B
