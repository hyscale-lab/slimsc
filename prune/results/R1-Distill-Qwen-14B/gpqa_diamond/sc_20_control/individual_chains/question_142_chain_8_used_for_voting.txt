Okay, so I have this question about the density matrix of a qubit, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)( |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, this ρ seems to be a density matrix for a qubit. 

I think the options are giving me coordinates in some space, like maybe the Bloch sphere? Because I remember that qubit states can be represented on a Bloch sphere, and the density matrix corresponds to a point in that geometry. 

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a two-dimensional sphere embedded in 3D space, right? Points on the sphere represent pure states, and inside are the mixed states. The density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. 

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So, when I expand this, I get ρ = (1/2) [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ].

But wait, in this problem, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute what that looks like in matrix form. 

|0⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |1⟩ is [0, 1]^T. So |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in (2,2) and zeros elsewhere. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and dividing by 2, ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Now, comparing this with the general form, which is (I + r·σ)/2. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when you add r·σ, which is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. 

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So, r·σ would be:
[ r_z , r_x - i r_y ]
[ r_x + i r_y , -r_z ]

So when we add I (which is [[1,0],[0,1]]), we get:
[[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]]

Then, when multiplied by 1/2, the density matrix becomes:
[[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Now, the given ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So, let's set the elements equal.

For the (1,1) element: (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

For the (1,2) element: (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x - i r_y = 0. Which implies r_x = 0 and r_y = 0, because any complex number equals zero only when both real and imaginary parts are zero. Because (r_x - i r_y) is zero only if r_x =0 and r_y=0.

So, r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. 

Wait, what does that mean? The origin in the Bloch sphere is the completely mixed state. Because a pure state is on the surface, and the most mixed state is the center. So this ρ is a completely mixed state, which makes sense because it's a maximally mixed state for a qubit. 

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which fits. So the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The general form of a qubit density matrix in Bloch sphere terms is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the density matrix becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\
r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

For the given \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) \), the matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form, we find:

1. From the (1,1) element: \( \frac{1 + r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \implies r_z = 0 \).
2. From the (1,2) element: \( \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} = 0 \implies r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the completely mixed state of a qubit. Among the options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as the Bloch vector is not on the surface of the Bloch sphere.**  
**B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \( |0\rangle \).**  
**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as this corresponds to the completely mixed state.**  
**D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as this is not a valid Bloch vector.**
