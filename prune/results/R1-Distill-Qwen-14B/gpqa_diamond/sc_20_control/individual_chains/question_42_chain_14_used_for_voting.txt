Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So, the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. The setup says there are three planets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I'm vaguely remembering stands for transit timing variation. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The problem gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The first ratio is between Planet1 and Planet2, and it's about 1.4. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So Planet1's equilibrium temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet2, and Planet2's is 2.3 times Planet3's. Wait, no, the ratio is Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, so T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So T1 is hotter than T2, and T2 is hotter than T3.

Then the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, so M1/M2 = 1.15. And M2/M3 is about 1.35. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more massive than Planet3. So M1 > M2 > M3.

The question is asking about the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. So we're looking for Period3 / Period1 = ?

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth's. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because a higher albedo reflects more light, so the planet is cooler. Since all have the same albedo, maybe that variable cancels out in the equations.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature Te of a planet is given by Te = [(L / (16πσ))*( (1 - a) ) / (d²) )]^1/4. Where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star.

But wait, in this case, all three planets have the same albedo, so a is 0.3 for all. So the ratio of their temperatures should depend on the square root of (L/(16πσ)) divided by d². Hmm, but wait, L and σ are constants for a given star. So the temperature ratio Te1/Te2 would be sqrt( (d2² * (1-a)) / (d1² * (1-a)) ) ) because when you take the ratio, the (L/(16πσ)) and (1-a) terms cancel out because they're the same for all planets. So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (d2/d1)^2 ), which simplifies to d2/d1. So Te1/Te2 = d2/d1. 

Wait, wait, let's think again. Let me write the formula for each planet. 

Te1 = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d1²) ) ]^(1/4)

Te2 = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d2²) ) ]^(1/4)

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is [ (d2² / d1²) ]^(1/4). Because when you take Te1/Te2, the terms outside the brackets (L, 1-a, etc.) cancel out, leaving (d2²/d1²)^(1/4) = (d2/d1)^(1/2). 

So Te1/Te2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). 

But wait, the question gives us Te1/Te2 is approximately 1.4. So 1.4 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Therefore, d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 is about 1.96 times d1. So Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

Wait, but I thought that the closer planet would be hotter, which aligns with this because Planet1 is hotter (Te1 is higher than Te2) and thus closer.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So Te2/Te3 = 2.3. Using the same formula: Te2/Te3 = (d3/d2)^(1/2). So 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2), so d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 ≈5.29. So d3 is about 5.29 times d2. So Planet3 is even farther out than Planet2.

So putting it together, the distances are d1, d2 = 1.96 d1, d3=5.29* d2 =5.29 *1.96 d1. Let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96 ≈ 5.29*2=10.58, but subtracting 5.29*0.04=0.2116, so around 10.3684. So d3≈10.368 d1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.368 times that of Planet1.

Now, orbital period relates to the distance via Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance). So P^2 ∝ a^3.

Since all planets are in circular orbits, a is the same as d. So P1 is the period of Planet1, P3 is the period of Planet3. So (P3/P1)^2 = (d3/d1)^3. 

So P3/P1 = sqrt( (d3/d1)^3 )

We have d3/d1 ≈10.368. So cubing that gives (10.368)^3. Let me compute that:

10^3 is 1000. 0.368^3 is about 0.05. But wait, 10.368 is 10 + 0.368. Let me compute 10.368^3 more accurately.

Alternatively, 10.368 = approx 10.37.

Compute 10.37^3:

First, 10^3 = 1000.

Then, 0.37 *10^2 = 0.37 *100=37, and multiplied by 3 (from (a+b)^3 expansion) but maybe it's easier to compute step by step.

10.37 *10.37 = (10 +0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 + 0.37^2 = 100 +7.4 + 0.1369 = 107.5369.

Then multiply by 10.37 again:

107.5369 *10.37. Let's compute 107.5369 *10 =1075.369, 107.5369 *0.37= approx 107.5369 *0.3=32.261, 107.5369 *0.07= approx 7.527.

So 32.261 +7.527=39.788. So total is 1075.369 +39.788=1115.157.

So (d3/d1)^3 ≈ 1115.157.

So (P3/P1)^2 = 1115.157 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1115.157).

What's sqrt(1115)?

Well, 33^2 is 1089. 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1115) is between 33 and 34.

Compute 33.4^2 = (33 +0.4)^2=33^2 + 2*33*0.4 + 0.4^2 =1089 +26.4 +0.16= 1115.56. Oh, that's very close to 1115.157. Wait, so sqrt(1115.157) is approximately 33.4.

Wait, but wait: 33.4^2 is 1115.56, which is a bit higher than 1115.157. So maybe the actual square root is a bit lower than 33.4. Let me compute 33.39^2:

33.39^2 = (33 +0.39)^2= 33^2 + 2*(33)*(0.39) + (0.39)^2 = 1089 + 26.22 + 0.1521 = 1089+26.22=1115.22 +0.1521=1115.3721. Hmm, that's higher than 1115.157.

Wait, maybe I should compute more precisely.

Wait, maybe I overcomplicated it. Because in the initial step, the distance ratio is about 10.368, which was d3/d1 = approx 10.368. Let me compute 10.368^3 exactly.

Wait, 10.368 *10.368 = let me compute it step by step.

10.368 *10.368:

Let me compute 10.368 * 10 = 103.68.

10.368 *0.368: Let me compute that.

10 *0.368=3.68.

0.368 *0.368: 0.135424.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to compute 10.368 *10.368 = (10 + 0.368)^2 = 100 + 2*(10)*(0.368) + (0.368)^2 = 100 +7.36 + 0.135424 = 107.495424.

Then, 10.368^3 is 107.495424 *10.368.

Let me compute this product.

107.495424 *10 = 1074.95424.

107.495424 *0.368:

Let me compute 107.495424 *0.3 = 32.2486272.

107.495424 *0.068 = let's see, 107.495424 *0.06 = 6.44972544; 107.495424 *0.008=0.859963392. Adding these gives 6.44972544 + 0.859963392 =7.309688832.

So 32.2486272 +7.309688832=39.55831603.

So total 107.495424 *10.368 = 1074.95424 +39.55831603 ≈1114.512556.

So (d3/d1)^3 ≈1114.5126.

So (P3/P1)^2 = 1114.5126 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.5126). 

What's the square root of 1114.5126?

Let me think, 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156. So sqrt(1114.5) is between 33 and 34.

Compute 33.39^2 again. 33.39^2 = (33 +0.39)^2= 33² + 2*33*0.39 +0.39² = 1089 + 26.22 +0.1521= 1115.3721.

Wait, but 1114.5126 is a bit less than 1115.3721. So the square is about 33.39, but since 33.39^2 is 1115.37 which is higher than 1114.51, the actual square root is a little less than 33.39. Let's approximate.

Compute (33.39 - x)^2 =1114.5126, where x is small.

(33.39)^2 =1115.3721.

So 1115.3721 - 2*33.39*x =1114.5126 → 2*33.39 x =1115.3721 -1114.5126=0.8595.

So x=0.8595/(2*33.39)=0.8595/(66.78)≈0.01286.

So 33.39 -0.01286≈33.377.

So P3/P1≈33.377. So about 33.4, right? So the factor is approximately 33.4.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the problem mentions that the masses are given. But in the calculation I did, I didn't use the masses. So why are the masses given?

Ah, perhaps because the question is about the orbital periods, but Kepler's third law depends on the mass of the star. Wait, but wait: Kepler's law in the context of exoplanets usually considers the mass of the star, not the planet, because the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So the period depends on the star's mass and the distance.

Wait, the actual formula is P² = (4π² G M_star )^(-1) * a^3. So if the star's mass is the same for all three planets, then the period depends only on a (distance). So the masses of the planets wouldn't affect the period. So why are the masses given here?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the question is a bit more complicated. Because if the star's mass is the same, then the period depends only on the distance. But if the star's mass varies between the systems, then the periods would scale differently. But the problem doesn't mention different stars, so I think the star's mass is the same for all three.

Wait, the problem says it's a system of three exoplanets, so they're orbiting the same star. So the star's mass is the same for all. So the masses of the planets don't affect their orbital periods, so the given mass ratios are a red herring. So I don't need to consider them in the calculation.

So then, the calculation I did earlier stands. The period ratio is about 33.4, so option D is the answer.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So yes, option D is ~33.4.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant astronomical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)
   Using the equilibrium temperature formula, \( T \propto d^{-1/2} \), the distance ratios are:
   \[
   d_2 / d_1 = (T_1 / T_2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
   \]
   \[
   d_3 / d_2 = (T_2 / T_3)^2 = (2.3)^2 \approx 5.29
   \]
   Combining these, the distance of Planet3 relative to Planet1 is:
   \[
   d_3 / d_1 = d_3 / d_2 \cdot d_2 / d_1 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \approx 10.368
   \]

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   The orbital period \( P \) is related to the distance \( d \) by \( P^2 \propto d^3 \). Thus:
   \[
   P_3 / P_1 = \sqrt{(d_3 / d_1)^3}
   \]
   Substituting \( d_3 / d_1 \approx 10.368 \):
   \[
   (d_3 / d_1)^3 \approx 10.368^3 \approx 1114.51
   \]
   \[
   P_3 / P_1 = \sqrt{1114.51} \approx 33.4
   \]

3. **Mass Ratios**:
   The mass ratios (\( M_1 / M_2 = 1.15 \), \( M_2 / M_3 = 1.35 \)) are provided but are not relevant here. Kepler's law depends on the star's mass and the planet's distance, not the planet's mass. Since all three planets orbit the same star, the mass ratios do not affect the orbital period calculation.

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So, the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. The setup says there are three planets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I'm vaguely remembering stands for transit timing variation. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The problem gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The first ratio is between Planet1 and Planet2, and it's about 1.4. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So Planet1's equilibrium temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet2, and Planet2's is 2.3 times Planet3's. Wait, no, the ratio is Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, so T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So T1 is hotter than T2, and T2 is hotter than T3.

Then the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, so M1/M2 = 1.15. And M2/M3 is about 1.35. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more massive than Planet3. So M1 > M2 > M3.

The question is asking about the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. So we're looking for Period3 / Period1 = ?

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth's. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because a higher albedo reflects more light, so the planet is cooler. Since all have the same albedo, maybe that variable cancels out in the equations.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature Te of a planet is given by Te = [(L / (16πσ))*( (1 - a) ) / (d²) )]^1/4. Where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star.

But wait, in this case, all three planets have the same albedo, so a is 0.3 for all. So the ratio of their temperatures should depend on the square root of (L/(16πσ)) divided by d². Hmm, but wait, L and σ are constants for a given star. So the temperature ratio Te1/Te2 would be sqrt( (d2² * (1-a)) / (d1² * (1-a)) ) ) because when you take the ratio, the (L/(16πσ)) and (1-a) terms cancel out because they're the same for all planets. So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (d2/d1)^2 ), which simplifies to d2/d1. So Te1/Te2 = d2/d1. 

Wait, wait, let's think again. Let me write the formula for each planet. 

Te1 = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d1²) ) ]^(1/4)

Te2 = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d2²) ) ]^(1/4)

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is [ (d2² / d1²) ]^(1/4). Because when you take Te1/Te2, the terms outside the brackets (L, 1-a, etc.) cancel out, leaving (d2²/d1²)^(1/4) = (d2/d1)^(1/2). 

So Te1/Te2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). 

But wait, the question gives us Te1/Te2 is approximately 1.4. So 1.4 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Therefore, d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 is about 1.96 times d1. So Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

Wait, but I thought that the closer planet would be hotter, which aligns with this because Planet1 is hotter (Te1 is higher than Te2) and thus closer.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So Te2/Te3 = 2.3. Using the same formula: Te2/Te3 = (d3/d2)^(1/2). So 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2), so d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 ≈5.29. So d3 is about 5.29 times d2. So Planet3 is even farther out than Planet2.

So putting it together, the distances are d1, d2 = 1.96 d1, d3=5.29* d2 =5.29 *1.96 d1. Let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96 ≈ 5.29*2=10.58, but subtracting 5.29*0.04=0.2116, so around 10.3684. So d3≈10.368 d1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.368 times that of Planet1.

Now, orbital period relates to the distance via Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance). So P^2 ∝ a^3.

Since all planets are in circular orbits, a is the same as d. So P1 is the period of Planet1, P3 is the period of Planet3. So (P3/P1)^2 = (d3/d1)^3. 

So P3/P1 = sqrt( (d3/d1)^3 )

We have d3/d1 ≈10.368. So cubing that gives (10.368)^3. Let me compute that:

10^3 is 1000. 0.368^3 is about 0.05. But wait, 10.368 is 10 + 0.368. Let me compute 10.368^3 more accurately.

Alternatively, 10.368 = approx 10.37.

Compute 10.37^3:

First, 10^3 = 1000.

Then, 0.37 *10^2 = 0.37 *100=37, and multiplied by 3 (from (a+b)^3 expansion) but maybe it's easier to compute step by step.

10.37 *10.37 = (10 +0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 + 0.37^2 = 100 +7.4 + 0.1369 = 107.5369.

Then multiply by 10.37 again:

107.5369 *10.37. Let's compute 107.5369 *10 =1075.369, 107.5369 *0.37= approx 107.5369 *0.3=32.261, 107.5369 *0.07= approx 7.527.

So 32.261 +7.527=39.788. So total is 1075.369 +39.788=1115.157.

So (d3/d1)^3 ≈ 1115.157.

So (P3/P1)^2 = 1115.157 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1115.157).

What's sqrt(1115)?

Well, 33^2 is 1089. 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1115) is between 33 and 34.

Compute 33.4^2 = (33 +0.4)^2=33^2 + 2*33*0.4 + 0.4^2 =1089 +26.4 +0.16= 1115.56. Oh, that's very close to 1115.157. Wait, so sqrt(1115.157) is approximately 33.4.

Wait, but wait: 33.4^2 is 1115.56, which is a bit higher than 1115.157. So maybe the actual square root is a bit lower than 33.4. Let me compute 33.39^2:

33.39^2 = (33 +0.39)^2= 33^2 + 2*(33)*(0.39) + (0.39)^2 = 1089 + 26.22 + 0.1521 = 1089+26.22=1115.22 +0.1521=1115.3721. Hmm, that's higher than 1115.157.

Wait, maybe I should compute more precisely.

Wait, maybe I overcomplicated it. Because in the initial step, the distance ratio is about 10.368, which was d3/d1 = approx 10.368. Let me compute 10.368^3 exactly.

Wait, 10.368 *10.368 = let me compute it step by step.

10.368 *10.368:

Let me compute 10.368 * 10 = 103.68.

10.368 *0.368: Let me compute that.

10 *0.368=3.68.

0.368 *0.368: 0.135424.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to compute 10.368 *10.368 = (10 + 0.368)^2 = 100 + 2*(10)*(0.368) + (0.368)^2 = 100 +7.36 + 0.135424 = 107.495424.

Then, 10.368^3 is 107.495424 *10.368.

Let me compute this product.

107.495424 *10 = 1074.95424.

107.495424 *0.368:

Let me compute 107.495424 *0.3 = 32.2486272.

107.495424 *0.068 = let's see, 107.495424 *0.06 = 6.44972544; 107.495424 *0.008=0.859963392. Adding these gives 6.44972544 + 0.859963392 =7.309688832.

So 32.2486272 +7.309688832=39.55831603.

So total 107.495424 *10.368 = 1074.95424 +39.55831603 ≈1114.512556.

So (d3/d1)^3 ≈1114.5126.

So (P3/P1)^2 = 1114.5126 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.5126). 

What's the square root of 1114.5126?

Let me think, 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156. So sqrt(1114.5) is between 33 and 34.

Compute 33.39^2 again. 33.39^2 = (33 +0.39)^2= 33² + 2*33*0.39 +0.39² = 1089 + 26.22 +0.1521= 1115.3721.

Wait, but 1114.5126 is a bit less than 1115.3721. So the square is about 33.39, but since 33.39^2 is 1115.37 which is higher than 1114.51, the actual square root is a little less than 33.39. Let's approximate.

Compute (33.39 - x)^2 =1114.5126, where x is small.

(33.39)^2 =1115.3721.

So 1115.3721 - 2*33.39*x =1114.5126 → 2*33.39 x =1115.3721 -1114.5126=0.8595.

So x=0.8595/(2*33.39)=0.8595/(66.78)≈0.01286.

So 33.39 -0.01286≈33.377.

So P3/P1≈33.377. So about 33.4, right? So the factor is approximately 33.4.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the problem mentions that the masses are given. But in the calculation I did, I didn't use the masses. So why are the masses given?

Ah, perhaps because the question is about the orbital periods, but Kepler's third law depends on the mass of the star. Wait, but wait: Kepler's law in the context of exoplanets usually considers the mass of the star, not the planet, because the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So the period depends on the star's mass and the distance.

Wait, the actual formula is P² = (4π² G M_star )^(-1) * a^3. So if the star's mass is the same for all three planets, then the period depends only on a (distance). So the masses of the planets wouldn't affect the period. So why are the masses given here?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the question is a bit more complicated. Because if the star's mass is the same, then the period depends only on the distance. But if the star's mass varies between the systems, then the periods would scale differently. But the problem doesn't mention different stars, so I think the star's mass is the same for all three.

Wait, the problem says it's a system of three exoplanets, so they're orbiting the same star. So the star's mass is the same for all. So the masses of the planets don't affect their orbital periods, so the given mass ratios are a red herring. So I don't need to consider them in the calculation.

So then, the calculation I did earlier stands. The period ratio is about 33.4, so option D is the answer.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So yes, option D is ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant astronomical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)
   Using the equilibrium temperature formula, \( T \propto d^{-1/2} \), the distance ratios are:
   \[
   d_2 / d_1 = (T_1 / T_2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
   \]
   \[
   d_3 / d_2 = (T_2 / T_3)^2 = (2.3)^2 \approx 5.29
   \]
   Combining these, the distance of Planet3 relative to Planet1 is:
   \[
   d_3 / d_1 = d_3 / d_2 \cdot d_2 / d_1 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \approx 10.368
   \]

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   The orbital period \( P \) is related to the distance \( d \) by \( P^2 \propto d^3 \). Thus:
   \[
   P_3 / P_1 = \sqrt{(d_3 / d_1)^3}
   \]
   Substituting \( d_3 / d_1 \approx 10.368 \):
   \[
   (d_3 / d_1)^3 \approx 10.368^3 \approx 1114.51
   \]
   \[
   P_3 / P_1 = \sqrt{1114.51} \approx 33.4
   \]

3. **Mass Ratios**:
   The mass ratios (\( M_1 / M_2 = 1.15 \), \( M_2 / M_3 = 1.35 \)) are provided but are not relevant here. Kepler's law depends on the star's mass and the planet's distance, not the planet's mass. Since all three planets orbit the same star, the mass ratios do not affect the orbital period calculation.

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This corresponds to option **D**.
