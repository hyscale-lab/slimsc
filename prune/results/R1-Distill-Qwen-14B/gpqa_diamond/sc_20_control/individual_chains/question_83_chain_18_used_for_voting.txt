Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can check my work against them once I figure it out.

First, when you dilute a solution, you can find the new concentration using the dilution formula. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and the initial concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

So the dilution calculation is M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 is (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40? Wait, 0.05 *20 =1 mmol? Wait, no, in terms of moles, but let's compute it correctly.

Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So M1 = 0.05 M. So initial moles of acetic acid are M1 * V1 = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Because 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L, and 0.02 L is 20 mL.

Then when you add 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL, so 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But when we titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, they'll react completely.

Now, during titration, the moles of NaOH added will react with the acetic acid (CH3COOH). The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of CH3COOH initially present.

So let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. As I calculated, it's 0.001 mol. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed at equivalence point is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point. So what's 25% of the equivalence volume? 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 25% titration, 2.5 mL of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's tackle each part: pH at 25% and at equivalence.

First, the 25% point.

At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of CH3COOH that have reacted are 0.00025 mol. So the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001 mol. So remaining moles of CH3COOH are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total solution volume at 25% titration is the initial solution (40 mL) plus the NaOH added (2.5 mL). So 42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.735 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733, approximately 4.73).

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is around 4.25. So looking at the options, the first part for the 25% point is about 4.25 or 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na+), which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The moles of acetate at equivalence are 0.001 mol (same as initial acetic acid moles). The total volume at equivalence is 40 mL (diluted acetic acid) + 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is about 5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration, we can approximate:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M

pH is calculated from pOH first: pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98

Then pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, none of them have 9.02 as the second value. Hmm, what did I do wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. That's correct.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb = x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 3.288e-6.

Wait, wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is about 3.288e-6, not 1e-5. Because (3.288e-6)^2 is about 1e-11. So [OH^-] is ~3.288e-6.

Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517, so pOH=5.483. pH=14-5.483=8.517. So approximately 8.52.

Wait, that makes more sense. So pH at equivalence is around 8.52. So looking at the options, option A says 4.26;8.52.

But let me check my initial calculation again for the 25% point. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch gave pH around 4.25, which is close to option D (4.57) or option A (4.26).

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the ratio. Let me redo that.

After adding 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.00025 moles. So in 42.5 mL (0.0425 L):

moles CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol

moles CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So the log(1/3) = log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = pKa (4.73) + (-0.477) → 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, so about 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, and 8.52 as the second. That seems to fit.

Wait, but the options list option D as 4.57; 6.92. How did that happen? Perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the concentration of acetate at equivalence. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, total volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL (NaOH) = 50 mL, 0.05 L. Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x²=0.02 *5.405e-10=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

[OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517, which is approx 8.52.

So at equivalence, pH is ~8.52.

So for the first part, 25% is ~4.25, equivalence is ~8.52. So the option is A) 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: when diluting, did I get the concentration right? Let me double-check.

Initial volume:20 mL, conc 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 mL water, total 40 mL. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

So the 25% point is 4.26, equivalence is 8.52. So the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid reacts, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total solution volume at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at equivalence is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis of acetate ion in water is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \(\text{K}_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}\), where \(x = [\text{OH}^-]\):

\[
x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately \(4.26\), and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately \(8.52\). Thus, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can check my work against them once I figure it out.

First, when you dilute a solution, you can find the new concentration using the dilution formula. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and the initial concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

So the dilution calculation is M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 is (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40? Wait, 0.05 *20 =1 mmol? Wait, no, in terms of moles, but let's compute it correctly.

Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So M1 = 0.05 M. So initial moles of acetic acid are M1 * V1 = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Because 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L, and 0.02 L is 20 mL.

Then when you add 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL, so 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But when we titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, they'll react completely.

Now, during titration, the moles of NaOH added will react with the acetic acid (CH3COOH). The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of CH3COOH initially present.

So let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. As I calculated, it's 0.001 mol. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed at equivalence point is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point. So what's 25% of the equivalence volume? 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 25% titration, 2.5 mL of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's tackle each part: pH at 25% and at equivalence.

First, the 25% point.

At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of CH3COOH that have reacted are 0.00025 mol. So the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001 mol. So remaining moles of CH3COOH are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total solution volume at 25% titration is the initial solution (40 mL) plus the NaOH added (2.5 mL). So 42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.735 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733, approximately 4.73).

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is around 4.25. So looking at the options, the first part for the 25% point is about 4.25 or 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na+), which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The moles of acetate at equivalence are 0.001 mol (same as initial acetic acid moles). The total volume at equivalence is 40 mL (diluted acetic acid) + 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is about 5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration, we can approximate:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M

pH is calculated from pOH first: pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98

Then pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, none of them have 9.02 as the second value. Hmm, what did I do wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. That's correct.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb = x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 3.288e-6.

Wait, wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is about 3.288e-6, not 1e-5. Because (3.288e-6)^2 is about 1e-11. So [OH^-] is ~3.288e-6.

Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517, so pOH=5.483. pH=14-5.483=8.517. So approximately 8.52.

Wait, that makes more sense. So pH at equivalence is around 8.52. So looking at the options, option A says 4.26;8.52.

But let me check my initial calculation again for the 25% point. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch gave pH around 4.25, which is close to option D (4.57) or option A (4.26).

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the ratio. Let me redo that.

After adding 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.00025 moles. So in 42.5 mL (0.0425 L):

moles CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol

moles CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So the log(1/3) = log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = pKa (4.73) + (-0.477) → 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, so about 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, and 8.52 as the second. That seems to fit.

Wait, but the options list option D as 4.57; 6.92. How did that happen? Perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the concentration of acetate at equivalence. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, total volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL (NaOH) = 50 mL, 0.05 L. Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x²=0.02 *5.405e-10=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

[OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517, which is approx 8.52.

So at equivalence, pH is ~8.52.

So for the first part, 25% is ~4.25, equivalence is ~8.52. So the option is A) 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: when diluting, did I get the concentration right? Let me double-check.

Initial volume:20 mL, conc 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 mL water, total 40 mL. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

So the 25% point is 4.26, equivalence is 8.52. So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid reacts, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total solution volume at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at equivalence is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis of acetate ion in water is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \(\text{K}_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}\), where \(x = [\text{OH}^-]\):

\[
x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately \(4.26\), and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately \(8.52\). Thus, the correct option is:
