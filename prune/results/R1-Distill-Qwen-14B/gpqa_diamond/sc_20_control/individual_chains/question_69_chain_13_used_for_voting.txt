Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀=8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer when they're moving at high speeds because of time dilation. So first, I probably need to calculate the lifetime as observed in the lab frame, which is the Bubble Chamber. Then, figure out how far the decay products travel, and based on that, determine the resolution needed.

Wait, the proper lifetime is τ₀. The lab frame lifetime τ is gamma times tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is the energy divided by the rest mass energy. Oh right, because gamma = E / m_rest. So E is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917... So gamma is about 8.

So tau, the lifetime in the lab frame, is gamma times tau_0. That's 8 * 8e-16 seconds. Let's calculate that: 8 * 8e-16 is 64e-16, which is 6.4e-15 seconds.

Now, the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The distance is velocity multiplied by time. The velocity can be found using beta * c, where beta is v/c. But beta is related to gamma. Since gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta²), I can find beta from gamma.

Alternatively, I remember that beta is approximately equal to gamma when gamma is large, but wait, gamma here is about 8, which isn't super large. Let me calculate beta properly.

Gamma is E/(m c²), but wait, in units where c=1, like in particle physics, so beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Yeah, that's the formula. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So with gamma=8, 1/gamma² is 1/64. So 1 - 1/64 is 63/64 ≈ 0.984375. The square root of that is sqrt(0.984375) ≈ approximately 0.9921567. So beta is about 0.992.

So the velocity v is beta * c. So the distance the particle travels before decaying is L = beta * c * tau.

Let me plug in the numbers. c is 3e8 meters per second. Tau is 6.4e-15 seconds. Beta is 0.992. So L ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.4e-15 s.

Wait, wait, hold on. Let me compute that step by step.

0.992 * 3e8 is approximately 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.4e-15 s gives (2.976e8) * (6.4e-15) = let's see, 2.976 * 6.4 = approx 19.06. Then 1e8 * 1e-15 = 1e-7. So 19.06e-7 meters, which is 1.906e-6 meters, or about 1.906 micrometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so the observation requires that the decay is detected, I think. So perhaps I need to ensure that the decay length is at least a certain fraction. Or maybe the resolution relates to the distance over which the decay is spread?

Wait, no. The problem states that the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh, wait—I think I might be missing something here. Maybe it's about the detection of the decay products, and the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point.

Wait, perhaps the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So if the particle's lifetime is longer, it moves further, so the decay length is longer. The resolution of the detector must be sufficient to pinpoint where the decay occurred. If the resolution is too low, you can't tell if the decay happened within a small region—you might miss some.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the proper decay length. Wait, no, the problem says the proper lifetime is given. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay length is longer.

Wait, but why would the minimum resolution needed to see 30% of the decays relate to the decay length? Hmm. Maybe they mean that the detector has a certain spatial resolution, and if the decay occurs over a region larger than that, the probability of detecting it is lower. So to get at least 30% of the decays detected, the resolution (the smallest feature the detector can see) must be less than some fraction of the decay length.

Wait, perhaps the decay length is the average distance the particle travels. The probability of observing the decay is related to the detector's ability to resolve it. So maybe the minimum resolution is the decay length multiplied by a certain factor. Or perhaps the 30% refers to the fraction of decays that happen within a certain distance, like within one mean decay length or something.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. The mean decay length is beta gamma c tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0, which is beta c tau.

Wait, wait, the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = beta c gamma tau_0 = beta c tau.

So in our case, that's approx 1.906e-6 meters, which is about 1.9 micrometers.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So what does "minimum resolution" mean here? If the detector has a spatial resolution (like the smallest distance it can measure), then perhaps to detect a decay, the decay must occur within a region smaller than the resolution. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's the other way around: the detector can only resolve events if the decay occurs within a certain area. If the decay length is too long, the decay products are spread out, making it harder to pinpoint the decay location. So the resolution must be such that the decay is detected at least 30% of the time.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the fraction of decays that are detected, given the detector's resolution. So the detector's resolution is the smallest distance it can measure. If the decay length is much larger than the resolution, the decay is more likely to be detected. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the time resolution required to measure the decay time accurately. But that doesn't seem right because tau is given as 8e-16 s, but the energy and mass are given, so it's more about the length.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the precision needed in the measurement of the decay products' paths. If the decay occurs, the products will leave tracks in the Bubble Chamber. The spatial resolution of the detector must be good enough to distinguish the decay vertex from the tracks.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Maybe the minimum resolution required refers to the distance over which the particle must decay for it to be observed. So if the decay length is L, then the detector must have a spatial resolution (the smallest detail it can see) that is less than some fraction of L to observe a certain percentage of decays.

Wait, perhaps the 30% refers to the probability that the decay occurs within a certain region. So the decay is a Poisson process, and the probability that the decay happens within a length d is P = 1 - e^{-d/(L)}. So if we set P = 0.3, then d = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The probability that the decay occurs within a distance x is P = 1 - e^{-x/L}, where L is the mean decay length. So if x is the distance over which the decay is observed, then for P=0.3, x = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

Wait, let me compute that. ln(1/0.7) is about ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567. So x = L * 0.3567. So the minimum distance x needed to capture 30% of the decays is about 0.3567 times L.

So L is about 1.906e-6 meters. So x is 0.3567 * 1.906e-6 ≈ 6.8e-7 meters, which is 0.68 micrometers.

Wait, but the options given are 2.08e-6, 2.08e-9, etc. Hmm, none of them match 0.68e-6. So maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is more about calculating the decay length and then ensuring that the detector's resolution is such that it can observe this length. But why 30%?

Alternatively, maybe the minimum resolution refers to the precision needed to determine the decay point. If the decay length is L, then the detector's spatial resolution must be much smaller than L to accurately measure the decay position. So the resolution should be a certain fraction of L, like maybe comparable or smaller.

Wait, but the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the idea is that if the resolution is too poor, the decay is not detected. So we need to find the resolution that allows at least 30% of decays to be detected, which would require the resolution to be at most a certain fraction of the decay length.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the proper calculation of the decay length and the minimum possible resolution being on the order of that length. But the options have 2.08e-6 m as an option, which is about twice the L I calculated earlier.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation of L. Let's compute it more accurately.

Gamma is E / m, E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV, so gamma=27/3.41≈7.91783.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s. So tau = gamma * tau_0 = 7.91783 *8e-16 s ≈6.334e-15 s.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

gamma=7.91783, gamma squared is approximately 62.692.

So 1/gamma² is 1/62.692≈0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405.

Square root of 0.98405 is approximately 0.99201.

So beta is approximately 0.99201.

So L = beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L=0.99201 * 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s.

Let me compute this:

0.99201 * 3 = 2.97603.

2.97603e8 m/s multiplied by 6.334e-15 s:

(2.97603 * 6.334) * 1e8 * 1e-15 = (18.905) * 1e-7 = 1.8905e-6 meters.

So approximately 1.89e-6 meters, which is 1.89 micrometers.

Hmm. If the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)
B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)
C) 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm, seems too big)
D) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

Hmm. The closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

But why is that different from my calculation? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me recalculate gamma more precisely:

27 / 3.41 = let's compute it. 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 7.9 = 27.0 (since 3.41 * 7 =23.87, 3.41 *7.9=23.87 + (3.41 *0.9)=23.87 +3.069=26.939, which is close to 27. So 7.9 is about 7.9178. So my initial calculation of gamma=7.9178 is correct.

Tau is gamma * tau0 = 7.9178 * 8e-16 = 63.3424e-16 = 6.33424e-15 s.

Beta: sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (27/3.41)^2 = (27)^2/(3.41)^2 = 729 / 11.6281 = approx 62.692.

So 1/(gamma^2)= 1/62.692≈0.01595.

1 - 0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405) = 0.99201.

So beta is 0.99201.

L= beta * c * tau.

c=2.99792e8 m/s. Let's use c=3e8 for an approximate calculation.

So L=0.99201 * 3e8 m/s * 6.33424e-15 s.

3e8 *6.33424e-15 = 1.900272e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.99201: 1.900272e-6 *0.99201 ≈ 1.89e-6 m, which is about 1.89 micrometers.

Hmm, but the option A is 2.08e-6 m. That's about 10% larger than my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of beta?

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

Let me compute gamma^2 precisely. Gamma is 27/3.41.

Let me compute 27 / 3.41:

3.41 *7=23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.41 *0.915=?

3.41 *0.9=3.069; 3.41*0.015=0.05115. Sum is 3.12015.

So 7 + 0.915 =7.915.

3.41 *7.915=3.41*(7+0.915)=23.87 + (3.41 *0.915).

Compute 3.41 *0.915:

3 *0.915=2.745, 0.41 *0.915=0.37515. Sum is 3.12015.

So 3.41 *7.915=23.87 +3.12015=26.99015. Close to 27, so gamma is 7.915.

So gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2= (27)^2/(3.41)^2.

27^2=729.

3.41^2= (3.4)^2=11.56, but 3.41^2= (3.4 +0.01)^2= 3.4^2 + 2*(3.4)*(0.01) +0.01^2=11.56 +0.068 +0.0001=11.6281.

So gamma squared=729/11.6281≈62.692. Correct.

So beta= sqrt(1-1/62.692)=sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405).

Let me compute sqrt(0.98405) accurately.

We can compute it step by step. Let me think.

We know that 0.99^2=0.9801. 0.992^2= (0.99+0.002)^2=0.9801 + 2*0.99*0.002 + (0.002)^2=0.9801 + 0.00396 + 0.000004=0.984064.

Wait, our value is 0.98405, which is very close to 0.984064. So sqrt(0.98405)≈0.992.

Because 0.992^2=0.984064, which is just a bit higher than 0.98405. So perhaps the exact value of beta is approximately 0.99199 or something. But for all practical purposes, it's 0.992.

So with that, L= approximately 1.89e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me compute beta more precisely.

We can compute it as beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Because gamma = E/(m c²), but since we use units where c=1, gamma = E/m.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41²)/(27²)).

Compute 3.41^2 = 11.6281.

27^2=729.

So 11.6281/729= approx 0.015962.

1-0.015962=0.984038.

sqrt(0.984038)= let me compute this accurately.

We can use a calculator method. Let's say x=0.984038.

We know that 0.992^2=0.984064.

Our x is 0.984038, which is 0.984064-0.000026= 0.984038.

So the difference is 0.000026 less than 0.992^2.

We can approximate the square root with a Taylor expansion.

Let me let a=0.992, a²=0.984064.

We have x= a² - 0.000026.

We want to find a - delta such that (a - delta)^2 = x.

(a - delta)^2 = a² - 2 a delta + delta² = x.

Since delta is small, delta² is negligible.

So 2 a delta ≈ (a² - x) = 0.000026.

So delta ≈ 0.000026/(2 a) = 0.000026/(2*0.992) ≈ 0.000026/1.984 ≈ 0.0000131.

So a - delta ≈ 0.992 - 0.0000131 = approx 0.9919869.

So beta ≈ 0.991987.

So, beta is approximately 0.991987.

So now, L= beta * c * tau.

c=2.99792e8 m/s.

Tau= 7.9178 *8e-16=63.3424e-16=6.33424e-15 s.

So L=0.991987 * 2.99792e8 m/s *6.33424e-15 s.

Compute 2.99792e8 *6.33424e-15:

2.99792 *6.33424= approx 18.903.

Multiply by 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7.

So 18.903e-7=1.8903e-6 m.

Now multiply by 0.991987: 1.8903e-6 *0.991987≈1.8903e-6 *0.992 ≈1.875e-6 m.

Wait, that's about 1.875 micrometers.

So why is the option A 2.08e-6 m?

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute gamma as (E² - m²)^(1/2)/m.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²). Since c=1, gamma=E/m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta as follows:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt(1 - ( (3.41)^2 )/(27^2)).

Which is sqrt(1 - (11.6281)/(729)).

11.6281/729=0.015962.

1-0.015962=0.984038.

So sqrt(0.984038)=0.991987 as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of L.

Let me compute L= beta * c * tau.

Compute with exact numbers:

beta= sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt( (E² - m²)/E² ) = sqrt(E² - m²)/E.

So beta = sqrt( (27^2 - 3.41^2 ) ) / 27.

So 27^2=729, 3.41^2=11.6281.

729 - 11.6281=717.3719.

So sqrt(717.3719)=approx 26.783.

So beta=26.783/27= approx 0.99196.

Hmm, that's more precise.

So beta=0.99196.

Now, c=2.99792e8 m/s.

Tau=gamma * tau0= (27/3.41) *8e-16=7.91783 *8e-16=63.3426e-16=6.33426e-15 s.

So L= beta * c * tau.

So 0.99196 *2.99792e8 *6.33426e-15.

Compute 2.99792e8 *6.33426e-15:

2.99792 *6.33426≈ (3 *6.33)=18.99, but let's compute exactly:

2.99792 * 6.33426:

Break it down: 2 *6.33426=12.66852; 0.99792 *6.33426≈ (1 - 0.00208)*6.33426≈6.33426 - (0.00208 *6.33426)≈6.33426 -0.013178≈6.32108.

So 12.66852 +6.32108=18.9896.

So 18.9896e-7 (since 1e8 * 1e-15=1e-7) → 1.89896e-6 m.

Multiply by beta: 0.99196 *1.89896e-6 ≈ (0.99196 *1.89896) e-6.

Compute 0.99196 *1.89896:

Approx 1.89896 *0.99 ≈1.88.

But more accurately: 1.89896 *0.99196 ≈ let's compute.

1.89896 *1 =1.89896.

1.89896 *0.99 = 1.89896 * (1 -0.01) =1.89896 -0.0189896=1.87997.

But we have 0.99196, which is 0.99 + 0.00196.

So 1.89896 *0.99196 ≈1.87997 + (1.89896 *0.00196).

1.89896 *0.00196 ≈approx 0.00372.

So total ≈1.87997 +0.00372=1.88369.

So L≈1.88369e-6 m, or 1.88369 micrometers.

Hmm, so about 1.88 micrometers.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. That's about 10% higher than our calculation. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma tau_0.

Wait, gamma is 27 /3.41=7.91783.

Tau_0=8e-16 s.

So gamma *tau_0=7.91783 *8e-16=63.3426e-16 = 6.33426e-15 s.

Yes.

So all the calculations seem correct, so perhaps the intended answer is option A, and the setup expects using gamma = E/(m) and beta= sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)).

Wait, maybe the question is about the mean lifetime tau, but the proper lifetime is tau0, so the lifetime observed is gamma * tau0. Then, velocity is beta c, so the mean decay length is beta c gamma tau0.

Which is beta c tau. So the same as before.

Hmm. If the calculation gives approximately 1.88e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m, which is a slight variation. Maybe the problem used rounded numbers.

Wait, perhaps the mass is 3.41 GeV, but the energy is 27 GeV. Let me compute gamma again.

Gamma = E/m =27 /3.41 =7.91783.

So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses c=3e8 m/s instead of the more precise 2.99792e8. Let's see.

If c=3e8, then:

beta*c*tau = 0.99196 *3e8 *6.33426e-15.

Compute 3e8 *6.33426e-15= 1.900278e-6.

Multiply by 0.99196: 1.900278e-6 *0.99196≈1.883e-6. Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So maybe the problem is that the detector's spatial resolution is the minimum distance that can be measured. So if the decay length is L, then to have a certain efficiency, the resolution must be much smaller than L.

Wait, if the resolution is the smallest distance the detector can measure, say, d, then the probability that the decay is detected is the fraction of the decay that occurs within a distance d from the production point. So the probability P is given by P = 1 - e^{-d/L}.

So we set P=0.3.

So 0.3 = 1 - e^{-d/(L)}.

Thus, e^{-d/L} = 0.7 → -d/L = ln(0.7) → d = - L ln(0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So d ≈ 0.3567 * L.

In our case, L≈1.88e-6 m, so d≈0.3567 *1.88e-6≈6.70e-7 m, which is 0.67 micrometers.

But this isn't matching any of the options. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relation between the resolution and the decay length.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum possible energy resolution, but no, the question is about spatial resolution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the minimum resolution is the uncertainty in the position of the decay. So if the decay occurs over a range, the detector's resolution must be sufficient to capture that range. The required resolution should be such that the uncertainty is less than the decay length.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." Maybe it's about the efficiency of the detector in detecting the decay events. So if the decay length is longer, the particles have a longer path, making it harder to detect (if the detector's resolution is low), but if the resolution is high enough, you can detect more decays.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe the proper lifetime is given, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. The minimum resolution refers to the time resolution, but the options are in meters, which is a spatial measure.

Wait, the question says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps it's the spatial resolution; the detector must be able to pinpoint the decay within a certain distance from the original point for it to be detected. 

But then, what's the formula that relates the detector's resolution (say, delta_x) to the probability of detecting the decay?

Hmm, perhaps the probability that the decay occurs within delta_x is P = (1 - e^{-delta_x/L}) - e^{-delta_x/L} * (delta_x/L) ?

No, wait, the probability that the decay occurs within a length x is P=1 - e^{-x/L}.

So, if the detector's resolution is delta_x, then the probability that the decay occurs within delta_x is P=1 - e^{-delta_x/L}.

We want P >= 0.3 → 1 - e^{-delta_x/L} >=0.3 → e^{-delta_x/L} <=0.7 → -delta_x/L <= ln(0.7) → delta_x >= - L ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567 L.

So delta_x_min = 0.3567 * L.

So with L≈1.88e-6 m, delta_x_min≈0.3567 *1.88e-6≈6.70e-7 m. But none of the options are that small.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)
B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)
...

Wait, if delta_x is 2.08e-6 m, then let's compute P.

delta_x=2.08e-6 m.

P=1 - e^{-2.08e-6 /1.88e-6}.

2.08e-6 /1.88e-6 ≈1.106.

e^{-1.106}=approx 0.331.

So P=1-0.331=0.669, which is about 66.9% probability. That's higher than 30%, so if the resolution is 2.08e-6 m, you get about 67% of the decays observed.

But the question asks for at least 30%, so this would satisfy it. So perhaps the minimum resolution is 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, why would the answer be option A? Because when using delta_x=2.08e-6 m, the probability is about 67%, which is way above 30%, so perhaps the minimum resolution required is even lower. Because 30% is much lower than 67%.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased in reverse. It says "the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So the resolution needs to be such that at least 30% are detected, which would require a smaller delta_x than what gives 30% P. Because a higher P requires a larger delta_x.

Wait, no, the higher the delta_x, the higher the P. So to get at least 30% of the decays, the delta_x can be as low as the value that gives P=30%.

Wait, but the answer options are much higher. So perhaps the question is not about the position resolution but something else.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem refers to the time resolution. But the question is about spatial resolution, given the options are in meters.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the velocity and the time it takes for the decay, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.

The decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So the probability that the decay occurs within a length d is P=1 - e^{-d/L}.

We need P >=0.3 → d >= L ln(1/(1-0.3))= L ln(1/0.7)≈0.3567 L.

So to get 30% of the decays, the minimum d is 0.3567 L.

But the question is about the resolution, which is the smallest detectable distance. So if the detector's resolution is d_res, then the probability to detect the decay is P=1 - e^{-d_res/L}.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased in terms of the maximum acceptable d_res to capture a certain P. So if d_res is the maximum distance, then P=1 -e^{-d_res/L}.

Wait, but the question says 'minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30%'. So perhaps the resolution is the maximum d_res allowed, as any larger and you can't detect. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the decay length itself. Because if the detector can't resolve distances smaller than L, then you can't pinpoint the decay location. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem states that the minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution must be smaller than the decay length to have any chance of observing the decay. But this reasoning doesn't directly give a numerical value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply about computing the decay length, and the answer is option A (2.08e-6 m), regardless of the 30% part. But why is the 30% included?

Wait, perhaps the 30% refers to the efficiency of detection. So the detector must be able to resolve the decay within a certain distance, and the efficiency is 30%.

But without more information on how the resolution affects the detection efficiency, it's hard to model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the velocity and the proper lifetime.

Wait, another thought: in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay length is longer. The minimum resolution would be the decay length itself, as you need to be able to see it. But why 30%?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as using relativistic momentum or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity.

Beta is approximately 0.992, so v=beta c ≈0.992 *3e8 m/s=2.976e8 m/s.

The proper lifetime is tau0=8e-16 s.

So the decay length L= v * tau =2.976e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s= (2.976 *6.334) *1e-7.

2.976 *6.334≈18.91.

So L=18.91e-7 m=1.891e-6 m.

Again, about 1.89e-6 m. So option A is 2.08e-6, which is approximately 10% higher.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects using gamma = 27/3.41 ≈7.9178, and then beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )= sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )= same as before.

So perhaps the intended answer is 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2.08 micrometers.

But why is that? Because 2.08e-6 is option A, and the calculation leads to about 1.88e-6. But perhaps the numbers in the problem are approximated.

Wait, 2.08e-6 is approximately 1.88e-6 * (2.08/1.88)≈ 20% higher. Maybe the problem used more precise gamma.

Wait, let me recompute gamma with more precise numbers.

Gamma=27 /3.41.

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.41 ×0.915=?

3.41 ×0.9=3.069.

3.41 ×0.015=0.05115.

3.069 +0.05115=3.12015.

So 7.915 ×3.41=27. So gamma=7.915.

So gamma=7.915.

Then, L= beta c gamma tau0.

Wait, tau=gamma tau0, so L= beta c gamma tau0.

So gamma=7.915, tau0=8e-16 s.

beta=0.99196.

So L= 0.99196 * 3e8 m/s *7.915 *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *7.915= 2.3745e9.

2.3745e9 *8e-16= 1.8996e-6.

Multiply by 0.99196: 1.8996e-6 *0.99196≈1.883e-6 m.

Again, same result.

So, no, the calculation is consistent.

Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, considering that the problem expects rounding or perhaps the calculation is done differently.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta more accurately.

Let me compute beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )

Compute 3.41/27=0.126296.

(0.126296)^2=0.015949.

So 1-0.015949=0.984051.

sqrt(0.984051)=0.992005.

So beta=0.992005.

So L=0.992005 *3e8 *6.33426e-15.

Which is same as before, giving 1.883e-6.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed of light as 3e8 m/s, and the calculation is done as:

L = (27 /3.41) * (3e8) * (8e-16) * sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )

Wait, let me compute that.

(27/3.41)=7.9178.

(3e8 m/s) * (8e-16 s) =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.9178: 2.4e-7 *7.9178≈1.9003e-6 m.

Multiply by beta=0.992005: 1.9003e-6 *0.992005≈1.883e-6 m.

Again, same result.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the answer is A, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor in the calculation. Maybe the energy is 27 GeV, but the particle's momentum is not simply E=pc, because for particles with mass, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that gamma=E/m. Because for a relativistic particle, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. So p = gamma m v.

Wait, but when considering E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v.

But perhaps I should compute beta using beta = (pc²)/(E), since p=E beta.

Wait, another approach: beta = (pc²)/E.

But for a relativistic particle, E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v.

But v=beta c, so p = gamma m beta c.

So, beta = (p c²)/(E) = (gamma m beta c * c²)/(gamma m c²) )= (gamma m beta c^3 )/(gamma m c^2 ) )= beta c.

Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, beta = p c / E.

So, if E=27 GeV, and m=3.41 GeV/c².

So, p c = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) GeV.

Which is sqrt(729 - 11.6281 )=sqrt(717.3719 )= approx26.78 GeV.

So p c =26.78 GeV.

So beta = (p c)/(E) =26.78 /27=0.99185.

Which is consistent with our previous calculation of beta≈0.992.

So, with beta=0.99185, then L= beta c tau =0.99185 *3e8 *6.334e-15.

Which is the same as before, giving 1.88e-6 m.

So, the calculation is consistent.

So, the only thing I can think is that the intended answer is option A, perhaps due to rounding in the problem's given numbers.

Looking back, perhaps the mass is given as 3.41 GeV, which is 3.41 GeV/c², and the energy is 27 GeV. So, to compute gamma, it's E/(m c²), but with c=1 in these units, gamma=27/3.41=7.9178.

So perhaps the intended answer is 2.08e-6 m, which is option A.

But based on calculation, I'm getting approximately 1.88e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6), but not exactly. However, given the options, I think the intended answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we start by calculating the decay length \( L \), which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying in the lab frame. The decay length is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \) is the proper lifetime of \( X^0 \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy of the particle is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), and its rest mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9178
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
Using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.9178)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{62.692}} = \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \) in the lab frame
The lifetime in the lab frame is \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \):

\[
\tau = 7.9178 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0 = \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
L = 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \times 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \approx 1.9002 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Now multiply by \( \beta \):

\[
L = 0.992 \times 1.9002 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 1.883 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the decay length is approximately \( 1.883 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 5: Relating resolution to the decay length
The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The probability of detecting a decay within a distance \( d \) is given by:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-d/L}
\]

For \( P = 0.3 \), we solve for \( d \):

\[
0.3 = 1 - e^{-d/L} \implies e^{-d/L} = 0.7 \implies -\frac{d}{L} = \ln(0.7) \implies d = -L \ln(0.7)
\]

Using \( \ln(0.7) \approx -0.3567 \):

\[
d = 0.3567 \times L \approx 0.3567 \times 1.883 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.70 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]

This is the minimum distance \( d \) needed to detect 30% of the decays. However, the question likely refers to the decay length \( L \) itself as the relevant scale for resolution. Comparing this to the options:

- **Option A: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)** (2.08 \( \mu\text{m} \)) is close to the calculated decay length of \( 1.883 \, \mu\text{m} \), with a small discrepancy likely due to rounding in the problem's parameters.
- **Option B: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)** (2.08 \( \text{nm} \)) is far too small.
- **Option C: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{m} \)** (20.8 \( \text{cm} \)) is far too large.
- **Option D: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \)** (2.08 \( \text{mm} \)) is also far too large.

Thus, the most reasonable answer is **Option A**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀=8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer when they're moving at high speeds because of time dilation. So first, I probably need to calculate the lifetime as observed in the lab frame, which is the Bubble Chamber. Then, figure out how far the decay products travel, and based on that, determine the resolution needed.

Wait, the proper lifetime is τ₀. The lab frame lifetime τ is gamma times tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is the energy divided by the rest mass energy. Oh right, because gamma = E / m_rest. So E is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917... So gamma is about 8.

So tau, the lifetime in the lab frame, is gamma times tau_0. That's 8 * 8e-16 seconds. Let's calculate that: 8 * 8e-16 is 64e-16, which is 6.4e-15 seconds.

Now, the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The distance is velocity multiplied by time. The velocity can be found using beta * c, where beta is v/c. But beta is related to gamma. Since gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta²), I can find beta from gamma.

Alternatively, I remember that beta is approximately equal to gamma when gamma is large, but wait, gamma here is about 8, which isn't super large. Let me calculate beta properly.

Gamma is E/(m c²), but wait, in units where c=1, like in particle physics, so beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Yeah, that's the formula. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So with gamma=8, 1/gamma² is 1/64. So 1 - 1/64 is 63/64 ≈ 0.984375. The square root of that is sqrt(0.984375) ≈ approximately 0.9921567. So beta is about 0.992.

So the velocity v is beta * c. So the distance the particle travels before decaying is L = beta * c * tau.

Let me plug in the numbers. c is 3e8 meters per second. Tau is 6.4e-15 seconds. Beta is 0.992. So L ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.4e-15 s.

Wait, wait, hold on. Let me compute that step by step.

0.992 * 3e8 is approximately 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.4e-15 s gives (2.976e8) * (6.4e-15) = let's see, 2.976 * 6.4 = approx 19.06. Then 1e8 * 1e-15 = 1e-7. So 19.06e-7 meters, which is 1.906e-6 meters, or about 1.906 micrometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so the observation requires that the decay is detected, I think. So perhaps I need to ensure that the decay length is at least a certain fraction. Or maybe the resolution relates to the distance over which the decay is spread?

Wait, no. The problem states that the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh, wait—I think I might be missing something here. Maybe it's about the detection of the decay products, and the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point.

Wait, perhaps the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So if the particle's lifetime is longer, it moves further, so the decay length is longer. The resolution of the detector must be sufficient to pinpoint where the decay occurred. If the resolution is too low, you can't tell if the decay happened within a small region—you might miss some.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the proper decay length. Wait, no, the problem says the proper lifetime is given. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay length is longer.

Wait, but why would the minimum resolution needed to see 30% of the decays relate to the decay length? Hmm. Maybe they mean that the detector has a certain spatial resolution, and if the decay occurs over a region larger than that, the probability of detecting it is lower. So to get at least 30% of the decays detected, the resolution (the smallest feature the detector can see) must be less than some fraction of the decay length.

Wait, perhaps the decay length is the average distance the particle travels. The probability of observing the decay is related to the detector's ability to resolve it. So maybe the minimum resolution is the decay length multiplied by a certain factor. Or perhaps the 30% refers to the fraction of decays that happen within a certain distance, like within one mean decay length or something.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. The mean decay length is beta gamma c tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0, which is beta c tau.

Wait, wait, the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = beta c gamma tau_0 = beta c tau.

So in our case, that's approx 1.906e-6 meters, which is about 1.9 micrometers.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So what does "minimum resolution" mean here? If the detector has a spatial resolution (like the smallest distance it can measure), then perhaps to detect a decay, the decay must occur within a region smaller than the resolution. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's the other way around: the detector can only resolve events if the decay occurs within a certain area. If the decay length is too long, the decay products are spread out, making it harder to pinpoint the decay location. So the resolution must be such that the decay is detected at least 30% of the time.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the fraction of decays that are detected, given the detector's resolution. So the detector's resolution is the smallest distance it can measure. If the decay length is much larger than the resolution, the decay is more likely to be detected. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the time resolution required to measure the decay time accurately. But that doesn't seem right because tau is given as 8e-16 s, but the energy and mass are given, so it's more about the length.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the precision needed in the measurement of the decay products' paths. If the decay occurs, the products will leave tracks in the Bubble Chamber. The spatial resolution of the detector must be good enough to distinguish the decay vertex from the tracks.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Maybe the minimum resolution required refers to the distance over which the particle must decay for it to be observed. So if the decay length is L, then the detector must have a spatial resolution (the smallest detail it can see) that is less than some fraction of L to observe a certain percentage of decays.

Wait, perhaps the 30% refers to the probability that the decay occurs within a certain region. So the decay is a Poisson process, and the probability that the decay happens within a length d is P = 1 - e^{-d/(L)}. So if we set P = 0.3, then d = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The probability that the decay occurs within a distance x is P = 1 - e^{-x/L}, where L is the mean decay length. So if x is the distance over which the decay is observed, then for P=0.3, x = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

Wait, let me compute that. ln(1/0.7) is about ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567. So x = L * 0.3567. So the minimum distance x needed to capture 30% of the decays is about 0.3567 times L.

So L is about 1.906e-6 meters. So x is 0.3567 * 1.906e-6 ≈ 6.8e-7 meters, which is 0.68 micrometers.

Wait, but the options given are 2.08e-6, 2.08e-9, etc. Hmm, none of them match 0.68e-6. So maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is more about calculating the decay length and then ensuring that the detector's resolution is such that it can observe this length. But why 30%?

Alternatively, maybe the minimum resolution refers to the precision needed to determine the decay point. If the decay length is L, then the detector's spatial resolution must be much smaller than L to accurately measure the decay position. So the resolution should be a certain fraction of L, like maybe comparable or smaller.

Wait, but the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the idea is that if the resolution is too poor, the decay is not detected. So we need to find the resolution that allows at least 30% of decays to be detected, which would require the resolution to be at most a certain fraction of the decay length.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the proper calculation of the decay length and the minimum possible resolution being on the order of that length. But the options have 2.08e-6 m as an option, which is about twice the L I calculated earlier.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation of L. Let's compute it more accurately.

Gamma is E / m, E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV, so gamma=27/3.41≈7.91783.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s. So tau = gamma * tau_0 = 7.91783 *8e-16 s ≈6.334e-15 s.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

gamma=7.91783, gamma squared is approximately 62.692.

So 1/gamma² is 1/62.692≈0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405.

Square root of 0.98405 is approximately 0.99201.

So beta is approximately 0.99201.

So L = beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L=0.99201 * 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s.

Let me compute this:

0.99201 * 3 = 2.97603.

2.97603e8 m/s multiplied by 6.334e-15 s:

(2.97603 * 6.334) * 1e8 * 1e-15 = (18.905) * 1e-7 = 1.8905e-6 meters.

So approximately 1.89e-6 meters, which is 1.89 micrometers.

Hmm. If the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)
B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)
C) 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm, seems too big)
D) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

Hmm. The closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

But why is that different from my calculation? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me recalculate gamma more precisely:

27 / 3.41 = let's compute it. 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 7.9 = 27.0 (since 3.41 * 7 =23.87, 3.41 *7.9=23.87 + (3.41 *0.9)=23.87 +3.069=26.939, which is close to 27. So 7.9 is about 7.9178. So my initial calculation of gamma=7.9178 is correct.

Tau is gamma * tau0 = 7.9178 * 8e-16 = 63.3424e-16 = 6.33424e-15 s.

Beta: sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (27/3.41)^2 = (27)^2/(3.41)^2 = 729 / 11.6281 = approx 62.692.

So 1/(gamma^2)= 1/62.692≈0.01595.

1 - 0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405) = 0.99201.

So beta is 0.99201.

L= beta * c * tau.

c=2.99792e8 m/s. Let's use c=3e8 for an approximate calculation.

So L=0.99201 * 3e8 m/s * 6.33424e-15 s.

3e8 *6.33424e-15 = 1.900272e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.99201: 1.900272e-6 *0.99201 ≈ 1.89e-6 m, which is about 1.89 micrometers.

Hmm, but the option A is 2.08e-6 m. That's about 10% larger than my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of beta?

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

Let me compute gamma^2 precisely. Gamma is 27/3.41.

Let me compute 27 / 3.41:

3.41 *7=23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.41 *0.915=?

3.41 *0.9=3.069; 3.41*0.015=0.05115. Sum is 3.12015.

So 7 + 0.915 =7.915.

3.41 *7.915=3.41*(7+0.915)=23.87 + (3.41 *0.915).

Compute 3.41 *0.915:

3 *0.915=2.745, 0.41 *0.915=0.37515. Sum is 3.12015.

So 3.41 *7.915=23.87 +3.12015=26.99015. Close to 27, so gamma is 7.915.

So gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2= (27)^2/(3.41)^2.

27^2=729.

3.41^2= (3.4)^2=11.56, but 3.41^2= (3.4 +0.01)^2= 3.4^2 + 2*(3.4)*(0.01) +0.01^2=11.56 +0.068 +0.0001=11.6281.

So gamma squared=729/11.6281≈62.692. Correct.

So beta= sqrt(1-1/62.692)=sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405).

Let me compute sqrt(0.98405) accurately.

We can compute it step by step. Let me think.

We know that 0.99^2=0.9801. 0.992^2= (0.99+0.002)^2=0.9801 + 2*0.99*0.002 + (0.002)^2=0.9801 + 0.00396 + 0.000004=0.984064.

Wait, our value is 0.98405, which is very close to 0.984064. So sqrt(0.98405)≈0.992.

Because 0.992^2=0.984064, which is just a bit higher than 0.98405. So perhaps the exact value of beta is approximately 0.99199 or something. But for all practical purposes, it's 0.992.

So with that, L= approximately 1.89e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me compute beta more precisely.

We can compute it as beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Because gamma = E/(m c²), but since we use units where c=1, gamma = E/m.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41²)/(27²)).

Compute 3.41^2 = 11.6281.

27^2=729.

So 11.6281/729= approx 0.015962.

1-0.015962=0.984038.

sqrt(0.984038)= let me compute this accurately.

We can use a calculator method. Let's say x=0.984038.

We know that 0.992^2=0.984064.

Our x is 0.984038, which is 0.984064-0.000026= 0.984038.

So the difference is 0.000026 less than 0.992^2.

We can approximate the square root with a Taylor expansion.

Let me let a=0.992, a²=0.984064.

We have x= a² - 0.000026.

We want to find a - delta such that (a - delta)^2 = x.

(a - delta)^2 = a² - 2 a delta + delta² = x.

Since delta is small, delta² is negligible.

So 2 a delta ≈ (a² - x) = 0.000026.

So delta ≈ 0.000026/(2 a) = 0.000026/(2*0.992) ≈ 0.000026/1.984 ≈ 0.0000131.

So a - delta ≈ 0.992 - 0.0000131 = approx 0.9919869.

So beta ≈ 0.991987.

So, beta is approximately 0.991987.

So now, L= beta * c * tau.

c=2.99792e8 m/s.

Tau= 7.9178 *8e-16=63.3424e-16=6.33424e-15 s.

So L=0.991987 * 2.99792e8 m/s *6.33424e-15 s.

Compute 2.99792e8 *6.33424e-15:

2.99792 *6.33424= approx 18.903.

Multiply by 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7.

So 18.903e-7=1.8903e-6 m.

Now multiply by 0.991987: 1.8903e-6 *0.991987≈1.8903e-6 *0.992 ≈1.875e-6 m.

Wait, that's about 1.875 micrometers.

So why is the option A 2.08e-6 m?

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute gamma as (E² - m²)^(1/2)/m.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²). Since c=1, gamma=E/m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta as follows:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt(1 - ( (3.41)^2 )/(27^2)).

Which is sqrt(1 - (11.6281)/(729)).

11.6281/729=0.015962.

1-0.015962=0.984038.

So sqrt(0.984038)=0.991987 as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of L.

Let me compute L= beta * c * tau.

Compute with exact numbers:

beta= sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt( (E² - m²)/E² ) = sqrt(E² - m²)/E.

So beta = sqrt( (27^2 - 3.41^2 ) ) / 27.

So 27^2=729, 3.41^2=11.6281.

729 - 11.6281=717.3719.

So sqrt(717.3719)=approx 26.783.

So beta=26.783/27= approx 0.99196.

Hmm, that's more precise.

So beta=0.99196.

Now, c=2.99792e8 m/s.

Tau=gamma * tau0= (27/3.41) *8e-16=7.91783 *8e-16=63.3426e-16=6.33426e-15 s.

So L= beta * c * tau.

So 0.99196 *2.99792e8 *6.33426e-15.

Compute 2.99792e8 *6.33426e-15:

2.99792 *6.33426≈ (3 *6.33)=18.99, but let's compute exactly:

2.99792 * 6.33426:

Break it down: 2 *6.33426=12.66852; 0.99792 *6.33426≈ (1 - 0.00208)*6.33426≈6.33426 - (0.00208 *6.33426)≈6.33426 -0.013178≈6.32108.

So 12.66852 +6.32108=18.9896.

So 18.9896e-7 (since 1e8 * 1e-15=1e-7) → 1.89896e-6 m.

Multiply by beta: 0.99196 *1.89896e-6 ≈ (0.99196 *1.89896) e-6.

Compute 0.99196 *1.89896:

Approx 1.89896 *0.99 ≈1.88.

But more accurately: 1.89896 *0.99196 ≈ let's compute.

1.89896 *1 =1.89896.

1.89896 *0.99 = 1.89896 * (1 -0.01) =1.89896 -0.0189896=1.87997.

But we have 0.99196, which is 0.99 + 0.00196.

So 1.89896 *0.99196 ≈1.87997 + (1.89896 *0.00196).

1.89896 *0.00196 ≈approx 0.00372.

So total ≈1.87997 +0.00372=1.88369.

So L≈1.88369e-6 m, or 1.88369 micrometers.

Hmm, so about 1.88 micrometers.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. That's about 10% higher than our calculation. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma tau_0.

Wait, gamma is 27 /3.41=7.91783.

Tau_0=8e-16 s.

So gamma *tau_0=7.91783 *8e-16=63.3426e-16 = 6.33426e-15 s.

Yes.

So all the calculations seem correct, so perhaps the intended answer is option A, and the setup expects using gamma = E/(m) and beta= sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)).

Wait, maybe the question is about the mean lifetime tau, but the proper lifetime is tau0, so the lifetime observed is gamma * tau0. Then, velocity is beta c, so the mean decay length is beta c gamma tau0.

Which is beta c tau. So the same as before.

Hmm. If the calculation gives approximately 1.88e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m, which is a slight variation. Maybe the problem used rounded numbers.

Wait, perhaps the mass is 3.41 GeV, but the energy is 27 GeV. Let me compute gamma again.

Gamma = E/m =27 /3.41 =7.91783.

So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses c=3e8 m/s instead of the more precise 2.99792e8. Let's see.

If c=3e8, then:

beta*c*tau = 0.99196 *3e8 *6.33426e-15.

Compute 3e8 *6.33426e-15= 1.900278e-6.

Multiply by 0.99196: 1.900278e-6 *0.99196≈1.883e-6. Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So maybe the problem is that the detector's spatial resolution is the minimum distance that can be measured. So if the decay length is L, then to have a certain efficiency, the resolution must be much smaller than L.

Wait, if the resolution is the smallest distance the detector can measure, say, d, then the probability that the decay is detected is the fraction of the decay that occurs within a distance d from the production point. So the probability P is given by P = 1 - e^{-d/L}.

So we set P=0.3.

So 0.3 = 1 - e^{-d/(L)}.

Thus, e^{-d/L} = 0.7 → -d/L = ln(0.7) → d = - L ln(0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So d ≈ 0.3567 * L.

In our case, L≈1.88e-6 m, so d≈0.3567 *1.88e-6≈6.70e-7 m, which is 0.67 micrometers.

But this isn't matching any of the options. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relation between the resolution and the decay length.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum possible energy resolution, but no, the question is about spatial resolution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the minimum resolution is the uncertainty in the position of the decay. So if the decay occurs over a range, the detector's resolution must be sufficient to capture that range. The required resolution should be such that the uncertainty is less than the decay length.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." Maybe it's about the efficiency of the detector in detecting the decay events. So if the decay length is longer, the particles have a longer path, making it harder to detect (if the detector's resolution is low), but if the resolution is high enough, you can detect more decays.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe the proper lifetime is given, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. The minimum resolution refers to the time resolution, but the options are in meters, which is a spatial measure.

Wait, the question says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps it's the spatial resolution; the detector must be able to pinpoint the decay within a certain distance from the original point for it to be detected. 

But then, what's the formula that relates the detector's resolution (say, delta_x) to the probability of detecting the decay?

Hmm, perhaps the probability that the decay occurs within delta_x is P = (1 - e^{-delta_x/L}) - e^{-delta_x/L} * (delta_x/L) ?

No, wait, the probability that the decay occurs within a length x is P=1 - e^{-x/L}.

So, if the detector's resolution is delta_x, then the probability that the decay occurs within delta_x is P=1 - e^{-delta_x/L}.

We want P >= 0.3 → 1 - e^{-delta_x/L} >=0.3 → e^{-delta_x/L} <=0.7 → -delta_x/L <= ln(0.7) → delta_x >= - L ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567 L.

So delta_x_min = 0.3567 * L.

So with L≈1.88e-6 m, delta_x_min≈0.3567 *1.88e-6≈6.70e-7 m. But none of the options are that small.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)
B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)
...

Wait, if delta_x is 2.08e-6 m, then let's compute P.

delta_x=2.08e-6 m.

P=1 - e^{-2.08e-6 /1.88e-6}.

2.08e-6 /1.88e-6 ≈1.106.

e^{-1.106}=approx 0.331.

So P=1-0.331=0.669, which is about 66.9% probability. That's higher than 30%, so if the resolution is 2.08e-6 m, you get about 67% of the decays observed.

But the question asks for at least 30%, so this would satisfy it. So perhaps the minimum resolution is 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, why would the answer be option A? Because when using delta_x=2.08e-6 m, the probability is about 67%, which is way above 30%, so perhaps the minimum resolution required is even lower. Because 30% is much lower than 67%.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased in reverse. It says "the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So the resolution needs to be such that at least 30% are detected, which would require a smaller delta_x than what gives 30% P. Because a higher P requires a larger delta_x.

Wait, no, the higher the delta_x, the higher the P. So to get at least 30% of the decays, the delta_x can be as low as the value that gives P=30%.

Wait, but the answer options are much higher. So perhaps the question is not about the position resolution but something else.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem refers to the time resolution. But the question is about spatial resolution, given the options are in meters.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the velocity and the time it takes for the decay, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.

The decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So the probability that the decay occurs within a length d is P=1 - e^{-d/L}.

We need P >=0.3 → d >= L ln(1/(1-0.3))= L ln(1/0.7)≈0.3567 L.

So to get 30% of the decays, the minimum d is 0.3567 L.

But the question is about the resolution, which is the smallest detectable distance. So if the detector's resolution is d_res, then the probability to detect the decay is P=1 - e^{-d_res/L}.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased in terms of the maximum acceptable d_res to capture a certain P. So if d_res is the maximum distance, then P=1 -e^{-d_res/L}.

Wait, but the question says 'minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30%'. So perhaps the resolution is the maximum d_res allowed, as any larger and you can't detect. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the decay length itself. Because if the detector can't resolve distances smaller than L, then you can't pinpoint the decay location. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem states that the minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution must be smaller than the decay length to have any chance of observing the decay. But this reasoning doesn't directly give a numerical value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply about computing the decay length, and the answer is option A (2.08e-6 m), regardless of the 30% part. But why is the 30% included?

Wait, perhaps the 30% refers to the efficiency of detection. So the detector must be able to resolve the decay within a certain distance, and the efficiency is 30%.

But without more information on how the resolution affects the detection efficiency, it's hard to model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the velocity and the proper lifetime.

Wait, another thought: in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay length is longer. The minimum resolution would be the decay length itself, as you need to be able to see it. But why 30%?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as using relativistic momentum or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity.

Beta is approximately 0.992, so v=beta c ≈0.992 *3e8 m/s=2.976e8 m/s.

The proper lifetime is tau0=8e-16 s.

So the decay length L= v * tau =2.976e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s= (2.976 *6.334) *1e-7.

2.976 *6.334≈18.91.

So L=18.91e-7 m=1.891e-6 m.

Again, about 1.89e-6 m. So option A is 2.08e-6, which is approximately 10% higher.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects using gamma = 27/3.41 ≈7.9178, and then beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )= sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )= same as before.

So perhaps the intended answer is 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2.08 micrometers.

But why is that? Because 2.08e-6 is option A, and the calculation leads to about 1.88e-6. But perhaps the numbers in the problem are approximated.

Wait, 2.08e-6 is approximately 1.88e-6 * (2.08/1.88)≈ 20% higher. Maybe the problem used more precise gamma.

Wait, let me recompute gamma with more precise numbers.

Gamma=27 /3.41.

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.41 ×0.915=?

3.41 ×0.9=3.069.

3.41 ×0.015=0.05115.

3.069 +0.05115=3.12015.

So 7.915 ×3.41=27. So gamma=7.915.

So gamma=7.915.

Then, L= beta c gamma tau0.

Wait, tau=gamma tau0, so L= beta c gamma tau0.

So gamma=7.915, tau0=8e-16 s.

beta=0.99196.

So L= 0.99196 * 3e8 m/s *7.915 *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *7.915= 2.3745e9.

2.3745e9 *8e-16= 1.8996e-6.

Multiply by 0.99196: 1.8996e-6 *0.99196≈1.883e-6 m.

Again, same result.

So, no, the calculation is consistent.

Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, considering that the problem expects rounding or perhaps the calculation is done differently.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta more accurately.

Let me compute beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )

Compute 3.41/27=0.126296.

(0.126296)^2=0.015949.

So 1-0.015949=0.984051.

sqrt(0.984051)=0.992005.

So beta=0.992005.

So L=0.992005 *3e8 *6.33426e-15.

Which is same as before, giving 1.883e-6.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed of light as 3e8 m/s, and the calculation is done as:

L = (27 /3.41) * (3e8) * (8e-16) * sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )

Wait, let me compute that.

(27/3.41)=7.9178.

(3e8 m/s) * (8e-16 s) =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.9178: 2.4e-7 *7.9178≈1.9003e-6 m.

Multiply by beta=0.992005: 1.9003e-6 *0.992005≈1.883e-6 m.

Again, same result.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the answer is A, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor in the calculation. Maybe the energy is 27 GeV, but the particle's momentum is not simply E=pc, because for particles with mass, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that gamma=E/m. Because for a relativistic particle, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. So p = gamma m v.

Wait, but when considering E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v.

But perhaps I should compute beta using beta = (pc²)/(E), since p=E beta.

Wait, another approach: beta = (pc²)/E.

But for a relativistic particle, E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v.

But v=beta c, so p = gamma m beta c.

So, beta = (p c²)/(E) = (gamma m beta c * c²)/(gamma m c²) )= (gamma m beta c^3 )/(gamma m c^2 ) )= beta c.

Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, beta = p c / E.

So, if E=27 GeV, and m=3.41 GeV/c².

So, p c = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) GeV.

Which is sqrt(729 - 11.6281 )=sqrt(717.3719 )= approx26.78 GeV.

So p c =26.78 GeV.

So beta = (p c)/(E) =26.78 /27=0.99185.

Which is consistent with our previous calculation of beta≈0.992.

So, with beta=0.99185, then L= beta c tau =0.99185 *3e8 *6.334e-15.

Which is the same as before, giving 1.88e-6 m.

So, the calculation is consistent.

So, the only thing I can think is that the intended answer is option A, perhaps due to rounding in the problem's given numbers.

Looking back, perhaps the mass is given as 3.41 GeV, which is 3.41 GeV/c², and the energy is 27 GeV. So, to compute gamma, it's E/(m c²), but with c=1 in these units, gamma=27/3.41=7.9178.

So perhaps the intended answer is 2.08e-6 m, which is option A.

But based on calculation, I'm getting approximately 1.88e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6), but not exactly. However, given the options, I think the intended answer is option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we start by calculating the decay length \( L \), which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying in the lab frame. The decay length is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \) is the proper lifetime of \( X^0 \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy of the particle is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), and its rest mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9178
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
Using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.9178)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{62.692}} = \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \) in the lab frame
The lifetime in the lab frame is \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \):

\[
\tau = 7.9178 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0 = \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
L = 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \times 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \approx 1.9002 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Now multiply by \( \beta \):

\[
L = 0.992 \times 1.9002 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 1.883 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the decay length is approximately \( 1.883 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 5: Relating resolution to the decay length
The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The probability of detecting a decay within a distance \( d \) is given by:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-d/L}
\]

For \( P = 0.3 \), we solve for \( d \):

\[
0.3 = 1 - e^{-d/L} \implies e^{-d/L} = 0.7 \implies -\frac{d}{L} = \ln(0.7) \implies d = -L \ln(0.7)
\]

Using \( \ln(0.7) \approx -0.3567 \):

\[
d = 0.3567 \times L \approx 0.3567 \times 1.883 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.70 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]

This is the minimum distance \( d \) needed to detect 30% of the decays. However, the question likely refers to the decay length \( L \) itself as the relevant scale for resolution. Comparing this to the options:

- **Option A: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)** (2.08 \( \mu\text{m} \)) is close to the calculated decay length of \( 1.883 \, \mu\text{m} \), with a small discrepancy likely due to rounding in the problem's parameters.
- **Option B: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)** (2.08 \( \text{nm} \)) is far too small.
- **Option C: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{m} \)** (20.8 \( \text{cm} \)) is far too large.
- **Option D: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \)** (2.08 \( \text{mm} \)) is also far too large.

Thus, the most reasonable answer is **Option A**.
