Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. 

First, I should figure out the structure of the target. Let me draw it mentally. Ethan-1-one is acetone, so the ketone is on a carbon attached to the benzene ring. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, wait, the numbering. Let me think: the ketone is on position 1, so the substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to that. So the ring has a ketone group (as part of the ethanone), a bromo group at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethanone (so the ketone is on the same carbon as the phenyl). So the phenyl group is at position 1 of the ethanone, and the substituents on the phenyl are at position 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro). So the benzene ring has a ketone group (as part of acetone) attached at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5.

So the substituents are meta to each other? Wait, benzene is a ring. If the ketone is at position 1, then position 3 is next to position 2 and 4, but wait I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Let me imagine the benzene ring: if the substituent (the ketone) is at position 1, then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So the bromine is at 3, nitro at 5, and the ketone is at 1. So the substituents are adjacent? Because 1,3,5 are all meta positions to each other. Wait, no. Wait, in benzene, positions 1, 3, 5 are actually all meta to each other, but that's not possible in a benzene ring. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's think: the acetone is attached to the benzene as a substituent. So the benzene is connected to a CH2-CO group. So the acetone is R-CO-CH2- attached to the benzene. So the benzene is a phenyl group attached to the methyl group of acetone. So the acetone is at position 1 of the benzene. Then, the substituents on the benzene would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetone group. That makes them meta to each other, because 3 and 5 are two positions apart from each other, with 1 being the acetone.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So if the substituent is at position 1, then positions 3 and 5 are on either side, each two carbons away. So the substituents are at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro). So the benzene ring has the acetone group at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5. So the substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the acetone.

So the plan is to add these substituents in the correct order so that they are at the correct positions.

Now, the starting material is benzene. The options are sequences of reactions, so each option is a series of steps. We need to figure out which sequence would lead to the correct substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about how to introduce the substituents. Since the nitro group is a meta director and bromine is also a meta director (if it's a substituent), but wait, the bromine could be introduced in different ways. Alternatively, the order in which substituents are added affects where they attach.

Wait, the order of adding substituents matters. For example, if you add a nitro group first, then when you add bromine, it will go into a position relative to the nitro group. Or if you add bromine first, then nitro would go in a different place.

But the target has both nitro and bromo groups, along with the acetone group. So let's think about how to get all three substituents in place.

First, the acetone group is a ketone. To introduce that, we can probably do Friedel-Crafts acylation. Friedel-Crafts requires directing groups. Benzene is activated for electrophilic substitution, but after substitution, the directing effects come into play.

Wait, but benzene is a planar molecule, so the positions of substituents depend on where they are added relative to each other.

Let me try to outline the possible steps.

We need to introduce three substituents: a ketone (from acetone), a bromine, and a nitro group. But wait, wait. Wait, the acetone is a substituent on benzene, so perhaps the benzene is first converted into acetophenone (phenylacetone) and then other substituents are added.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to the ethanone. So the ethanone is connected to the phenyl group via a methyl group, making it acetophenone derivative.

So first, perhaps the acetophenone is synthesized. Then, the nitro and bromine groups are added in the correct positions.

But wait, the problem is that Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot be done after certain substituents are added because some substituents deactivate the ring, making electrophilic substitution difficult.

So the order of substitution is important. Let's think about the directing effects.

Nitro groups are strong meta directors. Bromine is an ortho/para director but since it's a deactivating group (because it's an electron-withdrawing substituent), it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, but deactivates the ring.

So when adding substituents, we need to consider the order in which we add them, because each new substituent affects where the next will go.

Let me think about the possible steps:

One possible approach is:

1. Nitration (introduce nitro group) first. Then bromination, then acylation.

But wait, if you nitrate benzene first, you get nitrobenzene. Then, brominating nitrobenzene would add bromine in the meta or para position relative to nitro.

Wait, nitro is a meta director. So when you nitrate benzene, you get nitro in one position. Then, brominating would add in the meta position relative to nitro, but wait, nitro is already a meta director, so adding bromine would go into positions ortho or para to nitro. Wait, no. Wait, nitro is meta-directing, so the next substituent will go into the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, no, actually, after nitration, the nitro group is a meta director. So bromine would add in the meta position relative to nitro. But nitro is already in position 1, so bromine would be at position 3, perhaps. Then, the acylation would have to happen in the correct position.

But wait, the target has both nitro and bromo in 3 and 5 positions relative to the acetyl group. So let's see: if the acetyl group is at position 1, nitro at 5, and bromine at 3.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let's think:

If we introduce the nitro group first, say at position 1. Then, brominating would put it in the meta position relative to nitro; but wait, if nitro is at 1, bromine would be at position 3 or 5 depending on where it's added.

Wait, let me think of benzene as a ring with substituents:

If the first substituent is nitro at position 1. Then, adding bromine would go into either position 3 or 5 (meta positions relative to nitro). Let's say bromine goes into position 3. Then, the ring has nitro at 1 and bromo at 3. Now, we need to add the acetyl group. But wait, the acetyl group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. However, the ring already has nitro and bromo substituents. The nitro is at 1, bromo at 3.

Wait, but after adding nitro and bromo, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts acylation might not work. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group; Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So perhaps this approach won't work.

Alternatively, maybe the order is different.

Another approach: perhaps the acylation is done first. Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to become acetophenone. Then, adding nitro and bromine.

But acetophenone's acetyl group is an activating group, ortho/para director. So after acylation, the ring is activated, so further substitution can occur.

So if we start with benzene, do Friedel-Crafts acylation to get acetophenone. Then, nitrate it. Since the acetyl is an activating group, nitration would occur at the ortho or para positions relative to the acetyl group.

Wait, acetophenone is a meta director? Wait, no. Wait, the acetyl group is a strong activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via resonance). Wait, wait, no. Wait, acetyl is an acyl group, which is deactivating. Because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing. So acetophenone is a deactivating, meta-directing group.

Ah, right. So after acylation, the acetyl group is a meta director. So when you nitrate acetophenone, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl group (position 3 or 5?).

Wait, let me imagine acetophenone: benzene with the acetyl group at position 1. Then, nitration would add nitro in the meta position, which would be position 3 or 5, depending on how it's done.

But when you add a second substituent, the existing substituents influence where the next goes.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would be added in the meta position relative to the acetyl group. So let's say the acetyl is at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 3.

Then, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, bromination would occur. The ring now has two substituents: acetyl (meta dir.) and nitro (meta dir.) but the positions influence each other.

Wait, but when there are two substituents, the more activating group (if any) will dominate. Since acetyl is deactivating, and nitro is also deactivating, but perhaps the directing is determined by their positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is a stronger director. Hmm.

Wait, in the presence of multiple substituents, the substituents that are more activating (if any) will have a stronger influence. But in this case, both are deactivating. So their directing effects are considered. Let me think: the acetyl is meta-directing, and the nitro is also meta-directing.

So, if the nitro is at position 3, and the acetyl is at 1, then the next substitution (bromine) could be in a position that is meta to both, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, the ring's substituents could lead the incoming electrophile to a position that's a meta to one and perhaps ortho to another.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think step by step.

So, first, benzene is acylated to form acetophenone (1-acetylbenzene). Then, nitration is done. The acetyl group directs incoming nitro to the meta position, which would be position 3. So now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3.

Now, bromination. The ring has two substituents: acetyl (meta dir.) and nitro (meta dir.). So the incoming Br+ would look for positions that are meta to one of them, but considering both.

Wait, perhaps the positions available would be position 5. Because position 5 is meta to nitro (position 3) and also relative to acetyl. Let me visualize:

Positions:
1: acetyl
3: nitro
5: ?

If the Br+ comes in, it would go where? Let's think about the directing. The acetyl is at 1, which is a meta director. So Br+ would go to position 4 (meta to 1), but wait, position 4 is adjacent to position 3 (nitro). Alternatively, the nitro at 3 is a meta director, so the Br+ would go to position 6 (meta to 3, which is position 6). Or maybe position 5 (which is adjacent to position 3).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The nitro group at position 3 is a meta director, so the Br could go to positions 6 or  (relative to 3, the meta is positions 6 and so on?), but maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the entire molecule. So acetophenone has the acetyl at 1. After nitration at 3, the substituents are at 1 and 3. Now, brominating would need to go to a position that's meta to either the acetyl or the nitro group.

The available positions are 2,4,5,6. But let's see:

- Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (nitro), which is a deactivating group. So perhaps it's not favored.

- Position 5: is that meta to acetyl (position 1)? Let's see: 1, 5 are separated by three positions, making them para? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, position 1, then 2,3,4,5,6. So 1 and 5 are two positions apart; that would make them meta to each other. So yes, position 5 is meta to position 1 (acetyl). So Br+ would go to position 5 if directed by acetyl.

But wait, the nitro group is at 3; if Br is added in position 5, that's adjacent to nitro (position 3 and 5 are two apart, so it's meta to each other). Wait, no. Position 3 and 5 are two apart (3,4,5), so they're meta. So if Br goes to position 5, it's meta to nitro as well.

Hmm, so in this scenario, when you have substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro), the next substitution (Br) could go into position 5, which is meta to both.

Thus, after acylation, nitration, bromination, you would have substituents at 1,3,5. So that's the desired product.

So the steps so far would be:

1. Benzene → acetylation (Friedel-Crafts) → acetophenone (1-acetylbenzene).

2. Nitration → nitro group at position 3.

3. Bromination → bromine at position 5.

But wait, wait. When you add the nitro group, where does it go? Let me double-check. After acetylation, the ring has an acetyl group (deactivating, meta director). So nitration would add the nitro group in the meta position relative to acetyl. So position 3 or 5? Depending on where you add, but let me say position 3. Then, bromination would be done in a position meta to acetyl, which is position 5. Alternatively, maybe it's para to nitro. Hmm, perhaps this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine should be added before nitration. Let me think about that.

If I start with benzene, first brominate, then acetylate, then nitrate.

Wait, let's try that.

1. Benzene → bromination (FeBr3) → bromobenzene.

2. Acetylation (Friedel-Crafts) → the acetyl group would add in the meta position relative to bromine, because bromine is a deactivating, ortho/para director. Wait, but wait: Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, but bromine is deactivating. So after bromination, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work. So that approach won't work. So bromine can't be added before acylation.

Thus, acylation has to come first.

So back to the first approach: acylation first, then nitration and bromination.

So now, after acylation, nitration adds nitro at position 3, then bromination at position 5.

But wait, how does the bromination happen? Because after nitration, the ring has two substituents: acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, when adding Br, the ring is deactivated because both groups are deactivating. But perhaps with a strong electrophile, it can still proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group directs the Br to a specific position.

Wait another thing: perhaps the nitro group is a stronger director than acetyl. Let me think: the nitro group is a strong deactivating meta director. So when adding Br, the nitro group would direct the incoming Br to the meta position relative to itself, which is position 6. But that's not where we want it (we want Br at 5). Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group directs it to position 5.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is where the acetyl is. Nitro is at position 3. Then, the incoming Br would look for positions that are meta to either of these substituents.

The positions available are 2,4,5,6.

So, position 5 is meta to acetyl (1), because 1 and 5 are three positions apart (1 → 2 → 3 → 5? Wait, no, 1 to 5 is four positions away, which is para, not meta. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. The positions go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, with each adjacent. So the positions opposite to 1 is 4. So position 1, meta would be 3 and 5. So for the acetyl at 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5.

Similarly, the nitro at 3 has meta positions at 6 and 1 (but 1 is already occupied by acetyl), so the next available meta position is 6.

So when adding Br, the possible positions would be 5 (meta to acetyl) and 6 (meta to nitro). Now, which one would it choose?

Well, considering that the nitro group is a stronger deactivating, perhaps the Br would be more likely to add meta to the nitro group. So it would go to position 6. But that's not what we want; we need Br at 5. Hmm.

So perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe the order of adding nitro and bromine needs to be swapped.

Wait, perhaps after acylation, we brominate first, then nitrate. Let me see.

1. Benzene → acylation → acetophenone (1-acetyl).

2. Bromination: Since the acetyl is meta-directing, Br would add at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

Now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3.

3. Nitration: Now, the acetyl is a meta director, Br is also a meta director (since Br is deactivating, ortho/para would be possible, but maybe it's more likely to be meta under certain conditions? Hmm, not sure. Wait, Br is an ortho/para director. So now, after adding Br at 3, the next substituent (nitro) would be directed by both acetyl (meta) and Br (ortho/para).

So where would the nitro group go? 

The acetyl is at 1, Br at 3.

The acetyl directs meta, so possible positions for nitro are 4 (meta to 1) or 5 and 3 (but 3 is already occupied). But wait, meta to 1 is position 4? Or is it position 5?

Wait, position 1's meta is 3 and 5. Position 3 is already taken by Br, so the next possibility is position 5. But let's see.

Wait, position 1: meta is 3 and 5. Since Br is at 3, the acetyl would prefer the other meta position, which is 5.

But Br is at 3, which is an ortho/para director. So for nitration, the possible positions would be ortho (2,4) or para (6) relative to Br. But the existing substituents are at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br).

So, for Br at 3, the ortho positions are 2 and 4; para is 6.

But the acetyl is at 1, which is meta to Br (3), so perhaps the nitro group is directed by the acetyl to position 5.

But how does that happen when there are two substituents?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group ends up in position 5 because that's meta to acetyl and para to Br. Wait, position 5 is adjacent to Br (3). So that's ortho to Br, but perhaps the directing effect of the acetyl is stronger.

So in this scenario, nitration would add nitro at position 5. Then, the substituents are acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That's exactly what we need.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetylation: benzene → acetophenone (1-acetyl).

2. Bromination: acetophenone → 3-bromoacetophenone.

3. Nitration: 3-bromoacetophenone → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

But wait, let me check the nitration step again. After Br is added at 3, the ring has substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br). When adding nitro, the acetyl is a meta director (positions 3 and 5), and Br is an ortho/para director (positions 2,4,6).

The possible positions for nitro would be where both directing effects agree. Perhaps position 5 is meta to acetyl and not conflicting with Br's direction.

Alternatively, perhaps position 5 is the only available position that's meta to acetyl and not occupied by Br.

So, this order would give the desired substituents at 1,3,5.

But wait, in the target, the substituent positions are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, with the acetyl at 1. So let's confirm: after acylation (1), bromine (3), nitro (5), that's the correct configuration.

So the order of reactions would be: acetylation, bromination, nitration.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which option follows this sequence.

Looking at the options:

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

v) Fe/HCl → reduction (maybe to remove nitro?)

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → something like a hydrolysis or reduction?

Wait, option B doesn't seem to fit. Because the first step is bromination, which would not be possible after the previous steps.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

v) HNO3 → another nitration.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

Hmm, this seems to involve multiple nitrations and other steps. Not sure.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → ?

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitration.

This seems complicated, but perhaps not matching our desired order.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) HNO3 → nitration again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

So option A's steps are: acetylate first, then brominate, then nitrate. Then reduction, nitrate again, which seems unlikely.

Wait, but in the correct order, after acetylation, bromination, then nitration. So the steps would be:

1. Acetylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3).

2. Bromination (Br2/FeBr3).

3. Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4).

Looking for an option that has these steps in this order.

Looking at the options:

Option B starts with bromination, so no.

Option A: step i is acetylation, step ii bromination, step iii nitration. Then steps iv and beyond, which we don't need.

Wait, but the target molecule has only one nitro group and one bromine. So perhaps the options have more steps because they're trying to fit all in. But our desired steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. So option A has i) acetylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. So perhaps that's the correct sequence.

Wait, but the target has nitro at 5 and bromine at 3. So after step iii in option A, the nitro would be at position 5 (meta to acetyl), and bromine at 3 (from step ii). So that gives the correct structure.

But then what are steps iv to vii in option A? Let's see:

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of the nitro group. But in the target, there's a nitro group, so that would be incorrect.

Wait, the target requires a nitro group, so any step that reduces nitro (like Fe/HCl) would remove it. So that's a problem. So option A's steps after nitration would alter the structure, which is not desired.

So perhaps option A is not the correct answer.

Looking again at the options, which option includes acetylation, bromination, and nitration in the correct order without any steps that would remove the nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not seeing it. Let me re-examine.

Option B's steps:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

But if we start with benzene, bromination would make bromobenzene, which is deactivated. Then acetylation (step iii) wouldn't work because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So option B's first step can't be correct.

So perhaps the correct option is not among the options? No, that's not possible. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the nitration occurs before bromination, but in a way that allows the substituents to be in the correct positions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro group is added after bromine, but in a situation where the directing effects allow the correct positioning.

Let me think: if after acetylation, we nitrate first, then brominate.

So steps:

1. Acetylation → acetophenone (1-acetyl).

2. Nitration → nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl).

3. Bromination → Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl, which is at 1), but wait, position 3 is meta to 1. But in this case, after nitration, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 5.

Now, when adding Br, the substituents are acetyl (1) and nitro (5). The acetyl is a meta director, and the nitro is a meta director.

The acetyl would direct Br to position 3 or 5. But position 5 is already taken by nitro, so Br would go to 3.

Wait, but position 3 is adjacent to nitro (5 is three positions away from 3?), no, 3 and 5 are two positions apart, so that's meta. So if nitro is at 5, the acetyl at 1 directs to 3 and 5. Since 5 is taken, Br would go to 3.

So that would give the correct structure: acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetylation.

2. Nitration.

3. Bromination.

Now, looking for an option that does acetylation, then nitration, then bromination.

Looking at the options:

Option C: i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) acetylation, iv) bromination, etc. So steps i and ii don't fit.

Option B: starts with bromination, which is not correct.

Option D: i) nitration, so that's not correct.

Hmm, none of the options directly match this order.

Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps I'm not considering that after nitration, the ring might have a different director.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acetylation, bromination, then nitration. But earlier I thought that in option A, after nitration, there's a step that reduces the nitro group.

But perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration. But since the ring is deactivated by Br, nitration might be difficult. Also, where would the nitro group add? It would be ortho or para to Br.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation. But the ring has Br and nitro, which are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So this option seems incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine. Then, acetylation.

But if after nitration and reduction, the ring is activated again (since amine is activating), but then acetylation would happen.

But let's see:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation. The amine is an ortho/para director, activating. So acetylation would add in ortho or para to amine (which was position 1). So acetyl could be at 3 or 5.

Then, iv) Br2 → bromination. The ring has acetyl (3 or 5) and amine (1). So where would Br go?

Alternatively, perhaps this approach leads to the substituents in the correct positions, but I'm not certain.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → forms diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis to form phenol.

v) Br2 → bromination (maybe on the phenol? Not sure).

vi) CH3COCl → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → another nitration.

This seems complicated and probably not the right path.

So, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not finding it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in thinking about the steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acetylation, bromination, nitration, and none of the options have that. Let me check the options again.

Option A:

Reagents:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → adds Br in meta to acetyl (position 3).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → adds nitro in meta to acetyl, which is position 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. But the target has nitro, so this is bad.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? That's not needed.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

So option A's steps after the initial three are incorrect.

Option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro in para to Br.

iii) Acetylation → can't happen because Br is deactivating.

So option B is wrong.

Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine (NH2 at 1).

iii) Acetylation → acetyl adds ortho or para to NH2.

Assuming it adds at 3.

iv) Br2 → bromination. Where would Br add? The ring has NH2 (1) and acetyl (3). NH2 is activating, directs to ortho and para. So Br would add at 5 (meta to acetyl?), but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps after acetylation at 3, bromination would add at 5.

Then, another nitration (step v) would add nitro somewhere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, after step iv in option C, we have Br at 5. Then step v is another nitration, which would add nitro where?

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetylation, nitration, bromination, but looking at the options, none have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is nitration, bromination, acetylation.

Wait, let's see. If I start with benzene, nitrate to get nitro at 1. Then brominate: nitro is meta director, so Br at 3 or 5. Let's say 3. Then acetylation: but the ring has nitro (deactivating), so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that can't be.

So the only viable option seems to be option B, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetylation, bromination, nitration, and the steps in option A do that. But after nitration, there are steps that might not affect the substituents. Or perhaps the subsequent steps are part of another process.

Wait, let me re-examine option A's steps:

i) Acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Bromination → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) Nitration → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) Nitration again → adds another nitro group?

vi) Diazotization and H3PO2 → perhaps forms something else.

But the target has one nitro group. So steps iv onwards in option A would change the structure, which is bad.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetylation, bromination, then nitration. So the correct option would have these three steps in that order.

Looking back, option A does acetylation first, then bromination, then nitration. Even though it has additional steps after, perhaps those steps are not relevant or are part of a different synthesis path.

Wait, but the target molecule doesn't have any amine or other groups. The steps after nitration in option A might not be part of the correct synthesis. Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering the initial steps, but that's not the case; the entire sequence must lead to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis → phenol.

v) Br2 → bromination → bromophenol? Not sure.

vi) CH3COCl → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → another nitration.

This seems way off track.

So, perhaps the correct option is option B. Wait, let me think again.

Option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration. Nitration of bromobenzene would add nitro in para to Br (since Br is ortho/para director but deactivating).

So nitro would be at position 4 (if Br is at 1). Wait, but let me think: benzene with Br at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 4 (para to Br) or position 2 or 6 (ortho).

But nitration is more likely to occur para to Br, so nitro at 4.

Then, step iii is acetylation. But the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4, both deactivating. Friedel-Crafts won't proceed, so option B's step iii (acetylation) wouldn't work.

So option B is incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last. So, the steps would be:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Brominate → 3-bromoacetophenone.

3. Nitrate → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Which matches the target.

Looking for an option where acetylation is first, then bromination, then nitration.

Looking at option A:

i) Acetylation.

ii) Bromination.

iii) Nitration.

So those three steps would produce the correct product. The remaining steps (iv to vii) would need to be something that doesn't alter the structure, but that's not possible because the target has only those three substituents.

Wait, so perhaps the question is considering only the first three steps, but the options list all the steps needed to get to the target.

But looking at the options, option A has seven steps, but the first three would produce the desired product. The subsequent steps might be for something else, but the question is about the entire sequence leading to the target.

So perhaps none of the options are correct, which can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bromine is introduced after the nitro group. Let me think.

After acetylation, nitration adds nitro at position 3. Then bromination adds Br at position 5.

But how would that happen? Because after nitration, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). So when adding Br, it would be directed by both substituents.

The acetyl is meta director, so Br would go to 5. The nitro is meta director, so Br would go to 6 or 1. But 1 is taken by acetyl, so 6 is possible. But we want Br at 5.

Wait, perhaps the acetyl's directing effect is stronger, so Br would go to 5.

Thus, the steps would be acetylation, nitration, bromination.

But looking at the options, none of them have this sequence.

Wait, looking back, option C's steps are:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylate to acetanilide.

iv) Br2 → brominate. Acetanilide is an activating group, directing to ortho and para.

So Br would add in positions ortho or para to NHCOCH3.

Wait, but after acetylation, the acetanilide is at position 1. Then, bromination would add Br at position 3 or 5.

Wait, acetanilide is a strong activating group, so bromine would add in ortho or para.

But wait, bromination with FeBr3 is a typical electrophilic substitution. So after acetylation, the acetanilide directs Br to ortho or para.

So, if acetanilide is at position 1, Br could be at 3 (ortho) or 4 (para).

But we need Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, but this approach doesn't get nitro at 5.

Alternatively, perhaps after acetylation, nitration is done, but that's not in option C.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. I think the correct answer is option B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct one, and the subsequent steps are unnecessary or cancel each other out.

Wait, going back to the initial plan: the correct steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. Looking at option A, these are the first three steps. So the product after these three steps would be correct. But the full option A has more steps which would alter the product, which is not desired. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, because the first three steps are correct, and the rest are either not relevant or perhaps a distraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the essential steps, but the options include all steps. Maybe the question is designed such that the first three steps in option A are the correct ones, regardless of what comes after.

In that case, the correct answer would be option A.

To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in the correct positions. The target molecule has a ketone group (from ethan-1-one) attached to the benzene ring at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The order of substitution is critical because each substituent directs subsequent substitutions based on its electronic effects (activating or deactivating) and directing properties (ortho, meta, or para).

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Acetylation using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ introduces the ketone group at position 1, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination using Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3, which is meta to the acetyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration using HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group and does not interfere with the bromine at position 3.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, NaNO₂/HCl, and H₃PO₂, which are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and could alter the structure. However, the first three steps are sufficient to produce the desired product.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination using Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine to benzene, forming bromobenzene. However, bromine is a deactivating group, making further electrophilic substitution difficult.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration using HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group, but the deactivated ring limits the reaction, and the nitro group would likely end up in the para position relative to bromine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ is unlikely to proceed because the ring is deactivated by the bromine and nitro groups.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration using HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group to benzene, forming nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction using Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ introduces the ketone group. However, the amine group directs substitution to the ortho and para positions, which does not align with the desired meta positioning for the ketone.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve bromination, additional nitration, and other reactions, but the sequence does not lead to the correct substitution pattern.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration using HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group to benzene, forming nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction using Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization using NaNO₂/HCl and subsequent reaction with H₃PO₂ do not align with the desired synthesis pathway.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve bromination, acetylation, and additional nitration, but the sequence does not produce the correct substitution pattern.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is acetylation, bromination, and nitration, which is represented by the first three steps of **Option A**. While the additional steps in Option A are unnecessary, the first three steps are sufficient to produce the target molecule. Therefore, **Option A** is the best choice.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. 

First, I should figure out the structure of the target. Let me draw it mentally. Ethan-1-one is acetone, so the ketone is on a carbon attached to the benzene ring. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, wait, the numbering. Let me think: the ketone is on position 1, so the substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to that. So the ring has a ketone group (as part of the ethanone), a bromo group at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethanone (so the ketone is on the same carbon as the phenyl). So the phenyl group is at position 1 of the ethanone, and the substituents on the phenyl are at position 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro). So the benzene ring has a ketone group (as part of acetone) attached at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5.

So the substituents are meta to each other? Wait, benzene is a ring. If the ketone is at position 1, then position 3 is next to position 2 and 4, but wait I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Let me imagine the benzene ring: if the substituent (the ketone) is at position 1, then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So the bromine is at 3, nitro at 5, and the ketone is at 1. So the substituents are adjacent? Because 1,3,5 are all meta positions to each other. Wait, no. Wait, in benzene, positions 1, 3, 5 are actually all meta to each other, but that's not possible in a benzene ring. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's think: the acetone is attached to the benzene as a substituent. So the benzene is connected to a CH2-CO group. So the acetone is R-CO-CH2- attached to the benzene. So the benzene is a phenyl group attached to the methyl group of acetone. So the acetone is at position 1 of the benzene. Then, the substituents on the benzene would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetone group. That makes them meta to each other, because 3 and 5 are two positions apart from each other, with 1 being the acetone.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So if the substituent is at position 1, then positions 3 and 5 are on either side, each two carbons away. So the substituents are at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro). So the benzene ring has the acetone group at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5. So the substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the acetone.

So the plan is to add these substituents in the correct order so that they are at the correct positions.

Now, the starting material is benzene. The options are sequences of reactions, so each option is a series of steps. We need to figure out which sequence would lead to the correct substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about how to introduce the substituents. Since the nitro group is a meta director and bromine is also a meta director (if it's a substituent), but wait, the bromine could be introduced in different ways. Alternatively, the order in which substituents are added affects where they attach.

Wait, the order of adding substituents matters. For example, if you add a nitro group first, then when you add bromine, it will go into a position relative to the nitro group. Or if you add bromine first, then nitro would go in a different place.

But the target has both nitro and bromo groups, along with the acetone group. So let's think about how to get all three substituents in place.

First, the acetone group is a ketone. To introduce that, we can probably do Friedel-Crafts acylation. Friedel-Crafts requires directing groups. Benzene is activated for electrophilic substitution, but after substitution, the directing effects come into play.

Wait, but benzene is a planar molecule, so the positions of substituents depend on where they are added relative to each other.

Let me try to outline the possible steps.

We need to introduce three substituents: a ketone (from acetone), a bromine, and a nitro group. But wait, wait. Wait, the acetone is a substituent on benzene, so perhaps the benzene is first converted into acetophenone (phenylacetone) and then other substituents are added.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to the ethanone. So the ethanone is connected to the phenyl group via a methyl group, making it acetophenone derivative.

So first, perhaps the acetophenone is synthesized. Then, the nitro and bromine groups are added in the correct positions.

But wait, the problem is that Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot be done after certain substituents are added because some substituents deactivate the ring, making electrophilic substitution difficult.

So the order of substitution is important. Let's think about the directing effects.

Nitro groups are strong meta directors. Bromine is an ortho/para director but since it's a deactivating group (because it's an electron-withdrawing substituent), it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, but deactivates the ring.

So when adding substituents, we need to consider the order in which we add them, because each new substituent affects where the next will go.

Let me think about the possible steps:

One possible approach is:

1. Nitration (introduce nitro group) first. Then bromination, then acylation.

But wait, if you nitrate benzene first, you get nitrobenzene. Then, brominating nitrobenzene would add bromine in the meta or para position relative to nitro.

Wait, nitro is a meta director. So when you nitrate benzene, you get nitro in one position. Then, brominating would add in the meta position relative to nitro, but wait, nitro is already a meta director, so adding bromine would go into positions ortho or para to nitro. Wait, no. Wait, nitro is meta-directing, so the next substituent will go into the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, no, actually, after nitration, the nitro group is a meta director. So bromine would add in the meta position relative to nitro. But nitro is already in position 1, so bromine would be at position 3, perhaps. Then, the acylation would have to happen in the correct position.

But wait, the target has both nitro and bromo in 3 and 5 positions relative to the acetyl group. So let's see: if the acetyl group is at position 1, nitro at 5, and bromine at 3.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let's think:

If we introduce the nitro group first, say at position 1. Then, brominating would put it in the meta position relative to nitro; but wait, if nitro is at 1, bromine would be at position 3 or 5 depending on where it's added.

Wait, let me think of benzene as a ring with substituents:

If the first substituent is nitro at position 1. Then, adding bromine would go into either position 3 or 5 (meta positions relative to nitro). Let's say bromine goes into position 3. Then, the ring has nitro at 1 and bromo at 3. Now, we need to add the acetyl group. But wait, the acetyl group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. However, the ring already has nitro and bromo substituents. The nitro is at 1, bromo at 3.

Wait, but after adding nitro and bromo, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts acylation might not work. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group; Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So perhaps this approach won't work.

Alternatively, maybe the order is different.

Another approach: perhaps the acylation is done first. Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to become acetophenone. Then, adding nitro and bromine.

But acetophenone's acetyl group is an activating group, ortho/para director. So after acylation, the ring is activated, so further substitution can occur.

So if we start with benzene, do Friedel-Crafts acylation to get acetophenone. Then, nitrate it. Since the acetyl is an activating group, nitration would occur at the ortho or para positions relative to the acetyl group.

Wait, acetophenone is a meta director? Wait, no. Wait, the acetyl group is a strong activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via resonance). Wait, wait, no. Wait, acetyl is an acyl group, which is deactivating. Because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing. So acetophenone is a deactivating, meta-directing group.

Ah, right. So after acylation, the acetyl group is a meta director. So when you nitrate acetophenone, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl group (position 3 or 5?).

Wait, let me imagine acetophenone: benzene with the acetyl group at position 1. Then, nitration would add nitro in the meta position, which would be position 3 or 5, depending on how it's done.

But when you add a second substituent, the existing substituents influence where the next goes.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would be added in the meta position relative to the acetyl group. So let's say the acetyl is at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 3.

Then, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, bromination would occur. The ring now has two substituents: acetyl (meta dir.) and nitro (meta dir.) but the positions influence each other.

Wait, but when there are two substituents, the more activating group (if any) will dominate. Since acetyl is deactivating, and nitro is also deactivating, but perhaps the directing is determined by their positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is a stronger director. Hmm.

Wait, in the presence of multiple substituents, the substituents that are more activating (if any) will have a stronger influence. But in this case, both are deactivating. So their directing effects are considered. Let me think: the acetyl is meta-directing, and the nitro is also meta-directing.

So, if the nitro is at position 3, and the acetyl is at 1, then the next substitution (bromine) could be in a position that is meta to both, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, the ring's substituents could lead the incoming electrophile to a position that's a meta to one and perhaps ortho to another.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think step by step.

So, first, benzene is acylated to form acetophenone (1-acetylbenzene). Then, nitration is done. The acetyl group directs incoming nitro to the meta position, which would be position 3. So now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3.

Now, bromination. The ring has two substituents: acetyl (meta dir.) and nitro (meta dir.). So the incoming Br+ would look for positions that are meta to one of them, but considering both.

Wait, perhaps the positions available would be position 5. Because position 5 is meta to nitro (position 3) and also relative to acetyl. Let me visualize:

Positions:
1: acetyl
3: nitro
5: ?

If the Br+ comes in, it would go where? Let's think about the directing. The acetyl is at 1, which is a meta director. So Br+ would go to position 4 (meta to 1), but wait, position 4 is adjacent to position 3 (nitro). Alternatively, the nitro at 3 is a meta director, so the Br+ would go to position 6 (meta to 3, which is position 6). Or maybe position 5 (which is adjacent to position 3).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The nitro group at position 3 is a meta director, so the Br could go to positions 6 or  (relative to 3, the meta is positions 6 and so on?), but maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the entire molecule. So acetophenone has the acetyl at 1. After nitration at 3, the substituents are at 1 and 3. Now, brominating would need to go to a position that's meta to either the acetyl or the nitro group.

The available positions are 2,4,5,6. But let's see:

- Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (nitro), which is a deactivating group. So perhaps it's not favored.

- Position 5: is that meta to acetyl (position 1)? Let's see: 1, 5 are separated by three positions, making them para? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, position 1, then 2,3,4,5,6. So 1 and 5 are two positions apart; that would make them meta to each other. So yes, position 5 is meta to position 1 (acetyl). So Br+ would go to position 5 if directed by acetyl.

But wait, the nitro group is at 3; if Br is added in position 5, that's adjacent to nitro (position 3 and 5 are two apart, so it's meta to each other). Wait, no. Position 3 and 5 are two apart (3,4,5), so they're meta. So if Br goes to position 5, it's meta to nitro as well.

Hmm, so in this scenario, when you have substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro), the next substitution (Br) could go into position 5, which is meta to both.

Thus, after acylation, nitration, bromination, you would have substituents at 1,3,5. So that's the desired product.

So the steps so far would be:

1. Benzene → acetylation (Friedel-Crafts) → acetophenone (1-acetylbenzene).

2. Nitration → nitro group at position 3.

3. Bromination → bromine at position 5.

But wait, wait. When you add the nitro group, where does it go? Let me double-check. After acetylation, the ring has an acetyl group (deactivating, meta director). So nitration would add the nitro group in the meta position relative to acetyl. So position 3 or 5? Depending on where you add, but let me say position 3. Then, bromination would be done in a position meta to acetyl, which is position 5. Alternatively, maybe it's para to nitro. Hmm, perhaps this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine should be added before nitration. Let me think about that.

If I start with benzene, first brominate, then acetylate, then nitrate.

Wait, let's try that.

1. Benzene → bromination (FeBr3) → bromobenzene.

2. Acetylation (Friedel-Crafts) → the acetyl group would add in the meta position relative to bromine, because bromine is a deactivating, ortho/para director. Wait, but wait: Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, but bromine is deactivating. So after bromination, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work. So that approach won't work. So bromine can't be added before acylation.

Thus, acylation has to come first.

So back to the first approach: acylation first, then nitration and bromination.

So now, after acylation, nitration adds nitro at position 3, then bromination at position 5.

But wait, how does the bromination happen? Because after nitration, the ring has two substituents: acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, when adding Br, the ring is deactivated because both groups are deactivating. But perhaps with a strong electrophile, it can still proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group directs the Br to a specific position.

Wait another thing: perhaps the nitro group is a stronger director than acetyl. Let me think: the nitro group is a strong deactivating meta director. So when adding Br, the nitro group would direct the incoming Br to the meta position relative to itself, which is position 6. But that's not where we want it (we want Br at 5). Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group directs it to position 5.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is where the acetyl is. Nitro is at position 3. Then, the incoming Br would look for positions that are meta to either of these substituents.

The positions available are 2,4,5,6.

So, position 5 is meta to acetyl (1), because 1 and 5 are three positions apart (1 → 2 → 3 → 5? Wait, no, 1 to 5 is four positions away, which is para, not meta. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. The positions go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, with each adjacent. So the positions opposite to 1 is 4. So position 1, meta would be 3 and 5. So for the acetyl at 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5.

Similarly, the nitro at 3 has meta positions at 6 and 1 (but 1 is already occupied by acetyl), so the next available meta position is 6.

So when adding Br, the possible positions would be 5 (meta to acetyl) and 6 (meta to nitro). Now, which one would it choose?

Well, considering that the nitro group is a stronger deactivating, perhaps the Br would be more likely to add meta to the nitro group. So it would go to position 6. But that's not what we want; we need Br at 5. Hmm.

So perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe the order of adding nitro and bromine needs to be swapped.

Wait, perhaps after acylation, we brominate first, then nitrate. Let me see.

1. Benzene → acylation → acetophenone (1-acetyl).

2. Bromination: Since the acetyl is meta-directing, Br would add at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

Now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3.

3. Nitration: Now, the acetyl is a meta director, Br is also a meta director (since Br is deactivating, ortho/para would be possible, but maybe it's more likely to be meta under certain conditions? Hmm, not sure. Wait, Br is an ortho/para director. So now, after adding Br at 3, the next substituent (nitro) would be directed by both acetyl (meta) and Br (ortho/para).

So where would the nitro group go? 

The acetyl is at 1, Br at 3.

The acetyl directs meta, so possible positions for nitro are 4 (meta to 1) or 5 and 3 (but 3 is already occupied). But wait, meta to 1 is position 4? Or is it position 5?

Wait, position 1's meta is 3 and 5. Position 3 is already taken by Br, so the next possibility is position 5. But let's see.

Wait, position 1: meta is 3 and 5. Since Br is at 3, the acetyl would prefer the other meta position, which is 5.

But Br is at 3, which is an ortho/para director. So for nitration, the possible positions would be ortho (2,4) or para (6) relative to Br. But the existing substituents are at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br).

So, for Br at 3, the ortho positions are 2 and 4; para is 6.

But the acetyl is at 1, which is meta to Br (3), so perhaps the nitro group is directed by the acetyl to position 5.

But how does that happen when there are two substituents?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group ends up in position 5 because that's meta to acetyl and para to Br. Wait, position 5 is adjacent to Br (3). So that's ortho to Br, but perhaps the directing effect of the acetyl is stronger.

So in this scenario, nitration would add nitro at position 5. Then, the substituents are acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That's exactly what we need.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetylation: benzene → acetophenone (1-acetyl).

2. Bromination: acetophenone → 3-bromoacetophenone.

3. Nitration: 3-bromoacetophenone → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

But wait, let me check the nitration step again. After Br is added at 3, the ring has substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br). When adding nitro, the acetyl is a meta director (positions 3 and 5), and Br is an ortho/para director (positions 2,4,6).

The possible positions for nitro would be where both directing effects agree. Perhaps position 5 is meta to acetyl and not conflicting with Br's direction.

Alternatively, perhaps position 5 is the only available position that's meta to acetyl and not occupied by Br.

So, this order would give the desired substituents at 1,3,5.

But wait, in the target, the substituent positions are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, with the acetyl at 1. So let's confirm: after acylation (1), bromine (3), nitro (5), that's the correct configuration.

So the order of reactions would be: acetylation, bromination, nitration.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which option follows this sequence.

Looking at the options:

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

v) Fe/HCl → reduction (maybe to remove nitro?)

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → something like a hydrolysis or reduction?

Wait, option B doesn't seem to fit. Because the first step is bromination, which would not be possible after the previous steps.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

v) HNO3 → another nitration.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

Hmm, this seems to involve multiple nitrations and other steps. Not sure.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → ?

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitration.

This seems complicated, but perhaps not matching our desired order.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) HNO3 → nitration again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

So option A's steps are: acetylate first, then brominate, then nitrate. Then reduction, nitrate again, which seems unlikely.

Wait, but in the correct order, after acetylation, bromination, then nitration. So the steps would be:

1. Acetylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3).

2. Bromination (Br2/FeBr3).

3. Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4).

Looking for an option that has these steps in this order.

Looking at the options:

Option B starts with bromination, so no.

Option A: step i is acetylation, step ii bromination, step iii nitration. Then steps iv and beyond, which we don't need.

Wait, but the target molecule has only one nitro group and one bromine. So perhaps the options have more steps because they're trying to fit all in. But our desired steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. So option A has i) acetylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. So perhaps that's the correct sequence.

Wait, but the target has nitro at 5 and bromine at 3. So after step iii in option A, the nitro would be at position 5 (meta to acetyl), and bromine at 3 (from step ii). So that gives the correct structure.

But then what are steps iv to vii in option A? Let's see:

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of the nitro group. But in the target, there's a nitro group, so that would be incorrect.

Wait, the target requires a nitro group, so any step that reduces nitro (like Fe/HCl) would remove it. So that's a problem. So option A's steps after nitration would alter the structure, which is not desired.

So perhaps option A is not the correct answer.

Looking again at the options, which option includes acetylation, bromination, and nitration in the correct order without any steps that would remove the nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not seeing it. Let me re-examine.

Option B's steps:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

But if we start with benzene, bromination would make bromobenzene, which is deactivated. Then acetylation (step iii) wouldn't work because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So option B's first step can't be correct.

So perhaps the correct option is not among the options? No, that's not possible. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the nitration occurs before bromination, but in a way that allows the substituents to be in the correct positions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro group is added after bromine, but in a situation where the directing effects allow the correct positioning.

Let me think: if after acetylation, we nitrate first, then brominate.

So steps:

1. Acetylation → acetophenone (1-acetyl).

2. Nitration → nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl).

3. Bromination → Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl, which is at 1), but wait, position 3 is meta to 1. But in this case, after nitration, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 5.

Now, when adding Br, the substituents are acetyl (1) and nitro (5). The acetyl is a meta director, and the nitro is a meta director.

The acetyl would direct Br to position 3 or 5. But position 5 is already taken by nitro, so Br would go to 3.

Wait, but position 3 is adjacent to nitro (5 is three positions away from 3?), no, 3 and 5 are two positions apart, so that's meta. So if nitro is at 5, the acetyl at 1 directs to 3 and 5. Since 5 is taken, Br would go to 3.

So that would give the correct structure: acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetylation.

2. Nitration.

3. Bromination.

Now, looking for an option that does acetylation, then nitration, then bromination.

Looking at the options:

Option C: i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) acetylation, iv) bromination, etc. So steps i and ii don't fit.

Option B: starts with bromination, which is not correct.

Option D: i) nitration, so that's not correct.

Hmm, none of the options directly match this order.

Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps I'm not considering that after nitration, the ring might have a different director.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acetylation, bromination, then nitration. But earlier I thought that in option A, after nitration, there's a step that reduces the nitro group.

But perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration. But since the ring is deactivated by Br, nitration might be difficult. Also, where would the nitro group add? It would be ortho or para to Br.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation. But the ring has Br and nitro, which are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So this option seems incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine. Then, acetylation.

But if after nitration and reduction, the ring is activated again (since amine is activating), but then acetylation would happen.

But let's see:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation. The amine is an ortho/para director, activating. So acetylation would add in ortho or para to amine (which was position 1). So acetyl could be at 3 or 5.

Then, iv) Br2 → bromination. The ring has acetyl (3 or 5) and amine (1). So where would Br go?

Alternatively, perhaps this approach leads to the substituents in the correct positions, but I'm not certain.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → forms diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis to form phenol.

v) Br2 → bromination (maybe on the phenol? Not sure).

vi) CH3COCl → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → another nitration.

This seems complicated and probably not the right path.

So, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not finding it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in thinking about the steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acetylation, bromination, nitration, and none of the options have that. Let me check the options again.

Option A:

Reagents:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → adds Br in meta to acetyl (position 3).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → adds nitro in meta to acetyl, which is position 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. But the target has nitro, so this is bad.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? That's not needed.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

So option A's steps after the initial three are incorrect.

Option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro in para to Br.

iii) Acetylation → can't happen because Br is deactivating.

So option B is wrong.

Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine (NH2 at 1).

iii) Acetylation → acetyl adds ortho or para to NH2.

Assuming it adds at 3.

iv) Br2 → bromination. Where would Br add? The ring has NH2 (1) and acetyl (3). NH2 is activating, directs to ortho and para. So Br would add at 5 (meta to acetyl?), but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps after acetylation at 3, bromination would add at 5.

Then, another nitration (step v) would add nitro somewhere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, after step iv in option C, we have Br at 5. Then step v is another nitration, which would add nitro where?

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetylation, nitration, bromination, but looking at the options, none have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is nitration, bromination, acetylation.

Wait, let's see. If I start with benzene, nitrate to get nitro at 1. Then brominate: nitro is meta director, so Br at 3 or 5. Let's say 3. Then acetylation: but the ring has nitro (deactivating), so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that can't be.

So the only viable option seems to be option B, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetylation, bromination, nitration, and the steps in option A do that. But after nitration, there are steps that might not affect the substituents. Or perhaps the subsequent steps are part of another process.

Wait, let me re-examine option A's steps:

i) Acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Bromination → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) Nitration → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) Nitration again → adds another nitro group?

vi) Diazotization and H3PO2 → perhaps forms something else.

But the target has one nitro group. So steps iv onwards in option A would change the structure, which is bad.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetylation, bromination, then nitration. So the correct option would have these three steps in that order.

Looking back, option A does acetylation first, then bromination, then nitration. Even though it has additional steps after, perhaps those steps are not relevant or are part of a different synthesis path.

Wait, but the target molecule doesn't have any amine or other groups. The steps after nitration in option A might not be part of the correct synthesis. Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering the initial steps, but that's not the case; the entire sequence must lead to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis → phenol.

v) Br2 → bromination → bromophenol? Not sure.

vi) CH3COCl → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → another nitration.

This seems way off track.

So, perhaps the correct option is option B. Wait, let me think again.

Option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration. Nitration of bromobenzene would add nitro in para to Br (since Br is ortho/para director but deactivating).

So nitro would be at position 4 (if Br is at 1). Wait, but let me think: benzene with Br at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 4 (para to Br) or position 2 or 6 (ortho).

But nitration is more likely to occur para to Br, so nitro at 4.

Then, step iii is acetylation. But the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4, both deactivating. Friedel-Crafts won't proceed, so option B's step iii (acetylation) wouldn't work.

So option B is incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last. So, the steps would be:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Brominate → 3-bromoacetophenone.

3. Nitrate → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Which matches the target.

Looking for an option where acetylation is first, then bromination, then nitration.

Looking at option A:

i) Acetylation.

ii) Bromination.

iii) Nitration.

So those three steps would produce the correct product. The remaining steps (iv to vii) would need to be something that doesn't alter the structure, but that's not possible because the target has only those three substituents.

Wait, so perhaps the question is considering only the first three steps, but the options list all the steps needed to get to the target.

But looking at the options, option A has seven steps, but the first three would produce the desired product. The subsequent steps might be for something else, but the question is about the entire sequence leading to the target.

So perhaps none of the options are correct, which can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bromine is introduced after the nitro group. Let me think.

After acetylation, nitration adds nitro at position 3. Then bromination adds Br at position 5.

But how would that happen? Because after nitration, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). So when adding Br, it would be directed by both substituents.

The acetyl is meta director, so Br would go to 5. The nitro is meta director, so Br would go to 6 or 1. But 1 is taken by acetyl, so 6 is possible. But we want Br at 5.

Wait, perhaps the acetyl's directing effect is stronger, so Br would go to 5.

Thus, the steps would be acetylation, nitration, bromination.

But looking at the options, none of them have this sequence.

Wait, looking back, option C's steps are:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylate to acetanilide.

iv) Br2 → brominate. Acetanilide is an activating group, directing to ortho and para.

So Br would add in positions ortho or para to NHCOCH3.

Wait, but after acetylation, the acetanilide is at position 1. Then, bromination would add Br at position 3 or 5.

Wait, acetanilide is a strong activating group, so bromine would add in ortho or para.

But wait, bromination with FeBr3 is a typical electrophilic substitution. So after acetylation, the acetanilide directs Br to ortho or para.

So, if acetanilide is at position 1, Br could be at 3 (ortho) or 4 (para).

But we need Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, but this approach doesn't get nitro at 5.

Alternatively, perhaps after acetylation, nitration is done, but that's not in option C.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. I think the correct answer is option B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct one, and the subsequent steps are unnecessary or cancel each other out.

Wait, going back to the initial plan: the correct steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. Looking at option A, these are the first three steps. So the product after these three steps would be correct. But the full option A has more steps which would alter the product, which is not desired. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, because the first three steps are correct, and the rest are either not relevant or perhaps a distraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the essential steps, but the options include all steps. Maybe the question is designed such that the first three steps in option A are the correct ones, regardless of what comes after.

In that case, the correct answer would be option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in the correct positions. The target molecule has a ketone group (from ethan-1-one) attached to the benzene ring at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The order of substitution is critical because each substituent directs subsequent substitutions based on its electronic effects (activating or deactivating) and directing properties (ortho, meta, or para).

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Acetylation using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ introduces the ketone group at position 1, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination using Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3, which is meta to the acetyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration using HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group and does not interfere with the bromine at position 3.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, NaNO₂/HCl, and H₃PO₂, which are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and could alter the structure. However, the first three steps are sufficient to produce the desired product.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination using Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine to benzene, forming bromobenzene. However, bromine is a deactivating group, making further electrophilic substitution difficult.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration using HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group, but the deactivated ring limits the reaction, and the nitro group would likely end up in the para position relative to bromine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ is unlikely to proceed because the ring is deactivated by the bromine and nitro groups.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration using HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group to benzene, forming nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction using Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ introduces the ketone group. However, the amine group directs substitution to the ortho and para positions, which does not align with the desired meta positioning for the ketone.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve bromination, additional nitration, and other reactions, but the sequence does not lead to the correct substitution pattern.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration using HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group to benzene, forming nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction using Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization using NaNO₂/HCl and subsequent reaction with H₃PO₂ do not align with the desired synthesis pathway.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve bromination, acetylation, and additional nitration, but the sequence does not produce the correct substitution pattern.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is acetylation, bromination, and nitration, which is represented by the first three steps of **Option A**. While the additional steps in Option A are unnecessary, the first three steps are sufficient to produce the target molecule. Therefore, **Option A** is the best choice.
