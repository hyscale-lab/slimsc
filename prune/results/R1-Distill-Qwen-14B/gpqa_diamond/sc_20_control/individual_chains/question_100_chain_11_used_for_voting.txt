Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Let me break down each step and see what each product is.

First, Compound A is C3H6. Well, that's propene, right? Because propene has the formula C3H6 (the double bond makes it alkene with formula CnH2n). Wait, no, wait. Wait, n=3, so 2n=6? Hmm, propene is C3H6. So A is propene.

Step 1: Bromination in CCl4. Oh, that's probably an addition reaction. Propene (an alkene) reacting with bromine (Br2) in CCl4 would add across the double bond. So the double bond in propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Step 2: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, which I think is used for elimination reactions. So the dibromide would undergo dehydrohalogenation, probably eliminating HBr twice. Let me think. So if we have 1,2-dibromopropane and treat it with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it should eliminate HBr twice to form an alkene again. Wait, but where? The starting material was propene, after bromination it's 1,2-dibromopropane. Eliminating HBr from adjacent Brs would form either 1-propene or maybe another isomer.

Wait, wait. Let's imagine the structure. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When KOH (alcohol) is added, which is a base and a good nucleophile. But since it's alcoholic, the conditions are for elimination, not substitution. So it'll likely form an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. 

In 1,2-dibromopropane, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. When the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, it could form either 1-propene or maybe something else. Wait, but wait. Let's think about the possible products. If the base removes a hydrogen from the CH2Br group, adjacent to the CHBrCH3. So maybe elimination occurs between the two central carbons, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3?

Wait, another approach: the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when KOH is added in alcohol, it's E2 mechanism. The Br on the first carbon (CH2Br) and the Br on the second (CHBr) can both leave. Wait, no, E2 is a concerted process where a base abstracts a hydrogen that's anti to the leaving group. So in this case, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. So perhaps elimination occurs between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3.

Wait, let's think about each Br. If the Br on C1 (CH2Br) is leaving, but wait, that's Br on a CH2 group. Alternatively, the Br on C2 (CHBr) is next to another Br on C1.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure:

CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

When KOH attacks, it can abstract a hydrogen from either the adjacent carbon to a Br. So for the Br on C1 (CH2Br), the adjacent carbons are C2. So H from C2 would be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. Similarly, the Br on C2 is attached to CHBr, which is connected to C1 (CH2Br) and C3 (CH3). So abstracting a H from C1 or C3 could lead to elimination.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a β-H from C3, which is attached to the Br on C2, then elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. But wait, the structure after elimination would be either 1-propene (CH2=CHCH2Br?) No, wait, no, because both Brs are eliminated as HBr.

Wait, no. Each elimination would remove one H and the Br. So in the case of 1,2-dibromide, eliminating two HBr molecules would give back an alkene. Wait, but wait. The starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane. On treatment with alcoholic KOH, each Br would eliminate, each time losing an H and a Br. So perhaps the product is propene again, but perhaps a different isomer.

Wait, wait no: the initial structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when the base removes a H from CH2Br, the adjacent Br on CHBr would leave, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. That would give CH2=CH-CH2Br? Wait, but that's not possible because we have two Brs. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the actual reaction would remove both Brs, eliminating two molecules of HBr. So in 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr would form either 1-propene or 2-propene (which is the same as 1-propene because propene is CH2=CHCH3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-butadiene? No, because the starting molecule is propane, so elimination would lead to a double bond, but in this case, since it's a dibromide, two eliminations would occur.

Wait no, perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons, so when two eliminations happen, the result is a double bond between C1 and C2, and another double bond? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-propene. Because you eliminate two HBr, so the three carbons are connected by a double bond, CH2=CHCH3. But wait, that's the same as the original propene. Wait, but wait, the initial compound was propene, then brominated to 1,2-dibromide, then elimination gives back propene. So compound C would be propene again. But wait, that doesn't make sense because in the next step, when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it might undergo some sort of reaction.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When 1,2-dibromopropane is treated with alcoholic KOH, the base will deprotonate and cause elimination. Each elimination removes HBr. So for each Br, an H is abstracted from the adjacent carbon, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond.

Wait, but in the case of 1,2-dibromide, eliminating one HBr would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would leave another Br on C2. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe the product is 1-bromo-1-propene? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide eliminating two HBr to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction: 1,2-dibromide → when treated with alcoholic KOH, forms 1-propene.

So compound C is propene.

Wait, but wait, then what happens next. Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, which is a common setup for dehydrohalogenation or possibly for breaking double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction.

Wait, no: propene (CH2=CHCH3) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. That's a condition for dehydrogenation perhaps, forming something else. Wait, but propene is already an alkene. Wait, another possibility is that it's a catalytic dehydrogenation to form something else. Alternatively, maybe the iron is a catalyst for some other kind of reaction, like hydrogenation, but that would add hydrogen, which doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, but another thought: when propene is passed over a hot iron, maybe it undergoes a reaction to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the hot iron is a catalyst for dehydrogenation, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a condition for a different reaction, like forming a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake earlier. Let me check the first steps again.

Wait, perhaps when 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3) reacts with alcoholic KOH, it doesn't eliminate twice but perhaps forms a different product. Wait, maybe it forms 1-bromopropene? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a free radical substitution, but in the presence of alcoholic KOH, which is a deprotonating agent, I think elimination is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is 1-bromopropene. Let me think: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2Br. But wait, that's a possibility after elimination of one HBr. So if only one HBr is eliminated, we get CH2=CHCH2Br. But why would that happen? Because the other Br is on the adjacent carbon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: 1,2-dibromide → when treated with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice. Each elimination removes HBr, and the result is the formation of an alkene between the two middle carbons. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So upon eliminating two HBr molecules, we would get CH2=CHCH3, which is propene. So that would be the same as compound A. But I'm not sure; perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but in that case, compound C is propene again, so the next step is to pass it through a red-hot iron tube. Let's think about that reaction. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. I remember that when alkenes are passed over red-hot iron, they can undergo dehydrogenation to form alkenes. Wait, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydrogenation, but that would require adding hydrogen, which I don't think is happening here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is different. Oh! Wait, another possibility: when alkenes are treated with hot iron in the presence of water, they can undergo hydroxylation, but that's more like the oxymercuration reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing some kind of isomerization. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reaction wrong. Let me think again: propene (CH2=CHCH3) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't make sense because there's no halide left. Alternatively, perhaps the setup is for a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: if the reaction is with a red-hot iron, perhaps it's a hydrogenation catalyst. But propene is already an alkene, so hydrogenation would add hydrogen and make propane, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is a catalyst for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the propene is undergoing some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck here. Let's move forward and see if that helps. The next step is that compound D is formed. Then, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Then, compound E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Then F reacts with nitrous acid to form G, and G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Wait, perhaps I should try to figure out each step.

But let's get back to the beginning. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.

Compound A is C3H6: that's propene, correct. Then, bromination in CCl4: Br2 adds across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3), which is compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so it's likely an elimination reaction. So we have 1,2-dibromide reacting, which would eliminate two HBr molecules. The product would be propene again, but perhaps in a different position, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, and that's the same structure as before. So compound C is propene.

Then, compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, I think I remember that when propene is passed over a hot iron, it can form something else. Oh wait! Wait a second. When alkenes are treated with hot iron, especially in the presence of water, they can undergo hydration to form alcohols. But I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's more like the oxymercuration reaction, which uses a mercury catalyst and water.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is a catalyst for a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but there's no halide present.

Wait, another possibility: when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it forms benzene. Wait, no, that's not possible because you need more carbon atoms. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming something else, but I'm stuck. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about what compound C is.

Wait, wait. Let me think again: Could compound C be something else? If in step 2, instead of getting propene, I get 1-bromopropene (CH2=CHCH2Br), then what happens in step 3?

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different product. Let me think about the structure of B: CH2BrCHBrCH3. When KOH (alcohol) is added, perhaps the base abstracts a β-H from the first Br (on C1), leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. Then, the adjacent Br on C2 would be eliminated as well, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2 and another Br on C3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-bromopropene, with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a Br on C3.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it step by step. Let's see:

Structure of B: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

When KOH attacks, it abstracts a β-H. So, for the Br on C1, the adjacent β-H is on C2. So the base abstracts a H from C2, and the Br on C1 leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure becomes CH2=CH-CH2Br (1-bromopropene). But wait, that's only eliminating one HBr. But the molecule has two Brs, so perhaps another elimination happens.

Wait, but after the first elimination, the structure is CH2=CHCH2Br. Now, can another elimination happen? Because now we have a Br on C3. The adjacent β-H would be on C2, which is already part of the double bond. So perhaps the second elimination is not possible, or perhaps it leads to a different structure.

Wait, but perhaps the initial reaction from B leads to a different product. Maybe it's a 1,3-diene? No, because the starting material is propane.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromide eliminating to form 1,2-dibromide again. No, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the product from step 2 is 1-bromopropene (CH2=CHCH2Br), and then in step 3, when passed through a red-hot iron, it loses HBr, forming something else. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the product from step 2 is 2-bromopropene. Let me think again: the dibromide is CH2BrCHBrCH3. If the base abstracts a H from the C3 (the third carbon), which is adjacent to the Br on C2, then elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2Br-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, elimination would form CH2=CH2 (ethene) but that's not possible with this structure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think again. The reaction of 1,2-dibromide with alcoholic KOH likely leads to the formation of 1,2-dibromide → propene via two elimination steps, resulting in the formation of propene again. So compound C is propene.

Then, when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it undergoes some kind of hydrogenation or dehydrogenation. Wait, but propene is an alkene, so if hydrogen is added, it would become propane. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation to form something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to form something like cyclopropane? But I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: when propene is passed through a red-hot iron in the presence of steam, it might undergo hydration to form propan-2-ol. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is a catalyst for some kind of oxidation or reduction.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward and see what the subsequent steps are. Let's say compound D is something else, perhaps propene after some reaction becomes something else.

But let me think about each step again. So far:

A: C3H6 → propene.

B: bromination → 1,2-dibromide.

C: elimination → propene.

D: propene → something after red-hot iron.

Assuming D is propene, then when it's treated with two strong acids, perhaps concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid. Wait, that's a mixture for nitrating an alkene. But propene is an alkene, and nitrating it would add a nitro group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when propene is treated with concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3, it undergoes nitration to form nitropropane. So compound E would be nitropropane (CH2=CHCH2NO2), but wait, I'm not sure about the position. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different product.

Wait, but if D is propene, then E would be nitropropane, perhaps. Then, compound E is treated with iron and HCl. Wait, Fe and HCl. I'm not sure, but perhaps it's a reduction reaction. Nitro groups are reduced in the presence of Fe and HCl to form amines. So if E is nitropropane, then F would be propane-1-amine (CH2=CHCH2NH2).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is in a different position.

Then, compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines to form diazonium salts, which can decompose. So if F is an amine, G would be the corresponding diazonium chloride.

Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids or phenols, depending on the structure. If F is an amine derived from propane, then hydrolysis would form a carboxylic acid. So H would be propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH) but wait, I'm not sure about the structure.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about each product and the options given.

The options are about the correctness of statements about the products.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Well, if F is an amine, amines are often used in dye synthesis. So A could be correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. If H is a carboxylic acid, then adding ferric chloride would not give a color. But if H is a phenol, which can form a complex with FeCl3, then it would turn yellow. Hmm, but earlier steps don't suggest phenol formation. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propene, then its NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3. So that wouldn't give two singlets. Alternatively, if D is a different compound, maybe a di-substituted alkene, which would have different peaks.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is propene, which is a gas at standard conditions, and flammable, then D would be correct.

Wait, but let me go back. I think I made a mistake in step 3. Let me re-examine that.

Step 3: Compound C is propene (from step 2), which is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, perhaps the correct reaction here is the dehydrogenation of propene to form another compound. Wait, but propene has three carbons and one double bond. Dehydrogenation would require removing H to form another double bond, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrogenation that adds H to form propane.

Wait, if that's the case, then D would be propane. Then, when propane is treated with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3), perhaps it undergoes sulfonation or nitration. But alkanes are generally resistant to such reactions unless under very high pressure. Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, but that would make E something else.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about compound C. Let me think again. If compound C is propene, and then it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a condition for forming carbon dioxide or some other product. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step 2. Maybe the product of step 2 is not propene, but something else.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that compound B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When treated with alcoholic KOH, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form 1-bromopropene (CH2=CHCH2Br). Then, in step 3, this compound is passed through a red-hot iron, which might cause further elimination. So CH2=CHCH2Br could eliminate HBr to form CH2=CHCH2, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form another double bond.

Wait, but wait, CH2=CHCH2Br could eliminate HBr, forming something else. If the Br is on C3, then eliminating H from C2 would form a double bond between C2 and C3, but that would lead to CH2=CH2, which is ethene. But that would require losing the Br and an H from C2.

So, CH2=CHCH2Br → (eliminate HBr) → CH2=CH2 + HBr.

Wait, that would make D ethene (ethene is C2H4, a gas). Then, D is ethene.

Then, ethene (C2H4) is treated with two strong acids. Hmmm, what reaction occurs when ethene is treated with concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3?

Well, that's the nitrating mixture. Ethene can undergo nitration to form ethene's nitro derivative. The reaction would add a nitro group across the double bond, forming 1-nitroethylene? Or perhaps 1,2-dinitroethylene if two nitro groups are added.

Wait, but the product would be an di-substituted nitro compound. Let's say E is 1-nitroethylene (CH2NO2-CH2), but more accurately, it would be CH2=CHNO2, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs at one end, leading to CH2CH2NO2, but I'm not certain.

Then, E is treated with iron and HCl. Iron and HCl are typically used for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So if E is CH2=CHNO2, then F would be CH2=CHNH2.

Then, F (CH2=CHNH2) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts. So G would be the diazonium chloride, CH2=CHN2Cl.

Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids or phenol derivatives, depending on the substitution. Since CH2=CHN2Cl is a primary diazonium salt, hydrolysis would form CH2=COOH (propenoic acid?), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. CH2=CHNH2 → CH2=CHN2Cl → upon hydrolysis with NaOH, it would form CH2=COOH (propanoic acid? No, wait, CH2=CH2COOH would be something else. Wait, perhaps CH2=CH2COOH is not correct. Alternatively, it would form CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid), but that's C3H4O2.

But now, let's look at the options.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH2=CHNH2, which is a primary amine. Amines are used in dye synthesis, so A is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid). Propenoic acid is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids don't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. Phenols do, because FeCl3 is a catalyst for the formation of the phenolic complex. So if H were a phenol, B would be correct. But in our case, H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't form a yellow color with FeCl3. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is ethene (C2H4), which is a gas. The structure is CH2=CH2. The NMR would show a quartet for each set of protons because each CH2 group is adjacent to the other. Wait, no, in ethene, each CH2 is a triplet, but wait, no, ethene has two equivalent CH2 groups, each with two protons. Actually, in ethene, each CH2 group is a quartet because each proton is adjacent to two protons on the adjacent CH2. Wait, no, ethene is a planar molecule with each CH2 group having two protons. Each set is a quartet because each H is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Wait, but in reality, in ethene, the two CH2 groups are equivalent, so the NMR would show a single quartet integrating to 4H. So the statement in option C says D gives two singlets. That doesn't match because D is ethene, which would have one quartet. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), which is a gas at standard conditions and is flammable. So option D is correct.

Now, the question is to find the incorrect statement. So if option B and option C are incorrect, but the question says which statement is incorrect about the products.

Wait, but let me re-examine the steps. If D is ethene, its NMR would show a quartet, but the option says two singlets, so option C is incorrect.

Now, looking back, I think I made a mistake in the initial steps, particularly in step 3. If in step 3, propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube and forms ethene, then D is ethene. But how?

Wait, another possibility: when propene (CH2=CHCH3) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it undergoes dehydrogenation to form acetylene (C2H2). But that doesn't fit with the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation again, but without any halide present, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but propene is already dehydrated. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that D is ethene, then move forward.

So, looking at the options:

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3 to give color. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: D (ethene) in NMR gives two singlets. Ethene's NMR has each set of H as a quartet, so option C is incorrect.

So, the incorrect statements are B and C. But the question asks for the incorrect statement about the products, so which option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the steps. Let me re-examine.

If I'm correct that D is ethene, then:

Option C says D gives two singlets. Ethene has a quartet, so option C is incorrect.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, so B is incorrect.

So the options have two incorrect statements, but the question is asking which option is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps my understanding is wrong. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in step 3, propene is converted into something else. Let me think again.

If step 3 is forming something else, perhaps propene is passed through a red-hot iron, which could cause a hydrogenation to form propane. So D is propane.

Then, D (propane) reacts with two strong acids. Propane is an alkane, and nitrating it would require high pressure, but perhaps the reaction isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, but reacting with propane would not yield a nitro compound. So maybe this scenario is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, then E is something else. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I'm spending, perhaps I should make a decision based on the information I have.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is an amine; possible.

B) H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid; no, so B is incorrect.

C) D gives two singlets. If D is ethene, which gives a quartet, so C is incorrect.

D) C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable; correct.

So the question is to find the incorrect statement. The options are A, B, C, D. So options B and C are incorrect statements. But the question says which is incorrect about the products.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in step 2. Let me think again.

If step 2: 1,2-dibromide → elimination to form 1-bromopropene (CH2=CHCH2Br). Then, step 3: passing through red-hot iron, perhaps elimination of HBr occurs, forming CH2=CHCH2Br → CH2=CHCH2 + HBr. But that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form CH2=CH2 (ethene).

So, in that case, D is ethene.

Thus, the statement in option C is D gives two singlets. D is ethene, which has a quartet in NMR, so statement C is incorrect.

The statement in option B is H gives a yellow color. H is the product after G (diazonium salt) reacts with NaOH. If G is the diazonium salt of CH2=CHNH2, then upon hydrolysis, it forms CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid). Propionic acid is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3. So option B is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about the incorrect statement. So both B and C could be incorrect. But the options are given as four options, and the question states that one is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about H's structure. Let me think again. If F is CH2=CHCH2NH2, then upon reaction with nitrous acid, it forms the corresponding diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis with NaOH would form CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid). Which is a carboxylic acid. So H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3, so option B is incorrect.

So the incorrect statements are B and C.

But the options are only four, and the question says to choose the incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining what D is. Let me think: If D is propane, then its NMR would show a triplet for each CH3 group, but that's a singlet overall. So option C says D gives two singlets. If D is propane, then its NMR would be a singlet (all nine H are equivalent in CH3CH2CH3), so two singlets would mean something else. So perhaps D isn't propane.

Alternatively, if D is something else, like 1,2-dibromide, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck and should just proceed to the conclusion.

The incorrect statement is either B or C.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR.

If D is ethene, then its structure is CH2=CH2. The two CH2 groups are equivalent, so each H would be a quartet, but the overall NMR would show a single quartet integrating to four H. So two singlets would not be the case. So option C is incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3, so option B is incorrect.

So both B and C are incorrect. But the question asks for the incorrect statement. Since only one option is correct, perhaps the intended answer is option B.

Wait, but let me look at the possible answers again. The question is to find the incorrect statement.

If the product H is a phenol, then option B would be correct. But in our case, H is a carboxylic acid, so option B is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step where H is formed. If F is an aromatic amine, then upon hydrolysis, H would be a phenol, which would react with FeCl3. But in our case, F is CH2=CHNH2, which is an aliphatic amine. So upon hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, it would form a carboxylic acid, not a phenol. So option B is incorrect.

So the incorrect statements are B and C. But since only one option is correct, I think the intended answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C3H6), identified as propene. Bromination in carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to elimination of two HBr molecules, regenerating propene (Compound C). When propene (Compound C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form ethene (Compound D). 

Compound D (ethene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3), leading to nitration and the formation of 1-nitroethylene (Compound E). Reaction of E with iron and hydrochloric acid reduces the nitro group to an amine, forming allylamine (CH2=CHCH2NH2, Compound F). Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form the diazonium salt (Compound G), which upon reaction with NaOH hydrolyzes to propenoic acid (CH2=CHCOOH, Compound H).

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.  
   F is allylamine (CH2=CHCH2NH2), which is indeed used in dye synthesis. This statement is correct.

2. **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution.  
   H is propenoic acid (CH2=CHCOOH), a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids do not react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. Phenols, not carboxylic acids, form a yellow complex with FeCl3. This statement is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.  
   D is ethene (CH2=CH2). In its 1H NMR spectrum, the two equivalent CH2 groups produce a single quartet, not two singlets. This statement is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: C is a flammable gas.  
   C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), which is a flammable gas at standard conditions. This statement is correct.

### Conclusion:
Both options B and C are incorrect, but the question asks for the single incorrect statement. Since option B explicitly contradicts the chemical properties of Compound H, it is the best choice for the incorrect statement.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Let me break down each step and see what each product is.

First, Compound A is C3H6. Well, that's propene, right? Because propene has the formula C3H6 (the double bond makes it alkene with formula CnH2n). Wait, no, wait. Wait, n=3, so 2n=6? Hmm, propene is C3H6. So A is propene.

Step 1: Bromination in CCl4. Oh, that's probably an addition reaction. Propene (an alkene) reacting with bromine (Br2) in CCl4 would add across the double bond. So the double bond in propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Step 2: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, which I think is used for elimination reactions. So the dibromide would undergo dehydrohalogenation, probably eliminating HBr twice. Let me think. So if we have 1,2-dibromopropane and treat it with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it should eliminate HBr twice to form an alkene again. Wait, but where? The starting material was propene, after bromination it's 1,2-dibromopropane. Eliminating HBr from adjacent Brs would form either 1-propene or maybe another isomer.

Wait, wait. Let's imagine the structure. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When KOH (alcohol) is added, which is a base and a good nucleophile. But since it's alcoholic, the conditions are for elimination, not substitution. So it'll likely form an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. 

In 1,2-dibromopropane, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. When the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, it could form either 1-propene or maybe something else. Wait, but wait. Let's think about the possible products. If the base removes a hydrogen from the CH2Br group, adjacent to the CHBrCH3. So maybe elimination occurs between the two central carbons, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3?

Wait, another approach: the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when KOH is added in alcohol, it's E2 mechanism. The Br on the first carbon (CH2Br) and the Br on the second (CHBr) can both leave. Wait, no, E2 is a concerted process where a base abstracts a hydrogen that's anti to the leaving group. So in this case, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. So perhaps elimination occurs between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3.

Wait, let's think about each Br. If the Br on C1 (CH2Br) is leaving, but wait, that's Br on a CH2 group. Alternatively, the Br on C2 (CHBr) is next to another Br on C1.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure:

CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

When KOH attacks, it can abstract a hydrogen from either the adjacent carbon to a Br. So for the Br on C1 (CH2Br), the adjacent carbons are C2. So H from C2 would be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. Similarly, the Br on C2 is attached to CHBr, which is connected to C1 (CH2Br) and C3 (CH3). So abstracting a H from C1 or C3 could lead to elimination.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a β-H from C3, which is attached to the Br on C2, then elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. But wait, the structure after elimination would be either 1-propene (CH2=CHCH2Br?) No, wait, no, because both Brs are eliminated as HBr.

Wait, no. Each elimination would remove one H and the Br. So in the case of 1,2-dibromide, eliminating two HBr molecules would give back an alkene. Wait, but wait. The starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane. On treatment with alcoholic KOH, each Br would eliminate, each time losing an H and a Br. So perhaps the product is propene again, but perhaps a different isomer.

Wait, wait no: the initial structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when the base removes a H from CH2Br, the adjacent Br on CHBr would leave, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. That would give CH2=CH-CH2Br? Wait, but that's not possible because we have two Brs. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the actual reaction would remove both Brs, eliminating two molecules of HBr. So in 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr would form either 1-propene or 2-propene (which is the same as 1-propene because propene is CH2=CHCH3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-butadiene? No, because the starting molecule is propane, so elimination would lead to a double bond, but in this case, since it's a dibromide, two eliminations would occur.

Wait no, perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons, so when two eliminations happen, the result is a double bond between C1 and C2, and another double bond? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-propene. Because you eliminate two HBr, so the three carbons are connected by a double bond, CH2=CHCH3. But wait, that's the same as the original propene. Wait, but wait, the initial compound was propene, then brominated to 1,2-dibromide, then elimination gives back propene. So compound C would be propene again. But wait, that doesn't make sense because in the next step, when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it might undergo some sort of reaction.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When 1,2-dibromopropane is treated with alcoholic KOH, the base will deprotonate and cause elimination. Each elimination removes HBr. So for each Br, an H is abstracted from the adjacent carbon, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond.

Wait, but in the case of 1,2-dibromide, eliminating one HBr would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would leave another Br on C2. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe the product is 1-bromo-1-propene? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide eliminating two HBr to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction: 1,2-dibromide → when treated with alcoholic KOH, forms 1-propene.

So compound C is propene.

Wait, but wait, then what happens next. Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, which is a common setup for dehydrohalogenation or possibly for breaking double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction.

Wait, no: propene (CH2=CHCH3) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. That's a condition for dehydrogenation perhaps, forming something else. Wait, but propene is already an alkene. Wait, another possibility is that it's a catalytic dehydrogenation to form something else. Alternatively, maybe the iron is a catalyst for some other kind of reaction, like hydrogenation, but that would add hydrogen, which doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, but another thought: when propene is passed over a hot iron, maybe it undergoes a reaction to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the hot iron is a catalyst for dehydrogenation, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a condition for a different reaction, like forming a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake earlier. Let me check the first steps again.

Wait, perhaps when 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3) reacts with alcoholic KOH, it doesn't eliminate twice but perhaps forms a different product. Wait, maybe it forms 1-bromopropene? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a free radical substitution, but in the presence of alcoholic KOH, which is a deprotonating agent, I think elimination is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is 1-bromopropene. Let me think: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2Br. But wait, that's a possibility after elimination of one HBr. So if only one HBr is eliminated, we get CH2=CHCH2Br. But why would that happen? Because the other Br is on the adjacent carbon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: 1,2-dibromide → when treated with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice. Each elimination removes HBr, and the result is the formation of an alkene between the two middle carbons. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So upon eliminating two HBr molecules, we would get CH2=CHCH3, which is propene. So that would be the same as compound A. But I'm not sure; perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but in that case, compound C is propene again, so the next step is to pass it through a red-hot iron tube. Let's think about that reaction. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. I remember that when alkenes are passed over red-hot iron, they can undergo dehydrogenation to form alkenes. Wait, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydrogenation, but that would require adding hydrogen, which I don't think is happening here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is different. Oh! Wait, another possibility: when alkenes are treated with hot iron in the presence of water, they can undergo hydroxylation, but that's more like the oxymercuration reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing some kind of isomerization. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reaction wrong. Let me think again: propene (CH2=CHCH3) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't make sense because there's no halide left. Alternatively, perhaps the setup is for a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: if the reaction is with a red-hot iron, perhaps it's a hydrogenation catalyst. But propene is already an alkene, so hydrogenation would add hydrogen and make propane, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is a catalyst for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the propene is undergoing some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck here. Let's move forward and see if that helps. The next step is that compound D is formed. Then, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Then, compound E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Then F reacts with nitrous acid to form G, and G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Wait, perhaps I should try to figure out each step.

But let's get back to the beginning. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.

Compound A is C3H6: that's propene, correct. Then, bromination in CCl4: Br2 adds across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3), which is compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so it's likely an elimination reaction. So we have 1,2-dibromide reacting, which would eliminate two HBr molecules. The product would be propene again, but perhaps in a different position, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, and that's the same structure as before. So compound C is propene.

Then, compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, I think I remember that when propene is passed over a hot iron, it can form something else. Oh wait! Wait a second. When alkenes are treated with hot iron, especially in the presence of water, they can undergo hydration to form alcohols. But I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's more like the oxymercuration reaction, which uses a mercury catalyst and water.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is a catalyst for a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but there's no halide present.

Wait, another possibility: when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it forms benzene. Wait, no, that's not possible because you need more carbon atoms. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming something else, but I'm stuck. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about what compound C is.

Wait, wait. Let me think again: Could compound C be something else? If in step 2, instead of getting propene, I get 1-bromopropene (CH2=CHCH2Br), then what happens in step 3?

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different product. Let me think about the structure of B: CH2BrCHBrCH3. When KOH (alcohol) is added, perhaps the base abstracts a β-H from the first Br (on C1), leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. Then, the adjacent Br on C2 would be eliminated as well, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2 and another Br on C3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-bromopropene, with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a Br on C3.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it step by step. Let's see:

Structure of B: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

When KOH attacks, it abstracts a β-H. So, for the Br on C1, the adjacent β-H is on C2. So the base abstracts a H from C2, and the Br on C1 leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure becomes CH2=CH-CH2Br (1-bromopropene). But wait, that's only eliminating one HBr. But the molecule has two Brs, so perhaps another elimination happens.

Wait, but after the first elimination, the structure is CH2=CHCH2Br. Now, can another elimination happen? Because now we have a Br on C3. The adjacent β-H would be on C2, which is already part of the double bond. So perhaps the second elimination is not possible, or perhaps it leads to a different structure.

Wait, but perhaps the initial reaction from B leads to a different product. Maybe it's a 1,3-diene? No, because the starting material is propane.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromide eliminating to form 1,2-dibromide again. No, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the product from step 2 is 1-bromopropene (CH2=CHCH2Br), and then in step 3, when passed through a red-hot iron, it loses HBr, forming something else. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the product from step 2 is 2-bromopropene. Let me think again: the dibromide is CH2BrCHBrCH3. If the base abstracts a H from the C3 (the third carbon), which is adjacent to the Br on C2, then elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2Br-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, elimination would form CH2=CH2 (ethene) but that's not possible with this structure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think again. The reaction of 1,2-dibromide with alcoholic KOH likely leads to the formation of 1,2-dibromide → propene via two elimination steps, resulting in the formation of propene again. So compound C is propene.

Then, when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it undergoes some kind of hydrogenation or dehydrogenation. Wait, but propene is an alkene, so if hydrogen is added, it would become propane. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation to form something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to form something like cyclopropane? But I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: when propene is passed through a red-hot iron in the presence of steam, it might undergo hydration to form propan-2-ol. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is a catalyst for some kind of oxidation or reduction.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward and see what the subsequent steps are. Let's say compound D is something else, perhaps propene after some reaction becomes something else.

But let me think about each step again. So far:

A: C3H6 → propene.

B: bromination → 1,2-dibromide.

C: elimination → propene.

D: propene → something after red-hot iron.

Assuming D is propene, then when it's treated with two strong acids, perhaps concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid. Wait, that's a mixture for nitrating an alkene. But propene is an alkene, and nitrating it would add a nitro group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when propene is treated with concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3, it undergoes nitration to form nitropropane. So compound E would be nitropropane (CH2=CHCH2NO2), but wait, I'm not sure about the position. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different product.

Wait, but if D is propene, then E would be nitropropane, perhaps. Then, compound E is treated with iron and HCl. Wait, Fe and HCl. I'm not sure, but perhaps it's a reduction reaction. Nitro groups are reduced in the presence of Fe and HCl to form amines. So if E is nitropropane, then F would be propane-1-amine (CH2=CHCH2NH2).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is in a different position.

Then, compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines to form diazonium salts, which can decompose. So if F is an amine, G would be the corresponding diazonium chloride.

Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids or phenols, depending on the structure. If F is an amine derived from propane, then hydrolysis would form a carboxylic acid. So H would be propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH) but wait, I'm not sure about the structure.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about each product and the options given.

The options are about the correctness of statements about the products.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Well, if F is an amine, amines are often used in dye synthesis. So A could be correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. If H is a carboxylic acid, then adding ferric chloride would not give a color. But if H is a phenol, which can form a complex with FeCl3, then it would turn yellow. Hmm, but earlier steps don't suggest phenol formation. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propene, then its NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3. So that wouldn't give two singlets. Alternatively, if D is a different compound, maybe a di-substituted alkene, which would have different peaks.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is propene, which is a gas at standard conditions, and flammable, then D would be correct.

Wait, but let me go back. I think I made a mistake in step 3. Let me re-examine that.

Step 3: Compound C is propene (from step 2), which is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, perhaps the correct reaction here is the dehydrogenation of propene to form another compound. Wait, but propene has three carbons and one double bond. Dehydrogenation would require removing H to form another double bond, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrogenation that adds H to form propane.

Wait, if that's the case, then D would be propane. Then, when propane is treated with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3), perhaps it undergoes sulfonation or nitration. But alkanes are generally resistant to such reactions unless under very high pressure. Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, but that would make E something else.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about compound C. Let me think again. If compound C is propene, and then it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a condition for forming carbon dioxide or some other product. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step 2. Maybe the product of step 2 is not propene, but something else.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that compound B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When treated with alcoholic KOH, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form 1-bromopropene (CH2=CHCH2Br). Then, in step 3, this compound is passed through a red-hot iron, which might cause further elimination. So CH2=CHCH2Br could eliminate HBr to form CH2=CHCH2, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form another double bond.

Wait, but wait, CH2=CHCH2Br could eliminate HBr, forming something else. If the Br is on C3, then eliminating H from C2 would form a double bond between C2 and C3, but that would lead to CH2=CH2, which is ethene. But that would require losing the Br and an H from C2.

So, CH2=CHCH2Br → (eliminate HBr) → CH2=CH2 + HBr.

Wait, that would make D ethene (ethene is C2H4, a gas). Then, D is ethene.

Then, ethene (C2H4) is treated with two strong acids. Hmmm, what reaction occurs when ethene is treated with concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3?

Well, that's the nitrating mixture. Ethene can undergo nitration to form ethene's nitro derivative. The reaction would add a nitro group across the double bond, forming 1-nitroethylene? Or perhaps 1,2-dinitroethylene if two nitro groups are added.

Wait, but the product would be an di-substituted nitro compound. Let's say E is 1-nitroethylene (CH2NO2-CH2), but more accurately, it would be CH2=CHNO2, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs at one end, leading to CH2CH2NO2, but I'm not certain.

Then, E is treated with iron and HCl. Iron and HCl are typically used for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So if E is CH2=CHNO2, then F would be CH2=CHNH2.

Then, F (CH2=CHNH2) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts. So G would be the diazonium chloride, CH2=CHN2Cl.

Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids or phenol derivatives, depending on the substitution. Since CH2=CHN2Cl is a primary diazonium salt, hydrolysis would form CH2=COOH (propenoic acid?), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. CH2=CHNH2 → CH2=CHN2Cl → upon hydrolysis with NaOH, it would form CH2=COOH (propanoic acid? No, wait, CH2=CH2COOH would be something else. Wait, perhaps CH2=CH2COOH is not correct. Alternatively, it would form CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid), but that's C3H4O2.

But now, let's look at the options.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is CH2=CHNH2, which is a primary amine. Amines are used in dye synthesis, so A is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid). Propenoic acid is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids don't react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. Phenols do, because FeCl3 is a catalyst for the formation of the phenolic complex. So if H were a phenol, B would be correct. But in our case, H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't form a yellow color with FeCl3. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is ethene (C2H4), which is a gas. The structure is CH2=CH2. The NMR would show a quartet for each set of protons because each CH2 group is adjacent to the other. Wait, no, in ethene, each CH2 is a triplet, but wait, no, ethene has two equivalent CH2 groups, each with two protons. Actually, in ethene, each CH2 group is a quartet because each proton is adjacent to two protons on the adjacent CH2. Wait, no, ethene is a planar molecule with each CH2 group having two protons. Each set is a quartet because each H is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Wait, but in reality, in ethene, the two CH2 groups are equivalent, so the NMR would show a single quartet integrating to 4H. So the statement in option C says D gives two singlets. That doesn't match because D is ethene, which would have one quartet. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), which is a gas at standard conditions and is flammable. So option D is correct.

Now, the question is to find the incorrect statement. So if option B and option C are incorrect, but the question says which statement is incorrect about the products.

Wait, but let me re-examine the steps. If D is ethene, its NMR would show a quartet, but the option says two singlets, so option C is incorrect.

Now, looking back, I think I made a mistake in the initial steps, particularly in step 3. If in step 3, propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube and forms ethene, then D is ethene. But how?

Wait, another possibility: when propene (CH2=CHCH3) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it undergoes dehydrogenation to form acetylene (C2H2). But that doesn't fit with the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation again, but without any halide present, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but propene is already dehydrated. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that D is ethene, then move forward.

So, looking at the options:

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3 to give color. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: D (ethene) in NMR gives two singlets. Ethene's NMR has each set of H as a quartet, so option C is incorrect.

So, the incorrect statements are B and C. But the question asks for the incorrect statement about the products, so which option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the steps. Let me re-examine.

If I'm correct that D is ethene, then:

Option C says D gives two singlets. Ethene has a quartet, so option C is incorrect.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, so B is incorrect.

So the options have two incorrect statements, but the question is asking which option is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps my understanding is wrong. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in step 3, propene is converted into something else. Let me think again.

If step 3 is forming something else, perhaps propene is passed through a red-hot iron, which could cause a hydrogenation to form propane. So D is propane.

Then, D (propane) reacts with two strong acids. Propane is an alkane, and nitrating it would require high pressure, but perhaps the reaction isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, but reacting with propane would not yield a nitro compound. So maybe this scenario is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, then E is something else. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I'm spending, perhaps I should make a decision based on the information I have.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is an amine; possible.

B) H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid; no, so B is incorrect.

C) D gives two singlets. If D is ethene, which gives a quartet, so C is incorrect.

D) C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable; correct.

So the question is to find the incorrect statement. The options are A, B, C, D. So options B and C are incorrect statements. But the question says which is incorrect about the products.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in step 2. Let me think again.

If step 2: 1,2-dibromide → elimination to form 1-bromopropene (CH2=CHCH2Br). Then, step 3: passing through red-hot iron, perhaps elimination of HBr occurs, forming CH2=CHCH2Br → CH2=CHCH2 + HBr. But that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form CH2=CH2 (ethene).

So, in that case, D is ethene.

Thus, the statement in option C is D gives two singlets. D is ethene, which has a quartet in NMR, so statement C is incorrect.

The statement in option B is H gives a yellow color. H is the product after G (diazonium salt) reacts with NaOH. If G is the diazonium salt of CH2=CHNH2, then upon hydrolysis, it forms CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid). Propionic acid is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3. So option B is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about the incorrect statement. So both B and C could be incorrect. But the options are given as four options, and the question states that one is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about H's structure. Let me think again. If F is CH2=CHCH2NH2, then upon reaction with nitrous acid, it forms the corresponding diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis with NaOH would form CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid). Which is a carboxylic acid. So H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3, so option B is incorrect.

So the incorrect statements are B and C.

But the options are only four, and the question says to choose the incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining what D is. Let me think: If D is propane, then its NMR would show a triplet for each CH3 group, but that's a singlet overall. So option C says D gives two singlets. If D is propane, then its NMR would be a singlet (all nine H are equivalent in CH3CH2CH3), so two singlets would mean something else. So perhaps D isn't propane.

Alternatively, if D is something else, like 1,2-dibromide, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck and should just proceed to the conclusion.

The incorrect statement is either B or C.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR.

If D is ethene, then its structure is CH2=CH2. The two CH2 groups are equivalent, so each H would be a quartet, but the overall NMR would show a single quartet integrating to four H. So two singlets would not be the case. So option C is incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3, so option B is incorrect.

So both B and C are incorrect. But the question asks for the incorrect statement. Since only one option is correct, perhaps the intended answer is option B.

Wait, but let me look at the possible answers again. The question is to find the incorrect statement.

If the product H is a phenol, then option B would be correct. But in our case, H is a carboxylic acid, so option B is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step where H is formed. If F is an aromatic amine, then upon hydrolysis, H would be a phenol, which would react with FeCl3. But in our case, F is CH2=CHNH2, which is an aliphatic amine. So upon hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, it would form a carboxylic acid, not a phenol. So option B is incorrect.

So the incorrect statements are B and C. But since only one option is correct, I think the intended answer is option B.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C3H6), identified as propene. Bromination in carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to elimination of two HBr molecules, regenerating propene (Compound C). When propene (Compound C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form ethene (Compound D). 

Compound D (ethene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3), leading to nitration and the formation of 1-nitroethylene (Compound E). Reaction of E with iron and hydrochloric acid reduces the nitro group to an amine, forming allylamine (CH2=CHCH2NH2, Compound F). Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form the diazonium salt (Compound G), which upon reaction with NaOH hydrolyzes to propenoic acid (CH2=CHCOOH, Compound H).

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.  
   F is allylamine (CH2=CHCH2NH2), which is indeed used in dye synthesis. This statement is correct.

2. **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution.  
   H is propenoic acid (CH2=CHCOOH), a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids do not react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. Phenols, not carboxylic acids, form a yellow complex with FeCl3. This statement is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.  
   D is ethene (CH2=CH2). In its 1H NMR spectrum, the two equivalent CH2 groups produce a single quartet, not two singlets. This statement is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: C is a flammable gas.  
   C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), which is a flammable gas at standard conditions. This statement is correct.

### Conclusion:
Both options B and C are incorrect, but the question asks for the single incorrect statement. Since option B explicitly contradicts the chemical properties of Compound H, it is the best choice for the incorrect statement.

**Answer: B**
