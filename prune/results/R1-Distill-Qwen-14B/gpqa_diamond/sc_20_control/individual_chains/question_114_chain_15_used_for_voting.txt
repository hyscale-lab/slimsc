Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem has two reactions. The first one is: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

We're supposed to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step. First, I'll look at the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? It's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. So, when a ketone reacts with CN-, what usually happens? Oh, right, nucleophilic addition. The ketone has a carbonyl group, which can undergo nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but wait. Oh, right! The reaction of ketones with HCN (or its sodium salt, NaCN) usually gives cyanohydrins. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the OH and CN are added to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would have both groups attached. That's exactly what we see here: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That structure has both an OH and a CN group on the same carbon (the second carbon).

But how does the reaction proceed? The NaCN provides the CN- nucleophile. But wait, in aqueous solution, maybe it's under acidic or basic conditions? Oh, right! The formation of cyanohydrins typically occurs in acidic conditions. Because the carbonyl oxygen in ketones is deprotonated in basic conditions, making the carbonyl less electrophilic. So to make the carbonyl more reactive towards nucleophilic attack, you need an acid catalyst. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

So in the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (which is option A or B's A). That makes sense.

Now, looking at the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a molecule with a nitrile group (CN) attached to the same carbon as an OH group, and another substituent, 4-benzylphenyl. So the structure is something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CN ?

Wait, maybe the exact structure isn't crucial here. The key is that the molecule has both a CN and an OH group on the same carbon. The product is the corresponding acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the CN group is converted into a COOH group.

So, nitrile to carboxylic acid. How does that happen? Well, one common way to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids is through hydrolysis. But under what conditions?

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think. Under acidic conditions, with something like HCl (HCl is a strong acid), the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, it might form a carboxylate, which would then be acidified.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent B is mentioned, along with H2O. So the reaction is with B and H2O. So what reagent B would make the nitrile turn into a carboxylic acid?

In the presence of water and acid, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, with a strong acid like HCl, perhaps.

Wait, let's recall the hydrolysis of nitriles. The general reaction is RCN + H2O → RCOOH under acidic or basic conditions. But if the solution is strongly acidic, perhaps with HCl, then the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe it's a hydrolysis using H2SO4 and heat, but in this case, the options don't include sulfuric acid but do include HCl and acetic acid.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl
Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, for the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and we're turning the nitrile into a carboxylic acid. Let me think about the hydrolysis conditions.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done using:

1. Acidic hydrolysis: using concentrated HCl, heat. RCN + H2O (with HCl) → RCOOH.

2. Basic hydrolysis: using NaOH, then acidifying. RCOO^-Na^+ + HCl → RCOOH.

But in the second reaction, the reagent B is added along with H2O. So, what reagent B would facilitate the conversion of CN to COOH.

If B is HCl, then it's acidic. So in acidic conditions, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the acid. That makes sense. Alternatively, if B is acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is a weak acid, maybe that's enough, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the typical conditions.

Wait, another factor: in the presence of an -OH group. So the molecule has both an -OH and a -CN on the same carbon. So when you add H2O and an acid, like HCl, would that promote the hydrolysis of the nitrile?

Alternatively, maybe sulfuric acid is used, but it's not in the options.

Another approach: The first step's reagent A is H3O+ or NaHSO3. Let's think about that.

Wait, for the first reaction, are there any other possibilities? Could A be NaHSO3?

Wait, but NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Hmm. Wait, but the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Typically, that's done under acidic conditions. So H3O+ (like H2SO4 or HCl) is the usual catalyst.

So the first reaction's A is H3O+, so looking at the options, A is either option A or B.

But looking at the second reaction, if reagent B is HCl (option A or C), then that would fit the scenario of acidic hydrolysis of nitrile to acid.

Wait, but let's think: the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile (-CN) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So in the presence of H2O and HCl, that's the correct condition.

Alternatively, what if reagent B is CH3COOH? Acetic acid is a weak acid. Would that be enough for nitrile hydrolysis? I think nitrile hydrolysis under weak acid might not proceed as effectively. Usually, you need a strong acid or a strong base for the hydrolysis. So HCl is more likely.

So putting it together:

First reaction: A is H3O+ (acid catalyst), so options A or B.

Second reaction: B is HCl (acid catalyst), so options A or C.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option A: A= H3O+, B= HCl → both seem correct.

Option C: A= NaHSO3, B= HCl → but first reaction would require acid, so H3O+ is more likely.

Wait, but wait another thing. When forming a cyanohydrin, sometimes the reaction is done in the presence of HCN and a catalyst. Wait, but given that NaCN is present, perhaps the reaction is done in a solution where CN- is generated, perhaps with an acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen.

Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. But in an aqueous solution, NaCN would be in solution, but would the solution be acidic or basic? Well, if you're using just NaCN and water, it would be basic because NaCN is a salt of a weak acid (HCN is weak), so it would hydrolyze in water to produce OH-.

But in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So A is the catalyst. If A is H3O+, it's adding acid to make the solution acidic, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So that's correct.

So now, the first reaction requires H3O+ as reagent A, so options A or B.

The second reaction requires HCl as reagent B, so options A or C.

Looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that would fit.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let's make sure.

Option C has A=NaHSO3 (which is sodium bisulfate, a source of H+ and SO3^2-), but in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin. I don't think sodium bisulfate is used for that. It's more commonly used for other reactions, like maybe the reduction of ketones or in the workup of certain reactions.

Wait, NaHSO3 is often used in the hydroboration reaction or in the oxidation of alcohols, perhaps? Or in the workup where bisulfate provides H+ and sulfate ions. But for the cyanohydrin formation, I think it's acid (like H3O+) that's used. So I think option A is correct.

So the reagents would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

The problem involves two reactions. In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the carbonyl group of the ketone reacts with CN- to form a cyanohydrin. Such reactions typically require acidic conditions to make the carbonyl group more electrophilic. Therefore, reagent A is likely H3O+, which provides the necessary acidic environment.

In the second reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions, such as with HCl, is a common method to achieve this transformation. Thus, reagent B is likely HCl.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H3O+, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH. While H3O+ is correct for the first reaction, CH3COOH (a weak acid) is less suitable for nitrile hydrolysis compared to HCl.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl. NaHSO3 is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation, which requires acidic conditions but not necessarily bisulfate ions.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH. Neither reagent is appropriate for the reactions described.

The most suitable reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which corresponds to **Option A**.
