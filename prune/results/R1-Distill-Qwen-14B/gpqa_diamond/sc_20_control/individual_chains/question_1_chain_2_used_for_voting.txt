Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. The question is about two energy levels and their distinguishability based on their lifetimes. Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state relates to its energy uncertainty. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. 

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

In this problem, the lifetimes (Δt) are given as 10^-9 seconds for E1 and 10^-8 seconds for E2. Wait, no, actually, I think the lifetimes are the timescales over which the states exist, so they relate to Δt. So for each state, Δt is their lifetime. But since we're looking to distinguish the two energy levels, perhaps we need to consider the energy difference between them and whether that's detectable given their lifetimes.

Wait, the question is about the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2. How does the time relate to the energy uncertainty? Oh, right, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is approximately ħ/(Δt). So for each state, the uncertainty is ħ divided by their lifetime.

Wait, but wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So, each has their own energy uncertainty. But since we're trying to distinguish the two states, their energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe just each's uncertainty?

Wait, let me think. If the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the uncertainty in each, then we could distinguish them. So the required condition is ΔE > ħ/(Δt1) + ħ/(Δt2) or something like that. Or maybe it's each uncertainty? I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to structure this.

Each state has a certain uncertainty in energy. So for the first state, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(Δt1) = ħ/(1e-9 s). The second state has ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(1e-8 s). Since Δt2 is larger than Δt1, ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1.

Wait, but when we're looking at the energy difference between E1 and E2, that should be ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To distinguish between these two states, this ΔE must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. 

Wait, no, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy—so if ΔE is much larger than the uncertainty, it's resolvable. Let me think: if the energy levels are very close, the transitions might not be distinguishable due to the uncertainty. So the condition for clear distinguishability is that the energy difference ΔE is larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both states. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than each individual uncertainty. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: for a state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt). So for the two states, their ΔE1 and ΔE2 would be ħ/(1e-9) and ħ/(1e-8) respectively. Let me compute these.

Assuming ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So, for the first state, ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV. For the second state, ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainty for the first state is about 6.58e-7 eV, and for the second, 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger uncertainty? Because if the energy difference is larger than either uncertainty, it'll be resolvable.

Wait, let's think about it. If the energy difference is much larger than either uncertainty, then when you measure, you'll see a clear separation between the two levels. If it's smaller than the uncertainties, the measurements could overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if it's larger than both, then it's well-separated.

So, which uncertainty is larger? ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2, as 6.58e-7 eV is bigger than 6.58e-8 eV.

So, ΔE must be greater than 6.58e-7 eV to be distinguishable. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 6.58e-7, so no.

Option B:1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C:1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is way bigger than 6.58e-7 (which is 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658). So 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is bigger. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is larger than the larger uncertainty (6.58e-7), so it would be resolvable.

Option D:1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 6.58e-7 (0.000000658). So it's not enough.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculation of the uncertainties.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-16 eV·s. So for Δt1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / Δt1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV. Yes, that's correct.

Δt2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV. Correct.

So the maximum uncertainty is 6.58e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than this to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. So that's the only option that's bigger than the maximum uncertainty. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine whether two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) can be clearly distinguished, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)). For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

The lifetimes (time uncertainties) of the two states are given as \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Calculating the uncertainties for each state:

1. For the first state (\( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For the second state (\( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) (\( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \)) must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, which is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it is not sufficient to distinguish the two states.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it is not sufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it satisfies the condition for distinguishability.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it is not sufficient.

Thus, the only option that ensures the energy difference is large enough to distinguish the two states is **Option C**.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. The question is about two energy levels and their distinguishability based on their lifetimes.

Wait, but wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So, each has their own energy uncertainty. But since we're trying to distinguish the two states, their energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe just each's uncertainty?

Wait, let me think. If the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the uncertainty in each, then we could distinguish them. So the required condition is ΔE > ħ/(Δt1) + ħ/(Δt2) or something like that. Or maybe it's each uncertainty? I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to structure this.

Assuming ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So, for the first state, ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV. For the second state, ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainty for the first state is about 6.58e-7 eV, and for the second, 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger uncertainty? Because if the energy difference is larger than either uncertainty, it'll be resolvable.

Wait, let's think about it. If the energy difference is much larger than either uncertainty, then when you measure, you'll see a clear separation between the two levels. If it's smaller than the uncertainties, the measurements could overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if it's larger than both, then it's well-separated.

So, which uncertainty is larger? ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2, as 6.58e-7 eV is bigger than 6.58e-8 eV.

So, ΔE must be greater than 6.58e-7 eV to be distinguishable. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 6.58e-7, so no.

Option B:1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C:1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is way bigger than 6.58e-7 (which is 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658). So 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is bigger. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is larger than the larger uncertainty (6.58e-7), so it would be resolvable.

Option D:1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 6.58e-7 (0.000000658). So it's not enough.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculation of the uncertainties.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-16 eV·s. So for Δt1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / Δt1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV. Yes, that's correct.

Δt2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV. Correct.

So the maximum uncertainty is 6.58e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than this to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. So that's the only option that's bigger than the maximum uncertainty. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine whether two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) can be clearly distinguished, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)). For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

The lifetimes (time uncertainties) of the two states are given as \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Calculating the uncertainties for each state:

1. For the first state (\( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For the second state (\( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) (\( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \)) must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, which is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it is not sufficient to distinguish the two states.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it is not sufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it satisfies the condition for distinguishability.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it is not sufficient.

Thus, the only option that ensures the energy difference is large enough to distinguish the two states is **Option C**.
