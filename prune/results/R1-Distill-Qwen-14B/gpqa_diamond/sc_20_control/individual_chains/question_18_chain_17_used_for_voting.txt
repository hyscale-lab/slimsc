Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. The given data includes some abundance ratios: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex.

Wait, I remember that the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, more precisely, it's log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun, which is the same as log10(nX/nY / (nX_sun / nY_sun))).

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So I can find the solar ratios of Fe/H and Mg/H.

Wait, let's compute that first. For the Sun, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12? No, wait the formula is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5.

So solar Fe/H is 10^(-4.5) and Mg/H is 10^(-5). Or wait, actually, when you have [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun. So in the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun is 0, which makes sense. Similarly for [Mg/H].

Wait, looking at the data given: for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex. That means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So Star_1 has solar Fe/H. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 =0, so Mg/H is solar in Star_2.

The question is about [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] in the stars. We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, wait. The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So n_Si1 / n_Si2. Or is it the ratio of the abundance? Because [X/Y] is about number densities.

But let's think step by step.

First, let's get the [X/Y] values for each star.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. That means log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, n_Fe1 / n_H1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) =0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But how does this tie into the [Mg/Si]_2 value?

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(n_Mg2 / n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0.3.

Hmm. So for Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. Let's compute n_Mg2 / n_Si2 relative to the solar ratio.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) * 10^(0.3).

But wait, because [Mg/Si] = log (n_Mg/n_Si) - log (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) = log ( (n_Mg/n_Si) / (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) ) ) = log ( (n_Mg2 / n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) )) =0.3. So (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, but Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

So, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Similarly, n_Si2 can be found using [Mg/Si]_2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find each abundance in terms of solar.

Let me try to express all the abundances in terms of Solar.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe abundance same as Sun.

n_Fe1 /n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

So, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Since n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

Wait, but n_H is different in the star? Or are we assuming that the hydrogen is the same as the Sun's? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express all elements in terms of hydrogen.

Let me think about the Sun first.

In the Sun:

n_Fe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * n_H_sun.

Because log(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) = -4.5 → n_Fe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * n_H_sun.

Similarly, n_Mg_sun =10^(-5) *n_H_sun.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 /n_H_sun) → because [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe /n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) ) =0 → n_Fe/n_H = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun → n_Fe = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H.

So, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun)*n_H1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

Let me compute log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun). Since n_Si_sun = x, n_Fe_sun = y.

n_Si_sun = ?? Wait, I don't know the solar Si abundance. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, the initial data only gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the Sun. So I can't get n_Si_sun from that. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I can find it via other relations.

Wait, the question gives data for [Mg/Si]_2. So perhaps I can find the Solar [Mg/Si], and from that get the Si abundance.

Wait, from the Sun's data: n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun.

n_Si_sun is not given. So perhaps I need to express the ratio in terms of other elements.

Wait, maybe I can use the [Mg/Si]_2 to get the Si abundance in Star_2, and then relate it to Star_1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of the Sun's elements.

But the problem is that I don't have the solar [Mg/Si], so I can't directly compute that.

Wait, let me see: [Mg/Si]_sun is log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) - 0 (since it's solar, so [Mg/Si]_sun=0). So [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun)=0 → n_Mg_sun =n_Si_sun. So [Mg/Si]_sun=0 implies equal Mg and Si in the Sun.

Wait, no. Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun would be 0 if their abundances are the same as in the Sun. But the problem says [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3 above the Sun's.

Wait, but for the Sun's [Mg/Si], since the problem doesn't give it, perhaps I can compute it based on the given data.

Wait, in the Sun, n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun. And 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg = 1e-5 nH.

Similarly, for Si, I don't have its [Si/H]. Hmm. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/H], so perhaps I can't find n_Si_sun directly. So maybe I have to express the ratios in terms of each other.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 =0. So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

So, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

So n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) +0.3.

So n_Mg2 =n_Si2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) *10^0.3.

But n_Mg2 is also equal to (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2.

So, (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 =n_Si2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) *10^0.3.

Solve for n_Si2:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 / ( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) *10^0.3 )

Simplify:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 / 10^0.3.

So now, for both stars, we have expressions for n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of their hydrogen.

Wait, but I need the ratio n_Si1 /n_Si2.

So, let's compute that.

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^0.3.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 /10^0.3.

So, ratio (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 /10^0.3 ]

Simplify: the (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) cancels out.

= [n_H1 *10^0.3 ] / [n_H2 /10^0.3 ]

= [n_H1 * (10^0.3)^2 ] / n_H2.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_H1 /n_H2 ) * (10^0.3 )^2.

Now, what's n_H1 and n_H2?

Wait, the photospheric composition is about the abundances, but I don't think we have any information about the overall hydrogen content in the stars. Unless we can assume that the stars have the same H abundance as the Sun? But I don't think that's given.

Wait, wait, in the problem statement, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given, and for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, which means Fe is solar abundance relative to H. So it's possible that the H content is not necessarily the same as the Sun's, but their ratio is the same.

Wait, actually, in terms of number density, [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun) = [X/H].

So for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But n_H1 and n_H2 are just the hydrogen number densities in each star, which we don't have any info about. So how can we proceed?

Wait, maybe the ratio of H in each star (n_H1 and n_H2) can be found via the masses of the stars, but I don't see a direct connection. The star's mass doesn't directly give the composition of the photosphere. Unless we're considering the overall abundance, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another thought. Because we're looking for the ratio of Si in the photospheres, which is n_Si1/n_Si2, but since [X/H] is a logarithmic abundance, perhaps the ratio can be expressed in terms of the star's [Si/H] relative to each other.

But wait, we can't directly compute [Si/H] for each star because we don't know the solar [Si/H].

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3. Since [Fe/H]=0, meaning Fe is at solar abundance.

So, [Si/Fe] =0.3 → [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe] =0 + 0.3=0.3.

Because [X/H] is the logarithm of (X/H relative to solar), so [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe].

Because [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

So, yes, [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe] =0 +0.3=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

But to find [Si/H]_2, perhaps I can find [Si/Mg]_2 first.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Si/Mg]_2= -0.3.

So, [Si/Mg]_2= [Si/H]_2 - [Mg/H]_2.

Because [Si/Mg]= [Si/H] - [Mg/H].

Given that [Mg/H]_2=0, this becomes:

-0.3 = [Si/H]_2 - 0 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, Star_1 has [Si/H]_1=0.3, Star_2 has [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, the ratio of their Si abundances is 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6}.

Which is approximately 3.98, which is around 4.

Wait, but wait. Are we talking about the same H? Because [X/H] is relative to each star's own H, so the ratio of Si in each star would be based on their own [Si/H].

Wait, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 is (10^{[Si/H]_1} * n_H1) / (10^{[Si/H]_2} * n_H2 ).

Because [Si/H] is log(n_Si/n_H) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

So n_Si = 10^{[Si/H]} * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H.

Wait, no. Let me think again. [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun).

So, n_X = (n_X_sun /n_H_sun) * 10^{[X/H]} * n_H.

So n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3} *n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * 10^{-0.3} *n_H2.

The ratio is (n_Si1)/(n_Si2) = [10^{0.3} *n_H1 ] / [10^{-0.3} *n_H2 ].

= (10^{0.6}) * (n_H1 /n_H2).

But I don't know the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2. So this is a problem.

Wait, but if the stars have the same mass, perhaps... But their masses are different. Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2. But mass doesn't directly translate to H abundance in the photosphere. Unless we're considering total mass, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Because if [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1, and [Mg/H] is 0 for Star_2, that implies that H is the same as the Sun's? Or does it?

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0: it means n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. So if n_Fe1 is the same as the Sun's, but what about n_H1?

Hmm, but without knowing the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2, we can't proceed. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, going back to the initial approach. For Star_1:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^{0.3}.

For Star_2:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 /10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_H1 /n_H2) *10^{0.6}.

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, we can't compute this.

Unless I can relate n_H1 and n_H2 via the star's parameters. But I don't see a direct way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into considering that the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are the same as the Sun, but in reality, the H abundance could vary.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2 is 1, meaning the same H density as the Sun. But that doesn't make sense, because [Fe/H] is 0, which for Star_1 would imply that Fe is the same as the Sun, but H could be different.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the metallicity. But [Fe/H] is 0, so metallicity is solar.

Wait, maybe the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2 is 1, but I can't confirm that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio of H is the same as the Sun's, so n_H1 = n_H2 =n_H_sun. But that's an assumption, and the problem doesn't state that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen, and since [Si/H] in Star_1 is +0.3 and Star_2 is -0.3, the ratio is 10^{0.3 +0.3} =10^0.6≈3.98.

But wait, that's the ratio if n_H1/n_H2=1. Which is n_H1 =n_H2. But I don't know that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think.

The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So it's n_Si1 /n_Si2.

But n_Si depends on [Si/H], which we've determined for each star. So:

n_Si1 =n_Si_sun *10^{0.3} (since [Si/H]_1=0.3).

n_Si2 =n_Si_sun *10^{-0.3} (since [Si/H]_2=-0.3).

So, n_Si1/n_Si2 =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But this is under the assumption that the hydrogen in both stars is the same as in the Sun. But wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe is the same as the Sun. But what about H? If the H in Star_1 is same as Sun, then [Fe/H] would be 0. But if H is lower, then [Fe/H] would be positive. Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(solar ratio).

So, if [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe/n_H = solar ratio. So in Star_1, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. So if n_H1 is lower than n_H_sun, then n_Fe1 would be lower than solar n_Fe, but in such a way that their ratio is solar.

Wait, but since the problem doesn't give any other information about the H abundance, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the H in each star and just compute the ratio based on [Si/H] values.

So, under that assumption, the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is approximately 4. So option A is ~3.9.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

So this would point to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken into account the mass of the stars. But I don't see how the mass affects the photospheric composition. The mass would influence their evolution, but not their elemental abundance ratios if we're assuming LTE and using the EW method correctly.

So I think the correct answer is A) ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: Silicon abundance relative to Fe is 0.3 dex above solar.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: Magnesium abundance relative to Si is 0.3 dex above solar.

3. **Solar Abundances**:
   - For the Sun, [Mg/Si] = 0 dex, meaning Mg and Si abundances are equal in the Sun.

### Step 1: Determine [Si/H] for Each Star
- **Star_1**:
  Using [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H], and since [Fe/H]_1 = 0:
  \[
  [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 \, \text{dex}.
  \]

- **Star_2**:
  Using [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], and since [Mg/H]_2 = 0:
  \[
  [Mg/Si]_2 = -[Si/H]_2 \implies [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 \, \text{dex}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The ratio of silicon abundances in Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Using \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately 3.9.

### Step 3: Verify Assumptions
The problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance in both stars is consistent with the Sun's hydrogen abundance. This allows us to directly use the [Si/H] values to compute the silicon abundance ratio. The masses of the stars (1.5 and 1.2 times solar) do not directly affect the photospheric composition in this context.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. The given data includes some abundance ratios: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex.

Wait, I remember that the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, more precisely, it's log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun, which is the same as log10(nX/nY / (nX_sun / nY_sun))).

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So I can find the solar ratios of Fe/H and Mg/H.

Wait, let's compute that first. For the Sun, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12? No, wait the formula is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5.

So solar Fe/H is 10^(-4.5) and Mg/H is 10^(-5). Or wait, actually, when you have [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun. So in the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun is 0, which makes sense. Similarly for [Mg/H].

Wait, looking at the data given: for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex. That means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So Star_1 has solar Fe/H. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 =0, so Mg/H is solar in Star_2.

The question is about [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] in the stars. We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, wait. The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So n_Si1 / n_Si2. Or is it the ratio of the abundance? Because [X/Y] is about number densities.

But let's think step by step.

First, let's get the [X/Y] values for each star.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. That means log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, n_Fe1 / n_H1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) =0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But how does this tie into the [Mg/Si]_2 value?

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(n_Mg2 / n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0.3.

Hmm. So for Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. Let's compute n_Mg2 / n_Si2 relative to the solar ratio.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) * 10^(0.3).

But wait, because [Mg/Si] = log (n_Mg/n_Si) - log (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) = log ( (n_Mg/n_Si) / (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) ) ) = log ( (n_Mg2 / n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) )) =0.3. So (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, but Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

So, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Similarly, n_Si2 can be found using [Mg/Si]_2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find each abundance in terms of solar.

Let me try to express all the abundances in terms of Solar.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe abundance same as Sun.

n_Fe1 /n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

So, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Since n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

Wait, but n_H is different in the star? Or are we assuming that the hydrogen is the same as the Sun's? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express all elements in terms of hydrogen.

Let me think about the Sun first.

In the Sun:

n_Fe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * n_H_sun.

Because log(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) = -4.5 → n_Fe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * n_H_sun.

Similarly, n_Mg_sun =10^(-5) *n_H_sun.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 /n_H_sun) → because [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe /n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) ) =0 → n_Fe/n_H = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun → n_Fe = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H.

So, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun)*n_H1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

Let me compute log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun). Since n_Si_sun = x, n_Fe_sun = y.

n_Si_sun = ?? Wait, I don't know the solar Si abundance. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, the initial data only gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the Sun. So I can't get n_Si_sun from that. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I can find it via other relations.

Wait, the question gives data for [Mg/Si]_2. So perhaps I can find the Solar [Mg/Si], and from that get the Si abundance.

Wait, from the Sun's data: n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun.

n_Si_sun is not given. So perhaps I need to express the ratio in terms of other elements.

Wait, maybe I can use the [Mg/Si]_2 to get the Si abundance in Star_2, and then relate it to Star_1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of the Sun's elements.

But the problem is that I don't have the solar [Mg/Si], so I can't directly compute that.

Wait, let me see: [Mg/Si]_sun is log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) - 0 (since it's solar, so [Mg/Si]_sun=0). So [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun)=0 → n_Mg_sun =n_Si_sun. So [Mg/Si]_sun=0 implies equal Mg and Si in the Sun.

Wait, no. Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun would be 0 if their abundances are the same as in the Sun. But the problem says [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3 above the Sun's.

Wait, but for the Sun's [Mg/Si], since the problem doesn't give it, perhaps I can compute it based on the given data.

Wait, in the Sun, n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun. And 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg = 1e-5 nH.

Similarly, for Si, I don't have its [Si/H]. Hmm. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/H], so perhaps I can't find n_Si_sun directly. So maybe I have to express the ratios in terms of each other.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 =0. So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

So, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

So n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) +0.3.

So n_Mg2 =n_Si2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) *10^0.3.

But n_Mg2 is also equal to (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2.

So, (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 =n_Si2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) *10^0.3.

Solve for n_Si2:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 / ( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) *10^0.3 )

Simplify:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 / 10^0.3.

So now, for both stars, we have expressions for n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of their hydrogen.

Wait, but I need the ratio n_Si1 /n_Si2.

So, let's compute that.

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^0.3.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 /10^0.3.

So, ratio (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 /10^0.3 ]

Simplify: the (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) cancels out.

= [n_H1 *10^0.3 ] / [n_H2 /10^0.3 ]

= [n_H1 * (10^0.3)^2 ] / n_H2.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_H1 /n_H2 ) * (10^0.3 )^2.

Now, what's n_H1 and n_H2?

Wait, the photospheric composition is about the abundances, but I don't think we have any information about the overall hydrogen content in the stars. Unless we can assume that the stars have the same H abundance as the Sun? But I don't think that's given.

Wait, wait, in the problem statement, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given, and for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, which means Fe is solar abundance relative to H. So it's possible that the H content is not necessarily the same as the Sun's, but their ratio is the same.

Wait, actually, in terms of number density, [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun) = [X/H].

So for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But n_H1 and n_H2 are just the hydrogen number densities in each star, which we don't have any info about. So how can we proceed?

Wait, maybe the ratio of H in each star (n_H1 and n_H2) can be found via the masses of the stars, but I don't see a direct connection. The star's mass doesn't directly give the composition of the photosphere. Unless we're considering the overall abundance, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another thought. Because we're looking for the ratio of Si in the photospheres, which is n_Si1/n_Si2, but since [X/H] is a logarithmic abundance, perhaps the ratio can be expressed in terms of the star's [Si/H] relative to each other.

But wait, we can't directly compute [Si/H] for each star because we don't know the solar [Si/H].

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3. Since [Fe/H]=0, meaning Fe is at solar abundance.

So, [Si/Fe] =0.3 → [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe] =0 + 0.3=0.3.

Because [X/H] is the logarithm of (X/H relative to solar), so [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe].

Because [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

So, yes, [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe] =0 +0.3=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

But to find [Si/H]_2, perhaps I can find [Si/Mg]_2 first.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Si/Mg]_2= -0.3.

So, [Si/Mg]_2= [Si/H]_2 - [Mg/H]_2.

Because [Si/Mg]= [Si/H] - [Mg/H].

Given that [Mg/H]_2=0, this becomes:

-0.3 = [Si/H]_2 - 0 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, Star_1 has [Si/H]_1=0.3, Star_2 has [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, the ratio of their Si abundances is 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6}.

Which is approximately 3.98, which is around 4.

Wait, but wait. Are we talking about the same H? Because [X/H] is relative to each star's own H, so the ratio of Si in each star would be based on their own [Si/H].

Wait, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 is (10^{[Si/H]_1} * n_H1) / (10^{[Si/H]_2} * n_H2 ).

Because [Si/H] is log(n_Si/n_H) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

So n_Si = 10^{[Si/H]} * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H.

Wait, no. Let me think again. [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun).

So, n_X = (n_X_sun /n_H_sun) * 10^{[X/H]} * n_H.

So n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3} *n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * 10^{-0.3} *n_H2.

The ratio is (n_Si1)/(n_Si2) = [10^{0.3} *n_H1 ] / [10^{-0.3} *n_H2 ].

= (10^{0.6}) * (n_H1 /n_H2).

But I don't know the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2. So this is a problem.

Wait, but if the stars have the same mass, perhaps... But their masses are different. Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2. But mass doesn't directly translate to H abundance in the photosphere. Unless we're considering total mass, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Because if [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1, and [Mg/H] is 0 for Star_2, that implies that H is the same as the Sun's? Or does it?

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0: it means n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. So if n_Fe1 is the same as the Sun's, but what about n_H1?

Hmm, but without knowing the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2, we can't proceed. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, going back to the initial approach. For Star_1:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^{0.3}.

For Star_2:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 /10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_H1 /n_H2) *10^{0.6}.

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, we can't compute this.

Unless I can relate n_H1 and n_H2 via the star's parameters. But I don't see a direct way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into considering that the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are the same as the Sun, but in reality, the H abundance could vary.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2 is 1, meaning the same H density as the Sun. But that doesn't make sense, because [Fe/H] is 0, which for Star_1 would imply that Fe is the same as the Sun, but H could be different.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the metallicity. But [Fe/H] is 0, so metallicity is solar.

Wait, maybe the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2 is 1, but I can't confirm that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio of H is the same as the Sun's, so n_H1 = n_H2 =n_H_sun. But that's an assumption, and the problem doesn't state that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen, and since [Si/H] in Star_1 is +0.3 and Star_2 is -0.3, the ratio is 10^{0.3 +0.3} =10^0.6≈3.98.

But wait, that's the ratio if n_H1/n_H2=1. Which is n_H1 =n_H2. But I don't know that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think.

The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So it's n_Si1 /n_Si2.

But n_Si depends on [Si/H], which we've determined for each star. So:

n_Si1 =n_Si_sun *10^{0.3} (since [Si/H]_1=0.3).

n_Si2 =n_Si_sun *10^{-0.3} (since [Si/H]_2=-0.3).

So, n_Si1/n_Si2 =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But this is under the assumption that the hydrogen in both stars is the same as in the Sun. But wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe is the same as the Sun. But what about H? If the H in Star_1 is same as Sun, then [Fe/H] would be 0. But if H is lower, then [Fe/H] would be positive. Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(solar ratio).

So, if [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe/n_H = solar ratio. So in Star_1, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. So if n_H1 is lower than n_H_sun, then n_Fe1 would be lower than solar n_Fe, but in such a way that their ratio is solar.

Wait, but since the problem doesn't give any other information about the H abundance, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the H in each star and just compute the ratio based on [Si/H] values.

So, under that assumption, the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is approximately 4. So option A is ~3.9.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

So this would point to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken into account the mass of the stars. But I don't see how the mass affects the photospheric composition. The mass would influence their evolution, but not their elemental abundance ratios if we're assuming LTE and using the EW method correctly.

So I think the correct answer is A) ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: Silicon abundance relative to Fe is 0.3 dex above solar.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: Magnesium abundance relative to Si is 0.3 dex above solar.

3. **Solar Abundances**:
   - For the Sun, [Mg/Si] = 0 dex, meaning Mg and Si abundances are equal in the Sun.

### Step 1: Determine [Si/H] for Each Star
- **Star_1**:
  Using [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H], and since [Fe/H]_1 = 0:
  \[
  [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 \, \text{dex}.
  \]

- **Star_2**:
  Using [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], and since [Mg/H]_2 = 0:
  \[
  [Mg/Si]_2 = -[Si/H]_2 \implies [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 \, \text{dex}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The ratio of silicon abundances in Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Using \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately 3.9.

### Step 3: Verify Assumptions
The problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance in both stars is consistent with the Sun's hydrogen abundance. This allows us to directly use the [Si/H] values to compute the silicon abundance ratio. The masses of the stars (1.5 and 1.2 times solar) do not directly affect the photospheric composition in this context.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**
