Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. It's about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction.

Alright, the setup is that the magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. So the particle is aligned with that field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think about spin precession. When a magnetic field is applied, the magnetic moment tends to align with it. The energy of the system is given by the Zeeman term, which is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

Wait, so before the field changes, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz, so its spin is along z. When the field is suddenly switched off, the magnetic field in the z-direction is gone. But then another field is turned on in the y-direction. So the net magnetic field is now along y.

Wait, but the magnetic field changes direction. So the Hamiltonian of the system must change. Initially, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sz, but after the change, it's proportional to Sy, because the field is along y.

I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin will precess around the new field direction. But how does this affect the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment?

Oh, because the particle was initially in an eigenstate of Sz, which is the same as the initial magnetic field direction. After the field is changed to point in y, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Wait, the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. What's the frequency of that oscillation?

I think the frequency comes from the energy difference between the spin states. The energy levels will split based on the new Hamiltonian. So the energy levels are given by E = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, no, more accurately, the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, and B is in the y-direction, then H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So H = -gamma B Sy. Or is it positive? Oh, wait, the energy is E = -mu · B. So H = -mu · B = -gamma (S · B). So if B is along y, H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check. The magnetic dipole moment is mu = gamma S. The energy is U = - mu · B. So H = -gamma (S · B). So if B is along y, H = -gamma B Sy.

But wait, the energy levels for spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along y would be E = ± (gamma B / 2), because Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, no, wait: the eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2, but when multiplied by -gamma B, that gives E = ∓ (gamma B ħ/2). Wait, but ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, right? Oh, but wait, sometimes gamma is defined with factors that include ħ. Let me think about the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B Sy. Wait, I might have mixed up the sign. The energy is U = -mu · B. So mu is gamma S. So U = -gamma (S · B). So if B is along y, U = -gamma B Sy.

But wait, the operator for Sy is (ħ/2)σy, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2) σy. But the actual energy depends on the eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = (gamma B) Sy.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Larmor frequency. The precession frequency omega is given by gamma B, right? But wait, when the field is along a different axis, does that affect the frequency?

Wait, when the field is along the z-axis, the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2). The transition frequency between these states is (E+ - E-)/ħ = (gamma B ħ/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2)) / ħ = gamma B.

But in this problem, the field is along y, so the energy levels are E = ± gamma B (ħ/2) * something?

Wait, but the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, which is along z. When the field is along y, the states are eigenstates of Sy.

So when the field is switched, the state is no longer an eigenstate of H. The state will evolve in time, and the expectation value of Sz will oscillate.

The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian divided by Planck's constant.

Wait, the energy levels for the new Hamiltonian (field along y) are E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) * something? Let me think.

Wait, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) for Sy = +ħ/2 and E = gamma B (ħ/2) for Sy = -ħ/2? Or wait, perhaps I got the sign wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps H = gamma B Sy, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the energy is -mu · B. So if B is in y, H = -mu · B = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, that makes H = -gamma B Sy. So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (±1), so E = ± (-gamma B ħ/2) * ?

Wait, more accurately, the operator Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So if H = -gamma B Sy, then the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (± ħ/2). So E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_minus = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, that would make the energy levels E_plus = - (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_minus = (gamma B ħ)/2.

So the energy difference between the two states is E_minus - E_plus = (gamma B ħ/2) - (-gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ.

So the frequency is this energy difference divided by h-bar (ħ). So frequency nu = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, the time-dependent expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency equal to the energy difference divided by ħ. So the energy difference is 2 * (gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (gamma B ħ)/(ħ) )= gamma B.

Wait, but that's the same as the Larmor frequency when the field is along z. But in this case, the field is along y. Does the direction of the field affect the frequency? Or is it only dependent on the magnitude of B?

Wait, because when the field is in a different direction, the transition frequency remains the same as if it were along z because it's the same B. Because the frequency is determined by the energy gap, which depends on B's magnitude and the coupling term.

Wait, let me think again. The energy difference between the two eigenstates when the field is along y is (gamma B ħ) because E_plus is -gamma B ħ/2, E_minus is +gamma B ħ/2. The difference is gamma B ħ. Then, the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Hmm, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B. But wait, the options are given as A) gamma B/2, B) gamma B, C) sqrt(2) gamma B, D) gamma B/sqrt(2).

So option B is gamma B. That would be the answer? But wait, earlier I thought that when the field is along z, the frequency is gamma B, which is the Larmor frequency. So why is the direction change not affecting the frequency?

Wait, perhaps because the frequency is determined by the energy splitting, which is determined by gamma and B, regardless of the direction. So the energy splitting for any direction is proportional to B and gamma. So the frequency is the same as the Larmor frequency.

Wait, but let me think about the precession. When the magnetic field is applied in the y-direction, the spin will precess around the y-axis. But the observable here is the z-component of the magnetic moment. So the expectation value of Sz will oscillate as the spin precesses around y.

The time evolution of the expectation value of Sz will involve terms like sin(omega t) or cos(omega t), where omega is the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the frequency is not gamma B. Let me think about the time evolution more carefully.

The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue ħ/2. After the field is turned to y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

So the initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The time evolution is given by the Schrödinger equation. The state at time t is |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Expressing |+z> in the eigenbasis of H:

|+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.

The coefficients a and b can be found using the expansion. Let me think, the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)} and |−y> = (|+z> − |-z>)/sqrt(2)}. So solving for |+z>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

Therefore, the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |−y> with equal coefficients.

The time evolution for each eigenstate is multiplied by a phase factor. So |psi(t)> = ( |+y> exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) + |−y> exp(-i E_- t / ħ) ) / sqrt(2).

The energies E_+ and E_- are the eigenvalues of H for |+y> and |−y>:

H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, H |−y> = E_- |−y>.

Given that H = -gamma B Sy, and Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>.

So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (+1) = -gamma B ħ/2.

Similarly, E_- = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (-1) = +gamma B ħ/2.

So the time evolution becomes:

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) + |−y> exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) ] / sqrt(2).

Simplify the exponents: (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ = gamma B t/2.

So:

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) + |−y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to find the expectation value of Sz in this state.

Let's compute <Sz> = <psi(t) | Sz | psi(t)>.

Expressed in terms of |+y> and |−y>, since Sz can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |−y>.

But perhaps it's easier to express Sz in terms of the Pauli matrices. Sz is proportional to sigma_z.

But alternatively, let's compute the expectation value by expanding the state.

Express |psi(t)> as:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |−y> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ].

Then, when you compute <Sz>, you can write it as (1/sqrt(2})^2 times the sum of terms.

But perhaps it's easier to note that |+y> and |−y> are eigenstates of Sy, and Sz can be written in terms of Sx and Sy.

Alternatively, let's compute <Sz> using the expansion.

Expressed as:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2),
|−y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So, substituting into |psi(t)>:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) e^{i gamma B t/2} 
+ (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ] 

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= (1/2) [ (|+z> + |-z>) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - |-z>) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]

Combine terms:

= (1/2) [ (|+z> + |-z>) e^{i gamma B t/2} + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} - |-z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]

Group terms with |+z> and |-z>:

= (1/2) [ |+z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) + |-z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ) ]

Simplify the exponents using Euler's formula:

e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cosθ,
e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ.

So,

= (1/2) [ |+z> ( 2 cos(gamma B t/2) ) + |-z> ( 2i sin(gamma B t/2) ) ) ]

Factor out 2:

= (1/2)(2) [ cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ]

= [ cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ]

Now, compute <Sz>:

<Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>

Since |+z> has Sz = +ħ/2 and |-z> has Sz = -ħ/2.

Compute the inner product:

= [ cos(θ) < +z | + i sin(θ) < -z | ] 
  [ cos(θ) |+z> + i sin(θ) |-z> ] 

Where θ = gamma B t/2.

Expanding this:

= cos^2(θ) < +z | +z > 
+ i cos(θ) sin(θ) < +z | -z > 
+ i sin(θ) cos(θ) < -z | +z > 
+ (i^2) sin^2(θ) < -z | -z > 

But < +z | -z > is zero because they are orthogonal.

So,

= cos^2(theta) * (1) 
+ (-1) sin^2(theta) * (1) 
+ other terms which are zero.

Because i^2 = -1.

So,

= [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] 
= cos(2 theta).

Wait, because cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

So,

<Sz> = (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ].

Wait, no. Wait, because when you compute <Sz>, each |+z> has Sz = ħ/2. Let me think again.

Wait, the state is [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ].

So the expectation value is:

[ cos(theta) ]^* [ (ħ/2) cos(theta) ] 
+ [ i sin(theta) ]^* [ (-ħ/2) i sin(theta) ]

Wait, let me compute it properly.

Each state |+z> has Sz = ħ/2, and |-z> has Sz = - ħ/2.

So,

<Sz> = [ cos(theta)* < +z | + i sin(theta)* < -z | ] 
        [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]

= cos(theta) * cos(theta) * (ħ/2) 
+ cos(theta) * [i sin(theta)]^* * ( - ħ/2 )
+ [i sin(theta)]^* cos(theta) * ( - ħ/2 )
+ [i sin(theta)]^* [i sin(theta)] * (ħ/2 )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compute the inner product correctly.

Wait, the state vector is |psi> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>, where theta = gamma B t/2.

Then,

<Sz> = (cos(theta))^2 (ħ/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 (- ħ/2).

Wait, because <Sz> is:

= (cos(theta))^2 (ħ/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 (- ħ/2).

But (i sin(theta))^2 is (i^2) (sin^2 theta) ) = (-1) sin^2 theta.

So,

= (cos^2 theta)(ħ/2) + (- sin^2 theta)(- ħ/2)
= (cos^2 theta)(ħ/2) + sin^2 theta (ħ/2)
= (ħ/2)( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta )
= (ħ/2) (1) ) 
= ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right because it suggests that the expectation value is constant, which contradicts the question statement. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the expansion.

Wait, I think I forgot that the coefficients have complex phases. Let me try again.

The state |psi> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>.

The expectation value of Sz is:

< psi | Sz | psi >.

Which is [cos(theta)^* < +z | + i sin(theta)^* < -z | ] [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]

Since theta is real here, cos(theta)^* = cos(theta), and i sin(theta)^* = -i sin(theta).

So,

= cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | +z > (ħ/2)
+ cos(theta) (i sin(theta)) < +z | -z > ( - ħ/2 )
+ (-i sin(theta)) cos(theta) < -z | +z > ( ħ/2 )
+ (-i sin(theta)) (i sin(theta)) < -z | -z > ( - ħ/2 )

Simplify each term.

First term: cos^2 theta * (ħ/2)
Second term: i cos(theta) sin(theta) * 0 (since < +z | -z > is zero)
Third term: (-i) cos(theta) sin(theta) * 0 (same reason)
Fourth term: (-i)(i) sin^2 theta * < -z | -z > ( - ħ/2 )

Simplify each part:

Fourth term: (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = 1. So:

1 * sin^2 theta * ( - ħ/2 ) * ( -1 ) 
= sin^2 theta * ( ħ/2 )

So,

<Sz> = (ħ/2) cos^2 theta + (ħ/2) sin^2 theta 
= (ħ/2)( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta )
= (ħ/2)(1)
= ħ/2.

Wait, that suggests that <Sz> is constant, but the question says it starts oscillating. So I must have made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, maybe I messed up the time evolution. Let's double-check the time evolution.

The initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

After time t, the state is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ |+y> e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} + |−y> e^{-i E_- t / ħ} ]

E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |−y> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]

Expressing these in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2),
|−y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

Substituting:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ]

= (1/2) [ (|+z> + |-z>) e^{i theta} + (|+z> - |-z>) e^{-i theta} ]

Where theta = gamma B t/2.

Expanding:

= (1/2) [ |+z> e^{i theta} + |-z> e^{i theta} + |+z> e^{-i theta} - |-z> e^{-i theta} ]

Grouping terms:

= (1/2) [ |+z> (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) + |-z> (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) ]

Using Euler's formula:

e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta,
e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta.

So,

= (1/2)[ |+z> (2 cos theta) + |-z> (2i sin theta) ]

= [ |+z> cos theta + i |-z> sin theta ]

So, the state |psi(t)> is:

|+z> cos theta + i |-z> sin theta.

Now compute <Sz>:

= < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >
= [ cos theta < +z | - i sin theta < -z | ] 
  [ cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |-z> ]

= cos theta * cos theta * (ħ/2) 
+ (-i sin theta) * (i sin theta) * ( - ħ/2 )

Because < +z | +z > = 1, < -z | -z > =1, and cross terms are zero.

So,

= cos^2 theta (ħ/2) 
+ (-i)(i) sin^2 theta ( - ħ/2 )

Because (-i sin theta) * (i sin theta) = (-i^2) sin^2 theta = (1) sin^2 theta.

Wait, (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = (1), so,

= cos^2 theta (ħ/2) + (1) sin^2 theta ( ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2)( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta )
= (ħ/2) * 1
= ħ/2.

Hmm, that can't be right because the question says that the average of the z-component starts oscillating. But according to this calculation, it's constant. So where did I go wrong?

Wait a minute. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial state expansion. Let me double-check. The initial state is |+z> which is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). So when expressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>, |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |−y> is (|+z> − |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So,

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y> )/sqrt(2)
= [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)
= |+z> 

Wait, that's correct. So that part wasn't the mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the time evolution when substituting the energies. Let me recheck:

H = -gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

So the time evolution for |+y> is e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} = e^{-i (-gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} = e^{i gamma B t/2}.

Similarly, for |−y>, it's e^{-i E_- t/ħ} = e^{-i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} = e^{-i gamma B t/2}.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, but why is the expectation value of Sz not oscillating? I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps because I'm using the wrong definition of the magnetic moment. The question says the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So the magnetic moment's z-component is <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.

Wait, but in the question, they're asking for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z.

So if <Sz> is oscillating, then <mu_z> would oscillate as well. But according to my calculation, <Sz> is not oscillating. Hmm.

Wait, let me re-calculate <Sz> correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the expectation value. Let me compute it again.

So |psi(t)> is cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, theta = gamma B t/2.

Compute <Sz>:

= (cos(theta))^2 (ħ/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 ( - ħ/2 )

Because |-z> has Sz = -ħ/2.

So,

= (cos^2 theta)( ħ/2 ) + (i^2 sin^2 theta) ( - ħ/2 )
= (cos^2 theta)( ħ/2 ) + (-1) sin^2 theta ( - ħ/2 )
= (cos^2 theta)( ħ/2 ) + (sin^2 theta)( ħ/2 )
= (ħ/2)( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta )
= ħ/2.

Hmm, that's a problem. It suggests that the average is constant, which contradicts the question. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe the time evolution isn't just a phase factor. Let me think again about the time evolution. Maybe the Hamiltonian is time-dependent, but in this problem, the field is suddenly changed, so the Hamiltonian changes at t=0.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time evolution operator. The time evolution from t=0 to t is governed by H, which is H = -gamma B Sy.

So the state at time t is |psi(t)> = e^(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Which can be written as e^(-i (-gamma B Sy) t / ħ) |+z> 
= e^{i gamma B Sy t / ħ} |+z>.

Wait, but Sy for |+z> is (ħ/2) sigma_y. Let me think in terms of Pauli matrices.

Sy = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So,

e^{i gamma B Sy t / ħ} = e^{i gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y) t / ħ}
= e^{i gamma B t (sigma_y)/2}.

So, the time evolution operator is e^{i (gamma B t/2) sigma_y}.

The matrix for sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The exponential of i theta sigma_y can be found using the expansion:

e^{i theta sigma_y} = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So,

e^{i (gamma B t/2) sigma_y} = cos(gamma B t/2) I + i sigma_y sin(gamma B t/2).

Now, applying this to the state |+z>, which is represented by the vector [1; 0].

So,

|psi(t)> = [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] [1; 0 ]

= cos(theta) [1;0] + i sigma_y sin(theta) [1;0]

Sigma_y [1;0] is [0; i].

So,

= [ cos(theta) , 0 ]^T 
+ i [ 0, i ] sin(theta )
= [ cos(theta), i (i sin(theta)) ]^T
= [ cos(theta), (- sin(theta) ) ]^T.

So, the state is:

|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |−z>.

Wait, earlier I had i sin(theta) |-z>, but this gives -i sin(theta) |-z>.

So perhaps I made a sign mistake earlier.

Now, compute <Sz>:

= < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.

Since |+z> is [1; 0], < +z | Sz | +z > = ħ/2, and < -z | Sz | -z > = -ħ/2.

Compute the state: [cos(theta), -i sin(theta)]^T.

So,

< psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) > = [ cos(theta) , i sin(theta) ] 
                          [ [ ħ/2, 0 ], [ 0, -ħ/2 ] ] 
                          [ cos(theta) , -i sin(theta) ]^T 

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

The matrix multiplication:

= [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] 
  * [ [ (ħ/2) cos(theta), (ħ/2)(-i sin(theta) ) ],
      [ (-ħ/2)(i sin(theta)), (ħ/2)(-i sin(theta)) ) ] ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as a scalar product.

|psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> - i sin(theta)|-z>.
So,

< psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) > = cos(theta)^2 (ħ/2) + ( -i sin(theta) )^2 ( - ħ/2 )

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + (-i^2) sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + (1) sin^2(theta) ( ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2)( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) )
= ħ/2.

Again, <Sz> is constant. But the question states that the average starts oscillating. So perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong expression for the magnetic moment. The question says mu = gamma Sz. So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z.

So the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.

But according to our calculation, <Sz> is ħ/2, so <mu_z> would be gamma ħ/2, which is a constant. But the question says it starts oscillating. So maybe we're looking at a different observable.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the energy levels. Let me think again about the energy levels after the field is applied along y.

The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is turned on along y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.

The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, but because the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |−y>, which are the eigenstates of H, the system will evolve in time with phases that are determined by the energy differences.

Wait, but in our calculation, the expectation value of Sz is constant. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something about the observable.

Wait, perhaps the observable is not Sz but something else. Wait, the question asks about the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.

If <Sz> is not oscillating, then <mu_z> wouldn't oscillate either. But the question says it does. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute the expectation value of mu_z.

mu_z = gamma <Sz>.

So, maybe I should compute the expectation value of mu_z, which is gamma times <Sz>.

But regardless, the expectation value of Sz is a constant, which would imply that mu_z's expectation value is also a constant. But the question says it's oscillating. So I must have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem arises because I considered the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B Sy, but perhaps it should be H = gamma B Sy. Let me re-examine the expression for the Hamiltonian.

The energy is U = -mu · B. mu = gamma S. So, U = -gamma S · B.

If B is along y, then U = -gamma B Sy.

So, H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin precesses in such a way that the expectation value of Sz oscillates. Let me think about the time evolution operator.

The time evolution operator is U = exp(-i H t / ħ).

H is -gamma B Sy, so,

U = exp( i gamma B Sy t / ħ )

Sy = (ħ/2) sigma_y, so,

U = exp( i gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y ) t / ħ )
= exp( i (gamma B t/2) sigma_y )

Which is the same as I found earlier.

So,

U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta),
where theta = gamma B t/2.

Applying U to |+z> gives:

|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |−z>.

So, the state is a superposition of |+z> and |−z>.

The expectation value of Sz is:

< Sz > = |cos(theta)|^2 (ħ/2) + | -i sin(theta) |^2 ( - ħ/2 )

Wait, wait no. Because |-z> has Sz = -ħ/2. So,

< Sz > = cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)

Ah! There we go. I think I made a mistake in the signs earlier. Because the coefficient for |-z> is -i sin(theta), and the magnitude squared is sin^2(theta). But since |-z> has Sz = -ħ/2, the contribution is - sin^2(theta) (ħ/2).

So,

< Sz > = (ħ/2) cos(theta)² - (ħ/2) sin(theta)²
= (ħ/2)( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) )
= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)
= (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Because theta is (gamma B t/2), so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

< Sz > = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Therefore, the magnetic moment's z-component is:

< mu_z > = gamma < Sz > = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma B.

So the answer should be option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, corresponding to $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, which are superpositions of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$:
   \[
   |+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle).
   \]
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   After the field is switched, the state evolves under the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution operator is:
   \[
   U(t) = e^{-iHt/\hbar} = e^{i\gamma B S_y t / \hbar}.
   \]
   Substituting $S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2}\sigma_y$, the operator becomes:
   \[
   U(t) = \cos(\gamma B t / 2)I + i\sin(\gamma B t / 2)\sigma_y.
   \]
   Applying $U(t)$ to the initial state $|+z\rangle$, the evolved state is:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2)|+z\rangle - i\sin(\gamma B t / 2)|-z\rangle.
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ in the state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2(\gamma B t / 2)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2(\gamma B t / 2)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]
   Simplifying using $\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta = \cos(2\theta)$:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2}\cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**:  
   The magnetic moment’s $z$-component is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. Thus:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2}\cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   The oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is the coefficient of $t$ inside the cosine, which is $\gamma B$.

### Critical Evaluation of Options

- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not halved; it matches the energy splitting determined by $\gamma B$.
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, as derived from the time dependence of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2}\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the frequency.
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. 

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. It's about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction.

Alright, the setup is that the magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. So the particle is aligned with that field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think about spin precession. When a magnetic field is applied, the magnetic moment tends to align with it. The energy of the system is given by the Zeeman term, which is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

Wait, so before the field changes, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz, so its spin is along z. When the field is suddenly switched off, the magnetic field in the z-direction is gone. But then another field is turned on in the y-direction. So the net magnetic field is now along y.

Wait, but the magnetic field changes direction. So the Hamiltonian of the system must change. Initially, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sz, but after the change, it's proportional to Sy, because the field is along y.

I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin will precess around the new field direction. But how does this affect the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment?

Oh, because the particle was initially in an eigenstate of Sz, which is the same as the initial magnetic field direction. After the field is changed to point in y, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Wait, the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. What's the frequency of that oscillation?

I think the frequency comes from the energy difference between the spin states. The energy levels will split based on the new Hamiltonian. So the energy levels are given by E = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, no, more accurately, the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, and B is in the y-direction, then H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So H = -gamma B Sy. Or is it positive? Oh, wait, the energy is E = -mu · B. So H = -mu · B = -gamma (S · B). So if B is along y, H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check. The magnetic dipole moment is mu = gamma S. The energy is U = - mu · B. So H = -gamma (S · B). So if B is along y, H = -gamma B Sy.

But wait, the energy levels for spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along y would be E = ± (gamma B / 2), because Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, no, wait: the eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2, but when multiplied by -gamma B, that gives E = ∓ (gamma B ħ/2). Wait, but ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, right? Oh, but wait, sometimes gamma is defined with factors that include ħ. Let me think about the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B Sy. Wait, I might have mixed up the sign. The energy is U = -mu · B. So mu is gamma S. So U = -gamma (S · B). So if B is along y, U = -gamma B Sy.

But wait, the operator for Sy is (ħ/2)σy, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2) σy. But the actual energy depends on the eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = (gamma B) Sy.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Larmor frequency. The precession frequency omega is given by gamma B, right? But wait, when the field is along a different axis, does that affect the frequency?

Wait, when the field is along the z-axis, the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2). The transition frequency between these states is (E+ - E-)/ħ = (gamma B ħ/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2)) / ħ = gamma B.

But in this problem, the field is along y, so the energy levels are E = ± gamma B (ħ/2) * something?

Wait, but the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, which is along z. When the field is along y, the states are eigenstates of Sy.

So when the field is switched, the state is no longer an eigenstate of H. The state will evolve in time, and the expectation value of Sz will oscillate.

The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian divided by Planck's constant.

Wait, the energy levels for the new Hamiltonian (field along y) are E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) * something? Let me think.

Wait, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) for Sy = +ħ/2 and E = gamma B (ħ/2) for Sy = -ħ/2? Or wait, perhaps I got the sign wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps H = gamma B Sy, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the energy is -mu · B. So if B is in y, H = -mu · B = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, that makes H = -gamma B Sy. So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (±1), so E = ± (-gamma B ħ/2) * ?

Wait, more accurately, the operator Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So if H = -gamma B Sy, then the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (± ħ/2). So E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_minus = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, that would make the energy levels E_plus = - (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_minus = (gamma B ħ)/2.

So the energy difference between the two states is E_minus - E_plus = (gamma B ħ/2) - (-gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ.

So the frequency is this energy difference divided by h-bar (ħ). So frequency nu = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, the time-dependent expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency equal to the energy difference divided by ħ. So the energy difference is 2 * (gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (gamma B ħ)/(ħ) )= gamma B.

Wait, but that's the same as the Larmor frequency when the field is along z. But in this case, the field is along y. Does the direction of the field affect the frequency? Or is it only dependent on the magnitude of B?

Wait, because when the field is in a different direction, the transition frequency remains the same as if it were along z because it's the same B. Because the frequency is determined by the energy gap, which depends on B's magnitude and the coupling term.

Wait, let me think again. The energy difference between the two eigenstates when the field is along y is (gamma B ħ) because E_plus is -gamma B ħ/2, E_minus is +gamma B ħ/2. The difference is gamma B ħ. Then, the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Hmm, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B. But wait, the options are given as A) gamma B/2, B) gamma B, C) sqrt(2) gamma B, D) gamma B/sqrt(2).

So option B is gamma B. That would be the answer? But wait, earlier I thought that when the field is along z, the frequency is gamma B, which is the Larmor frequency. So why is the direction change not affecting the frequency?

Wait, perhaps because the frequency is determined by the energy splitting, which is determined by gamma and B, regardless of the direction. So the energy splitting for any direction is proportional to B and gamma. So the frequency is the same as the Larmor frequency.

Wait, but let me think about the precession. When the magnetic field is applied in the y-direction, the spin will precess around the y-axis. But the observable here is the z-component of the magnetic moment. So the expectation value of Sz will oscillate as the spin precesses around y.

The time evolution of the expectation value of Sz will involve terms like sin(omega t) or cos(omega t), where omega is the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the frequency is not gamma B. Let me think about the time evolution more carefully.

The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue ħ/2. After the field is turned to y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

So the initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The time evolution is given by the Schrödinger equation. The state at time t is |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Expressing |+z> in the eigenbasis of H:

|+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.

The coefficients a and b can be found using the expansion. Let me think, the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)} and |−y> = (|+z> − |-z>)/sqrt(2)}. So solving for |+z>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

Therefore, the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |−y> with equal coefficients.

The time evolution for each eigenstate is multiplied by a phase factor. So |psi(t)> = ( |+y> exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) + |−y> exp(-i E_- t / ħ) ) / sqrt(2).

The energies E_+ and E_- are the eigenvalues of H for |+y> and |−y>:

H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, H |−y> = E_- |−y>.

Given that H = -gamma B Sy, and Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>.

So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (+1) = -gamma B ħ/2.

Similarly, E_- = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (-1) = +gamma B ħ/2.

So the time evolution becomes:

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) + |−y> exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) ] / sqrt(2).

Simplify the exponents: (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ = gamma B t/2.

So:

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) + |−y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to find the expectation value of Sz in this state.

Let's compute <Sz> = <psi(t) | Sz | psi(t)>.

Expressed in terms of |+y> and |−y>, since Sz can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |−y>.

But perhaps it's easier to express Sz in terms of the Pauli matrices. Sz is proportional to sigma_z.

But alternatively, let's compute the expectation value by expanding the state.

Express |psi(t)> as:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |−y> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ].

Then, when you compute <Sz>, you can write it as (1/sqrt(2})^2 times the sum of terms.

But perhaps it's easier to note that |+y> and |−y> are eigenstates of Sy, and Sz can be written in terms of Sx and Sy.

Alternatively, let's compute <Sz> using the expansion.

Expressed as:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2),
|−y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So, substituting into |psi(t)>:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) e^{i gamma B t/2} 
+ (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ] 

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= (1/2) [ (|+z> + |-z>) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - |-z>) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]

Combine terms:

= (1/2) [ (|+z> + |-z>) e^{i gamma B t/2} + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} - |-z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]

Group terms with |+z> and |-z>:

= (1/2) [ |+z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) + |-z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ) ]

Simplify the exponents using Euler's formula:

e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cosθ,
e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ.

So,

= (1/2) [ |+z> ( 2 cos(gamma B t/2) ) + |-z> ( 2i sin(gamma B t/2) ) ) ]

Factor out 2:

= (1/2)(2) [ cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ]

= [ cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ]

Now, compute <Sz>:

<Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>

Since |+z> has Sz = +ħ/2 and |-z> has Sz = -ħ/2.

Compute the inner product:

= [ cos(θ) < +z | + i sin(θ) < -z | ] 
  [ cos(θ) |+z> + i sin(θ) |-z> ] 

Where θ = gamma B t/2.

Expanding this:

= cos^2(θ) < +z | +z > 
+ i cos(θ) sin(θ) < +z | -z > 
+ i sin(θ) cos(θ) < -z | +z > 
+ (i^2) sin^2(θ) < -z | -z > 

But < +z | -z > is zero because they are orthogonal.

So,

= cos^2(theta) * (1) 
+ (-1) sin^2(theta) * (1) 
+ other terms which are zero.

Because i^2 = -1.

So,

= [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] 
= cos(2 theta).

Wait, because cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

So,

<Sz> = (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ].

Wait, no. Wait, because when you compute <Sz>, each |+z> has Sz = ħ/2. Let me think again.

Wait, the state is [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ].

So the expectation value is:

[ cos(theta) ]^* [ (ħ/2) cos(theta) ] 
+ [ i sin(theta) ]^* [ (-ħ/2) i sin(theta) ]

Wait, let me compute it properly.

Each state |+z> has Sz = ħ/2, and |-z> has Sz = - ħ/2.

So,

<Sz> = [ cos(theta)* < +z | + i sin(theta)* < -z | ] 
        [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]

= cos(theta) * cos(theta) * (ħ/2) 
+ cos(theta) * [i sin(theta)]^* * ( - ħ/2 )
+ [i sin(theta)]^* cos(theta) * ( - ħ/2 )
+ [i sin(theta)]^* [i sin(theta)] * (ħ/2 )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compute the inner product correctly.

Wait, the state vector is |psi> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>, where theta = gamma B t/2.

Then,

<Sz> = (cos(theta))^2 (ħ/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 (- ħ/2).

Wait, because <Sz> is:

= (cos(theta))^2 (ħ/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 (- ħ/2).

But (i sin(theta))^2 is (i^2) (sin^2 theta) ) = (-1) sin^2 theta.

So,

= (cos^2 theta)(ħ/2) + (- sin^2 theta)(- ħ/2)
= (cos^2 theta)(ħ/2) + sin^2 theta (ħ/2)
= (ħ/2)( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta )
= (ħ/2) (1) ) 
= ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right because it suggests that the expectation value is constant, which contradicts the question statement. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the expansion.

Wait, I think I forgot that the coefficients have complex phases. Let me try again.

The state |psi> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>.

The expectation value of Sz is:

< psi | Sz | psi >.

Which is [cos(theta)^* < +z | + i sin(theta)^* < -z | ] [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]

Since theta is real here, cos(theta)^* = cos(theta), and i sin(theta)^* = -i sin(theta).

So,

= cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | +z > (ħ/2)
+ cos(theta) (i sin(theta)) < +z | -z > ( - ħ/2 )
+ (-i sin(theta)) cos(theta) < -z | +z > ( ħ/2 )
+ (-i sin(theta)) (i sin(theta)) < -z | -z > ( - ħ/2 )

Simplify each term.

First term: cos^2 theta * (ħ/2)
Second term: i cos(theta) sin(theta) * 0 (since < +z | -z > is zero)
Third term: (-i) cos(theta) sin(theta) * 0 (same reason)
Fourth term: (-i)(i) sin^2 theta * < -z | -z > ( - ħ/2 )

Simplify each part:

Fourth term: (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = 1. So:

1 * sin^2 theta * ( - ħ/2 ) * ( -1 ) 
= sin^2 theta * ( ħ/2 )

So,

<Sz> = (ħ/2) cos^2 theta + (ħ/2) sin^2 theta 
= (ħ/2)( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta )
= (ħ/2)(1)
= ħ/2.

Wait, that suggests that <Sz> is constant, but the question says it starts oscillating. So I must have made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, maybe I messed up the time evolution. Let's double-check the time evolution.

The initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

After time t, the state is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ |+y> e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} + |−y> e^{-i E_- t / ħ} ]

E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |−y> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]

Expressing these in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2),
|−y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

Substituting:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ]

= (1/2) [ (|+z> + |-z>) e^{i theta} + (|+z> - |-z>) e^{-i theta} ]

Where theta = gamma B t/2.

Expanding:

= (1/2) [ |+z> e^{i theta} + |-z> e^{i theta} + |+z> e^{-i theta} - |-z> e^{-i theta} ]

Grouping terms:

= (1/2) [ |+z> (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) + |-z> (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) ]

Using Euler's formula:

e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta,
e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta.

So,

= (1/2)[ |+z> (2 cos theta) + |-z> (2i sin theta) ]

= [ |+z> cos theta + i |-z> sin theta ]

So, the state |psi(t)> is:

|+z> cos theta + i |-z> sin theta.

Now compute <Sz>:

= < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >
= [ cos theta < +z | - i sin theta < -z | ] 
  [ cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |-z> ]

= cos theta * cos theta * (ħ/2) 
+ (-i sin theta) * (i sin theta) * ( - ħ/2 )

Because < +z | +z > = 1, < -z | -z > =1, and cross terms are zero.

So,

= cos^2 theta (ħ/2) 
+ (-i)(i) sin^2 theta ( - ħ/2 )

Because (-i sin theta) * (i sin theta) = (-i^2) sin^2 theta = (1) sin^2 theta.

Wait, (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = (1), so,

= cos^2 theta (ħ/2) + (1) sin^2 theta ( ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2)( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta )
= (ħ/2) * 1
= ħ/2.

Hmm, that can't be right because the question says that the average of the z-component starts oscillating. But according to this calculation, it's constant. So where did I go wrong?

Wait a minute. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial state expansion. Let me double-check. The initial state is |+z> which is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). So when expressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>, |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |−y> is (|+z> − |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So,

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y> )/sqrt(2)
= [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)
= |+z> 

Wait, that's correct. So that part wasn't the mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the time evolution when substituting the energies. Let me recheck:

H = -gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

So the time evolution for |+y> is e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} = e^{-i (-gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} = e^{i gamma B t/2}.

Similarly, for |−y>, it's e^{-i E_- t/ħ} = e^{-i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} = e^{-i gamma B t/2}.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, but why is the expectation value of Sz not oscillating? I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps because I'm using the wrong definition of the magnetic moment. The question says the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So the magnetic moment's z-component is <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.

Wait, but in the question, they're asking for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z.

So if <Sz> is oscillating, then <mu_z> would oscillate as well. But according to my calculation, <Sz> is not oscillating. Hmm.

Wait, let me re-calculate <Sz> correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the expectation value. Let me compute it again.

So |psi(t)> is cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, theta = gamma B t/2.

Compute <Sz>:

= (cos(theta))^2 (ħ/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 ( - ħ/2 )

Because |-z> has Sz = -ħ/2.

So,

= (cos^2 theta)( ħ/2 ) + (i^2 sin^2 theta) ( - ħ/2 )
= (cos^2 theta)( ħ/2 ) + (-1) sin^2 theta ( - ħ/2 )
= (cos^2 theta)( ħ/2 ) + (sin^2 theta)( ħ/2 )
= (ħ/2)( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta )
= ħ/2.

Hmm, that's a problem. It suggests that the average is constant, which contradicts the question. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe the time evolution isn't just a phase factor. Let me think again about the time evolution. Maybe the Hamiltonian is time-dependent, but in this problem, the field is suddenly changed, so the Hamiltonian changes at t=0.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time evolution operator. The time evolution from t=0 to t is governed by H, which is H = -gamma B Sy.

So the state at time t is |psi(t)> = e^(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Which can be written as e^(-i (-gamma B Sy) t / ħ) |+z> 
= e^{i gamma B Sy t / ħ} |+z>.

Wait, but Sy for |+z> is (ħ/2) sigma_y. Let me think in terms of Pauli matrices.

Sy = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So,

e^{i gamma B Sy t / ħ} = e^{i gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y) t / ħ}
= e^{i gamma B t (sigma_y)/2}.

So, the time evolution operator is e^{i (gamma B t/2) sigma_y}.

The matrix for sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The exponential of i theta sigma_y can be found using the expansion:

e^{i theta sigma_y} = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So,

e^{i (gamma B t/2) sigma_y} = cos(gamma B t/2) I + i sigma_y sin(gamma B t/2).

Now, applying this to the state |+z>, which is represented by the vector [1; 0].

So,

|psi(t)> = [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] [1; 0 ]

= cos(theta) [1;0] + i sigma_y sin(theta) [1;0]

Sigma_y [1;0] is [0; i].

So,

= [ cos(theta) , 0 ]^T 
+ i [ 0, i ] sin(theta )
= [ cos(theta), i (i sin(theta)) ]^T
= [ cos(theta), (- sin(theta) ) ]^T.

So, the state is:

|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |−z>.

Wait, earlier I had i sin(theta) |-z>, but this gives -i sin(theta) |-z>.

So perhaps I made a sign mistake earlier.

Now, compute <Sz>:

= < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.

Since |+z> is [1; 0], < +z | Sz | +z > = ħ/2, and < -z | Sz | -z > = -ħ/2.

Compute the state: [cos(theta), -i sin(theta)]^T.

So,

< psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) > = [ cos(theta) , i sin(theta) ] 
                          [ [ ħ/2, 0 ], [ 0, -ħ/2 ] ] 
                          [ cos(theta) , -i sin(theta) ]^T 

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

The matrix multiplication:

= [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] 
  * [ [ (ħ/2) cos(theta), (ħ/2)(-i sin(theta) ) ],
      [ (-ħ/2)(i sin(theta)), (ħ/2)(-i sin(theta)) ) ] ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as a scalar product.

|psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> - i sin(theta)|-z>.
So,

< psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) > = cos(theta)^2 (ħ/2) + ( -i sin(theta) )^2 ( - ħ/2 )

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + (-i^2) sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + (1) sin^2(theta) ( ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2)( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) )
= ħ/2.

Again, <Sz> is constant. But the question states that the average starts oscillating. So perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong expression for the magnetic moment. The question says mu = gamma Sz. So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z.

So the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.

But according to our calculation, <Sz> is ħ/2, so <mu_z> would be gamma ħ/2, which is a constant. But the question says it starts oscillating. So maybe we're looking at a different observable.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the energy levels. Let me think again about the energy levels after the field is applied along y.

The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is turned on along y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.

The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, but because the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |−y>, which are the eigenstates of H, the system will evolve in time with phases that are determined by the energy differences.

Wait, but in our calculation, the expectation value of Sz is constant. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something about the observable.

Wait, perhaps the observable is not Sz but something else. Wait, the question asks about the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.

If <Sz> is not oscillating, then <mu_z> wouldn't oscillate either. But the question says it does. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute the expectation value of mu_z.

mu_z = gamma <Sz>.

So, maybe I should compute the expectation value of mu_z, which is gamma times <Sz>.

But regardless, the expectation value of Sz is a constant, which would imply that mu_z's expectation value is also a constant. But the question says it's oscillating. So I must have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem arises because I considered the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B Sy, but perhaps it should be H = gamma B Sy. Let me re-examine the expression for the Hamiltonian.

The energy is U = -mu · B. mu = gamma S. So, U = -gamma S · B.

If B is along y, then U = -gamma B Sy.

So, H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin precesses in such a way that the expectation value of Sz oscillates. Let me think about the time evolution operator.

The time evolution operator is U = exp(-i H t / ħ).

H is -gamma B Sy, so,

U = exp( i gamma B Sy t / ħ )

Sy = (ħ/2) sigma_y, so,

U = exp( i gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y ) t / ħ )
= exp( i (gamma B t/2) sigma_y )

Which is the same as I found earlier.

So,

U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta),
where theta = gamma B t/2.

Applying U to |+z> gives:

|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |−z>.

So, the state is a superposition of |+z> and |−z>.

The expectation value of Sz is:

< Sz > = |cos(theta)|^2 (ħ/2) + | -i sin(theta) |^2 ( - ħ/2 )

Wait, wait no. Because |-z> has Sz = -ħ/2. So,

< Sz > = cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)

Ah! There we go. I think I made a mistake in the signs earlier. Because the coefficient for |-z> is -i sin(theta), and the magnitude squared is sin^2(theta). But since |-z> has Sz = -ħ/2, the contribution is - sin^2(theta) (ħ/2).

So,

< Sz > = (ħ/2) cos(theta)² - (ħ/2) sin(theta)²
= (ħ/2)( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) )
= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)
= (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Because theta is (gamma B t/2), so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

< Sz > = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Therefore, the magnetic moment's z-component is:

< mu_z > = gamma < Sz > = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma B.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, corresponding to $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, which are superpositions of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$:
   \[
   |+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle).
   \]
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   After the field is switched, the state evolves under the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution operator is:
   \[
   U(t) = e^{-iHt/\hbar} = e^{i\gamma B S_y t / \hbar}.
   \]
   Substituting $S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2}\sigma_y$, the operator becomes:
   \[
   U(t) = \cos(\gamma B t / 2)I + i\sin(\gamma B t / 2)\sigma_y.
   \]
   Applying $U(t)$ to the initial state $|+z\rangle$, the evolved state is:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2)|+z\rangle - i\sin(\gamma B t / 2)|-z\rangle.
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ in the state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2(\gamma B t / 2)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2(\gamma B t / 2)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]
   Simplifying using $\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta = \cos(2\theta)$:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2}\cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**:  
   The magnetic moment’s $z$-component is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. Thus:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2}\cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   The oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is the coefficient of $t$ inside the cosine, which is $\gamma B$.

### Critical Evaluation of Options

- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not halved; it matches the energy splitting determined by $\gamma B$.
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, as derived from the time dependence of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2}\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the frequency.
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$.
