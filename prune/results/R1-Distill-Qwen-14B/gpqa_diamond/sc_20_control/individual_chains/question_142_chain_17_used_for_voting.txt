Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem presents a density matrix rho, which is given by (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. So, I think the question is asking about the position of this particular density matrix in the space of qubits. The options are given as vectors in three-dimensional space, which is a bit confusing because qubits are two-level systems, so I'm not exactly sure how that maps to a three-dimensional space.

Wait, I think I remember something about the Bloch sphere. Oh right! For a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices are more general than pure states. So, how does that work for mixed states?

A pure state is a vector on the Bloch sphere, like |0> would be at (1,0,0) and |1> at (5,0,0) maybe? Wait, no, the Bloch sphere has a radius of 1. So |0> is (1,0,0), and |1> is (-1,0,0)? Or wait, maybe I have that backwards. Let me think. The Bloch sphere representation is usually given by the vector (x,y,z) where the state is ( (x,y,z) + I ) / 2, or something like that? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the general form for a single qubit density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is rho = (I + r · σ) / 2, where r is a vector in three dimensions (x, y, z) with |r| ≤ 1, and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given rho in this form, I can find the vector r.

The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1| ) / 2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix [1,0; 0,0], and |1><1| is [0,0; 0,1]. So when I add them, I get [1,0; 0,1], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives rho = (I)/2.

So rho equals I/2. Now, comparing this with the Bloch form rho = (I + r·σ)/2. So if rho is I/2, that implies that r·σ must be zero. Because I/2 = (I + 0)/2. So r·σ = 0.

What does r·σ equal? The Pauli matrices σ are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this to be zero, each term must contribute to zero. So r_x must be zero, r_y must be zero, and r_z must be zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that should be the answer.

Wait a second, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because I remember that the completely mixed state for a qubit is (I/2), which corresponds to the origin on the Bloch sphere. So yeah, that makes sense. So the density matrix given is the maximally mixed state, which has no coherence and equal probability for 0 and 1. Its Bloch vector is at the origin, so the position is (0,0,0).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch sphere representation of a density matrix is given by:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector in three-dimensional space with \( |\mathbf{r}| \leq 1 \), and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \), meaning all components of \( \mathbf{r} \) must be zero. Therefore, the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin on the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the fact that the given density matrix represents the maximally mixed state, which has no coherence and equal probability for the states \( \left|0\right\rangle \) and \( \left|1\right\rangle \).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \( (0, 0, 0) \).
