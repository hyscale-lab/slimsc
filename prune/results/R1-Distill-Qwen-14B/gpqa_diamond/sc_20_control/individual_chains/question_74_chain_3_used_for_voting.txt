Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there's an atom with a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm. Wait, so the initial setup is that we have an atom that has a certain decay probability. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? The probability of decay is related to the half-life or something like that.

Let me think. The decay probability given is 32% over 100 minutes. So if I denote the probability as P(t), then P(100) = 32% = 0.32. 

I think the formula for the probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Alternatively, maybe it's expressed as P(t) = λt, but that doesn't make much sense because for larger t, the probability can't exceed 1. So exponential decay makes more sense.

Wait, so the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. That means that 32% of atoms will decay in that time. So for a single atom, the chance it decays within 100 minutes is 0.32.

But wait, the way it's stated, "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." So that's the probability that the atom decays before 100 minutes.

Now, the question is a bit tricky. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. What's the chance it will decay in the next 150 minutes? Wait, 150 minutes from now? Or the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed? Oh, I think it's the total time from now, meaning 50 + 150 = 200 minutes from the start.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: The total time being considered is 50 minutes that have already passed, and then the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 200 minutes. But now, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes.

Ah, right. So this is a conditional probability. Since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we can treat that as a new starting point, and find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.

So the key idea is that radioactive decay is memoryless. The probability of decay in a future period doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. So the decay process is independent of the time already elapsed.

Wait, so the fact that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed doesn't change the probability. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of when it starts. So I can ignore the past 50 minutes and just compute the probability for 150 minutes.

But wait, let me think again. The initial 100-minute period had a 32% chance. So perhaps I should model this with the decay equation.

So, the decay law is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λ t). But here, the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t). So, for t=100, P(100) = 0.32.

Let me set up the equation. 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but wait, 0.68 is a bit higher. Let me calculate it.

Wait, let's compute ln(0.68). Using a calculator in my head: ln(1)=0. ln(0.5)= -0.6931. 0.68 is 0.12 above 0.57. Hmm, perhaps it's approximately -0.3856? Alternatively, I can just use the formula and leave it symbolic for now.

So λ = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. So the time from the current point is 150 minutes.

The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

But wait, wait. Because the 150 minutes is from now, but the initial condition was that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150, which is 200 minutes total. But because of the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval starting at the current time.

But wait, no. Let me clarify. The initial 100 minutes has a 32% chance. Now, we have 50 minutes passed, so the remaining time is 150.

Another approach: The decay probability in the first 100 minutes is 32%, so the decay constant λ can be found, and then we can compute the probability for 150 minutes.

Alternatively, since the process is memoryless, after 50 minutes, the remaining probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute window.

Wait, no. Let me think: the initial 100-minute probability is 32%, so the decay constant λ is such that P(100) = 0.32.

Then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150), which is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

But wait, that's not considering the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Wait, no. Because the probability that the atom hasn't decayed yet after 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50). So the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is (1 - e^(-λ *150 )) / (1 - e^(-λ *50 )).

Because, the conditional probability formula is P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B). In this case, A is decay within next 150 minutes, and B is not decaying in the first 50 minutes. But since if it decays in the next 150, it must not have decayed in the first 50. So P(A and B) is the same as P(A given B), because if it decays in the next 150, it definitely didn't decay in the first 50. Wait, that's correct.

So P(A given B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = P(A|B) = [Probability it decays between 50 and 200 minutes] / [Probability it doesn't decay in 50 minutes].

But how do we compute this? The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the probability it hasn't decayed by 50 (which is e^(-λ*50)), and then decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the probability it decays between 50 and 200 is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the probability of decaying after 50 minutes but before 200 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ *50) [1 - e^(-λ *150)].

But the conditional probability is [e^(-λ *50) (1 - e^(-λ *150)) ] / [e^(-λ *50)] ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the process is memoryless, then given that it hasn't decayed by t=50, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150 minutes starting from now. Which would mean that it's P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but that's only if the process is memoryless. So perhaps the conditional probability is just the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, regardless of the past.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me approach it differently.

The standard formula for the probability of decay in a specific time interval when the process is memoryless is that the probability of decay in a time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t).

But when we know that the atom hasn't decayed for a time t1, the probability that it decays between t1 and t1 + t2 is P(t1 + t2) - P(t1) = [1 - e^(-λ(t1 + t2))] - [1 - e^(-λ t1)] = e^(-λ t1) (1 - e^(-λ t2)).

But the conditional probability, given that it hasn't decayed by t1, is [e^(-λ t1) (1 - e^(-λ t2))] / [e^(-λ t1)] = 1 - e^(-λ t2). So it's the same as the probability of decaying in the next t2 minutes. So the memoryless property makes it so that the conditional probability is the same as the probability for the time starting from zero.

So in this problem, the t1 is 50 minutes, t2 is 150 minutes.

So the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

But wait, we can compute λ from the initial condition. We know that P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So solving for λ.

1 - 0.32 = e^(-100 λ)
0.68 = e^(-100 λ)
Take natural log: ln(0.68) = -100 λ
So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Compute ln(0.68) → I think ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856. Wait, because ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less. So maybe around -0.3856.

Let me compute it accurately. Let's approximate ln(0.68). Let's use the expansion or a calculator approach.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, I can just compute λ numerically.

So λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = (ln(1) - ln(0.68))/100 → same as (0 - (-0.3856 )) /100 → 0.3856 /100 ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

So λ ≈ 0.003856 min^-1.

Now, compute the probability for 150 minutes: P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150) → 1 - e^(-0.003856 *150).

Compute 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.

So e^(-0.5784) ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, which is about 43.9%, so approximately 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in considering the time? Because the 50 minutes have already passed, and we're looking for the next 150, so the total time would be 50 +150=200 minutes. But the calculation I did was for 150 minutes, but perhaps I should calculate for 200 minutes minus 50 minutes? No, because the memoryless property says it doesn't matter. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as starting from 50 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes.

So, the formula would be: P(decay between 50 and 200) = P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

But the conditional probability is [e^(-λ *50) (1 - e^(-λ *150)) ] / [e^(-λ *50)] ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150), which is the same as before. So regardless of the time passed, the conditional probability is the same as the probability over 150 minutes.

So yes, the calculation is correct, leading to approximately 44% which is option A.

To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the memoryless property of radioactive decay. The decay probability is modeled by the exponential law:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3856 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3856}{100} \approx 0.003856 \, \text{min}^{-1}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the same formula:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003856 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
-\lambda \cdot 150 = -0.003856 \cdot 150 \approx -0.5784
\]

\[
e^{-0.5784} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%. The memoryless property ensures that the past 50 minutes without decay do not affect this calculation. Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is:

**A) 44%**

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Or the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed? Oh, I think it's the total time from now, meaning 50 + 150 = 200 minutes from the start.

So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of when it starts. So I can ignore the past 50 minutes and just compute the probability for 150 minutes.

So λ = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. So the time from the current point is 150 minutes.

The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

But wait, wait. Because the 150 minutes is from now, but the initial condition was that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150, which is 200 minutes total. But because of the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval starting at the current time.

But wait, no. Let me clarify. The initial 100 minutes has a 32% chance. Now, we have 50 minutes passed, so the remaining time is 150.

Another approach: The decay probability in the first 100 minutes is 32%, so the decay constant λ can be found, and then we can compute the probability for 150 minutes.

Alternatively, since the process is memoryless, after 50 minutes, the remaining probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute window.

Wait, no. Let me think: the initial 100-minute probability is 32%, so the decay constant λ is such that P(100) = 0.32.

Then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150), which is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

But wait, that's not considering the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Wait, no. Because the probability that the atom hasn't decayed yet after 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50). So the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is (1 - e^(-λ *150 )) / (1 - e^(-λ *50 )).

Because, the conditional probability formula is P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B). In this case, A is decay within next 150 minutes, and B is not decaying in the first 50 minutes. But since if it decays in the next 150, it must not have decayed in the first 50. So P(A and B) is the same as P(A given B), because if it decays in the next 150, it definitely didn't decay in the first 50. Wait, that's correct.

So P(A given B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = P(A|B) = [Probability it decays between 50 and 200 minutes] / [Probability it doesn't decay in 50 minutes].

But how do we compute this? The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the probability it hasn't decayed by 50 (which is e^(-λ*50)), and then decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the probability it decays between 50 and 200 is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the probability of decaying after 50 minutes but before 200 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ *50) [1 - e^(-λ *150)].

But the conditional probability is [e^(-λ *50) (1 - e^(-λ *150)) ] / [e^(-λ *50)] ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the process is memoryless, then given that it hasn't decayed by t=50, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150 minutes starting from now. Which would mean that it's P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but that's only if the process is memoryless. So perhaps the conditional probability is just the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, regardless of the past.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me approach it differently.

The standard formula for the probability of decay in a specific time interval when the process is memoryless is that the probability of decay in a time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t).

But when we know that the atom hasn't decayed for a time t1, the probability that it decays between t1 and t1 + t2 is P(t1 + t2) - P(t1) = [1 - e^(-λ(t1 + t2))] - [1 - e^(-λ t1)] = e^(-λ t1) (1 - e^(-λ t2)).

But the conditional probability, given that it hasn't decayed by t1, is [e^(-λ t1) (1 - e^(-λ t2))] / [e^(-λ t1)] = 1 - e^(-λ t2). So it's the same as the probability of decaying in the next t2 minutes. So the memoryless property makes it so that the conditional probability is the same as the probability for the time starting from zero.

So in this problem, the t1 is 50 minutes, t2 is 150 minutes.

So the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

But wait, we can compute λ from the initial condition. We know that P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So solving for λ.

1 - 0.32 = e^(-100 λ)
0.68 = e^(-100 λ)
Take natural log: ln(0.68) = -100 λ
So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Compute ln(0.68) → I think ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856. Wait, because ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less. So maybe around -0.3856.

Let me compute it accurately. Let's approximate ln(0.68). Let's use the expansion or a calculator approach.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, I can just compute λ numerically.

So λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = (ln(1) - ln(0.68))/100 → same as (0 - (-0.3856 )) /100 → 0.3856 /100 ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

So λ ≈ 0.003856 min^-1.

Now, compute the probability for 150 minutes: P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150) → 1 - e^(-0.003856 *150).

Compute 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.

So e^(-0.5784) ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, which is about 43.9%, so approximately 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in considering the time? Because the 50 minutes have already passed, and we're looking for the next 150, so the total time would be 50 +150=200 minutes. But the calculation I did was for 150 minutes, but perhaps I should calculate for 200 minutes minus 50 minutes? No, because the memoryless property says it doesn't matter. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as starting from 50 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes.

So, the formula would be: P(decay between 50 and 200) = P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

But the conditional probability is [e^(-λ *50) (1 - e^(-λ *150)) ] / [e^(-λ *50)] ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150), which is the same as before. So regardless of the time passed, the conditional probability is the same as the probability over 150 minutes.

So yes, the calculation is correct, leading to approximately 44% which is option A.


To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the memoryless property of radioactive decay. The decay probability is modeled by the exponential law:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3856 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3856}{100} \approx 0.003856 \, \text{min}^{-1}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the same formula:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003856 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
-\lambda \cdot 150 = -0.003856 \cdot 150 \approx -0.5784
\]

\[
e^{-0.5784} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%. The memoryless property ensures that the past 50 minutes without decay do not affect this calculation. Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is:

**A) 44%**
