Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these synthesis pathways. Let me try to think it through.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm. Let me draw its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring, and on one carbon (probably the one adjacent to the ring), there's a substituent. That substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, there's a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde), so the carbon next to the ring is a formyl group. Wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Then, the carbaldehyde part is on the cyclohexane ring, so maybe the same carbon as the substituent has the aldehyde group? Or is the aldehyde on a separate carbon?

Wait, no. The structure would be cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is CH2CH(OH)Cyclohexyl? Wait, no. Let me parse the name properly. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a group attached to the main ring. So, the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)- attached to both a cyclohexyl and an -OH group. So, it's like -(CH2)Cyclohexyl-OH? Or maybe the structure is that the substituent is a CH2 group, where one of the hydrogens is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and another by a hydroxyl group. So, the structure would be something like cyclohexane with a substituent CH2-O-Cyclohexyl? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a methyl group (CH2-) where one hydrogen is attached to a cyclohexyl group and another to a hydroxyl. So, it's -CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group which also has an OH group. So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH)-Cyclohexyl? Hmm, perhaps it's -(CH2)- where one of the H's is replaced by a cyclohexyl and another by OH. So, that would make a CH with two substituents: cyclohexyl and OH, and the third bond is to the main ring. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a branch where the main ring has a CH2 group attached to it, and that CH2 is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, it's CH2(OH)(Cyclohexyl). So, the substituent is a methyl group with two substituents: one cyclohexyl and one OH. So, the molecule is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1 which is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and an -OH group, and the same carbon has an aldehyde group. Wait, no, because the aldehyde is part of the 'carbaldehyde' suffix. So the main ring is cyclohexane, and one of the carbons (let's say position 1) has a substituent which is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl and an OH, and that same carbon has a formyl group (CHO). So the structure is cyclohexane with a carbon at position 1 that's connected to both a formyl group (CHO) and a CH2 group which is connected to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So it's like:

cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl)CH2 group? No, not exactly. Let me try to write it as a formula. The main ring is cyclohexane, so C6H11-. At position 1, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to an OH and a cyclohexyl group. So, substituent is CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the substituent being a CH2 group, which is itself substituted by both cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups. So, the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-Cyclohexyl, but that's not possible either because a CH2 can't have two substituents. Oh wait, wait. The substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) where one of the H's is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and another by a hydroxyl. So, it's a CH2 group with two substituents: cyclohexyl and OH. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl). So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl)-CHO. Wait, no. Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexane, and at position 1, there's a methyl group (CH2-) which is substituted by a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH2-CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2 group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So, it's like CH2(OH)(Cyclohexyl). Wait, but that's a quaternary carbon, which may not be possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH)-Cyclohexyl, but attached where? So, the main ring has a CH2 group connected to both the OH and the cyclohexyl. So, the substituent is CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH?

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this differently. Let's think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. So, that's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. Structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

We need to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's think about the steps involved. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. Also, there's an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane ring.

So, perhaps the plan is to functionalize the ethynyl group into a hydroxyl group and a formyl group. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can do some kind of oxidation or addition to the triple bond.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, it's a cyclohexane with a triple bond attached via a CH2 group. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

What reactions can we perform on ethynyl groups?

One possible pathway is to perform a hydration. For example, using H2O and a catalyst like HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration of alkynes). But that would produce a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the conditions. Alternatively, if we have an alkyne, we can perform an addition reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond can be converted into a diol via oxymercuration or other methods, but that would add two OH groups, which might not be what we want.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a Grignard reagent. Wait, let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH. So, maybe the ethynyl group needs to be transformed into such a group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne can be converted into an aldehyde. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent, like O3 (ozone) followed by workup. Ozonolysis of an alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would produce two carbonyl groups. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is an internal alkyne. Ozonolysis of an internal alkyne would cleave it into two carbonyls. So, for example, if you have R-C≡C-R', ozonolysis would give R-O and R'-O, but that might not be the case.

Wait, actually, ozonolysis of internal alkynes typically gives diketones, I think. So, for ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CO and another CO group attached to H's. Wait, no: wait, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would cleave between the two carbons of the triple bond. So, each fragment would have a carbonyl group. So, the left side is cyclohexane-CH2-C=O, and the right side is H-C=O. But that would produce a diketone? Wait, but wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. So, ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyls, each attached to where the triple bond was. So, the left fragment is cyclohexane-CH2-C=O, and the right fragment is H-C=O (formaldehyde). So, that would give cyclohexane-CH2-CHO and formaldehyde. Wait, but that's not the target. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group.

Hmm, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 that also has an OH and the main ring's aldehyde. So, maybe the triple bond needs to be converted into an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a hydroxyl group via some addition, and then further functionalized.

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane can undergo hydroboration followed by oxidation to give an alcohol. But in the case of alkynes, the addition is a bit different.

Wait, let's think about the steps in the options.

Looking at the options, all of them have steps involving NaNH2, methyl chloride, then some other reagents. Let me think about what each step could do.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

NaNH2 is a strong base. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So, perhaps methylating something. If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, maybe the NaNH2 and CH3Cl would perform an alkylation. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. Treating with a strong base like NaNH2 might deprotonate the alkyne. Then, methyl chloride could methylate it.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, but in the presence of a good leaving group, perhaps it's an elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into a Grignard reagent. Wait, but Grignard reagents are usually made from alkyl halides or esters. The alkyne would need to be converted to an organometallic first.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a substitution. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (CH2-C≡CH). Wait, no, it's an internal alkyne because both ends are attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no, wait: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached. So, the alkyne is attached to a CH2 group, so it's an internal alkyne. So, it's CH2-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane? Wait, no, wait. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent CH2-C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

In that case, the triple bond is between C-1 and C-2 of the substituent. So, the substituent is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane.

So, if we have NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. The alkyne is acidic, so NaNH2 would deprotonate it. Then, methyl chloride could methylate the resulting acetylide.

Wait, but methyl chloride is a primary alkylating agent. So, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl. So, the product after first step would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me (methyl group).

So after step 1, we'd have cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd. So, hydrogenation over palladium would reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, the triple bond would become a single bond with two CH2 groups. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, that would be cyclohexane with a butyl group. Wait, but butyl is longer. Or is it a propyl group? Wait, the starting substituent after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane. So, the substituent becomes a propyl group? Wait, no, CH2-C≡C-CH3 is a propyne. Upon hydrogenation, it would become propane. So, the substituent becomes -CH2-CH2-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but then the next step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, typically used for elimination reactions, or in the formation of epoxides, or maybe for the oxidation of alcohols. Wait, but in this case, after step 2, the substituent is a butyl group. Then Ba(OH)2 is used. Maybe it's causing elimination. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is something else. Wait, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Hmm, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in the oxidation of alcohols, like in the Jones oxidation to ketones. But Ba(OH)2 is often used in the Birch reduction or in elimination reactions.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane ring, and a substituent which is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde comes from the oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, if we have a primary alcohol, we can oxidize it to an aldehyde. But wait, no, because oxidation of a primary alcohol typically goes all the way to a carboxylic acid unless controlled with a mild oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is formed by some kind of alkyne hydration. Hydration of an alkyne with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would form a ketone, but if the alkyne is terminal, it becomes an aldehyde. But our starting alkyne is internal, perhaps not terminal.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a benzyl-type group, which can then undergo various reactions, like epoxidation, or hydroxylation.

Wait, maybe the correct steps involve first converting the alkyne into a ketone or aldehyde, then performing some kind of addition or substitution.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C has steps involving NaNH2, methyl chloride, then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, then O3 and (CH3)2S, then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let's break it down.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride.

Assuming this is deprotonating the alkyne and then methylating to form a longer alkyne.

So, after step 1, we have ethynylcyclohexane methylated to cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, catalytic hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So, the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, cyclohexane with a propyl group attached.

Wait, but that's similar to what I thought earlier. Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozone followed by workup with a reductant like (CH3)2S (which is a mild reductant, like in reductive cleavage). Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups, but in this case, after hydrogenation, the triple bond is a single bond. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. Then, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. But ozone generally reacts with double bonds, not single bonds. So, unless there's a double bond introduced, perhaps I'm not following the steps correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the steps. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a trans double bond via some reaction.

Wait, another option is to functionalize the alkyne into a carbonyl group, which could then undergo further reactions, like aldehyde formation.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into a ketone via hydration. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4, which would add water across the triple bond to form a ketone. So, the substituent would become a ketone group. For example, cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Hydration would form CH2-C(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, because hydration of a triple bond typically forms a ketone if internal, an aldehyde if terminal. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH, which is a terminal alkyne? No, because it's attached to the cyclohexane via a CH2 group, making the triple bond internal. Wait, no, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, the alkyne is at the end, making it a terminal alkyne. Because the triple bond is between the CH2 and the CH. So, the alkyne is terminal.

In that case, hydration would produce a ketone, but wait, for a terminal alkyne, hydration usually gives an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, hydration would give R-CHO. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CHO. So, cyclohexane with a formyl group attached via a CH2.

If that's the case, then we have the aldehyde in the structure. Then, perhaps the next step is to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the target has a substituent that's a CH2 group connected to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, perhaps after getting the aldehyde, we need to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a CH2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde, we can perform a Grignard reaction. But Grignard reagents are typically added to ketones or esters, not aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde can be protected, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe a cyclopropane ring-opening or some cycloaddition.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol via oxymercuration, but that would give two OH groups, which might not be ideal.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then undergoes a reduction to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone again, but that seems circular.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves multiple steps, including epoxidation, then opening to introduce substituents.

Wait, going back to the options, perhaps option D is correct.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

Wait, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a methylating agent? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation.

But methanol is not a good electrophile for alkylation. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction condition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, NaNH2 and methanol could be for deprotonating the alkyne, forming an acetylide, which is then treated with something else.

Wait, step 2 in option D is Li and liquid NH3. That's a condition for the formation of Grignard reagents or for alkyne additions. Li in NH3 is used for the formation of alkyl lithium reagents. Alternatively, it's used for the deprotonation of alkynes to form acetylides, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a method for the synthesis of cyclopropane rings, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is ozonolysis. O3 followed by (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would cleave double bonds into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

But in this case, after step 2, what would the structure be? If step 2 involves Li and NH3, perhaps it's a method for deprotonation and alkylation. But I'm not entirely clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to make a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Let me try to think of the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Plus, the main ring has a formyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring. So, the main ring has a substituent which is a CH group with two substituents: OH and cyclohexyl, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group, and the same carbon has a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that is a CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl)-CHO group. No, that's not possible because the formyl group is CHO. So, perhaps the substituent is CH2 group connected to OH and cyclohexyl, and the main ring also has a formyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is a CH2 group connected to OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try to think of the possible reagents.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. That suggests ozonolysis followed by reductive cleavage. Ozonolysis is for breaking double bonds into carbonyls.

So, perhaps before ozonolysis, the molecule must have a double bond.

How to get a double bond from ethynylcyclohexane?

One way is to hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene. So, if the alkyne is hydrogenated, it becomes a cis or trans alkene, depending on the catalyst. Using H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's would give cis, but if it's just H2 and Pd, it would give trans.

Wait, so step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a trans double bond.

So, after step 1, we have ethynylcyclohexane methylated to CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, no. Step 1 is NaNH2, methyl chloride. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane's triple bond is acidic). Deprotonation gives the acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne. So, the product after step 1 would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, hydrogenating a triple bond to a single bond would require a lot of hydrogen, but perhaps in practice, it would hydrogenate to a cis or trans double bond. Or wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne over Pd usually stops at the cis-alkene. So, perhaps the triple bond becomes a cis double bond.

Wait, but the starting material after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond typically goes first to a cis double bond, and then to a single bond with excess hydrogen. So, if step 2 is H2 and Pd, perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation to a cis-alkene.

Wait, but in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation to cis-alkene. Then, the molecule would have a double bond.

Wait, that makes sense. So after step 2, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let me correct.

Original structure after step 1: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Hydrogenation of the triple bond under H2 and Pd would convert the triple bond into a double bond. So, it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. Wait, no. The hydrogenation would add two H's across the triple bond, converting C≡C into C-C, but with a single bond. Wait, no, that's not right. Typically, hydrogenation of a triple bond would require two equivalents of H2 to go to a single bond. So, perhaps step 2 is a full hydrogenation, adding two H's, making the triple bond into a single bond.

Wait, but the substituent is CH2-C≡C-CH3. After full hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a single bond, so no double bond. Then, how would ozonolysis work in step 3?

Hmm, perhaps I'm barking up the wrong tree.

Wait, perhaps the correct pathway involves making a diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group via NaNH2 and methyl chloride, making a longer alkyne. Then, hydrogenate that alkyne to an alkene. Then, perform ozonolysis to break the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

If that's the case, then after ozonolysis, we would have two carbonyl groups, which could be further functionalized.

Wait, let's think through this.

After step 1: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond. Wait, actually, hydrogenation of a triple bond typically goes to a single bond, but perhaps in some cases, it stops at the alkene. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is partial, giving a cis double bond.

Wait, so after step 2, we have cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH2-CH3. No, wait, the substituent would be CH2-C=CH-CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond.

Wait, maybe I need to think about what each reagent does.

Another approach: Perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a bromide. But how? Using NaNH2 and CH3Cl would give a methyl group, but perhaps that's not the path.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to perform a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule and what steps are needed to get there.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 that also has an OH group. So, perhaps this is a result of a Grignard reaction adding a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl, followed by some oxidation or reduction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration. Then, a Grignard reagent is added to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But I don't see how that would lead to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the ketone, some kind of ring-opening occurs. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the options.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but with a single bond, that doesn't make sense. Unless the molecule has a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the substituent is a single bond, but the molecule might have another double bond elsewhere. Not sure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonate the alkyne and then quench with methanol, forming an ether or something.

2. Li, liq. NH3 → maybe deprotonate again to form a lithium acetylide, then a reaction.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed from oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the cyclohexyl group is introduced via some alkylation.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → convert the alkyne into a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

3. Introduce the cyclohexyl group via some substitution.

But how?

Wait, another approach: think about the possible reagents.

In option C, step 3 is ozonolysis. So, perhaps the molecule has a double bond after step 2.

Wait, if step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis double bond, then step 3 would be ozonolysis of that double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, let's take this through.

Starting material: ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Step 1: NaNH2, CH3Cl → form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → convert triple bond to single bond → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be a single bond, so no double bond, making ozonolysis in step 3 impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. Then perhaps step 2 isn't a full hydrogenation.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation stops at the cis double bond, so after step 2, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne was originally CH2-C≡CH. Step 1: methylate to CH2-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: partial hydrogenation to CH2-C=CH2-CH3 (but that would not make sense). Alternatively, the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but without a double bond, so ozonolysis can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene. But without more structural clues, this is getting too vague.

Let me try to think about the target molecule's synthesis again.

We have ethynylcyclohexane. We need to get to a molecule where the same carbon has an aldehyde group, a cyclohexyl group, and a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps we can form a ketone from the alkyne, then perform a nucleophilic addition to introduce the cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a formyl group. Wait, if we can add water across the triple bond to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would give an aldehyde. Because the alkyne is R-C≡CH, hydration gives R-CHO. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CHO.

Then, perhaps we can perform a Grignard addition. But Grignard reagents typically add to ketones or esters. Aldehydes can react with Grignards, but the product would be a secondary alcohol. Wait, but our target has a primary alcohol and a cyclohexyl group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the aldehyde, we can perform a conjugate addition.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the desired substituent.

This is getting a bit tangled. Perhaps I should consider each option's steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/H2O.

4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would methylate the alkyne, replacing H with CH2CH3. So, substituent becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li and NH3. Maybe deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, then perhaps do an alkylation with another reagent. But no other reagent is present, so maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3 followed by H2O. So, ozonolysis of a diene or an alkyne? If step 2 converted the alkyne into a diene, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls. But I'm not sure.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, CH3Cl, then H2/Pd, then Ba(OH)2, then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

After step 1: ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form an epoxide or a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

But after step 2, the substituent is a butyl group. Not sure how Ba(OH)2 would affect that.

Hmm.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It has an aldehyde group, an OH group, and a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2.

Perhaps the aldehyde is formed by oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the cyclohexyl group is added via a coupling reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → convert to a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

3. Introduce the cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl group through some kind of alkylation or substitution.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the aldehyde, we can perform a substitution to add the cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl group to a CH2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reaction adds a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a benzyl-type position, then epoxidized, then opened to add substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me see.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, CH3Cl → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but then there's no double bond for ozonolysis.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't go to completion. Maybe it's a partial hydrogenation to a cis-alkene.

So, after step 2, substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. No, that's not possible. Wait, the triple bond becomes a double bond after one equivalent of H2. So, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the middle carbons.

Wait, after step 1, substituent is CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 and Pd → partial hydrogenation to CH2-C=CH-CH3. So, a double bond now exists between the two central carbons.

Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the double bond, breaking it into two carbonyl groups.

So, the substituent would become two carbonyl groups attached to where the double bond was.

Wait, the molecule would now have two formyl groups or ketones.

Wait, the structure after ozonolysis would be cyclohexane-CH2-C=O and O=C-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, ozonolysis of a double bond R1R2C=CR3R4 would form R1R2C=O and R3R4C=O.

So, in this case, the substituent is CH2-C=CH2-CH3. Ozonolysis would break between the two middle carbons, so the substituent would become CH2-CO and HCO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but how does that relate to the target molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis fragments are CH2-CO and CH3-CHO. So, the cyclohexane would have a formyl group, and the other fragment would be formaldehyde.

Hmm, that might not fit the target structure.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH and a formyl group on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are to form a diol via oxymercuration, then perform some kind of oxidation or substitution to introduce the aldehyde and the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

But I'm not making much progress.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct. Let me consider option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → possibly forms an acetylide, then quenched with methanol, which could lead to an ether. But I'm not sure.

2. Li, liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonate to form a lithium acetylide, then react with an electrophile. But no electrophile is given.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, after step 3 in option C, O3/(CH3)2S, ozonolysis would break a double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2, we have a double bond, then ozonolysis would create two carbonyls.

Suppose after step 2, the substituent is a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two formyl groups. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which could cause elimination or some kind of oxidation.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → methylated to longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenated to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two aldehydes.

4. Then, perform a reaction to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not certain.

After thinking about all the options, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, another approach: let's look for the presence of a formyl group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 which also has an OH group.

To get the formyl group, perhaps we need an oxidation step. To get the cyclohexyl group attached, perhaps a Grignard addition.

Wait, in option C, after ozonolysis, we might have two carbonyl groups. Then, Ba(OH)2 could perform an elimination or perhaps a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is for the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone.

Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure about the steps. Based on the options and the reagents, I'll make an educated guess.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which suggests that an oxidation step is involved. Option C includes an ozonolysis step, which is used to form carbonyl groups. So, the correct answer is likely option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. This substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and the same carbon also has a formyl group (CHO). The synthesis begins with ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-C≡CH group attached.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: This step likely deprotonates the alkyne and methylates it, forming a longer alkyne (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3).
2. **H2/Pd**: This step hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: This step could cause elimination or oxidation, but it is unclear how this would lead to the desired product.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: This is a Jones oxidation, which typically oxidizes alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. However, the intermediate after step 2 does not have an alcohol group, making this pathway unlikely to yield the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: This step methylates the alkyne, forming cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This step could deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, but no further reaction is specified.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but the intermediate after step 2 does not have a double bond.
4. **NH4OH**: This step is a workup, but it does not clarify how the target molecule is formed. This pathway does not seem to lead to the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: The alkyne is deprotonated and methylated, forming cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: The triple bond is partially hydrogenated to a cis double bond, resulting in cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH-CH3.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. This step could produce cyclohexane-CH2-C=O and CH3-C=O (formaldehyde).
4. **Ba(OH)2**: This step could introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups, leading to the target molecule. This pathway aligns with the formation of the aldehyde and the introduction of the substituent.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: The alkyne is deprotonated and possibly quenched with methanol, but the exact reaction is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This step could deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, but no further reaction is specified.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but the intermediate after step 2 does not have a double bond.
4. **NH4OH**: This step is a workup, but it does not clarify how the target molecule is formed. This pathway does not seem to lead to the desired product.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides a plausible sequence of reactions. The alkyne is methylated, partially hydrogenated to a double bond, and then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups. Subsequent steps could introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups, leading to the target molecule. 

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these synthesis pathways. Let me try to think it through.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm. Let me draw its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring, and on one carbon (probably the one adjacent to the ring), there's a substituent. That substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, there's a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde), so the carbon next to the ring is a formyl group. Wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Then, the carbaldehyde part is on the cyclohexane ring, so maybe the same carbon as the substituent has the aldehyde group? Or is the aldehyde on a separate carbon?

Wait, no. The structure would be cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is CH2CH(OH)Cyclohexyl? Wait, no. Let me parse the name properly. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a group attached to the main ring. So, the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)- attached to both a cyclohexyl and an -OH group. So, it's like -(CH2)Cyclohexyl-OH? Or maybe the structure is that the substituent is a CH2 group, where one of the hydrogens is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and another by a hydroxyl group. So, the structure would be something like cyclohexane with a substituent CH2-O-Cyclohexyl? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a methyl group (CH2-) where one hydrogen is attached to a cyclohexyl group and another to a hydroxyl. So, it's -CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group which also has an OH group. So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH)-Cyclohexyl? Hmm, perhaps it's -(CH2)- where one of the H's is replaced by a cyclohexyl and another by OH. So, that would make a CH with two substituents: cyclohexyl and OH, and the third bond is to the main ring. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a branch where the main ring has a CH2 group attached to it, and that CH2 is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, it's CH2(OH)(Cyclohexyl). So, the substituent is a methyl group with two substituents: one cyclohexyl and one OH. So, the molecule is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1 which is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and an -OH group, and the same carbon has an aldehyde group. Wait, no, because the aldehyde is part of the 'carbaldehyde' suffix. So the main ring is cyclohexane, and one of the carbons (let's say position 1) has a substituent which is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl and an OH, and that same carbon has a formyl group (CHO). So the structure is cyclohexane with a carbon at position 1 that's connected to both a formyl group (CHO) and a CH2 group which is connected to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So it's like:

cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl)CH2 group? No, not exactly. Let me try to write it as a formula. The main ring is cyclohexane, so C6H11-. At position 1, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to an OH and a cyclohexyl group. So, substituent is CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the substituent being a CH2 group, which is itself substituted by both cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups. So, the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-Cyclohexyl, but that's not possible either because a CH2 can't have two substituents. Oh wait, wait. The substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) where one of the H's is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and another by a hydroxyl. So, it's a CH2 group with two substituents: cyclohexyl and OH. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl). So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl)-CHO. Wait, no. Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexane, and at position 1, there's a methyl group (CH2-) which is substituted by a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH2-CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2 group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So, it's like CH2(OH)(Cyclohexyl). Wait, but that's a quaternary carbon, which may not be possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH)-Cyclohexyl, but attached where? So, the main ring has a CH2 group connected to both the OH and the cyclohexyl. So, the substituent is CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH?

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this differently. Let's think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. So, that's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. Structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

We need to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's think about the steps involved. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. Also, there's an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane ring.

So, perhaps the plan is to functionalize the ethynyl group into a hydroxyl group and a formyl group. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can do some kind of oxidation or addition to the triple bond.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, it's a cyclohexane with a triple bond attached via a CH2 group. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

What reactions can we perform on ethynyl groups?

One possible pathway is to perform a hydration. For example, using H2O and a catalyst like HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration of alkynes). But that would produce a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the conditions. Alternatively, if we have an alkyne, we can perform an addition reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond can be converted into a diol via oxymercuration or other methods, but that would add two OH groups, which might not be what we want.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a Grignard reagent. Wait, let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH. So, maybe the ethynyl group needs to be transformed into such a group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne can be converted into an aldehyde. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent, like O3 (ozone) followed by workup. Ozonolysis of an alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would produce two carbonyl groups. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is an internal alkyne. Ozonolysis of an internal alkyne would cleave it into two carbonyls. So, for example, if you have R-C≡C-R', ozonolysis would give R-O and R'-O, but that might not be the case.

Wait, actually, ozonolysis of internal alkynes typically gives diketones, I think. So, for ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CO and another CO group attached to H's. Wait, no: wait, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would cleave between the two carbons of the triple bond. So, each fragment would have a carbonyl group. So, the left side is cyclohexane-CH2-C=O, and the right side is H-C=O. But that would produce a diketone? Wait, but wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. So, ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyls, each attached to where the triple bond was. So, the left fragment is cyclohexane-CH2-C=O, and the right fragment is H-C=O (formaldehyde). So, that would give cyclohexane-CH2-CHO and formaldehyde. Wait, but that's not the target. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group.

Hmm, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 that also has an OH and the main ring's aldehyde. So, maybe the triple bond needs to be converted into an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a hydroxyl group via some addition, and then further functionalized.

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane can undergo hydroboration followed by oxidation to give an alcohol. But in the case of alkynes, the addition is a bit different.

Wait, let's think about the steps in the options.

Looking at the options, all of them have steps involving NaNH2, methyl chloride, then some other reagents. Let me think about what each step could do.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

NaNH2 is a strong base. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So, perhaps methylating something. If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, maybe the NaNH2 and CH3Cl would perform an alkylation. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. Treating with a strong base like NaNH2 might deprotonate the alkyne. Then, methyl chloride could methylate it.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, but in the presence of a good leaving group, perhaps it's an elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into a Grignard reagent. Wait, but Grignard reagents are usually made from alkyl halides or esters. The alkyne would need to be converted to an organometallic first.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a substitution. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (CH2-C≡CH). Wait, no, it's an internal alkyne because both ends are attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no, wait: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached. So, the alkyne is attached to a CH2 group, so it's an internal alkyne. So, it's CH2-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane? Wait, no, wait. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent CH2-C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

In that case, the triple bond is between C-1 and C-2 of the substituent. So, the substituent is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane.

So, if we have NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. The alkyne is acidic, so NaNH2 would deprotonate it. Then, methyl chloride could methylate the resulting acetylide.

Wait, but methyl chloride is a primary alkylating agent. So, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl. So, the product after first step would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me (methyl group).

So after step 1, we'd have cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd. So, hydrogenation over palladium would reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, the triple bond would become a single bond with two CH2 groups. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, that would be cyclohexane with a butyl group. Wait, but butyl is longer. Or is it a propyl group? Wait, the starting substituent after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane. So, the substituent becomes a propyl group? Wait, no, CH2-C≡C-CH3 is a propyne. Upon hydrogenation, it would become propane. So, the substituent becomes -CH2-CH2-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but then the next step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, typically used for elimination reactions, or in the formation of epoxides, or maybe for the oxidation of alcohols. Wait, but in this case, after step 2, the substituent is a butyl group. Then Ba(OH)2 is used. Maybe it's causing elimination. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is something else. Wait, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Hmm, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in the oxidation of alcohols, like in the Jones oxidation to ketones. But Ba(OH)2 is often used in the Birch reduction or in elimination reactions.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane ring, and a substituent which is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde comes from the oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, if we have a primary alcohol, we can oxidize it to an aldehyde. But wait, no, because oxidation of a primary alcohol typically goes all the way to a carboxylic acid unless controlled with a mild oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is formed by some kind of alkyne hydration. Hydration of an alkyne with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would form a ketone, but if the alkyne is terminal, it becomes an aldehyde. But our starting alkyne is internal, perhaps not terminal.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a benzyl-type group, which can then undergo various reactions, like epoxidation, or hydroxylation.

Wait, maybe the correct steps involve first converting the alkyne into a ketone or aldehyde, then performing some kind of addition or substitution.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C has steps involving NaNH2, methyl chloride, then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, then O3 and (CH3)2S, then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let's break it down.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride.

Assuming this is deprotonating the alkyne and then methylating to form a longer alkyne.

So, after step 1, we have ethynylcyclohexane methylated to cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, catalytic hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So, the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, cyclohexane with a propyl group attached.

Wait, but that's similar to what I thought earlier. Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozone followed by workup with a reductant like (CH3)2S (which is a mild reductant, like in reductive cleavage). Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups, but in this case, after hydrogenation, the triple bond is a single bond. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. Then, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. But ozone generally reacts with double bonds, not single bonds. So, unless there's a double bond introduced, perhaps I'm not following the steps correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the steps. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a trans double bond via some reaction.

Wait, another option is to functionalize the alkyne into a carbonyl group, which could then undergo further reactions, like aldehyde formation.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into a ketone via hydration. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4, which would add water across the triple bond to form a ketone. So, the substituent would become a ketone group. For example, cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Hydration would form CH2-C(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, because hydration of a triple bond typically forms a ketone if internal, an aldehyde if terminal. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH, which is a terminal alkyne? No, because it's attached to the cyclohexane via a CH2 group, making the triple bond internal. Wait, no, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, the alkyne is at the end, making it a terminal alkyne. Because the triple bond is between the CH2 and the CH. So, the alkyne is terminal.

In that case, hydration would produce a ketone, but wait, for a terminal alkyne, hydration usually gives an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, hydration would give R-CHO. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CHO. So, cyclohexane with a formyl group attached via a CH2.

If that's the case, then we have the aldehyde in the structure. Then, perhaps the next step is to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the target has a substituent that's a CH2 group connected to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, perhaps after getting the aldehyde, we need to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a CH2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde, we can perform a Grignard reaction. But Grignard reagents are typically added to ketones or esters, not aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde can be protected, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe a cyclopropane ring-opening or some cycloaddition.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol via oxymercuration, but that would give two OH groups, which might not be ideal.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then undergoes a reduction to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone again, but that seems circular.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves multiple steps, including epoxidation, then opening to introduce substituents.

Wait, going back to the options, perhaps option D is correct.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

Wait, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a methylating agent? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation.

But methanol is not a good electrophile for alkylation. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction condition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, NaNH2 and methanol could be for deprotonating the alkyne, forming an acetylide, which is then treated with something else.

Wait, step 2 in option D is Li and liquid NH3. That's a condition for the formation of Grignard reagents or for alkyne additions. Li in NH3 is used for the formation of alkyl lithium reagents. Alternatively, it's used for the deprotonation of alkynes to form acetylides, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a method for the synthesis of cyclopropane rings, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is ozonolysis. O3 followed by (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would cleave double bonds into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

But in this case, after step 2, what would the structure be? If step 2 involves Li and NH3, perhaps it's a method for deprotonation and alkylation. But I'm not entirely clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to make a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Let me try to think of the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Plus, the main ring has a formyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring. So, the main ring has a substituent which is a CH group with two substituents: OH and cyclohexyl, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group, and the same carbon has a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that is a CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl)-CHO group. No, that's not possible because the formyl group is CHO. So, perhaps the substituent is CH2 group connected to OH and cyclohexyl, and the main ring also has a formyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is a CH2 group connected to OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try to think of the possible reagents.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. That suggests ozonolysis followed by reductive cleavage. Ozonolysis is for breaking double bonds into carbonyls.

So, perhaps before ozonolysis, the molecule must have a double bond.

How to get a double bond from ethynylcyclohexane?

One way is to hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene. So, if the alkyne is hydrogenated, it becomes a cis or trans alkene, depending on the catalyst. Using H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's would give cis, but if it's just H2 and Pd, it would give trans.

Wait, so step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a trans double bond.

So, after step 1, we have ethynylcyclohexane methylated to CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, no. Step 1 is NaNH2, methyl chloride. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane's triple bond is acidic). Deprotonation gives the acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne. So, the product after step 1 would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, hydrogenating a triple bond to a single bond would require a lot of hydrogen, but perhaps in practice, it would hydrogenate to a cis or trans double bond. Or wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne over Pd usually stops at the cis-alkene. So, perhaps the triple bond becomes a cis double bond.

Wait, but the starting material after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond typically goes first to a cis double bond, and then to a single bond with excess hydrogen. So, if step 2 is H2 and Pd, perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation to a cis-alkene.

Wait, but in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation to cis-alkene. Then, the molecule would have a double bond.

Wait, that makes sense. So after step 2, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let me correct.

Original structure after step 1: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Hydrogenation of the triple bond under H2 and Pd would convert the triple bond into a double bond. So, it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. Wait, no. The hydrogenation would add two H's across the triple bond, converting C≡C into C-C, but with a single bond. Wait, no, that's not right. Typically, hydrogenation of a triple bond would require two equivalents of H2 to go to a single bond. So, perhaps step 2 is a full hydrogenation, adding two H's, making the triple bond into a single bond.

Wait, but the substituent is CH2-C≡C-CH3. After full hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a single bond, so no double bond. Then, how would ozonolysis work in step 3?

Hmm, perhaps I'm barking up the wrong tree.

Wait, perhaps the correct pathway involves making a diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group via NaNH2 and methyl chloride, making a longer alkyne. Then, hydrogenate that alkyne to an alkene. Then, perform ozonolysis to break the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

If that's the case, then after ozonolysis, we would have two carbonyl groups, which could be further functionalized.

Wait, let's think through this.

After step 1: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond. Wait, actually, hydrogenation of a triple bond typically goes to a single bond, but perhaps in some cases, it stops at the alkene. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is partial, giving a cis double bond.

Wait, so after step 2, we have cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH2-CH3. No, wait, the substituent would be CH2-C=CH-CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond.

Wait, maybe I need to think about what each reagent does.

Another approach: Perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a bromide. But how? Using NaNH2 and CH3Cl would give a methyl group, but perhaps that's not the path.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to perform a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule and what steps are needed to get there.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 that also has an OH group. So, perhaps this is a result of a Grignard reaction adding a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl, followed by some oxidation or reduction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration. Then, a Grignard reagent is added to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But I don't see how that would lead to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the ketone, some kind of ring-opening occurs. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the options.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but with a single bond, that doesn't make sense. Unless the molecule has a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the substituent is a single bond, but the molecule might have another double bond elsewhere. Not sure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonate the alkyne and then quench with methanol, forming an ether or something.

2. Li, liq. NH3 → maybe deprotonate again to form a lithium acetylide, then a reaction.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed from oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the cyclohexyl group is introduced via some alkylation.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → convert the alkyne into a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

3. Introduce the cyclohexyl group via some substitution.

But how?

Wait, another approach: think about the possible reagents.

In option C, step 3 is ozonolysis. So, perhaps the molecule has a double bond after step 2.

Wait, if step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis double bond, then step 3 would be ozonolysis of that double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, let's take this through.

Starting material: ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Step 1: NaNH2, CH3Cl → form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → convert triple bond to single bond → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be a single bond, so no double bond, making ozonolysis in step 3 impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. Then perhaps step 2 isn't a full hydrogenation.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation stops at the cis double bond, so after step 2, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne was originally CH2-C≡CH. Step 1: methylate to CH2-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: partial hydrogenation to CH2-C=CH2-CH3 (but that would not make sense). Alternatively, the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but without a double bond, so ozonolysis can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene. But without more structural clues, this is getting too vague.

Let me try to think about the target molecule's synthesis again.

We have ethynylcyclohexane. We need to get to a molecule where the same carbon has an aldehyde group, a cyclohexyl group, and a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps we can form a ketone from the alkyne, then perform a nucleophilic addition to introduce the cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a formyl group. Wait, if we can add water across the triple bond to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would give an aldehyde. Because the alkyne is R-C≡CH, hydration gives R-CHO. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CHO.

Then, perhaps we can perform a Grignard addition. But Grignard reagents typically add to ketones or esters. Aldehydes can react with Grignards, but the product would be a secondary alcohol. Wait, but our target has a primary alcohol and a cyclohexyl group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the aldehyde, we can perform a conjugate addition.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the desired substituent.

This is getting a bit tangled. Perhaps I should consider each option's steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/H2O.

4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would methylate the alkyne, replacing H with CH2CH3. So, substituent becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li and NH3. Maybe deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, then perhaps do an alkylation with another reagent. But no other reagent is present, so maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3 followed by H2O. So, ozonolysis of a diene or an alkyne? If step 2 converted the alkyne into a diene, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls. But I'm not sure.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, CH3Cl, then H2/Pd, then Ba(OH)2, then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

After step 1: ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form an epoxide or a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

But after step 2, the substituent is a butyl group. Not sure how Ba(OH)2 would affect that.

Hmm.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It has an aldehyde group, an OH group, and a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2.

Perhaps the aldehyde is formed by oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the cyclohexyl group is added via a coupling reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → convert to a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

3. Introduce the cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl group through some kind of alkylation or substitution.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the aldehyde, we can perform a substitution to add the cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl group to a CH2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reaction adds a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a benzyl-type position, then epoxidized, then opened to add substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me see.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, CH3Cl → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but then there's no double bond for ozonolysis.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't go to completion. Maybe it's a partial hydrogenation to a cis-alkene.

So, after step 2, substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. No, that's not possible. Wait, the triple bond becomes a double bond after one equivalent of H2. So, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the middle carbons.

Wait, after step 1, substituent is CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 and Pd → partial hydrogenation to CH2-C=CH-CH3. So, a double bond now exists between the two central carbons.

Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the double bond, breaking it into two carbonyl groups.

So, the substituent would become two carbonyl groups attached to where the double bond was.

Wait, the molecule would now have two formyl groups or ketones.

Wait, the structure after ozonolysis would be cyclohexane-CH2-C=O and O=C-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, ozonolysis of a double bond R1R2C=CR3R4 would form R1R2C=O and R3R4C=O.

So, in this case, the substituent is CH2-C=CH2-CH3. Ozonolysis would break between the two middle carbons, so the substituent would become CH2-CO and HCO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but how does that relate to the target molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis fragments are CH2-CO and CH3-CHO. So, the cyclohexane would have a formyl group, and the other fragment would be formaldehyde.

Hmm, that might not fit the target structure.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH and a formyl group on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are to form a diol via oxymercuration, then perform some kind of oxidation or substitution to introduce the aldehyde and the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

But I'm not making much progress.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct. Let me consider option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → possibly forms an acetylide, then quenched with methanol, which could lead to an ether. But I'm not sure.

2. Li, liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonate to form a lithium acetylide, then react with an electrophile. But no electrophile is given.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, after step 3 in option C, O3/(CH3)2S, ozonolysis would break a double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2, we have a double bond, then ozonolysis would create two carbonyls.

Suppose after step 2, the substituent is a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two formyl groups. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which could cause elimination or some kind of oxidation.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → methylated to longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenated to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two aldehydes.

4. Then, perform a reaction to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not certain.

After thinking about all the options, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, another approach: let's look for the presence of a formyl group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 which also has an OH group.

To get the formyl group, perhaps we need an oxidation step. To get the cyclohexyl group attached, perhaps a Grignard addition.

Wait, in option C, after ozonolysis, we might have two carbonyl groups. Then, Ba(OH)2 could perform an elimination or perhaps a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is for the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone.

Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure about the steps. Based on the options and the reagents, I'll make an educated guess.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which suggests that an oxidation step is involved. Option C includes an ozonolysis step, which is used to form carbonyl groups. So, the correct answer is likely option C.


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. This substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and the same carbon also has a formyl group (CHO). The synthesis begins with ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-C≡CH group attached.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: This step likely deprotonates the alkyne and methylates it, forming a longer alkyne (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3).
2. **H2/Pd**: This step hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: This step could cause elimination or oxidation, but it is unclear how this would lead to the desired product.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: This is a Jones oxidation, which typically oxidizes alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. However, the intermediate after step 2 does not have an alcohol group, making this pathway unlikely to yield the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: This step methylates the alkyne, forming cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This step could deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, but no further reaction is specified.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but the intermediate after step 2 does not have a double bond.
4. **NH4OH**: This step is a workup, but it does not clarify how the target molecule is formed. This pathway does not seem to lead to the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: The alkyne is deprotonated and methylated, forming cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: The triple bond is partially hydrogenated to a cis double bond, resulting in cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH-CH3.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. This step could produce cyclohexane-CH2-C=O and CH3-C=O (formaldehyde).
4. **Ba(OH)2**: This step could introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups, leading to the target molecule. This pathway aligns with the formation of the aldehyde and the introduction of the substituent.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: The alkyne is deprotonated and possibly quenched with methanol, but the exact reaction is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This step could deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, but no further reaction is specified.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but the intermediate after step 2 does not have a double bond.
4. **NH4OH**: This step is a workup, but it does not clarify how the target molecule is formed. This pathway does not seem to lead to the desired product.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides a plausible sequence of reactions. The alkyne is methylated, partially hydrogenated to a double bond, and then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups. Subsequent steps could introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups, leading to the target molecule.
