Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a spin-half particle in a specific state. Hmm.

Alright, the state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. And the operator is 10σz +5σx. I remember that expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that operator many times on identically prepared systems. So the expectation value of an operator O for a state |ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

Wait, but σz and σx are the Pauli matrices, right? So their expectation values can be found separately and then combined. Oh right, because expectation values are linear. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Okay, so I just need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for this state.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since σz is the spin-z operator, and the state is a superposition of its eigenstates. The eigenstates of σz are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are given here. So for the state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σz is |a|^2 - |b|^2 because σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. 

Let me compute that. The coefficients are a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4, which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Because for σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the expectation value is (a)^2 * (+1) + (b)^2 * (-1). So that would be (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that again.

(0.5)^2 is 0.25, so that's 0.25 * 1 = 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75. So adding them: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. That makes sense.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which doesn't share the same eigenstates as σz. So I can't just compute it directly from the coefficients because the state isn't an eigenstate of σx. So I need to compute it using the matrix representation.

Wait, let me think. The state ψ is a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], right? Because |↑⟩ is [1, 0] and |↓⟩ is [0,1]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to find ⟨σx⟩, I need to compute ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, since expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

So let me write that out. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, let me compute that. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it as the sum. σx has elements (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0. So when I multiply σx with |ψ⟩, I swap the components and possibly add a sign? Wait, let me compute σx |ψ⟩.

σx |ψ⟩ = [0 1; 1 0 ] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, the inner product with ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] · [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. So that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Wait, 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4. Same for the other term. So together, it's (sqrt(3)/4) *2 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that.

Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is (ψ† σx ψ) = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Which is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = [ 0.5 * 0.866 ] + [ 0.866 * 0.5 ] ≈ 0.433 + 0.433 ≈ 0.866.

Which is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but how does that compare to the state's properties? Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for expectation value of σx in a spin-1/2 state. Oh, right! For a spin-1/2 state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(a*b^* + a^* b) / (|a|^2 + |b|^2), but wait, no, maybe not. Wait, let me think.

Wait, σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|). So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is (a* ⟨↓| + b* ⟨↑|) (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩).

Expanding this, you get a* a ⟨↓|↑⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↑|↑⟩ + b* b ⟨↑|↓⟩.

But ⟨↓|↑⟩ and ⟨↑|↓⟩ are zero. So only the second and third terms remain.

So it becomes a* b ⟨↓|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↑|↑⟩.

⟨↓|↓⟩ is 1, and ⟨↑|↑⟩ is also 1. So this becomes (a* b + b* a) = 2 Re(a* b).

Because a and b are real numbers here (because the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, which are real), so Re(a* b) = a b. So ⟨σx⟩ = 2 a b.

So in this case, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5 * 0.866) = 2 * 0.433 = 0.866.

So that's the same as before. So that's correct.

So putting it all together, the expectation value of σz is -0.5, and σx's expectation is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Now the operator in question is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866).

Calculating each term: 10*(-0.5) is -5. 5*(0.866) is approximately 4.33.

So sum is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait. Let's be precise with the numbers. Because sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is 0.8660.

So 5 * 0.8660 = 4.3300.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5.0.

Adding: -5 +4.3300 = -0.6700.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.67. Wait, but the options are given to one decimal place.

So -0.67 rounds to -0.7. Oh, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, another approach: let's compute each part again.

Compute 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Compute 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 *0.8660 ≈4.33.

Total: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

So -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So yes, option C is -0.7. So the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute \( \langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) are \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. For the state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot (+1) + |b|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]
Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Thus:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Substituting:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) does not share the same eigenstates as \( \sigma_z \). For a general state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab,
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are real coefficients. Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total expectation value
The operator is \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \), so the expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to one decimal place
The expectation value \( -0.67 \) rounds to \( -0.7 \) when expressed to one decimal place.

### Final Answer
Comparing with the options:
- A) \( -1.4 \)
- B) \( 1.65 \)
- C) \( -0.7 \)
- D) \( 0.85 \)

The correct answer is **C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a spin-half particle in a specific state. Hmm.

Alright, the state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. And the operator is 10σz +5σx. I remember that expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that operator many times on identically prepared systems. So the expectation value of an operator O for a state |ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

Wait, but σz and σx are the Pauli matrices, right? So their expectation values can be found separately and then combined. Oh right, because expectation values are linear. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Okay, so I just need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for this state.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since σz is the spin-z operator, and the state is a superposition of its eigenstates. The eigenstates of σz are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are given here. So for the state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σz is |a|^2 - |b|^2 because σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. 

Let me compute that. The coefficients are a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4, which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Because for σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the expectation value is (a)^2 * (+1) + (b)^2 * (-1). So that would be (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that again.

(0.5)^2 is 0.25, so that's 0.25 * 1 = 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75. So adding them: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. That makes sense.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which doesn't share the same eigenstates as σz. So I can't just compute it directly from the coefficients because the state isn't an eigenstate of σx. So I need to compute it using the matrix representation.

Wait, let me think. The state ψ is a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], right? Because |↑⟩ is [1, 0] and |↓⟩ is [0,1]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to find ⟨σx⟩, I need to compute ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, since expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

So let me write that out. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, let me compute that. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it as the sum. σx has elements (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0. So when I multiply σx with |ψ⟩, I swap the components and possibly add a sign? Wait, let me compute σx |ψ⟩.

σx |ψ⟩ = [0 1; 1 0 ] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, the inner product with ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] · [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. So that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Wait, 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4. Same for the other term. So together, it's (sqrt(3)/4) *2 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that.

Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is (ψ† σx ψ) = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Which is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = [ 0.5 * 0.866 ] + [ 0.866 * 0.5 ] ≈ 0.433 + 0.433 ≈ 0.866.

Which is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but how does that compare to the state's properties? Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for expectation value of σx in a spin-1/2 state. Oh, right! For a spin-1/2 state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(a*b^* + a^* b) / (|a|^2 + |b|^2), but wait, no, maybe not. Wait, let me think.

Wait, σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|). So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is (a* ⟨↓| + b* ⟨↑|) (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩).

Expanding this, you get a* a ⟨↓|↑⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↑|↑⟩ + b* b ⟨↑|↓⟩.

But ⟨↓|↑⟩ and ⟨↑|↓⟩ are zero. So only the second and third terms remain.

So it becomes a* b ⟨↓|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↑|↑⟩.

⟨↓|↓⟩ is 1, and ⟨↑|↑⟩ is also 1. So this becomes (a* b + b* a) = 2 Re(a* b).

Because a and b are real numbers here (because the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, which are real), so Re(a* b) = a b. So ⟨σx⟩ = 2 a b.

So in this case, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5 * 0.866) = 2 * 0.433 = 0.866.

So that's the same as before. So that's correct.

So putting it all together, the expectation value of σz is -0.5, and σx's expectation is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Now the operator in question is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866).

Calculating each term: 10*(-0.5) is -5. 5*(0.866) is approximately 4.33.

So sum is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait. Let's be precise with the numbers. Because sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is 0.8660.

So 5 * 0.8660 = 4.3300.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5.0.

Adding: -5 +4.3300 = -0.6700.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.67. Wait, but the options are given to one decimal place.

So -0.67 rounds to -0.7. Oh, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, another approach: let's compute each part again.

Compute 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Compute 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 *0.8660 ≈4.33.

Total: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

So -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So yes, option C is -0.7. So the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute \( \langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) are \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. For the state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot (+1) + |b|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]
Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Thus:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Substituting:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) does not share the same eigenstates as \( \sigma_z \). For a general state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab,
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are real coefficients. Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total expectation value
The operator is \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \), so the expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to one decimal place
The expectation value \( -0.67 \) rounds to \( -0.7 \) when expressed to one decimal place.

### Final Answer
Comparing with the options:
- A) \( -1.4 \)
- B) \( 1.65 \)
- C) \( -0.7 \)
- D) \( 0.85 \)

The correct answer is **C**.
