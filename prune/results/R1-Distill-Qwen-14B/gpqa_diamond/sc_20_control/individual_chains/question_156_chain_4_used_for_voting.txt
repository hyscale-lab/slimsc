Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about reactions involving mCPBA and their products. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is used in epoxidation reactions. So, when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides.

The question mentions two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

I need to figure out how many peaks each HPLC will show. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the epoxidation. mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product. For each starting alkene (E and Z), the epoxidation would form an epoxide.

Wait, no, actually, I think mCPBA adds the epoxide in a stereospecific manner. So for each starting alkene, the epoxidation leads to a specific diastereomer. Because the starting alkenes are E and Z, their epoxidation would form different epoxides.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes forms an epoxide, and the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation would form a trans epoxide? Or maybe the same as the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, no, I might be getting this wrong. When mCPBA epoxidizes an alkene, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene because mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds to the same face. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is on carbons 4 and 5, and the substituents on either end are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, the two oxygen atoms are added across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene.

Wait, but wait. Let's picture the structure. (E)-oct-4-ene would have two CH2CH2 groups on either end of the double bond, with the substituents (the CH2CH3 groups) on opposite sides. So, when mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds are on the same face. So, the epoxide ring would have the substituents on adjacent carbons in a certain configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the actual product. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are added to the same face of the double bond. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which has the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond (trans), the epoxide that forms would have the substituents on the same side of the epoxide ring. Because the starting structure is trans, the epoxide's substituents end up cis in the epoxide.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the starting alkene is (E)-configuration. So, the substituents (like the CH2- groups on each end of the double bond) are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to each carbon from the same face. So for (E), the two substituents (like CH2CH2CH2CH3 groups on each end) would be on opposite faces of the double bond. When the oxygen adds to each carbon on the same face, the resulting epoxide would have those substituents on the same face, leading to a cis arrangement in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. The double bond is between C4 and C5. For (E), the groups on C4 and C5 (say, CH2CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3) are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, O comes from the same face, so each O adds to adjacent carbons. So, the epoxide that forms would have substituents on the same side. So, the epoxide would be trans or cis?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the actual product. The product of epoxidation with (E)-oct-4-ene would be cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. Because the mCPBA adds the oxygen atoms on the same face of the double bond, so the two substituents (the adjacent groups) on each carbon of the double bond end up on the same face, making a cis epoxide.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the starting alkene has substituents on the same side. So, when mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds on the same face, leading to the same arrangement as the starting material. Wait no, maybe not. Wait, the (Z)-oct-4-ene has substituents on the same side of the double bond. When epoxidized, the oxygen atoms add to the same face, so the substituents on each carbon would end up on the same face as each other, making a cis epoxide as well. Wait, but that can't be. Because I thought that mCPBA forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So, for (E) and (Z), the epoxides would be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the actual products.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA â†’ forms an epoxide. Because mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition (since it's an peracid), the two oxygen atoms add to the same face. So, for (E)-ene, which has the substituents on opposite sides, the resulting epoxide would have substituents on the same side, making it a cis epoxide.

Wait, but the starting alkene is E, which is trans. So the substituents on each end of the double bond are trans. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to each carbon from the same face. So, the substituents (the CH2 groups) that were trans would end up on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. So the product is cis-4,5-epoxyoctane.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA. The starting alkene is Z, so substituents are on the same face. When mCPBA adds, the same syn addition happens, so the substituents end up on the same face, leading again to a cis epoxide. Wait, but that would be the same product as in reaction 1. That can't be right, because the starting alkenes are E and Z, leading to different epoxides.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct this. The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene would yield a trans epoxide, and the epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene would yield a cis epoxide. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific structures. Let's take (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3, where the double bond is between C4 and C5. The (E) configuration means that the two higher priority groups (maybe the two CH2CH3 groups on each end) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

When mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition, the oxygen atoms add to the same face. So, in the case of (E)-ene, the substituents on each end (the CH2CH3 groups) are on opposite sides. When the O adds to each carbon from the same face, the substituents on each carbon would end up on the same face, making the epoxide's substituents cis. So, the epoxide would be cis.

Wait, but that would imply that both (E) and (Z) starting alkenes would form the same epoxide. But that's not possible because (E) and (Z) are different.

Ah, maybe the issue is that I'm mixing up the starting configuration and the resulting epoxide's configuration. Let me try a different approach.

When an alkene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. That is, the configuration of the starting alkene is preserved in the epoxide. So, (E)-ene would form an (E)-epoxide, and (Z)-ene would form a (Z)-epoxide. But wait, in an epoxide, the substituents are on adjacent carbons, so perhaps the terms are used differently.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide's configuration depends on the starting alkene's configuration. So, (E) and (Z) starting alkenes would produce different epoxides, which may themselves be chiral.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric. Let me think about the actual structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, octene is eight carbons. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, oct-4-ene has eight carbons, with a double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Let me write it as CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps I should think of it as CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused, but the exact structure isn't critical right now.

But when mCPBA epoxidizes the alkene, the reaction is stereospecific. So, for each starting alkene, the configuration of the substituents in the epoxide will depend on whether the starting alkene was E or Z.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that the two starting alkenes (E and Z) each form an epoxide that is a diastereomer. Moreover, since the starting alkenes are different, their epoxides are different.

After epoxidation, the mixture is treated with aqueous acid. I think that step is for opening the epoxide, perhaps via acid-catalyzed ring-opening.

Wait, when an epoxide is treated with acid, it undergoes ring-opening. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon (in a more substituted epoxide, but I might be mixing things up).

Wait, but in this case, the epoxide is symmetric. Let me think: oct-4-ene, after epoxidation, becomes a five-membered ring epoxide. The epoxide is between C4 and C5, so the structure is (CH2)3-CH-O-CH-(CH2)3.

Wait, no, the structure would be (CH2)3-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-(CH2)3? No, perhaps something else. Anyway, the key point is that the epoxide is symmetric. So when it's treated with acid, it would open in a certain way.

Wait, but the epoxide's structure from (E)-ene and (Z)-ene might be different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-ene is a trans epoxide, and from (Z)-ene is a cis epoxide. And when each is treated with acid, they would open to form different products.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each reaction's product.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxidized â†’ (cis or trans epoxide) â†’ acid treatment â†’ product.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxidized â†’ (different epoxide) â†’ acid treatment â†’ product.

Then, the products from both reactions are combined.

Wait, but when you treat an epoxide with acid, it typically opens via a ring-opening reaction. The ring opening can lead to different products based on the structure of the epoxide.

Wait, but for a symmetric epoxide, like when the substituents on each side are the same, the ring-opening under acid conditions would lead to the same product regardless of the epoxide's configuration. Because in a symmetric epoxide, both sides are the same, so the ring opens to form the same diol.

Wait, wait, maybe not. If the epoxide is symmetric, like both sides are the same, the ring-opening would lead to the same product, but if the epoxide is asymmetric, it would form different products.

Wait, but in our case, the epoxides from (E) and (Z) are symmetric or not?

Wait, let's think about (E)-oct-4-ene. The double bond is between C4 and C5. The groups on each end of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3 (I think I'm getting the substituents wrong; maybe both ends are similar, making the epoxide symmetric).

Wait, oct-4-ene would have the structure CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's not right. Let me correct this: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not possible because that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH-CH-CH2CH3, but that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5, making it CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, maybe I'm not getting the structure correctly, but perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. Anyway, the epoxide formed would have the same substituents on each end, so the epoxide would be symmetric.

If the epoxide is symmetric, then treating it with acid would lead to the same product regardless of the starting configuration. Wait, but that can't be because (E) and (Z) would form different epoxides, but maybe they are both symmetric.

Wait, no. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form with substituents on the same face (cis), resulting in a trans epoxide because the substituents on each carbon are on opposite faces. Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the resulting epoxide is trans, and when (Z) is epoxidized, the epoxide is cis. Then, when each is opened under acidic conditions, they form different diols.

Wait, but wait. The acid treatment of an epoxide typically leads to the formation of a diol. For a trans-epoxide, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (trans), and for a cis-epoxide, the diol would have them on the same side (cis). But in reality, the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's structure and the mechanism of ring-opening.

Wait, but when the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed would be a meso compound. For example, if the epoxide is trans and symmetric, the diol formed upon acid-catalyzed ring-opening would have two hydroxyl groups on opposite sides but due to the symmetry, the molecule would be achiral (meso).

Similarly, if the epoxide is cis and symmetric, the diol would have both hydroxyl groups on the same side, again leading to a meso compound if the structure is symmetric.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, regardless of whether it's cis or trans, the diol formed would be a meso compound. Because the structure would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about it. Suppose the epoxide is cis. So, the two substituents (like the CH2 groups) are on the same face. When ring-opening occurs, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. But in a symmetric epoxide, both carbons are equally substituted, so the attack can happen on either carbon with equal probability.

Wait, but in a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening under acid conditions would lead to the same product regardless of where the attack occurs. Because both ends are the same, the product would be a meso diol.

Wait, so Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 each produce the same diol? Or different diols?

Wait, no. Because the starting epoxides are different. So, (E)-ene gives a trans epoxide, which when opened, forms a trans diol, but if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound. Similarly, (Z)-ene gives a cis epoxide, which upon opening would form a cis diol, but again, if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound.

Wait, but in reality, the meso diol would be the same regardless of whether the epoxide was cis or trans, because the diol's configuration would depend on the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think about a specific example. Take cyclohexene oxide (epoxide). If it's trans, upon acid treatment, it would form a diol where the hydroxyls are on opposite sides. But if the epoxide is cis, the diol would have the hydroxyls on the same side.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of ethylene oxide. When it's opened, it forms ethylene glycol, which is a diol where both hydroxyls are on the same side â€” but ethylene oxide is a three-membered ring, which is a special case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The main point is that each reaction (E and Z) produces an epoxide, which upon acid treatment produces a diol. Then, the diols from both reactions are combined and run on HPLC.

Now, the question is about the number of peaks observed on standard and chiral HPLC columns.

In a standard (achiral) HPLC, diastereomers would elute as separate peaks, while enantiomers would not. But if the diol is achiral (meso compound), then it would only give one peak. If it's chiral, it would give two peaks on a chiral column but one on an achiral column.

Wait, no. Wait, if a molecule is chiral, it would have enantiomers. On an achiral column, enantiomers would co-elute as one peak because the column doesn't distinguish them. On a chiral column, they would separate into two peaks.

But if the molecule is a meso compound (achiral), then on both column types, it would be a single peak.

So, let's get back to the problem.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxidation â†’ epoxide (let's say cis or trans) â†’ acid â†’ diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxidation â†’ epoxide (different from reaction 1) â†’ acid â†’ diol.

Assuming that the epoxides from each reaction are different and when opened, produce different diols.

Wait, but if the epoxides are symmetric, then their ring-opening would produce the same diol (meso), regardless of whether the starting epoxide was cis or trans. Because in a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening would lead to a meso diol.

Wait, but (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene have different structures, but when epoxidized, if the epoxide is symmetric, their ring-opening would produce the same diol.

Wait, but maybe the epoxides from E and Z are not symmetric, making the diols different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, with the double bond between C4 and C5.

The (E) configuration means that the higher priority groups on each end of the double bond are opposite each other. For oct-4-ene, each end of the double bond has a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group and a CH2CH2 group. Wait, perhaps not. I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the epoxide formed from each alkene would be a trans or cis epoxide, and when treated with acid, would form a diol that's either meso or chiral.

Wait, but if the diol is meso, then it's achiral. If it's chiral, it would have enantiomers.

So, for each reaction, the product is a diol. Let's say reaction 1 gives diol A, and reaction 2 gives diol B.

If diol A and diol B are enantiomers, then when combined, they might form a racemic mixture, but that depends on their structures.

Wait, but let's think.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxidation â†’ trans-epoxide â†’ acid â†’ diol (maybe meso or chiral).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxidation â†’ cis-epoxide â†’ acid â†’ diol (maybe same or different as reaction 1).

Suppose each reaction produces a diol that is a meso compound. Then, combining the products would give only one product, as both are the same. So, on the standard HPLC, it would be one peak. On the chiral column, since it's meso, it would also be one peak.

But that can't be the case because the options don't have one peak in either. So perhaps each reaction gives a different diol.

Wait, but if the diols are different, perhaps each is a different diastereomer or enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, but that's unlikely because the reaction goes to 100% completion.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a single diol, which is either a meso compound or a chiral molecule.

Wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 is a meso compound, and the diol from Reaction 2 is a chiral compound.

Or vice versa.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's say Reaction 1, starting with (E)-oct-4-ene, forms a trans-epoxide. When treated with acid, this would form a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides. If the diol is symmetric (meso), then it's achiral.

Reaction 2, starting with (Z)-oct-4-ene, forms a cis-epoxide. Acid treatment leads to a diol where the hydroxyls are on the same side, but if the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound, achiral.

Wait, but if both diols are meso, then combining them would give only one product, which would give one peak on both HPLC columns. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from (E)-ene is a meso compound, and the diol from (Z)-ene is a chiral compound. Let's think about that.

If Reaction 1 produces a meso diol (one peak on any column), and Reaction 2 produces a chiral diol (which would have two enantiomers), then when they're combined, the products would be the meso diol and a racemic mixture of the chiral diol.

So, on standard HPLC (achiral), the meso diol would be one peak, and the racemic mixture (enantiomers) would also be one peak, giving a total of two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, the meso diol is still one peak, and the racemic mixture would split into two peaks (the R and S enantiomers). So, total of three peaks.

Wait, that fits one of the options. Let me look at the options.

Option B: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 in chiral.

Yes, that matches. Because:

- Standard HPLC: two different compounds, each as a single peak. The meso and the racemic (which would appear as one peak on standard).

Wait, but wait. The meso diol is one compound, and the diol from Reaction 2 is another compound (chiral). So when you combine them, you have two different diols: one meso and one chiral.

Wait, no. Because Reaction 1's product is a meso diol, and Reaction 2's product is a chiral diol.

Wait, but in that case, when you combine the products, you have two different diols: one meso and one chiral. So, on standard HPLC, each would be a single peak. So, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, the meso diol is one peak, and the chiral diol would split into two peaks (its two enantiomers). So, total of three peaks.

Which matches option B: 2 in standard, 3 in chiral.

Alternatively, if each reaction produces two diols, but no, each reaction goes to 100% completion. So each reaction produces a single product.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong about the diols. Maybe each reaction produces a diol that isn't meso. Let me think.

Suppose that Reaction 1 produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, and Reaction 2 produces another pair of enantiomers. Then, when combined, you'd have four different compounds: two pairs of enantiomers.

But that would require that each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, which isn't the case because mCPBA adds in a specific way to form a single epoxide, which then forms a single diol upon acid treatment.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diastereomer, not an enantiomer, leading to two different diols. So, combining them would give two diols on standard HPLC, each as a single peak.

On a chiral HPLC, each diol would split into two peaks if they are chiral, but if they are meso, they stay as one. So, if one diol is meso and the other is chiral, then standard would have two peaks, and chiral would have (1 meso + 2 enantiomers) = 3 peaks.

So, that aligns with option B.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers. But that would require that each reaction produces a racemic mixture, but the question states each reaction goes to 100% completion, implying a single product. So each reaction produces a single diol, not a racemic mixture.

Wait, but wait. If the product of each reaction is a diol that is itself a racemic mixture, but the reaction conditions are such that only one diastereomer is formed, then each reaction gives a single diol.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a single enantiomer. But that's not possible unless the reaction is stereoselective.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible products.

For Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxidation â†’ trans-epoxide â†’ acid â†’ diol.

When the epoxide is trans and symmetric, the diol formed would be meso. So, one peak on standard, one peak on chiral.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxidation â†’ cis-epoxide â†’ acid â†’ diol.

If the epoxide is cis and symmetric, the diol would also be meso. So, same product as Reaction 1, leading to one peak on standard and one on chiral. But that's not the case because the two starting alkenes are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think that when the epoxide is cis and symmetric, the diol is meso, but when it's trans and symmetric, the diol is also meso.

But then, both reactions produce the same diol, which is meso. So, combining them would result in one diol, leading to one peak on both columns. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are different. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-ene is trans and leads to a diol that's a pair of enantiomers, while the epoxide from (Z)-ene is cis and leads to a diol that's also a pair of enantiomers. Then, each reaction produces a racemic mixture, but the two diols are different.

Wait, but if each reaction produces a single diol (racemic), then when combined, you have two different racemic diols. But that's not possible because each reaction produces only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single enantiomer. But mCPBA typically forms a single epoxide, which upon acid treatment would form a single diol, possibly as a racemic mixture, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a single enantiomer, leading to two enantiomers when combined.

Wait, I'm getting too stuck on the structures. Let me try to approach this from the HPLC perspective.

The chemist combines the products of both reactions. Each reaction gives a single diol. Let's say Reaction 1 gives diol A, and Reaction 2 gives diol B.

If diol A is a meso compound, it would appear as one peak on both columns.

If diol B is a meso compound, then combining A and B (if they are the same) would give one peak on standard and one on chiral.

But if diol A and diol B are different, then on standard HPLC, they would elute as two separate peaks. On a chiral column, if either diol is chiral, it would split into two peaks; if meso, remains one.

So, let's say Reaction 1's product is meso (one peak), and Reaction 2's product is a chiral diol (which would be a racemic mixture, but since the reaction is complete, perhaps it's a single enantiomer? No, because mCPBA tends to form a single epoxide, which leads to a single diol.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 1 produces a diol that is a meso compound (so one peak on any column), and Reaction 2 produces a chiral diol (which, as a single enantiomer, would give one peak on standard and two on chiral).

Wait, no. Wait, mCPBA forms a single epoxide, which upon acid treatment forms a single diol. So, if the diol is chiral, it would be a single enantiomer, leading to one peak on standard HPLC (since enantiomers co-elute) and two peaks on chiral HPLC (the two enantiomers).

But wait, if the diol is a single enantiomer, then when you run it on a standard column, it's one peak. On a chiral column, it's one peak as well because it's only one enantiomer. But if it's a racemic mixture, the chiral column would show two peaks. But the problem says each reaction goes to 100% completion, which suggests that each reaction produces a single stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a single enantiomer. So, Reaction 1 produces diol A (one enantiomer), and Reaction 2 produces diol B (another enantiomer, but not necessarily related).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 is a meso compound, and the diol from Reaction 2 is a pair of enantiomers. So, combining them would give a meso compound and a racemic mixture.

Wait, but that would complicate things. Let me think again.

If Reaction 1 produces a meso diol (one peak on any column), and Reaction 2 produces a chiral diol (which is a pair of enantiomers, giving two peaks on chiral column and one on standard), then when combined, the products are meso (1 peak on standard, 1 peak on chiral) and the chiral diol (1 peak on standard, 2 on chiral). So, total would be 2 peaks on standard and 3 on chiral. Which matches option B.

So, the answer would be option B: 2 peaks in standard, 3 peaks in chiral.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid treatment, and subsequent analysis of the combined products on standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via syn addition. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans-epoxide, while (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis-epoxide.  
   - Acid treatment of the epoxides leads to ring-opening, forming diols. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the starting epoxide.

2. **Products of Each Reaction**:  
   - Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ trans-epoxide â†’ diol (likely a meso compound due to symmetry).  
   - Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ cis-epoxide â†’ diol (likely a chiral compound, as the cis-epoxide is not symmetric).  

3. **Combination of Products**:  
   - The products of both reactions are combined. Reaction 1 produces a meso diol, while Reaction 2 produces a chiral diol.  

4. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:  
     - The meso diol from Reaction 1 appears as a single peak because it is achiral.  
     - The chiral diol from Reaction 2 also appears as a single peak because achiral columns cannot distinguish enantiomers.  
     - Total: 2 peaks.  

   - **Chiral HPLC**:  
     - The meso diol from Reaction 1 appears as a single peak because it is achiral.  
     - The chiral diol from Reaction 2 separates into two peaks corresponding to its two enantiomers.  
     - Total: 3 peaks.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - On the standard HPLC, 2 peaks are observed.  
   - On the chiral HPLC, 3 peaks are observed.  

This matches **Option B**: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
