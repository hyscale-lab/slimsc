Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n vectors. Oh wait, sigma is the Pauli spin matrices vector, right?

Alright, let me think. Pauli matrices are usually represented as sigma_x, sigma_y, and sigma_z. So the vector sigma would be in terms of these matrices. And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some direction, but it's arbitrary. The problem is to find the eigenvalues of H.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a spin operator in a particular direction are plus and minus something. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and their eigenvalues are +/- 1 for each component. But when you have a linear combination of them, like in this case, the Hamiltonian is a sum of each sigma_i multiplied by n_i, all multiplied by epsilon.

Wait, the general form for the Hamiltonian here is H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since sigma matrices are involved, the system is a spin-1/2 particle, I think. So the eigenvalues of H should be related to the eigenvalues of the spin component in the direction of n.

Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. So when you have a linear combination, the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix depend on the coefficients. But wait, more accurately, for any unit vector n, the matrix H should have eigenvalues ±ε, right? Because when you take the Pauli vector dot product with n, the trace is zero and the determinant is 1, so the eigenvalues are sqrt( (trace/2)^2 - determinant ) or something like that.

Let me think again. The trace of H would be zero because the trace of each Pauli matrix is zero, and n is a unit vector, so any linear combination would also have trace zero. The determinant of H would be (ε^2)(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) minus the sum of the products of the off-diagonal terms. Wait, no, that's not right. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix a b; c d is ad - bc. But for the Pauli matrices, each is traceless and has determinant -1, right? Wait, no. Let's compute the determinant of H.

Wait, H is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. Let's suppose n is in the z-direction for simplicity. Then H would be ε σ_z, which is ε times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The eigenvalues are clearly ±ε.

But what if n is in a different direction? Then H is a combination of σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z. But regardless of the direction, the eigenvalues should be ±ε because the square of H would be (ε^2)(σ · n)^2. Since σ · n is a unit vector in spin space, (σ · n)^2 would be the identity matrix. So H squared is ε² I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H squared would be ε², so the eigenvalues of H are ±ε.

Wait, that makes sense. Because any spin operator in a given direction has eigenvalues ±hbar/2 times something. Wait, no, in this case, H is given as ε times the spin component. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply by ε, the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the spin matrices. The spin operator S is (ℏ/2) σ, right? So each Pauli matrix is 2S_i /ℏ. So if H is ε (σ · n), then H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1, so the eigenvalues of H would be ±ε. Because when you take the spin in a certain direction, the eigenvalue is the coefficient times the Pauli matrix, which gives ± epsilon.

So the eigenvalues should be +ε and −ε. Looking at the options, option B is +ε and −ε. Option C has factors of ℏ and 2, but I don't think they are present here. The Hamiltonian is given as ε times sigma dot n, not involving hbar or 2.

Wait, but wait again. If the spin matrices are σ, then the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1. So H is ε times that, so eigenvalues are ±ε. So option B is correct.

Hmm, but sometimes I get confused because sometimes spin matrices are written with factors of 1/2. Let me make sure. For instance, the spin operator S is (ℏ/2) sigma. So if someone writes H = epsilon * (sigma · n), then the eigenvalues would be ±epsilon. But if H were written as epsilon * (S · n), then it would be (epsilon * ℏ/2) * something, leading to eigenvalues ± (epsilon ℏ/2).

But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is written as H = epsilon sigma.n, so the eigenvalues are ±epsilon. So the correct answer should be option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The task is to determine the eigenvalues of \(H\).

The Pauli matrices \(\vec{\sigma}\) are 2x2 traceless matrices, and their eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\). For any unit vector \(\vec{n}\), the dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) represents the spin operator in the direction of \(\vec{n}\). This operator is also traceless and has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). When multiplied by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\).

To confirm, note that \(H^2 = (\varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \varepsilon^2 (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2\). Since \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\) (the identity matrix), \(H^2 = \varepsilon^2 I\). The eigenvalues of \(H^2\) are therefore \(\varepsilon^2\), and the eigenvalues of \(H\) must be \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues depend on \(\varepsilon\), not just \(\pm 1\).
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because \(\hbar\) and factors of 2 are not present in the given Hamiltonian.
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Answer: B
