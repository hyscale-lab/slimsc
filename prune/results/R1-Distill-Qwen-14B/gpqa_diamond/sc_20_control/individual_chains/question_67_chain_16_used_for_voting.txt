Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. So, the question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Hmm, p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1, right? Each electron is in a p orbital, so l1 and l2 are both 1.

The problem says the coupled angular momentum state is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, wait. The notation is |l1, l2, l, m>, so for each electron, l is 1, and the total l is 2. Because when you couple two angular momenta, the possible total l values range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since l1 and l2 are both 1, the possible total l's are 0, 1, 2. But in this case, it's l=2, so that's the maximum possible. And m is -1. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum, so m can be from -l to +l in integer steps. So for l=2, m can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. Here, m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each of these has eigenvalues m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ, where m1 and m2 are the individual magnetic quantum numbers for each electron. So, for each electron, Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ because l=1.

We're to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalue -ħ. So, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, but the state given is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. We need to find the probability that both electrons have m=-1 in their individual states.

But wait, how is the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> related to the product states of the individual m's?

I remember that the coupled states are built from the product states via Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. So, for two angular momenta j1 and j2, the state |j1, j2, J, M> is a linear combination of |j1, m1>|j2, m2> where m1 + m2 = M.

In this problem, J is 2 and M is -1. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of all possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

The possible m1 and m2 combinations for m1 + m2 = -1 are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum to -1

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum to -1

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a linear combination of |1, -1>|1, 0> and |1, 0>|1, -1>, possibly multiplied by some coefficients, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. The Clebsch-Gordan expansion for J=2, M=-1 would be a sum over m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M = -1. So, the possible terms are:

- m1=-1, m2=0 → product state |1,-1> |1,0>
- m1=0, m2=-1 → product state |1,0> |1,-1>

So, the combined state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states. The coefficients can be found using Clebsch-Gordan tables or by remembering the expansion.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. Let me think. The coefficients might be such that the state is symmetric or antisymmetric, but wait, since the two electrons are identical particles, does that affect the symmetry here? Hmm, but wait, the state given is about orbital angular momentum, and electrons are fermions, so their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But orbital angular momentum is symmetric under exchange, and spin might play a role. But the question says to ignore spin angular momentum, so perhaps we don't have to worry about exchange symmetry here? Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe that's a complication we can set aside for this problem.

Alternatively, maybe the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific linear combination. Let's think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for J=2, M=-1. For two l=1 particles (p orbitals), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for M=−1 would involve the possible m1, m2 pairs.

Wait, let me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 (p) angular momenta. The general approach is to write the state |L=2, M> as a linear combination of the product states |m1>|m2> where m1 + m2 = M.

For M=2, it's only m1=1 and m2=1. So the state is |1,1>.

For M=1, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are (1,0) and (0,1). The state would be sqrt(2/3) |1,0> + sqrt(1/3) |0,1>, or something like that. Wait, actually, the coefficients depend on the exact coupling. Alternatively, perhaps for M=1, it's a combination of |1,0> and |0,1>, but I'm not sure about the exact coefficients. Alternatively, maybe it's (|1,0> + |0,1> ) multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, but for M=-2, it's |m1=-1, m2=-1>, so the state is |−1,−1>.

For M=−1, the possible m1 and m2 are (−1,0) and (0,−1). So the state would be the combination of |−1,0> and |0,−1>.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get L=2 and M=−1 would be, I think, sqrt( (something) ) times ( |−1,0> + |0,−1> ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's symmetric in m1 and m2. Let me think, the general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient C(j1, m1; j2, m2 | J, M) is such that:

|J, M> = sum_{m1, m2} C(j1, m1; j2, m2 | J, M) |j1, m1> |j2, m2>,

with the condition that m1 + m2 = M.

So for our case, j1 = j2 =1, J=2, M=-1.

The possible (m1, m2) pairs are ( -1, 0 ) and ( 0, -1 ).

So the state |2, -1> is a linear combination of |1, -1> |1, 0> and |1, 0> |1, -1>.

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) is sqrt( (2 + 1) / ( (2 + 1)(2) ) ) )? Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, I remember that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the state |2, -1> would be a symmetric combination of |1, -1>|1, 0> and |1, 0>|1, -1>.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients can be found using recursion relations or known formulae. But I'm not remembering exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a symmetric combination, so the coefficients are the same for both terms.

Wait, but perhaps the state is symmetric under exchange of the two particles, so the two terms would have the same coefficient. But wait, in the case of |2, -1>, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt( (2)(2+1) ) / something. Hmm, this is getting a bit hazy for me.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the normalization. Let's say that the state |2, -1> is a sum of two terms: a|1,-1>|1,0> + b|1,0>|1,-1>.

Then, the normalization condition would be |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1, since the two terms are orthogonal. But wait, are the product states |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1> orthogonal?

Wait, their inner product is <1,-1;1,0 | 1,0;1,-1> = <1,-1|1,0> * <1,0|1,-1> = 0 * 0 = 0 because <m1| m2> is zero unless m1 = m2. So the product states are orthogonal, so the coefficients a and b must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

But what else determines a and b? Well, perhaps the state has to satisfy certain symmetry properties. Alternatively, maybe the state can be written as ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> ) multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the state's squared norm would be (1^2 + 1^2) = 2, so the normalization factor would be 1/sqrt(2), making the state ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> ) / sqrt(2).

But wait, that would make sense for certain cases. Let me see: for J=2, M=1, the state is a combination of |1,0>|1,1> and |1,1>|1,0>, maybe with coefficients sqrt( (something) ) , but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |2, -1> is proportional to |1, -1> |1, 0> + |1, 0> |1, -1> divided by sqrt(2).

But wait, perhaps I should just assume that the state is an equal combination of these two terms, each with a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are different. Let me think: for the state |2, 2>, it's only |1,1> |1,1>, so that's just a single term. For |2,1>, it's a combination of |1,1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,1>, but I think the coefficients are different. Wait, maybe the coefficients are sqrt( ( (2)(2+1) ) / ( (2+1)(something) ) )).

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Wigner 3-j symbols or use the explicit expressions for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can find a reference or a formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for j1 = j2 =1 and J=2, M=-1.

Alternatively, let me just think about the possible states. The state |2, -1> is a combination of |1,-1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,-1>.

But each of these product states has m1 and m2, so for |1,-1> |1,0>, m1 = -1, m2=0. For the other term, m1=0, m2=-1.

In our problem, we're to find the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Wait, but in the coupled state |2,-1>, the product states that contribute are only those where m1 + m2 = -1. So, the possible product states are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1). The product state where both m1 and m2 are -1 would have m1 + m2 = -2, which is M = -2, which is a different state. So, in the state |2, -1>, the only product states are where one is -1 and the other is 0.

Therefore, the amplitude for the product state |m1 = -1, m2 = -1> is zero. Because the state |2,-1> is built from m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. So, the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is part of the |2,-2> state, I think. Because for M = -2, m1 + m2 = -2, which requires both m1 and m2 to be -1.

So, in |2, -1>, the coefficient for the |m1=-1, m2=-1> product state is zero. So, the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero because that product state isn't present in the coupled state |2,-1>.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. So, if the coupled state is |2,-1>, and the product states are |m1, m2>, then the expansion is a sum over only those m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1. So, for each m1, m2 is fixed as -1 - m1.

So, the possible terms are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1).

Therefore, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> isn't included in the expansion of |2,-1>. Hence, the probability of finding both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

So, the answer should be 0, which is option D.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 = 1 \), \( l_2 = 1 \), \( l = 2 \), and \( m = -1 \). The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

The coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) is a linear combination of product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). The possible pairs of \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy this condition are:

1. \( m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0 \)
2. \( m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1 \)

Thus, the state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) is a combination of the product states \( |1, -1\rangle |1, 0\rangle \) and \( |1, 0\rangle |1, -1\rangle \). The product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \), which corresponds to \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), is not part of the expansion of \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \), as this would belong to the \( |1, 1, 2, -2\rangle \) state.

Since the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) does not appear in the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \), the probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is zero.

Because when you couple two angular momenta, the possible total l values range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since l1 and l2 are both 1, the possible total l's are 0, 1, 2. But in this case, it's l=2, so that's the maximum possible. And m is -1. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum, so m can be from -l to +l in integer steps. So for l=2, m can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. Here, m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each of these has eigenvalues m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ, where m1 and m2 are the individual magnetic quantum numbers for each electron. So, for each electron, Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ because l=1.

We're to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalue -ħ. So, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, but the state given is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. We need to find the probability that both electrons have m=-1 in their individual states.

But wait, how is the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> related to the product states of the individual m's?

In this problem, J is 2 and M is -1. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of all possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

The possible m1 and m2 combinations for m1 + m2 = -1 are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum to -1

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum to -1

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a linear combination of |1, -1>|1, 0> and |1, 0>|1, -1>, possibly multiplied by some coefficients, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. The Clebsch-Gordan expansion for J=2, M=-1 would be a sum over m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M = -1. So, the possible terms are:

- m1=-1, m2=0 → product state |1,-1> |1,0>
- m1=0, m2=-1 → product state |1,0> |1,-1>

So, the combined state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states. The coefficients can be found using Clebsch-Gordan tables or by remembering the expansion.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. Let me think.

For M=2, it's only m1=1 and m2=1. So the state is |1,1>.

For M=1, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are (1,0) and (0,1). The state would be sqrt(2/3) |1,0> + sqrt(1/3) |0,1>, or something like that.

Wait, but for M=-2, it's |m1=-1, m2=-1>, so the state is |−1,−1>.

For M=−1, the possible m1 and m2 are (−1,0) and (0,−1). So the state would be the combination of |−1,0> and |0,−1>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's symmetric in m1 and m2. Let me think, the general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient C(j1, m1; j2, m2 | J, M) is such that:

|J, M> = sum_{m1, m2} C(j1, m1; j2, m2 | J, M) |j1, m1> |j2, m2>,

with the condition that m1 + m2 = M.

So for our case, j1 = j2 =1, J=2, M=-1.

The possible (m1, m2) pairs are ( -1, 0 ) and ( 0, -1 ).

So the state |2, -1> is a linear combination of |1, -1> |1, 0> and |1, 0> |1, -1>.

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) is sqrt( (2 + 1) / ( (2 + 1)(2) ) ) )? Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, I remember that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the state |2, -1> would be a symmetric combination of |1, -1>|1, 0> and |1, 0>|1, -1>.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients can be found using recursion relations or known formulae. But I'm not remembering exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a symmetric combination, so the coefficients are the same for both terms.

Wait, but perhaps the state is symmetric under exchange of the two particles, so the two terms would have the same coefficient. But wait, in the case of |2, -1>, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt( (2)(2+1) ) / something. Hmm, this is getting a bit hazy for me.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the normalization. Let's say that the state |2, -1> is a sum of two terms: a|1,-1>|1,0> + b|1,0>|1,-1>.

Then, the normalization condition would be |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1, since the two terms are orthogonal. But wait, are the product states |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1> orthogonal?

Wait, their inner product is <1,-1;1,0 | 1,0;1,-1> = <1,-1|1,0> * <1,0|1,-1> = 0 * 0 = 0 because <m1| m2> is zero unless m1 = m2. So the product states are orthogonal, so the coefficients a and b must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

But what else determines a and b? Well, perhaps the state has to satisfy certain symmetry properties. Alternatively, maybe the state can be written as ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> ) multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the state's squared norm would be (1^2 + 1^2) = 2, so the normalization factor would be 1/sqrt(2), making the state ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> ) / sqrt(2).

But wait, that would make sense for certain cases. Let me see: for J=2, M=1, the state is a combination of |1,0>|1,1> and |1,1>|1,0>, maybe with coefficients sqrt( (something) ) , but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |2, -1> is proportional to |1, -1> |1, 0> + |1, 0> |1, -1> divided by sqrt(2).

But wait, perhaps I should just assume that the state is an equal combination of these two terms, each with a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are different. Let me think: for the state |2, 2>, it's only |1,1> |1,1>, so that's just a single term. For |2,1>, it's a combination of |1,1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,1>, but I think the coefficients are different. Wait, maybe the coefficients are sqrt( ( (2)(2+1) ) / ( (2+1)(something) ) )).

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Wigner 3-j symbols or use the explicit expressions for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can find a reference or a formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for j1 = j2 =1 and J=2, M=-1.

Alternatively, let me just think about the possible states. The state |2, -1> is a combination of |1,-1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,-1>.

But each of these product states has m1 and m2, so for |1,-1> |1,0>, m1 = -1, m2=0. For the other term, m1=0, m2=-1.

In our problem, we're to find the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Wait, but in the coupled state |2,-1>, the product states that contribute are only those where m1 + m2 = -1. So, the possible product states are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1). The product state where both m1 and m2 are -1 would have m1 + m2 = -2, which is M = -2, which is a different state. So, in the state |2, -1>, the only product states are where one is -1 and the other is 0.

Therefore, the amplitude for the product state |m1 = -1, m2 = -1> is zero. Because the state |2,-1> is built from m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. So, the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is part of the |2,-2> state, I think. Because for M = -2, m1 + m2 = -2, which requires both m1 and m2 to be -1.

So, in |2, -1>, the coefficient for the |m1=-1, m2=-1> product state is zero. So, the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero because that product state isn't present in the coupled state |2,-1>.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. So, if the coupled state is |2,-1>, and the product states are |m1, m2>, then the expansion is a sum over only those m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1. So, for each m1, m2 is fixed as -1 - m1.

So, the possible terms are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1).

Therefore, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> isn't included in the expansion of |2,-1>. Hence, the probability of finding both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

So, the answer should be 0, which is option D.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 = 1 \), \( l_2 = 1 \), \( l = 2 \), and \( m = -1 \). The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

The coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) is a linear combination of product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). The possible pairs of \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy this condition are:

1. \( m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0 \)
2. \( m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1 \)

Thus, the state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) is a combination of the product states \( |1, -1\rangle |1, 0\rangle \) and \( |1, 0\rangle |1, -1\rangle \). The product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \), which corresponds to \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), is not part of the expansion of \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \), as this would belong to the \( |1, 1, 2, -2\rangle \) state.

Since the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) does not appear in the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \), the probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is zero.

Answer: D
