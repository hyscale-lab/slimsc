Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me the production energy, mass, and width of the meson. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. They can decay into other particles, and the mean decay distance must have something to do with how long the meson lives before decaying.

Wait, the mean decay distance is probably related to the lifetime of the particle. Because the longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. So I think the formula involves the particle's velocity and lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay length (L) is given by L = v * τ, where τ is the lifetime.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right! The uncertainty principle comes into play here. The lifetime is related to the width of the resonance. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I need to be careful with units here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in J·s or eV·s. Let's get the constants straight.

Okay, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant over 2pi in eV·s is about 6.582×10^-16 eV·s. Wait, wait, no, I think ħc is 197.33 MeV·fm or something. Wait, maybe I should convert everything into compatible units.

Let me write down what I know:

E_X = 8 GeV (production energy)
m_X = 1.2 GeV (mass)
Γ_X = 320 MeV (width)

First, I need to find the lifetime τ. As I thought, τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, I think the formula is τ = ħ/(Γ c^2), but I'm not certain. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of natural units where ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing different formulas.

Wait, no. The resonance width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, no: actually, Γ is the total decay width, which has units of energy. Since ħ has units of energy×time, so Γ (energy) = ħ (energy·time) / τ (time). So solving for τ gives τ = ħ / Γ.

But I need to use the correct units for ħ. Let's see: ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and I remember that ħc is approximately 197 MeV·fm, but that's for ħ multiplied by the speed of light. Hmm, maybe it's better to stick with the ħ value in GeV·s.

So, let me compute τ:

Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems really small. But meson lifetimes are usually very short, so maybe it's right.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since it's produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its rest mass is 1.2 GeV. We can find the velocity using relativistic equations.

The energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum via E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Let's solve for p.

E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So,

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (8)^2 = (p c)^2 + (1.2)^2 → (8)^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. So (p c)^2 = 64 -1.44 = 62.56 → p c = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, because units: GeV² = (GeV/c)^2 c^2 → so p c = GeV. So p c = 7.91 GeV → p = (7.91 GeV) / c.

But to find velocity, we can use beta = v/c = (p c) / (E) → beta = (7.91) / 8 ≈ 0.98875.

So v = beta c ≈ 0.98875 * speed of light. Approximately 0.989c.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. So L = 0.989c * τ.

Compute that.

c is about 3e8 m/s.

So:

L = 0.989 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute the numbers:

0.989 *3e8 = approx 2.967e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.967e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.967 * 2.056875) * 1e(8-24) = (approx 6.113) * 1e-16 → 6.113e-16 meters.

Wait, that's about 6e-16 meters. But looking at the options, the highest is 5.02e-15. Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, let me redo the calculation step by step.

Compute τ:

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875e-25 → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, compute beta:

E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 → (8)^2 = (pc)^2 + (1.2)^2 → 64 = (pc)^2 + 1.44 → (pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 → pc = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.

So beta = (pc) / E = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875.

Yes, correct.

v = beta c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Decay length L = v * τ.

So 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = Let's compute 2.966 * 2.056875 = approx.

2.056875 * 3 is 6.17, but 2.966 is a bit less than 3, so let's compute 2.056875 *2.966.

Let me calculate:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 2.056875 * (1 - 0.034) → approx 2.056875 - 0.070 (approx) → 1.986.

So total is 4.11375 + 1.986 ≈ 6.09975.

So 6.09975e(8 * -24 + 0) → Wait, 1e8 m/s * 1e-24 s → 1e-16 m.

So L ≈ 6.1e-16 m.

But looking at the options:

A) 5.0223 *10^-16 m

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6e-16 m, but the closest option is A, which is 5.02e-16. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me compute beta again.

E = 8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (mc²)^2 = (64) - (1.44) = 62.56 → pc = sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV/c.

Beta = pc/E → 7.91 GeV/c / 8 GeV = 7.91/8 ≈ 0.98875. So that's correct.

Velocity v = 0.98875c.

Hmm, maybe I should use more precise values for ħ.

Another thing: Perhaps I should use natural units where ħc is taken into account differently. Because when dealing with particle physics, sometimes people use c=1, but when calculating decay lengths, you have to reintroduce c.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of τ. Let me think again about the units.

Wait, the formula is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.

So, another possibility is that I should have considered the decay width in a different way, perhaps using the relation with the lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which might involve other constants.

Wait, another approach: The mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Since Γ is the total decay width. But sometimes, people use Γ in units of MeV, and ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So perhaps I did that correctly.

Wait, let me try to compute the decay length again, perhaps with more precise values.

Compute v as 0.98875c. c is 2.99792e8 m/s. So v = 0.98875 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 2.964e8 m/s.

Wait, more accurately: 0.98875 * 2.99792e8 = let's compute:

2.99792e8 * 0.98875.

2.99792e8 * 0.98875 = 2.99792 *0.98875 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. So that's correct.

Now, v * τ: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers:

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

2.966 * 2.056875.

Let me compute that accurately:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875 = Let's calculate:

0.966 * 2 = 1.932

0.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.966 *0.05 = 0.0483, and 0.966 * 0.006875 ≈ 0.006635. So total ≈ 0.0483 + 0.006635 = 0.054935.

So 0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.932 + 0.054935 ≈ 1.986935.

So total 2.966 *2.056875 ≈ 4.11375 +1.986935 ≈ 6.100685.

So 6.100685e-16 meters.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. The options are A) 5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, etc.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Let me think, perhaps I should have used relativistic momentum correctly.

Wait, to find the velocity, another approach is to use beta = (pc) / E, which I did. But perhaps using beta gamma would be better. Alternatively, maybe I should have used the relation:

gamma = E/(m c²).

Yes, gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667.

Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

gamma = 6.6667, so 1/gamma ≈ 0.15. 1/gamma² ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 1/gamma² ≈ 0.9775 → sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, which matches what I had before.

So v is correct.

Hmm, maybe the mistake is in the calculation of the width. Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps in the formula, the width should be in the same units as ħ. Alternatively, perhaps I should take ħ in MeV·s.

Wait, wait, 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. So 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV.

So another way to compute ħ: 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Then, Γ is 320 MeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-22 MeV·s) / (320 MeV) ) = 6.582e-22 / 320 s → approximately 2.056875e-24 s, same as before.

So same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but none of the options match my result. Or I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mean decay length formula is different. Oh wait, perhaps the decay length is c times the lifetime, but I'm already using v as a fraction of c, so L = v * tau. Wait, but I'm using v in m/s and tau in seconds, so L is in meters.

Wait, perhaps I should use the speed of light multiplied by tau, then multiplied by beta. So L = beta c tau. But that's the same as v * tau, which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the natural unit conversion more precisely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for decay length:

L = c * τ * beta.

So L = c * (ħ/(Γ)) * beta.

But in units where ħ is in eV s:

Wait, perhaps using ħ = 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me recompute using more precise values.

Let me compute L = v * tau = beta c tau.

Beta is 0.98875.

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s.

Tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.98875 * 2.99792458e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 0.98875 * 2.99792458e8:

Approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.1006875e-16 m.

Wait, that's about 6.1e-16 meters. But none of the options are near that. The options are either around 4e-15 or 5e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me think:

Wait, E = gamma m c^2 → gamma = E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666....

Gamma is 6.66667.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/(6.66667))^2) → 1/(6.66667) is 0.15 → 0.15^2 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is about 0.9887, which is correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should reconsider the approach. Perhaps the decay distance is calculated using the mean lifetime, but maybe the width is given in a different way.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the mean path is L = gamma * c * tau.

Wait, because gamma is the Lorentz factor, which accounts for time dilation. So tau is the proper lifetime, and the lifetime observed is gamma tau. So the moving particle's lifetime is longer by gamma, so the decay length is L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, but earlier, I used tau as the proper lifetime (tau_0), and v tau_0 is the decay length. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used gamma tau_0.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the relation between the particle's lifetime and the decay width.

Wait, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime tau as Γ = ħ / tau. So tau is the proper lifetime.

But when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is gamma tau, so the time available for decay is longer, allowing for a longer decay length.

Ah, maybe that's where I went wrong. Because I calculated tau as the proper lifetime (tau_0), but in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

So the decay length L = v * gamma tau_0.

So perhaps I need to include gamma in the calculation.

Wait, but where does gamma come into play here? Let's think again.

In the rest frame of the meson, the lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation: tau = gamma tau_0.

So the mean path length is L = v * tau = v gamma tau_0.

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, the velocity v is in terms of c, so beta c. So L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

But gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, tau_0 is ħ / Γ.

Let me compute this again with this new approach.

Compute tau_0 = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 8 /1.2 =6.6667.

Beta is 0.98875.

So L = beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

So L = 0.98875 * 6.6667 * 2.99792e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute step by step.

First, calculate beta * gamma = 0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591667.

Then, multiply by c: 6.591667 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 1.975e9 m/s.

Wait, wait: 6.591667 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9775e9 m/s. So approximately 1.9775e9 m/s.

Now multiply by tau_0 (2.056875e-24 s):

1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 * 2.056875) * 1e(9-24) → approx 4.065 * 1e-15 → 4.065e-15 m.

Wait, that's 4.065e-15 meters, which matches option B.

Wait, but earlier I didn't include the gamma factor and got 6.1e-16. Now, with gamma included, I get 4.065e-15, which is option B.

So where did I go wrong before? I think I forgot to include the time dilation factor, gamma. So the correct approach is to compute L = beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, so L = v * (gamma tau_0) = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Where tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is ħ / Γ.

So let me recalculate the numbers more accurately.

Compute beta * gamma:

0.98875 * (8 / 1.2) = 0.98875 * 6.666666... → let's compute 6.666666 * 0.98875.

6.666666 * 0.98875 = Let's compute 6.666666 * 0.98875.

= 6.666666 * (1 - 0.01125) = 6.666666 - (6.666666 * 0.01125).

6.666666 * 0.01125 = approx 0.075.

So 6.666666 -0.075 = 6.591666.

So beta gamma is 6.591666.

Now, c = 2.99792e8 m/s.

tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0 = 6.591666 * 2.99792e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute step by step:

First, 6.591666 * 2.99792e8 = ?

2.99792e8 * 6 ≈ 1.79875e9.

0.591666 * 2.99792e8 ≈ approx 0.591666 * 3e8 ≈ 1.775e8.

So total ≈ 1.79875e9 + 1.775e8 = approx 1.976e9 m/s.

Wait, more accurately:

6.591666 * 2.99792e8 = 

2.99792e8 * 6 = 1.798752e9.

2.99792e8 * 0.591666 = Let me compute 0.5 * 2.99792e8 = 1.49896e8.

0.091666 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 2.747e7.

So total 1.49896e8 + 2.747e7 ≈ 1.7737e8.

So total 6.591666 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 1.798752e9 + 1.7737e8 = 1.976122e9 m/s.

Now multiply by tau_0: 1.976122e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying the numbers: 1.976122 * 2.056875 ≈ let's calculate.

1.976 *2 =3.952.

1.976 *0.056875 ≈ approx 0.1117.

So total approx 4.0637.

So 4.0637e(9-24) =4.0637e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.06e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the meson as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the meson,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width of the meson.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \)
The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), the proper lifetime is:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The energy of the meson is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( \beta \)
Using the relativistic energy relation \( E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \), we solve for \( p c \):

\[
(p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \, \text{GeV}^2.
\]

\[
p c = \sqrt{62.56} = 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The velocity is then:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} = 0.98875.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0.
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( \beta = 0.98875 \),
- \( \gamma = 6.6667 \),
- \( c = 2.99792 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \).

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.98875 \times 6.6667 = 6.591667.
\]

Next, calculate \( \beta \gamma c \):

\[
\beta \gamma c = 6.591667 \times 2.99792 \times 10^8 = 1.975 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0 = 1.975 \times 10^9 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
