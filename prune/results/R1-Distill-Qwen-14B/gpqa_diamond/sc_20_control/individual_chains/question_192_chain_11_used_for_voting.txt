Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The setup describes an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P located outside the conductor, at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is given as l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. 

Wait, right, when a charge is placed inside a conductor's cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have an equal positive charge to balance it out. No, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor was initially uncharged. So when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) will have an induced -q charge. But then, since the conductor's total charge must remain zero, the outer surface must have a +q charge to balance the inner surface's -q.

Wait, no, the conductor as a whole is neutral, so if the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q. Because the total charge is zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0. Yes, that makes sense.

Now, point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there should be due to the charges on the outer surface. But wait, what about the charge inside the cavity? Does it affect the field outside? 

I recall that the electric field outside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So in this case, the outer surface has a charge of +q. So the field outside would be due to this +q as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, right? So the outer surface is a sphere of radius R. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P should be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Because outside a conducting sphere, the field is as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the charge is placed inside a cavity that's not at the center. The center of the cavity is s away from the center of the conductor. So the charge +q is at some point inside the cavity, which is off-center. But when considering the induced charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces, does that affect the external field?

Wait, the conductor's outer surface must have a charge of +q because the inner surface has -q. But the exact distribution of the charges on the outer surface—since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution if the conductor were isolated. But in this case, the charge in the cavity is off-center, so the inner surface's charge isn't uniform. However, the outer surface's charge distribution depends on external fields or other charges. But in this case, the conductor is isolated except for the charge in the cavity. So the outer surface's charge should distribute in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, but for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. That means the charges rearrange themselves such that their fields cancel each other inside the conductor. So the field inside the conductor due to the outer surface charges must be zero. So the outer surface's charge distribution must be such that the field inside the conductor is zero, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed.

So regardless of where the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution as if the total charge is at the center? Or does the position of the cavity's charge affect the outer surface's distribution?

Wait, no, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface will be a sphere. The field inside the conductor is zero, so the outer surface's charge must be uniformly distributed to cancel the field from the inner charges. But wait, the inner surface's charge isn't uniform because the charge in the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface has a non-uniform charge distribution, but the outer surface must have a uniform distribution because it's a sphere. Because any external field (if present) would cause a non-uniform distribution, but since the conductor is isolated, the outer surface must be uniform. Hmm, I'm not so sure about that. Or is there another way to think about it?

Alternatively, perhaps the outer surface's charge distribution is such that it produces a field that cancels the inner field within the conductor. Since the inner charges are non-symmetric, perhaps the outer surface's charges must arrange themselves to create a uniform field, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to consider the effect on the external field. The external field should only depend on the total charge on the outer surface. Because the conductor is spherical, the external field should be as if the charge were all at the center, regardless of the inner charge's position.

Wait, that's it! Because when you have a spherical conductor, any charge inside the cavity (even if it's off-center) doesn't affect the external field. The external field is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, would be the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which matches this reasoning. 

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me think again. Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. That seems like it's considering the position of the charge relative to the cavity's center. But since the conductor's outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, the external field should only depend on the total charge and the distance from the center, not the position of the inner charge.

Hmm, but wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the distance to the cavity's center is l. The angle between l and s (the displacement between the two centers) is theta. So perhaps there's a way for these variables to affect the field.

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere. The electric field outside a sphere is radial and depends only on the distance from the center of the sphere. So regardless of where the charge is inside, the outer field is as if all the charge is at the center.

So in this case, the external field at P is due to the +q charge at the center. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (L)^2.

So option B is correct.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ located outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$ to balance the induced charge on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. The field is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor, regardless of the distribution of charges on the inner surface or the position of the charge inside the cavity.

3. **Effect of the Cavity's Position**: The displacement $s$ of the cavity's center from the conductor's center and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the external electric field. This is because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, and the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.

4. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: Since the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ (located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor) is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which incorrectly suggests that the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the external field. This is incorrect because the external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$.
   - **Option B**: This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor and is correct.
   - **Option C**: This expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: This expression assumes the field depends on $l^2$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
