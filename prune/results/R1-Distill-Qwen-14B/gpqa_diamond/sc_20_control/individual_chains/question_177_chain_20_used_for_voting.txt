Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, that's interesting because the wavelength of maximum brightness is related to the star's temperature, right? Like from the blackbody radiation curve. So if both stars peak at the same wavelength, they must have the same temperature? Or is that not necessarily the case?

Wait, no. The peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is same, T would be same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would imply the same T for both, assuming they're blackbodies. So T1 equals T2.

But then, the rest of the question: the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm. Radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But when the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same, does that mean the rest wavelengths are the same, or the observed wavelengths? That would make a big difference.

Wait, the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So that would be the observed wavelengths, right? Because that's what you measure. But if the stars are moving, their observed wavelength would be shifted. So if both have the same observed lambda_max, but their rest lambda_max (from their own T) are different, then their T's would be different. Because if Star_1 is moving towards us or away, its observed wavelength would shift.

Wait, but if the rest lambda_max for both are same, then they would have same T. Alternatively, if they have different T's but their observed lambda_max are same due to Doppler shift.

So let's think:

Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed lambda_max is same as its rest lambda_max. So T1 = b / lambda_max1_observed.

Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (positive velocity) or towards. Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 is at rest, Star_2 is moving. How does that affect their observed lambda_max?

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, I think I need to get that right. Alternatively, when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift), so lambda_obs > lambda_rest. If moving towards, observed is shorter (blue shift).

Wait, the formula for the Doppler effect when velocities are much less than c is approximately lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), but that's a first-order approximation. But maybe for velocities as high as 700 km/s, that's about 0.00233c (since c is about 3e5 km/s), so the approximation might be okay. But perhaps the exact formula is better to use.

Wait, let me get precise. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

But wait, no. If the source is moving away, v is positive. The formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + (v/c)) / (1 - (v/c)) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I have to get the sign right. If the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So the formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, v is the velocity along the line of sight, positive if moving away from the observer.

So for Star_2, which is moving with radial velocity v = 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away, then we have a redshift. So lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But Star_1 has v=0, so lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

The problem states that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2. So:

lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But earlier, I thought that because lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1, and lambda_obs2 is shifted, perhaps the lambda_rest2 is different.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. That is, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the observed lambda_max is same for both stars. So, for Star_1, lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs1. For Star_2, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * Doppler shift factor.

But in the problem statement, the observed lambda_max is same for both stars. So, lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * Doppler shift factor. Wait, no, because for Star_1, lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1. For Star_2, lambda_obs2 = Doppler shifted version of lambda_rest2.

But the problem says lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

So, lambda_rest1 = Doppler_shift_factor * lambda_rest2.

But also, from the blackbody radiation, lambda_rest is related to temperature via Wien's law: lambda_rest = b / T.

So, lambda_rest1 = b / T1, lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

So, substituting:

(b / T1) = Doppler_shift_factor * (b / T2)

The b's cancel, so:

1 / T1 = Doppler_shift_factor * (1 / T2)

So, T2 = T1 * Doppler_shift_factor.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated, but let's proceed.

So, the Doppler_shift_factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), where v is Star_2's velocity (700 km/s) directed away from us.

So, let me compute that factor.

First, v = 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333, 1 - v/c ≈ 0.997667.

Then, the ratio (1+v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ let's compute that.

1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ approximately 1.00468.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1.002333 = approx. 1 + 0.002333.

Denominator: 0.997667 = approx. 1 - 0.002333.

We can approximate the ratio as [1 + x]/[1 - x], where x = 0.002333.

Which is approximately (1 + x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x when x is small, but wait, that's not accurate. Wait, [1+x]/[1 -x] ≈ (1 + x)(1 + x) ) when x is small because 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 + x.

Wait, wait, no: [1 + x]/[1 - x] = [ (1 + x) * (1 + x) ] if x is small, but that's not correct. Let me compute (1+0.002333)/(1-0.002333) numerically.

Compute numerator: 1.002333.

Denominator: 0.997667.

Approximately, 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me compute this division:

1.002333 ÷ 0.997667.

Let me compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

I can think of it as (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333).

Which is approximately (1 + 2 * 0.002333) using the approximation (1 + x)/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + 2x when x is small.

So 2x = 2 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.004666. So the ratio is approx. 1.004666.

But for more precision, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.002333 ÷ 0.997667.

Let me compute this as division:

Let me let a = 1.002333 and b = 0.997667.

a ≈ 1.002333.

b ≈ 0.997667.

Compute a/b:

Divide 1.002333 by 0.997667.

Let me compute it as:

(1.002333) / (0.997667) = ?

I can compute this as 1 + (0.002333 / 0.997667).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute how much 0.997667 * 1.0047 equals.

Alternatively, use a calculator approach.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute it as follows:

Let me compute (1.002333) / (0.997667).

Let me write it as (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333).

The exact value would be:

(1 + x) / (1 - x), where x = 0.002333.

Which equals [1 + x] * [1/(1 - x)].

Approximating 1/(1 - x) as 1 + x + x² + x³ + ... ≈ 1 + x when x is small.

So [1 + x] * [1 + x] = 1 + 2x, so approximately 1.004666.

But let me compute it more accurately.

We can compute 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ (1002333e-6) / (997667e-6) = 1002333 / 997667 ≈ let's compute that.

Compute 1002333 ÷ 997667.

Well, 997667 * 1.0047 = about ?

1.0047 * 997667 ≈ 997667 + 0.0047 * 997667.

0.0047 * 997667 ≈ 4683. So 997667 + 4683 ≈ 1,002,350. Which is very close to 1,002,333. So 1.0047 * 997667 ≈ 1,002,350. Close to 1,002,333, so the ratio is approximately 1.0047.

So the Doppler shift factor is approximately 1.0047, meaning that the observed wavelength is 1.0047 times the rest wavelength.

But wait, in our earlier equation, we have:

lambda_rest1 = Doppler_shift_factor * lambda_rest2.

But from Wien's law, lambda_rest is inversely proportional to T, so:

lambda_rest1 = b / T1,

lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = Doppler_shift_factor * (b / T2).

Canceling b,

1/T1 = (Doppler_shift_factor) * (1/T2).

So,

T2 = T1 * Doppler_shift_factor.

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I messed up the Doppler shift direction. Let me think again. When a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed lambda is longer. If Star_1's observed lambda is same as Star_2's observed lambda, then Star_2's rest lambda must be shorter. Because when you redshift, the observed lambda increases.

Wait, let me think. Suppose Star_2's rest lambda is lambda_rest2. When it's moving away, the observed lambda is lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

If lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

Then lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * Doppler_shift_factor.

So lambda_rest1 is greater than lambda_rest2 because Doppler_shift_factor is about 1.0047.

Since lambda_rest1 = b / T1,

lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * 1.0047.

Which implies,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * 1.0047.

Cancel b,

1/T1 = 1.0047 / T2,

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.0047.

So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

But earlier, I thought that if the observed lambda_max is same, the temperatures would be same, but that's only if there's no Doppler shift. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as:

The peak wavelength observed is same for both stars. So:

lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

But lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1 (since Star_1 is not moving).

lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Or,

lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which can be written as:

lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Now, since lambda_rest is b / T,

lambda_rest1 = b/T1,

lambda_rest2 = b/T2.

So,

b/T2 = (b/T1) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T2 = (1/T1) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is same as T2 = T1 * Doppler_shift_factor.

So, T2 is hotter than T1, because Doppler_shift_factor is greater than 1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because Star_2 is moving away, it's observed to have a longer lambda_max, implying that its rest lambda_max would be shorter (since the observed is longer due to redshift). A shorter rest lambda_max implies higher temperature because lambda_max = b / T.

So, T2 is higher than T1.

So, getting back to the problem, now we need to calculate the luminosity ratio.

The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But since we're looking for the ratio of luminosities, the constants will cancel.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

Given,

R1 = 1.5 R2,

T2 = T1 * Doppler_shift_factor, which we computed as sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), which is approximately 1.0047.

Wait, but wait, earlier I found T2 = T1 * Doppler_shift_factor, which is about 1.0047.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)² * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² (T1 * 1.0047)^4 )

Simplify R terms:

(1.5^2 R2²) / (R2^2) = 2.25.

Now, the T terms:

T1^4 / (T1^4 * (1.0047)^4 ) = 1 / (1.0047)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.0047)^4.

Compute (1.0047)^4.

Let me compute that.

First, compute ln(1.0047): approx 0.00469.

Multiply by 4: 0.01876.

Exponentiate: e^0.01876 ≈ 1.0189.

Alternatively, compute 1.0047^2: (1.0047)^2 ≈ 1.0094. Then (1.0094)^2 ≈ 1.0189.

So, (1.0047)^4 ≈ approx 1.0189.

Thus,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0189 ≈ 2.206.

Wait, that's approximately 2.206.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23, but wait, wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.0047)^4 more accurately.

(1.0047)^2: 1.0047 * 1.0047.

Let me compute it:

1.0047 * 1.0047.

= (1 + 0.0047)^2

= 1 + 2*(0.0047) + (0.0047)^2

= 1 + 0.0094 + 0.00002209

≈ 1.00942209.

Now, square that again to get the 4th power.

(1.00942209)^2.

Which is:

1.00942209 * 1.00942209.

Let's compute:

Approximate using (1 + a)^2 where a=0.00942209.

= 1 + 2a + a².

a=0.00942209 → 2a=0.01884418.

a²= (0.00942209)^2 ≈ 0.00008878.

So, 1 + 0.01884418 + 0.00008878 ≈ 1.01893296.

So, (1.0047)^4 ≈ 1.018933.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.018933 ≈ 2.25 / 1.018933.

Let me compute that:

2.25 / 1.018933.

Compute 1.018933 × 2.2 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 2.25 / 1.018933.

Let me compute 2.25 ÷ 1.018933.

Perhaps using long division.

1.018933 × 2.2 ≈ 2.241653.

Which is less than 2.25.

So 2.2 is 2.241653.

The difference is 2.25 - 2.241653 = 0.008347.

Now, find how much more than 2.2 we need.

Each 0.001 adds 1.018933 × 0.001 = 0.001018933.

We need 0.008347, so 0.008347 / 0.001018933 ≈ 8.195, so approximately 0.0082.

Wait, that would make it 2.2 + 0.0082 = 2.2082.

Wait, 1.018933 × 2.2082 ≈ 1.018933 * 2.2 = 2.2416526, plus 1.018933 * 0.0082 ≈ 0.008354.

So 2.2416526 + 0.008354 ≈ 2.25.

So 2.2082 is the answer.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.2082, which is roughly 2.21.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25 → 2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Wait, my calculation is about 2.208, which is approximately 2.21. But the options don't have 2.21. The closest is D) 2.23. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler factor calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the Doppler shift factor more accurately.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s → 300,000 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.00233333...

So,

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333333,

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667.

Compute the ratio: (1.002333333)/(0.997666667).

Compute 1.002333333 / 0.997666667.

Let me compute this division accurately.

Using division, 1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667.

I can write this as (1002333.333e-6) ÷ (997666.667e-6) = 1002333.333 / 997666.667.

Approximately, 1002333.333 ÷ 997666.667.

Let me compute 997666.667 * 1.0047 = 997666.667 * 1 = 997666.667.

Adding 0.0047 * 997666.667 = 997666.667 * 0.0047 ≈ 4683.4.

So 997,666.667 + 4,683.4 ≈ 1,002,350.067.

Which is close to 1,002,333.333, so 1.0047 gives us 1,002,350, which is slightly larger than 1,002,333. So the actual ratio is a little less than 1.0047.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Compute 1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667.

Let me write it as (1 + 0.002333333)/(1 - 0.002333333).

Which can be written as (1 + x)/(1 - x), where x=0.002333333.

As I remember, (1+x)/(1-x) ≈ 1 + 2x + 2x² + 2x³ + ... for small x.

But for better precision, perhaps compute it as:

(1 + x) = 1.002333333,

(1 - x) = 0.997666667.

So (1+x)/(1-x) = [1.002333333] / [0.997666667].

Let me compute this using division.

Compute 1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667.

Let me write it as:

How many times does 0.997666667 go into 1.002333333.

Well, 0.997666667 * 1.0047 = approximately 1.002333333.

Wait, wait, 0.997666667 * 1.0047 ≈ 1.002333333.

So the ratio is approximately 1.0047.

Wait, but that's the same as before.

So (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ 1.0047.

Thus, the Doppler shift factor is sqrt(1.0047) ≈ ?

Compute sqrt(1.0047).

Approximate sqrt(1.0047) using Taylor series.

sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 - x²/8 + ... for small x.

x = 0.0047.

So sqrt(1.0047) ≈ 1 + 0.0047/2 - (0.0047)^2 / 8.

= 1 + 0.00235 - (0.00002209) / 8.

= 1 + 0.00235 - 0.00000276.

≈ 1.002347.

Wait, but that's the sqrt of (1.0047) ≈ 1.002347.

Wait, but wait, the Doppler shift formula is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1+v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So the Doppler shift factor is sqrt(1.0047) ≈ 1.002347.

Which is approximately 1.00235.

So, the Doppler shift factor is about 1.002347.

Then, in our earlier equation, T2 = T1 * Doppler_shift_factor.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002347.

So, the temperature of Star_2 is about 0.2347% higher than Star_1.

Now, let's compute the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4)

Given,

R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

(R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T2 = T1 * 1.002347.

So,

T2^4 = (T1)^4 * (1.002347)^4.

Now, compute (1.002347)^4.

Again using the Taylor expansion for (1+x)^n, where x is small.

x = 0.002347.

n =4.

So, (1+x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4.

Compute each term:

4x = 4 * 0.002347 ≈ 0.009388.

6x² = 6*(0.002347)^2 ≈ 6*(0.000005509) ≈ 0.00003305.

4x³ ≈ 4*(0.002347)^3 ≈ 4*(0.0000000129) ≈ 0.0000000516.

x^4 ≈ (0.002347)^4 ≈ 0.0000000003.

Adding up:

1 + 0.009388 = 1.009388,

+ 0.00003305 → 1.00942105,

+ 0.0000000516 → 1.00942110,

+ 0.0000000003 → 1.00942110.

So, (1.002347)^4 ≈ 1.0094211.

So, T2^4 = T1^4 * 1.0094211.

Now, L1/L2 = (2.25) * [T1^4 / (T1^4 * 1.0094211) ) ]

= 2.25 / 1.0094211.

Compute 2.25 / 1.0094211.

Again, let me compute this.

1.0094211 * 2.23 ≈ ?

1.0094211 * 2 = 2.0188422.

1.0094211 * 0.23 = 0.232167.

So 2.0188422 + 0.232167 ≈ 2.251009.

Which is just a bit over 2.25.

So 2.23 gives 2.251, which is 2.251, which is just a bit more than 2.25.

So 2.23 is just slightly higher than the required 2.25.

Wait, but wait, we have L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0094211 ≈ 2.225.

Because 1.0094211 is approximately 1.00942.

So, 2.25 / 1.00942 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 ÷ 1.00942.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to eliminate decimals.

2250000 ÷ 1009420.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Approximate 1.00942 as 1.0094.

Compute 2.25 ÷ 1.0094.

Let me compute this as:

(1.0094) × 2.230 = ?

Compute 1.0094 × 2.23.

= 1.0094 * 2 + 1.0094 * 0.23.

= 2.0188 + 0.232162 = 2.250962.

Which is approximately 2.251, which is very close to 2.25.

So, 2.23 gives 2.251, which is 0.001 over 2.25.

So, 2.23 is approximately the value where 1.00942 × 2.23 = 2.25.

So, 2.25 / 1.00942 ≈ 2.23.

Wait, but let me compute 2.25 / 1.00942.

Let me write it as 2.25 ÷ 1.00942.

We can compute this as:

= (2250 / 1009.42) ≈ 2.229.

Wait, 1009.42 × 2.22 = approx 1009.42 * 2 = 2018.84,

plus 1009.42 * 0.22 = approx 222.07.

Total: 2018.84 + 222.07 = 2240.91.

Which is a bit less than 2250. The difference is 9.09.

So, 9.09 / 1009.42 ≈ 0.00899.

So, 2.22 + 0.00899 ≈ 2.22899.

So, approximately 2.229.

So about 2.229, which is around 2.23.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier, I thought I got 2.208, but perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift factor earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the Doppler shift factor accurately.

Wait, let me recap:

The Doppler shift factor for wavelength is sqrt( (1+v/c)/(1-v/c) ).

v=700 km/s, c=3e5 km/s → v/c = 700/3e5 = 7/3000 = 0.002333333...

So,

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333333...

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667...

Their ratio is (1.002333333)/(0.997666667) ≈ 1.0047.

So, the Doppler shift factor is sqrt(1.0047) ≈ 1.002347.

Which makes T2 = T1 * 1.002347.

Now, T2^4 = (T1)^4 * (1.002347)^4.

Earlier, I computed (1.002347)^4 as approx 1.0094211.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0094211 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), where \( R_2 \) is the radius of Star_2.
   - Star_1 and Star_2 appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, implying their observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are equal.
   - Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Doppler Shift and Temperature**:
   - The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]
     where \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \). Substituting \( v/c = 0.002333 \), the Doppler shift factor becomes:
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} \approx 1.0047
     \]
   - Since the observed wavelengths are the same, the rest wavelength of Star_2 (\( \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \)) is related to the rest wavelength of Star_1 (\( \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \)) by:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot 1.0047
     \]
   - Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperature of Star_2 (\( T_2 \)) is related to the temperature of Star_1 (\( T_1 \)) by:
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.0047
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
   - Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.0047 \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2 T_1^4}{T_1^4 (1.0047)^4} = \frac{2.25}{(1.0047)^4}
     \]
   - Compute \( (1.0047)^4 \) using the Taylor expansion:
     \[
     (1.0047)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.0047) + 6(0.0047)^2 + 4(0.0047)^3 + (0.0047)^4 \approx 1.0189
     \]
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.0189} \approx 2.229
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
