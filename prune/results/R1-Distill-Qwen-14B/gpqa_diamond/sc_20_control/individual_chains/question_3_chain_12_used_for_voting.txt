Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about expectation values. Hmm, let me think. I've studied a bit about expectation values and operators, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me break down the problem.

Alright, the problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. I need to find this expectation value up to one decimal place.

Wait, so expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz + 5σx) |ψ⟩.

Let me recall the Pauli matrices. σz is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], and σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Oh right, and for σy it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]], but I don't think that's needed here.

The state is given as a linear combination. Let me write it as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, right? But I should just keep it exact for calculations.

So ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me think about how to compute the expectation value.

The operator is 10σz + 5σx. So the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation value separately and then combine them.

First, compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are straightforward.

In |↑⟩, σz has eigenvalue +1, and in |↓⟩, it's -1. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2*(1) + |b|^2*(-1). Because the state is a linear combination, the probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

So |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|² is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Then 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.0. Got that part.

Next, compute ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is a bit trickier. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So I need to compute the expectation value of σx in state ψ.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ψ† σx ψ. Alternatively, I can write it as (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| ) σx (a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩).

Wait, but σx is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the spin-up and spin-down states. Let me think about it.

Alternatively, I can express σx in terms of its matrix. So σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So when I apply σx to |↑⟩, it becomes |↓⟩, and applying to |↓⟩, it becomes |↑⟩.

But perhaps a better approach is to remember that for any state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is 2 Re(ab*), but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the expectation value of σx for a state ψ is given by 2 times the real part of (a b*) where a and b are the coefficients. Or is it something else? Let me think.

No, wait. Let me compute it step by step.

Express ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ would be [a; b] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The operator σx is [[0, 1],[1,0]]. So the matrix representation is:

σx |ψ⟩ = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [a; b] = [b; a].

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is [a*, b*] * [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

So that's a* b + b* a = 2 Re( a* b ). Because a* b is the complex conjugate of b* a, so their sum is twice the real part.

In this case, a and b are real numbers, so a* = a, b* = b. So ⟨σx⟩ = a b + b a = 2ab.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if a and b are real, then a* b is a*b, which is same as a*b since they are real. So Re(a* b) is a*b, and 2 Re( a* b ) is 2 a*b.

But let's compute it directly. a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So a*b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2 )= sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.

So 2 a*b = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but that would mean ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, but wait, wait. Let me compute it again. Because if ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], then σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], right?

Then ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Wait, that's (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4, and (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 is same as (sqrt(3))/4. So the sum is (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866.

So yes, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because the expectation value here is for the operator σx, which is a Hermitian operator, so the expectation must be real, which it is.

So putting it all together:

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (-5.0) + (5*sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, let me compute 5*sqrt(3)/2. Since sqrt(3)≈1.732, 1.732/2 =0.866, then 5*0.866 ≈4.33.

So that's -5.0 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me compute it exactly.

Wait, 5*sqrt(3)/2 is (5/2) * sqrt(3) ≈ (2.5)(1.732) ≈4.33.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is -5.0. 5⟨σx⟩ is 4.33. So total expectation is (-5.0) +4.33 =-0.67.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, the state is 0.5 |↑> + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓>, right? So when I compute ⟨σx⟩, which is 2ab.

a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/1) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(0.866) =4.33.

Yes, so 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) =-5.0.

So, total is -5.0 +4.33 = -0.67. So about -0.67.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -1.4

B)1.65

C)-0.7

D)0.85

Hmm. So -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the closest option is C) -0.7.

Wait, but wait, let me re-calculate the exact value to make sure.

Let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2) exactly.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So 5*(1.73205)/2 = (5 *1.73205)/2 = (8.66025)/2 =4.330125.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) =-5.0.

So sum is -5.0 +4.330125 =-0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7 (since 0.669 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6, but wait, 0.669 is 0.67, which is 67 hundredths. Rounding to one decimal place: 0.67 rounded is 0.7? No, wait, no. Wait, 0.669 is approximately 0.67, but when rounded to one decimal place, look at the next digit.

Wait, 0.669 has 6 in tenths place, 6 in hundredths, 9 in thousandths. So 0.669 is approximately 0.67 when rounded to two decimals.

But when rounding to one decimal, 0.669 is 0.7 because the second decimal is 6, which is ≥5. So, 0.669 ≈ 0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.669 is 0.6 (tenths) + 0.06 (hundredths) + 0.009 (thousandths). So when rounding to one decimal place, you look at the hundredths place. The hundredths digit is 6, which is ≥5. So you round up the tenths place from 6 to 7. So 0.7.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

So the correct answer is option C) -0.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given quantum state:

\[
\psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle,
\]
where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Calculating \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \):

\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) for the state \( \psi \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(ab^*),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Since \( a \) and \( b \) are real, this simplifies to:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab.
\]

Substituting \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5.0 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. I need to find this expectation value up to one decimal place.

Wait, so expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz + 5σx) |ψ⟩.

Let me recall the Pauli matrices. σz is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], and σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Oh right, and for σy it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]], but I don't think that's needed here.

The state is given as a linear combination. Let me write it as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, right? But I should just keep it exact for calculations.

So |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|² is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Then 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.0. Got that part.

Next, compute ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is a bit trickier. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So I need to compute the expectation value of σx in state ψ.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ψ† σx ψ. Alternatively, I can write it as (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| ) σx (a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩).

Wait, but σx is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the spin-up and spin-down states. Let me think about it.

Alternatively, I can express σx in terms of its matrix. So σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So when I apply σx to |↑⟩, it becomes |↓⟩, and applying to |↓⟩, it becomes |↑⟩.

But perhaps a better approach is to remember that for any state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is 2 Re(ab*), but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the expectation value of σx for a state ψ is given by 2 times the real part of (a b*) where a and b are the coefficients. Or is it something else? Let me think.

No, wait. Let me compute it step by step.

Express ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ would be [a; b] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The operator σx is [[0, 1],[1,0]]. So the matrix representation is:

σx |ψ⟩ = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [a; b] = [b; a].

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is [a*, b*] * [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

So that's a* b + b* a = 2 Re( a* b ). Because a* b is the complex conjugate of b* a, so their sum is twice the real part.

In this case, a and b are real numbers, so a* = a, b* = b. So ⟨σx⟩ = a b + b a = 2ab.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if a and b are real, then a* b is a*b, which is same as a*b since they are real. So Re(a* b) is a*b, and 2 Re( a* b ) is 2 a*b.

But let's compute it directly. a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So a*b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2 )= sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.

So 2 a*b = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but that would mean ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, but wait, wait. Let me compute it again. Because if ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], then σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], right?

Then ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Wait, that's (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4, and (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 is same as (sqrt(3))/4. So the sum is (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866.

So yes, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because the expectation value here is for the operator σx, which is a Hermitian operator, so the expectation must be real, which it is.

So putting it all together:

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (-5.0) + (5*sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, let me compute 5*sqrt(3)/2. Since sqrt(3)≈1.732, 1.732/2 =0.866, then 5*0.866 ≈4.33.

So that's -5.0 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me compute it exactly.

Wait, 5*sqrt(3)/2 is (5/2) * sqrt(3) ≈ (2.5)(1.732) ≈4.33.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is -5.0. 5⟨σx⟩ is 4.33. So total expectation is (-5.0) +4.33 =-0.67.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, the state is 0.5 |↑> + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓>, right? So when I compute ⟨σx⟩, which is 2ab.

a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/1) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(0.866) =4.33.

Yes, so 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) =-5.0.

So, total is -5.0 +4.33 = -0.67. So about -0.67.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -1.4

B)1.65

C)-0.7

D)0.85

Hmm. So -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the closest option is C) -0.7.

Wait, but wait, let me re-calculate the exact value to make sure.

Let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2) exactly.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So 5*(1.73205)/2 = (5 *1.73205)/2 = (8.66025)/2 =4.330125.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) =-5.0.

So sum is -5.0 +4.330125 =-0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7 (since 0.669 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6, but wait, 0.669 is 0.67, which is 67 hundredths. Rounding to one decimal place: 0.67 rounded is 0.7? No, wait, no. Wait, 0.669 is approximately 0.67, but when rounded to one decimal place, look at the next digit.

Wait, 0.669 has 6 in tenths place, 6 in hundredths, 9 in thousandths. So 0.669 is approximately 0.67 when rounded to two decimals.

But when rounding to one decimal, 0.669 is 0.7 because the second decimal is 6, which is ≥5. So, 0.669 ≈ 0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.669 is 0.6 (tenths) + 0.06 (hundredths) + 0.009 (thousandths). So when rounding to one decimal place, you look at the hundredths place. The hundredths digit is 6, which is ≥5. So you round up the tenths place from 6 to 7. So 0.7.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

So the correct answer is option C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given quantum state:

\[
\psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle,
\]
where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Calculating \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \):

\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) for the state \( \psi \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(ab^*),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Since \( a \) and \( b \) are real, this simplifies to:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab.
\]

Substituting \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5.0 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
