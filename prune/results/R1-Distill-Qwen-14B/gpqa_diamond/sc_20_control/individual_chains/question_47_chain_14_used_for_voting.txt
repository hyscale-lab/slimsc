Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. Let's see... The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about the possible structures that fit this. So, the molecular formula has 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and two oxygens. The options given are A to D, each a different structure. Let me go through the spectroscopic data step by step.

First, the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, the intensity is medium to strong, so maybe it's an amide or something with an amino group. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, looking at the options, all have carbonyls except maybe some, but let me check. Amides and esters have carbonyls around 1680-1720. So, 1720 is probably an ester or maybe a ketone, but more likely an ester or amide.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So, the carbonyl is the amide, which would show around 1680 maybe, but the IR here is 1720. Maybe not? Or perhaps it's more of an amide I band.

Wait, benzamide's carbonyl is around 1660-1680, but if it's an ester, like ethyl ester, the carbonyl is around 1730-1750. Hmm, but the given is 1720. So maybe it's an amide? Or perhaps a conjugated amide? Alternatively, maybe an ester.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That's a formamide, so the carbonyl would be around 1700 perhaps. But 1720 is a bit higher. Maybe it's an amide with electron-withdrawing groups?

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is an ester (since it's an acid derivative). So the carbonyl would be higher, around 1720-1750. So this could fit. Also, if it's an ester, the O-H stretch from the amino group (if it's an amine, would show broad peaks in IR, but in the given IR, there are peaks at 3420 and 3325. That could be N-H stretching, like in an amine or amide. So, let's see.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's an ester, so the carbonyl at 1720 makes sense. The amino group would be NH2, so broad peaks in IR—maybe the 3420 and 3325 are the N-H stretches.

Wait, the IR shows two bands around 3400, which could be two different N-H stretches, perhaps in an amide or a primary amine. Alternatively, an amide might have a single stretch but maybe a broad one.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm triplet (3H): this is likely a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group. The triplet suggests that the ethyl is attached to something that splits the signal into a triplet. So maybe an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) or an ethyl ester (like OCOOCH2CH3). Wait, no, in an ester, the ethyl would be OCH2CH3, but wait, the splitting depends on adjacent groups.

Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) would be the CH2CH3 group. So, maybe connected to an O, making it an ethoxy group. Alternatively, it could be part of an ethyl ester, like in ethyl benzoate.

Next, 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H): could be an NH2 group. Because amines typically show broad signals, but wait, in the NMR, if it's an NH2, it would appear as a broad peak, but in the options, some have amide groups or amino groups. Alternatively, in an amide, the NH might be exchange broadened.

Wait, 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): a singlet, but 2H. Hmm, maybe an OCH2 group. Like an ethoxy group, where the ethoxy's O is connected to CH2CH3. Wait, no, that would be the CH2 next to O. Wait, but in an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), the OCH2 would be around 3.4-3.7 ppm, maybe as a quartet because the CH2 next to O is split by the CH3. Hmm, the 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH3, so maybe the OCH2 is at around 4.0? Wait, maybe the OCH2 is split into a quartet, but in this case, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, maybe not an OCH2.

Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm could be an NHCH2 group? Not sure. Another possibility: maybe it's a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom but not O. Or perhaps in an amide, the adjacent groups.

Wait, looking at the other signals:

4.5 ppm quartet (2H): quartet, 2H. So perhaps an ethyl group adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ester, the OCOOCH2CH3 would have the CH2 at around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, but here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide's adjacent group.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzoate ester with NH2 at position 4. So the structure would be OCOOCH2CH3 attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group at position 4.

So, the NMR would have:

- The ethyl group: CH2CH3 attached to the ester oxygen. The CH2CH3 would be triplet at around 1.2 ppm, which matches the 1.20 triplet. The OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.2, maybe as a quartet because the adjacent CH3 splits it. So, in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet at ~4.1 ppm. But in the data, the 4.0 is a broad singlet (2H). Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 is split into a quartet, but maybe in the data, it's a triplet elsewhere. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check the NMR data again.

The NMR signals are:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → ?

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → quartet, 2H.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) → aromatic, probably para-substituted.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) → aromatic, another pair.

So, the aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, a para-substituted benzene. So the substituent is at para position. So, for example, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents would be the ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and the NH2 at para positions.

Wait, no. 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group and the ester group on the benzene ring. Wait, that's not possible because the benzoate ester is the COOEt. So, the structure would be benzene with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4? No, actually, it's more likely that the ester is at the para position relative to the amino group. So, the benzene has COOEt and NH2 in para positions.

So, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data. So that's a good sign.

Now, the NMR data has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). That could be the OCH2 group in the ester. Because in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet (split by the adjacent CH3). So, the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.2, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe that's a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps another group.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the quartet is from a CH2 connected to an amide or amine group. For example, in an amide, the structure might have a CH2 group adjacent to the amide.

Wait, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be a benzamide (PhCONH-) with an ethoxy group at para position. So, the ethoxy group would have the OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be around 3.4-3.7 as a quartet. So, the 1.20 t is the ethoxy's CH3. Then, the OCH2 would be around 4 ppm. Wait, but in the NMR data, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a singlet at 4.0.

Alternatively, the quartet at 4.5 could be the NHCH2 group, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So, the propionate would be CH2CH2COO–. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO–. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 at para and a propionate group attached. The propionate would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is OCOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? Or wait, the propionate would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. So the structure is benzene with OCOCH2CH2CH3 and NH2 in para positions.

In that case, the NMR would have:

The ethyl group? Wait, no, propionate is a three-carbon chain. So the OCOOCH2CH2CH2-? No, wait, no. Wait, the propionate ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? No, propionate is CH2CH2COO–, so the ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. Hmm, maybe.

In that case, the CH2CH2CH3 group would have the terminal CH3 as a triplet. So the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) fits that. Then, the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet around 1.6 ppm (but I don't see that in the data). Wait, the data doesn't show that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate ester's structure is OCOCH2CH2CH3. So, the CH2CH2CH3 group: the CH3 at 1.20 (t), then the adjacent CH2 would be a triplet around 1.6 ppm, but that's not present in the data. The next CH2 (closer to the carbonyl) would be a quartet around 3.5-4.0 ppm. Wait, but the data has a quartet at 4.5. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from a CH2 connected to an oxygen, such as an ester's OCH2. Let me think about that.

Another approach: Let's list the possible structures and their expected NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions.

NMR:

- Ethyl group: OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be triplet at 1.2, which matches. The OCH2 would be quartet around 4.1 ppm. But in the data, it's at 4.5 as quartet. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the OCH2 is at 4.0 as a quartet, but in the data, it's a quartet at 4.5. So perhaps not matching.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from the CH2 adjacent to the amino group? But I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR data has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). That's a bit high, perhaps for an OCH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's an NHCH2 group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at the NMR data, another signal is at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet. 2H. That could be an NH2 group, but NH2 in DMSO-d6 would typically be broad, but in CDCl3, maybe not. Alternatively, it could be an amide NH. Wait, but in an amide, the NH would be a singlet, perhaps, but in the case of an aromatic amide, maybe it's a singlet.

Wait, but in the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene. So, if it's an amino group para to the ester, then the NH2 would be a singlet? Or would they split into a doublet? No, amino groups are usually broad and singlet, I think. But in the NMR data, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a singlet at 4.0. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is the NH2 group. But wait, NH2 is usually a broad peak, but integrating to 2H? Wait, NH2 protons are each one proton, so 2H would imply two protons, meaning an NH2. But I'm not sure about the integration. Alternatively, maybe it's an N-attached group. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Maybe how?

Wait, another option: looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: formamide (HCONH-) attached to a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at para position.

So, the structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 (para) and HCONH- attached to the same benzene.

Looking at the NMR:

The ethoxy group's CH3 is at 1.20 (t), which matches.

The OCH2 would be around 3.4-3.7, but in the data, there's a quartet at 4.5. Hmm.

The formamide group would have the CONH2. The NH2 in formamide would typically show up as a broad peak, perhaps around 8-9 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the NH is exchange broadened and appears elsewhere.

Wait, in formamide, the NH is around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. But in the given NMR, there's no signal above 8 ppm except the aromatic protons. So that might not fit.

Also, the carbonyl in formamide is around 1680-1700 cm-1 in IR, but the given is 1720, which is a bit higher, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is the NH group in the formamide. But I'm not sure.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: benzamide with ethoxy at position 3.

So, the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 3 and a CONH2 at position 1 (assuming benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene).

In this case, the NMR would have the ethoxy's CH3 as triplet at 1.20, OCH2 around 3.4-3.7 as quartet.

The amide NH would be around 8-9 ppm, but again, the data doesn't show that. So maybe not.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: benzene with NH2 at para and a propionate ester (O-CO-CH2CH2CH3) attached.

So, the propionate would have the ethyl group: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the structure is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene, which also has NH2.

The NMR would have:

- CH2CH2CH3: the terminal CH3 is a triplet around 1.20, which matches.

- The adjacent CH2 would be a quartet around 1.6 ppm, but that's not in the data.

- The next CH2 (closer to the carbonyl) would be a triplet around 2.5 ppm, but again, not present.

Wait, maybe the propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So, the CH2CH2CH3 group would have the CH3 as triplet, then the middle CH2 as a quartet, then the CH2 adjacent to carbonyl as triplet around 4.5 ppm? Hmm, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which could fit. The O-CO-CH2 would be around 4.5 as a quartet because it's adjacent to the CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but the middle CH2 in propionate is usually around 2.5 ppm. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, so the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be around 4.0-4.5.

Wait, the quartet at 4.5 (2H) could be the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Then, the next CH2 would be around 2.5, but that's not in the data. The data only has 1.20 (t), 4.0 (bs, 2H), 4.5 (q, 2H), and the aromatic.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1. So: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 → (20 -11 +1)/2 → 10/2 =5. So five degrees: likely a benzene ring (3), a carbonyl (1), and a double bond or ring. So the structure probably has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzene ring (3), amide (1 double bond), ethoxy (no additional unsaturation). So total 4 + 1? Wait, benzamide has CONH2, which is another double bond. So the degrees would be benzene (3) + CONH2 (1) + OCH2CH3 (no), so total 4. Hmm, but the molecular formula gives 5. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. The formula is C9H11NO2. So for option A: C9H11NO2.

3-ethoxybenzamide is C8H9NO2? Let me count: benzene (6C) + CONH2 (2C) + OCH2CH3 (2C) → 6+2+2=10, but that can't be right. Wait, wait. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Wait, no: benzamide is C6H5CONH2 → C7H7NO2. Then adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would make it C9H11NO2. So yes.

So all options have the correct formula.

Back to the NMR:

The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is a key part. Let's think about where this could come from.

In an ethyl ester, the OCH2 is typically a quartet around 4.1-4.3. If it's at 4.5, maybe it's a different group. Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen or nitrogen.

Wait, in the case of a propionate ester (option C), the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl is the one closer to the oxygen. Its protons would be split by the adjacent CH2. So, in the NMR, this would be a triplet around 4.0-4.2. But in the data, it's at 4.5 as a quartet. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to an amide. For instance, in a structure like RCONHR', where R' is CH2CH3. Hmm, but that's an amide with ethyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, looking back at the options, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions.

In the NMR, the ethyl group (OCH2CH3) would show as triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and quartet at around 4.1 or 4.2 ppm (OCH2). But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. However, sometimes the OCH2 can be shifted upfield or downfield depending on neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the OCH2, and the 4.0 is something else. But what would that be?

Wait, in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene. So, the NMR would have a peak for the NH2 protons. But in the data given, there's no peak around 5-6 ppm for NH2. Instead, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a singlet at 4.0.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 (bs, 2H) is not the NH2, but another group. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not showing up here because the sample is in DMSO and the NH2 is exchange broadened and not visible? Or perhaps the amine is deprotonated? Unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the IR again. The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1. For esters, that's a typical carbonyl. So maybe option D is correct.

Looking at the NMR:

- 1.20 triplet (3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): perhaps the OCH2, but it's a singlet. That doesn't fit because OCH2 in ester is a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 is at 4.5 as a quartet, which matches the data. Then what is the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)?

Wait, maybe the 4.0 is the NH2 group. But in which case, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but integrating to 2H. However, in an amine, each H is a separate proton. So an NH2 would have two protons, but in the NMR, it would appear as a broad peak, but integrating to 2H. So that could fit the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). But wait, in that case, why is it at 4.0? Because amino protons typically resonate lower, around 1-5 ppm, but more like 2-4 ppm. Wait, maybe not. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 is not the NH2. Maybe it's another group.

Wait, another thought: in the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is attached to the benzene ring. So, in the NMR, the NH2 protons would be a singlet, broad, integrating to 2H. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 group. Then the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 of the ester.

But wait, the OCH2 in ethyl ester is typically around 4.1-4.2 as a quartet. If it's at 4.5, perhaps there's some deshielding effect. Maybe due to the amino group on the ring, causing the OCH2 to shift downfield. That could explain it.

So putting this together:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 from ester.

Aromatic region:

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene. The lower ppm (7.0) would be the protons next to the electron-donating group (like NH2), while the higher (8.0) would be next to the ester (which is deactivating).

Wait, no. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so the protons ortho to it would be deshielded and appear downfield. The amino group is activating, so the protons ortho to it would be shielded and appear upfield. So, the substituents would be NH2 and COOEt at para positions.

So, the aromatic protons adjacent to NH2 would be upfield (~7.0), and those adjacent to COOEt would be downfield (~8.0). This matches the data.

So, the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 of the ester. The singlet at 4.0 would be the NH2 group, which is broad because of exchange with the solvent or because it's a secondary amine. Wait, but in this case, it's a primary amine, so the NH2 would typically show as a broad peak. But in the NMR data, it's a broad singlet integrating to 2H, which would fit.

So, putting it all together, option D seems to fit most of the data.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound C9H11NO2 is identified using the provided spectral data:

### IR Analysis:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Broad bands indicative of N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong band corresponding to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, likely from an ester or amide.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group (CH2CH3).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely corresponding to an NH2 group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, likely from the CH2 group in an ethyl ester (OCH2CH3).
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: Contains an ethoxy group and an amide. However, the IR carbonyl stretch for an amide typically appears at ~1680 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the NMR data does not support the expected splitting patterns for this structure.
- **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: Contains an ethoxy group and a formamide. The IR carbonyl stretch for a formamide (~1700 cm⁻¹) is slightly lower than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. Furthermore, the NMR data does not match the expected splitting for the ethoxy group or the formamide structure.
- **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: Contains an amino group and a propionate ester. The NMR data does not show signals consistent with the propionate chain, such as a triplet around 1.6 ppm for the CH2 group adjacent to the CH3.
- **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: Contains an amino group and an ethyl ester. The IR data matches the ester carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR data aligns well:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: CH3 of the ethyl group.
  - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: NH2 group.
  - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: CH2 of the ethyl ester.
  - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons on a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data is most consistent with **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**, as it matches the molecular formula, IR and NMR data, and structural features.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. Let's see... The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about the possible structures that fit this. So, the molecular formula has 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and two oxygens. The options given are A to D, each a different structure. Let me go through the spectroscopic data step by step.

First, the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, the intensity is medium to strong, so maybe it's an amide or something with an amino group. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, looking at the options, all have carbonyls except maybe some, but let me check. Amides and esters have carbonyls around 1680-1720. So, 1720 is probably an ester or maybe a ketone, but more likely an ester or amide.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So, the carbonyl is the amide, which would show around 1680 maybe, but the IR here is 1720. Maybe not? Or perhaps it's more of an amide I band.

Wait, benzamide's carbonyl is around 1660-1680, but if it's an ester, like ethyl ester, the carbonyl is around 1730-1750. Hmm, but the given is 1720. So maybe it's an amide? Or perhaps a conjugated amide? Alternatively, maybe an ester.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That's a formamide, so the carbonyl would be around 1700 perhaps. But 1720 is a bit higher. Maybe it's an amide with electron-withdrawing groups?

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is an ester (since it's an acid derivative). So the carbonyl would be higher, around 1720-1750. So this could fit. Also, if it's an ester, the O-H stretch from the amino group (if it's an amine, would show broad peaks in IR, but in the given IR, there are peaks at 3420 and 3325. That could be N-H stretching, like in an amine or amide. So, let's see.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's an ester, so the carbonyl at 1720 makes sense. The amino group would be NH2, so broad peaks in IR—maybe the 3420 and 3325 are the N-H stretches.

Wait, the IR shows two bands around 3400, which could be two different N-H stretches, perhaps in an amide or a primary amine. Alternatively, an amide might have a single stretch but maybe a broad one.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm triplet (3H): this is likely a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group. The triplet suggests that the ethyl is attached to something that splits the signal into a triplet. So maybe an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) or an ethyl ester (like OCOOCH2CH3). Wait, no, in an ester, the ethyl would be OCH2CH3, but wait, the splitting depends on adjacent groups.

Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) would be the CH2CH3 group. So, maybe connected to an O, making it an ethoxy group. Alternatively, it could be part of an ethyl ester, like in ethyl benzoate.

Next, 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H): could be an NH2 group. Because amines typically show broad signals, but wait, in the NMR, if it's an NH2, it would appear as a broad peak, but in the options, some have amide groups or amino groups. Alternatively, in an amide, the NH might be exchange broadened.

Wait, 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): a singlet, but 2H. Hmm, maybe an OCH2 group. Like an ethoxy group, where the ethoxy's O is connected to CH2CH3. Wait, no, that would be the CH2 next to O. Wait, but in an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), the OCH2 would be around 3.4-3.7 ppm, maybe as a quartet because the CH2 next to O is split by the CH3. Hmm, the 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH3, so maybe the OCH2 is at around 4.0? Wait, maybe the OCH2 is split into a quartet, but in this case, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, maybe not an OCH2.

Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm could be an NHCH2 group? Not sure. Another possibility: maybe it's a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom but not O. Or perhaps in an amide, the adjacent groups.

Wait, looking at the other signals:

4.5 ppm quartet (2H): quartet, 2H. So perhaps an ethyl group adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ester, the OCOOCH2CH3 would have the CH2 at around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, but here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide's adjacent group.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzoate ester with NH2 at position 4. So the structure would be OCOOCH2CH3 attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group at position 4.

So, the NMR would have:

- The ethyl group: CH2CH3 attached to the ester oxygen. The CH2CH3 would be triplet at around 1.2 ppm, which matches the 1.20 triplet. The OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.2, maybe as a quartet because the adjacent CH3 splits it. So, in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet at ~4.1 ppm. But in the data, the 4.0 is a broad singlet (2H). Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 is split into a quartet, but maybe in the data, it's a triplet elsewhere. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check the NMR data again.

The NMR signals are:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → ?

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → quartet, 2H.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) → aromatic, probably para-substituted.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) → aromatic, another pair.

So, the aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, a para-substituted benzene. So the substituent is at para position. So, for example, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents would be the ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and the NH2 at para positions.

Wait, no. 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group and the ester group on the benzene ring. Wait, that's not possible because the benzoate ester is the COOEt. So, the structure would be benzene with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4? No, actually, it's more likely that the ester is at the para position relative to the amino group. So, the benzene has COOEt and NH2 in para positions.

So, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data. So that's a good sign.

Now, the NMR data has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). That could be the OCH2 group in the ester. Because in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet (split by the adjacent CH3). So, the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.2, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe that's a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps another group.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the quartet is from a CH2 connected to an amide or amine group. For example, in an amide, the structure might have a CH2 group adjacent to the amide.

Wait, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be a benzamide (PhCONH-) with an ethoxy group at para position. So, the ethoxy group would have the OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be around 3.4-3.7 as a quartet. So, the 1.20 t is the ethoxy's CH3. Then, the OCH2 would be around 4 ppm. Wait, but in the NMR data, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a singlet at 4.0.

Alternatively, the quartet at 4.5 could be the NHCH2 group, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So, the propionate would be CH2CH2COO–. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO–. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 at para and a propionate group attached. The propionate would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is OCOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? Or wait, the propionate would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. So the structure is benzene with OCOCH2CH2CH3 and NH2 in para positions.

In that case, the NMR would have:

The ethyl group? Wait, no, propionate is a three-carbon chain. So the OCOOCH2CH2CH2-? No, wait, no. Wait, the propionate ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? No, propionate is CH2CH2COO–, so the ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. Hmm, maybe.

In that case, the CH2CH2CH3 group would have the terminal CH3 as a triplet. So the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) fits that. Then, the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet around 1.6 ppm (but I don't see that in the data). Wait, the data doesn't show that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate ester's structure is OCOCH2CH2CH3. So, the CH2CH2CH3 group: the CH3 at 1.20 (t), then the adjacent CH2 would be a triplet around 1.6 ppm, but that's not present in the data. The next CH2 (closer to the carbonyl) would be a quartet around 3.5-4.0 ppm. Wait, but the data has a quartet at 4.5. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from a CH2 connected to an oxygen, such as an ester's OCH2. Let me think about that.

Another approach: Let's list the possible structures and their expected NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions.

NMR:

- Ethyl group: OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be triplet at 1.2, which matches. The OCH2 would be quartet around 4.1 ppm. But in the data, it's at 4.5 as quartet. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the OCH2 is at 4.0 as a quartet, but in the data, it's a quartet at 4.5. So perhaps not matching.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from the CH2 adjacent to the amino group? But I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR data has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). That's a bit high, perhaps for an OCH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's an NHCH2 group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at the NMR data, another signal is at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet. 2H. That could be an NH2 group, but NH2 in DMSO-d6 would typically be broad, but in CDCl3, maybe not. Alternatively, it could be an amide NH. Wait, but in an amide, the NH would be a singlet, perhaps, but in the case of an aromatic amide, maybe it's a singlet.

Wait, but in the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene. So, if it's an amino group para to the ester, then the NH2 would be a singlet? Or would they split into a doublet? No, amino groups are usually broad and singlet, I think. But in the NMR data, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a singlet at 4.0. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is the NH2 group. But wait, NH2 is usually a broad peak, but integrating to 2H? Wait, NH2 protons are each one proton, so 2H would imply two protons, meaning an NH2. But I'm not sure about the integration. Alternatively, maybe it's an N-attached group. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Maybe how?

Wait, another option: looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: formamide (HCONH-) attached to a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at para position.

So, the structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 (para) and HCONH- attached to the same benzene.

Looking at the NMR:

The ethoxy group's CH3 is at 1.20 (t), which matches.

The OCH2 would be around 3.4-3.7, but in the data, there's a quartet at 4.5. Hmm.

The formamide group would have the CONH2. The NH2 in formamide would typically show up as a broad peak, perhaps around 8-9 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the NH is exchange broadened and appears elsewhere.

Wait, in formamide, the NH is around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. But in the given NMR, there's no signal above 8 ppm except the aromatic protons. So that might not fit.

Also, the carbonyl in formamide is around 1680-1700 cm-1 in IR, but the given is 1720, which is a bit higher, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is the NH group in the formamide. But I'm not sure.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: benzamide with ethoxy at position 3.

So, the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 3 and a CONH2 at position 1 (assuming benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene).

In this case, the NMR would have the ethoxy's CH3 as triplet at 1.20, OCH2 around 3.4-3.7 as quartet.

The amide NH would be around 8-9 ppm, but again, the data doesn't show that. So maybe not.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: benzene with NH2 at para and a propionate ester (O-CO-CH2CH2CH3) attached.

So, the propionate would have the ethyl group: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the structure is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene, which also has NH2.

The NMR would have:

- CH2CH2CH3: the terminal CH3 is a triplet around 1.20, which matches.

- The adjacent CH2 would be a quartet around 1.6 ppm, but that's not in the data.

- The next CH2 (closer to the carbonyl) would be a triplet around 2.5 ppm, but again, not present.

Wait, maybe the propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So, the CH2CH2CH3 group would have the CH3 as triplet, then the middle CH2 as a quartet, then the CH2 adjacent to carbonyl as triplet around 4.5 ppm? Hmm, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which could fit. The O-CO-CH2 would be around 4.5 as a quartet because it's adjacent to the CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but the middle CH2 in propionate is usually around 2.5 ppm. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, so the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be around 4.0-4.5.

Wait, the quartet at 4.5 (2H) could be the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Then, the next CH2 would be around 2.5, but that's not in the data. The data only has 1.20 (t), 4.0 (bs, 2H), 4.5 (q, 2H), and the aromatic.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1. So: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 → (20 -11 +1)/2 → 10/2 =5. So five degrees: likely a benzene ring (3), a carbonyl (1), and a double bond or ring. So the structure probably has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzene ring (3), amide (1 double bond), ethoxy (no additional unsaturation). So total 4 + 1? Wait, benzamide has CONH2, which is another double bond. So the degrees would be benzene (3) + CONH2 (1) + OCH2CH3 (no), so total 4. Hmm, but the molecular formula gives 5. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. The formula is C9H11NO2. So for option A: C9H11NO2.

3-ethoxybenzamide is C8H9NO2? Let me count: benzene (6C) + CONH2 (2C) + OCH2CH3 (2C) → 6+2+2=10, but that can't be right. Wait, wait. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Wait, no: benzamide is C6H5CONH2 → C7H7NO2. Then adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would make it C9H11NO2. So yes.

So all options have the correct formula.

Back to the NMR:

The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is a key part. Let's think about where this could come from.

In an ethyl ester, the OCH2 is typically a quartet around 4.1-4.3. If it's at 4.5, maybe it's a different group. Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen or nitrogen.

Wait, in the case of a propionate ester (option C), the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl is the one closer to the oxygen. Its protons would be split by the adjacent CH2. So, in the NMR, this would be a triplet around 4.0-4.2. But in the data, it's at 4.5 as a quartet. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to an amide. For instance, in a structure like RCONHR', where R' is CH2CH3. Hmm, but that's an amide with ethyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, looking back at the options, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions.

In the NMR, the ethyl group (OCH2CH3) would show as triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and quartet at around 4.1 or 4.2 ppm (OCH2). But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. However, sometimes the OCH2 can be shifted upfield or downfield depending on neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the OCH2, and the 4.0 is something else. But what would that be?

Wait, in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene. So, the NMR would have a peak for the NH2 protons. But in the data given, there's no peak around 5-6 ppm for NH2. Instead, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a singlet at 4.0.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 (bs, 2H) is not the NH2, but another group. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not showing up here because the sample is in DMSO and the NH2 is exchange broadened and not visible? Or perhaps the amine is deprotonated? Unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the IR again. The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1. For esters, that's a typical carbonyl. So maybe option D is correct.

Looking at the NMR:

- 1.20 triplet (3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): perhaps the OCH2, but it's a singlet. That doesn't fit because OCH2 in ester is a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 is at 4.5 as a quartet, which matches the data. Then what is the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)?

Wait, maybe the 4.0 is the NH2 group. But in which case, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but integrating to 2H. However, in an amine, each H is a separate proton. So an NH2 would have two protons, but in the NMR, it would appear as a broad peak, but integrating to 2H. So that could fit the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). But wait, in that case, why is it at 4.0? Because amino protons typically resonate lower, around 1-5 ppm, but more like 2-4 ppm. Wait, maybe not. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 is not the NH2. Maybe it's another group.

Wait, another thought: in the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is attached to the benzene ring. So, in the NMR, the NH2 protons would be a singlet, broad, integrating to 2H. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 group. Then the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 of the ester.

But wait, the OCH2 in ethyl ester is typically around 4.1-4.2 as a quartet. If it's at 4.5, perhaps there's some deshielding effect. Maybe due to the amino group on the ring, causing the OCH2 to shift downfield. That could explain it.

So putting this together:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 from ester.

Aromatic region:

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene. The lower ppm (7.0) would be the protons next to the electron-donating group (like NH2), while the higher (8.0) would be next to the ester (which is deactivating).

Wait, no. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so the protons ortho to it would be deshielded and appear downfield. The amino group is activating, so the protons ortho to it would be shielded and appear upfield. So, the substituents would be NH2 and COOEt at para positions.

So, the aromatic protons adjacent to NH2 would be upfield (~7.0), and those adjacent to COOEt would be downfield (~8.0). This matches the data.

So, the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 of the ester. The singlet at 4.0 would be the NH2 group, which is broad because of exchange with the solvent or because it's a secondary amine. Wait, but in this case, it's a primary amine, so the NH2 would typically show as a broad peak. But in the NMR data, it's a broad singlet integrating to 2H, which would fit.

So, putting it all together, option D seems to fit most of the data.


The compound C9H11NO2 is identified using the provided spectral data:

### IR Analysis:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Broad bands indicative of N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong band corresponding to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, likely from an ester or amide.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group (CH2CH3).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely corresponding to an NH2 group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, likely from the CH2 group in an ethyl ester (OCH2CH3).
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: Contains an ethoxy group and an amide. However, the IR carbonyl stretch for an amide typically appears at ~1680 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the NMR data does not support the expected splitting patterns for this structure.
- **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: Contains an ethoxy group and a formamide. The IR carbonyl stretch for a formamide (~1700 cm⁻¹) is slightly lower than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. Furthermore, the NMR data does not match the expected splitting for the ethoxy group or the formamide structure.
- **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: Contains an amino group and a propionate ester. The NMR data does not show signals consistent with the propionate chain, such as a triplet around 1.6 ppm for the CH2 group adjacent to the CH3.
- **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: Contains an amino group and an ethyl ester. The IR data matches the ester carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR data aligns well:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: CH3 of the ethyl group.
  - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: NH2 group.
  - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: CH2 of the ethyl ester.
  - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons on a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data is most consistent with **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**, as it matches the molecular formula, IR and NMR data, and structural features.
