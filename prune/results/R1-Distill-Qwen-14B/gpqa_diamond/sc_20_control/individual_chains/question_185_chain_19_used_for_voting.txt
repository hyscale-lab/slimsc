Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ·n. Hmm, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ is a vector made up of the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some direction on the sphere. ε is just an energy constant.

Wait, I remember that when you have a spin operator in a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is something like H = -γ B · σ, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But in this case, it's just ε times the dot product of σ and n. So the form is similar, but without the negative and without the constants from the magnetic field.

The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1/2 multiplied by some factor, but wait, no, each Pauli matrix alone doesn't have those as eigenvalues. Wait, no—the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. Because, for example, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

But wait, when we have a spin in a magnetic field in the z-direction, the Hamiltonian is proportional to σ_z. The eigenvalues are ±ℏ/2, right? Because the spin matrices are (ℏ/2) σ matrices. Wait, let me think.

The spin operator S is given by (ℏ/2) σ. So if H is proportional to σ·n, then H would be proportional to S·n, but scaled by something.

Wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ·n. So let's write that out as H = ε (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z). So each component is a Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of the unit vector n.

Eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix product? Well, for any operator of the form a·σ, where a is a vector, the eigenvalues are ±|a|. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1, so their eigenvalues are plus or minus the magnitude of a.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The operator a·σ, where a is a vector, is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues can be found by considering that the matrix is a sum of scaled Pauli matrices.

The general approach is that for a matrix like A = a·σ, the eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0. So let's compute that.

Alternatively, I remember that the eigenvalues of a·σ are ±|a|. Because when you have a vector a=(a_x,a_y,a_z), then a·σ is the sum a_x σ_x + a_y σ_y + a_z σ_z. The trace is zero, and the determinant is -1. So the eigenvalues are λ and -λ, where λ^2 = (a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2) because the trace is zero (so λ + (-λ) =0, and the product is -λ^2 = determinant = -1 → λ^2 =1 → λ=±1. Wait, but that's if a is a unit vector.

Wait, no, I think I messed up. Let me think again. The trace of a·σ is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant of a·σ is (a_x a_y a_z ... ) Wait, maybe a different approach.

Wait, the matrix a·σ is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute its square. (a·σ)^2 = (a_x σ_x + a_y σ_y + a_z σ_z)^2.

Expanding this, each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), because σ_i^2 = I for each i. The cross terms are σ_i σ_j, which is i ε_ijk σ_k. But when you square a·σ, you get a_x^2 I + a_y^2 I + a_z^2 I + cross terms. The cross terms would involve terms like a_x a_y (σ_x σ_y) + a_x a_z (σ_x σ_z) + etc. But each σ_i σ_j is i ε_ijk σ_k, which for i≠j would be an imaginary term. However, when you sum all the cross terms in (a·σ)^2, they will combine to give (a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2) I, because the cross terms are each a multiple of σ_k, but when squared, the trace would just be the sum of squares.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the square of a·σ is (a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2) I. Because σ_i σ_i = I, and the cross terms like σ_i σ_j (i≠j) will contribute 2i ε_ijk σ_k, but when you take the trace, those terms (which are anti-hermitian) could complicate things. Alternatively, I know that the eigenvalues of a·σ are ±|a|, because (a·σ)^2 = |a|^2 I. So the eigenvalues of (a·σ) must be ±|a|.

Wait, that's probably the key. Because (a·σ)^2 = |a|^2 I, then each eigenvalue λ of a·σ must satisfy λ^2 = |a|^2. So λ is ±|a|.

In our problem, a is ε n. Because H = ε σ·n, which is the same as (ε n)·σ. So the vector a in this case is a = ε n. So |a| is sqrt( (ε n_x)^2 + (ε n_y)^2 + (ε n_z)^2 ) = ε sqrt(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 ) = ε * 1, because n is a unit vector. So |a|= ε.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ± ε. Because each eigenvalue of a·σ is ± |a|, which is ± ε.

So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. Looking at the options, that's option B: +ε and -ε.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes spin matrices have factors of ħ/2. Oh wait, the question says that the components of σ are the Pauli spin matrices. Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, but in quantum mechanics, spin operators are often written as S = (ħ/2) σ. So if the Hamiltonian was written using S, it would be H = ε (2 S · n) / ħ. Hmm, but in this case, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ·n, which would imply that it's using the Pauli matrices directly. So the eigenvalues would be ± ε.

So the correct eigenvalues are ± ε. So option B is the answer.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\varepsilon\) is an energy constant, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. To find the eigenvalues of \(H\), we analyze the structure of the operator.

The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, weighted by the components of \(\vec{n}\). For any vector \(\vec{a}\), the eigenvalues of the operator \(\vec{a} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\) are \(\pm |\vec{a}|\), where \(|\vec{a}|\) is the magnitude of the vector. In this case, \(\vec{a} = \varepsilon \vec{n}\), and since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the magnitude \(|\vec{a}| = \varepsilon\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B) \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\)**.
