Okay, so I've just come across this physics problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm, so the glass is moving, and we need to find the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame. I remember that when objects are moving relative to each other, especially at significant fractions of the speed of light, we have to consider special relativity. But wait, glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is in the glass. Since the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, and toward the observer, I need to think about how this affects the observed speed.

Wait, but the question is about the speed of light in the glass. Oh, but wait, light's speed in the glass is already known, right? Because the refractive index n is given. The speed of light in the medium is c/n, but since c is 1 here, it's 1/n. But that's the speed in the glass when the glass is at rest relative to the observer.

But here, the glass itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed? I think this is a case where we have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). Wait, but wait, let me get that right. Because in this case, the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving at u = (speed in glass) in the glass's frame, then what's u' in the lab frame?

Wait, the light's speed in the glass frame is u = c/n, but since c is 1, u = 1/n. But wait, actually, when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is not just u + v. Because things get more complicated with relativity. So the velocity addition formula applies here.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the direction. The glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the light. Wait, same direction as the beam, so if the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Let me think, the light is propagating through the glass, which is itself moving towards the observer. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at velocity u = c/n (since the glass has refractive index n). But in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So we need to transform the velocity of the light from the glass's frame to the lab's frame.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So what is the lab's measurement of the light's speed?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the speed of light must always be c in any inertial frame, but wait, no. Because the light is inside the glass, which has a refractive index. Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in a medium is not c. Or is it? Hmm, that's a point I'm a bit fuzzy on. Wait, in a medium, the speed of light is less than c, but in the medium's rest frame. But according to special relativity, the speed of light in a medium isn't c, so that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Let me set this up: in the frame of the glass (let's call it frame S'), the light is moving at velocity u' = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (frame S). So the light's velocity in the lab frame (S) can be found using the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. Wait, the velocity addition formula is for transforming velocities from S' to S. So if in S', the light's velocity is u', then in S, the velocity u is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, I'm getting the direction right? Because the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then in S', the light's velocity would be u' = c/n in the direction of motion. But wait, wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n towards the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to imagine a scenario. The glass is moving to the right at velocity v in the lab frame. The light is moving to the right through the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u' = c/n to the right. Now, from the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, so the light's speed will be more than u' plus v? But according to relativity, velocities don't just add linearly.

So applying the velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/(c²))

But since c is 1 (as given), the equation becomes:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v )

But u' is the speed of light in the glass, which is 1/n. So substituting:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

But wait, that can't be right because if the glass is moving at speed v, and the light is moving at 1/n in the glass's frame, then in the lab frame, it should be a combination of those velocities.

Wait a second, but according to the problem statement, the glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer in the laboratory, and the light is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So in the lab frame, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So when the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame would be higher than in the glass's frame.

Wait, but I think I might be mixing up frames. Let me think again.

In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u' = 1/n. The glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So we need to find the lab frame's measurement of the light's speed.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, if in S' (glass frame), the light's speed is u' = 1/n, then in S (lab frame), moving at velocity v relative to S', the light's speed is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v) / c² )

But wait, I think I might have the sign wrong. Because when the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S (lab frame), then the transformation from S' to S is when you go from S' (which is moving at v) to S. So the formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²))

So substituting u' = 1/n, and c=1,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) * v )

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see. Let's compute that:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to simplify:

Numerator: (1 + n v )

Denominator: (n + v )

So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, but that's option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v )

So that would be the correct answer. So option A.

Wait, but I should check whether the direction of the velocity is correct. Because if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, then the light's speed in the lab frame should be higher than 1/n. Let's plug in some numbers to check.

Suppose v is positive. Suppose n is 1, so it's vacuum. Then according to the formula, u would be (1 + 1 * v) / (1 + v ) = (1 + v)/(1 + v ) = 1, which makes sense because in a vacuum, light's speed is always 1, regardless of the frame's velocity.

Another test: suppose v=0. Then u would be (1 + 0)/(n +0) = 1/n, which is correct because the glass isn't moving, so the speed in the lab is 1/n.

Wait, if v is negative, like moving in the opposite direction, I guess the formula still works, but perhaps that's beyond this problem.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at velocity \(v\) in the lab frame, and the speed of light in the glass (in the glass's rest frame) is \(u' = \frac{1}{n}\), where \(n\) is the refractive index of the glass. 

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Since the speed of light in a vacuum is \(c = 1\), this simplifies to:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

Substituting \(u' = \frac{1}{n}\), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{1}{n} v}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \(n\):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Testing special cases confirms the result: (1) if \(v = 0\), the speed reduces to \(\frac{1}{n}\), consistent with the speed of light in a stationary medium; (2) if \(n = 1\) (vacuum), the speed is always 1, as expected for light in a vacuum. Thus, the correct answer is:
