Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I can convert to liters because molarity is in mol/L. Oh right, 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 200 cm³ is 0.2 L.

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions.

Wait, I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. They're both related to phosphate ions but in different forms. So maybe they're part of a buffer solution?

But first, I think I need to calculate the moles of each compound. Let's start with KH2PO4.

The molecular weight (Mw) of KH2PO4 is given as 136.09 g/mol. Moles are mass divided by Mw. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007344 mol. So about 0.007344 moles of KH2PO4.

Then, for Na2HPO4·2H2O, the Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me see, 1/177.99 is roughly 0.005613 moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, but when Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves, does it dissociate into Na+ and HPO4^2-? And the 2H2O is just water, so it doesn't contribute to ions. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, I have from KH2PO4: H2PO4^- ions. Each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

And from Na2HPO4: HPO4^2- ions.

But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. Hmm, so I need to find [PO4^3-] in solution.

Wait, but how does this happen? PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, which is the deprotonated form of H2PO4^-.

So I think this solution is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are related by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid.

Let me think about the dissociation steps. H3PO4 is triprotic.

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So in solution, H2PO4^- can lose another proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

But in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- present because we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So this is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-. So I'm thinking that to find [PO4^3-], I might consider the third dissociation step. So the third step is HPO4^2- losing a proton to form PO4^3-.

So in solution, the concentration of PO4^3- would be influenced by the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; maybe the presence of both can affect the concentration of PO4^3- through their respective dissociation steps. Hmm, maybe I need to consider all three steps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the PO4^3- comes primarily from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is acting as a buffer, and I can find the pH first, then use that to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- directly. So maybe I can find the concentration of HPO4^2- and then calculate the PO4^3- based on the third Ka.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4.
2. Calculate moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O.
3. Find the concentrations of these ions in the solution.
4. Since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.
5. Then, use that pH to determine the concentration of PO4^3- via the third dissociation.

Wait, but maybe I can approach it using the charge balance or considering all species. Alternatively, perhaps the concentrations of HPO4^2- and PO4^3- are related by the third dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression for the third dissociation and solve for [PO4^3-].

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

The concentration of H+ in solution can be found using the pH from the buffer solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the pH using the buffer equation involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007344 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

So in solution, after dissolving and dissociating:

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O.

So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 0.2 L.

So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.03672 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.028065 M.

Now, these two can be considered as a buffer system. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. The relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 ≈ 7.21 (since pKa = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21).

So plugging into the equation:

pH = 7.21 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03672 M.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.7645.

The log of 0.7645 is approximately log(0.7645) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.115 ≈ 7.095.

Now, with the pH known, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

The expression for Ka3 is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, and [H+] can be found from pH.

pH is 7.095 → [H+] = 10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.29e-8 M.

So plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.29e-8).

Let me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 ≈ 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.29e-8 → so 5.0517e-14 / 8.29e-8 ≈ 6.098e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028065:

0.028065 is about 2.8065e-2.

1.8e-12 * 2.8065e-2 = (1.8 * 2.8065) * 1e-14.

1.8 * 2.8065 ≈ 5.0517.

So 5.0517e-14.

Divide by 8.29e-8 → 5.0517e-14 / 8.29e-8.

5.0517e-14 / 8.29e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.29) ) * 1e-6.

5.0517 / 8.29 ≈ 0.6098.

So 0.6098e-6 → 6.098e-7 M.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 3.97e-7 M and option B is 5.48e-7. So my calculation gives about 6.1e-7, which isn't one of the options. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's go back and check each step.

First, the moles:

KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol → let me calculate it more accurately.

136.09 is close to 136.1.

1 / 136.1 ≈ 0.007344 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g / 177.99 g/mol.

177.99 is approximately 178.

1 / 178 ≈ 0.005618 mol. So 0.005613 is correct.

Concentration in 0.2 L: 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M. Correct.

0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M. Correct.

Henderson-Hasselbalch for pH: pKa2 is for H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-.

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → Let's compute it more accurately.

log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 + (-8) = -7.2076 → pKa2 = 7.2076.

[HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.7645.

log(0.7645): Let me compute it accurately.

Log(0.7645) → since 10^(-0.115) is about 0.7645. Wait, but more accurately.

Let me compute log(0.7645):

We can use calculator-like steps.

I know that log(0.75) is about -0.1249, and log(0.7645) is a bit higher.

Wait, alternatively, using exact calculation:

Using logarithm tables or a calculator (but since I don't have one, I'll approximate).

Let me consider that 10^0.115 ≈ 1.3, but wait, no. Wait, 10^(-0.115) is about 0.7645. Because 10^0.115 is about 1.298, so 1/1.298 ≈ 0.7698. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that ln(0.7645) is approximately -0.267.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the pH calculation is correct, around 7.095, but let's proceed.

Then, [H+] = 10^(-7.095) → Let me compute this more accurately.

7.095 is 7 + 0.095.

So 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.095 → 10^(-0.095) ≈ 0.829.

So 1e-7 * 0.829 ≈ 8.29e-8 M. That's correct.

Now, calculating [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12) * (0.028065) / (8.29e-8) → Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 1.8 * 0.028065e-12 = 0.050517e-12 → 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.29e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 / 8.29e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.29) * 1e-6.

5.0517 divided by 8.29: Let's compute that.

8.29 * 0.6 = 4.974. 5.0517 - 4.974 = 0.0777. So 0.6 plus 0.0777/8.29 ≈ 0.6 + 0.00937 = 0.60937.

So 0.60937e-6 → 6.0937e-7 M.

Hmm, so [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.09e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B)5.48e-7 

C)2.81e-7 

D)3.97e-7.

So closest is option A (6.24e-7), but my calculation is 6.09e-7, which is near option A.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Maybe I should consider the contribution of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- to the PO4^3- concentration.

Wait, another approach: the total phosphate species in solution is H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in this solution, is there any H3PO4? Probably not, because the salts are dissociated into H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is not a buffer for the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- but for another pair. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the PO4^3- comes from both the HPO4^2- and any other dissociations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the overall charge balance.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the charge balance. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the pH calculation is correct, but maybe I need to consider the contribution of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- to the H+ in solution more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the buffer equation is correct, and the pH is 7.095, leading to [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.1e-7 M. But none of the options exactly match. The closest is A) 6.24e-7.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check more accurately.

Wait, when I calculated the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-], I got 0.028065 / 0.03672 = approximately 0.7645.

But let me compute this more accurately.

0.028065 ÷ 0.03672 → let's compute.

0.028065 / 0.03672 ≈ let's convert to 28065 / 36720 → let's compute 28065 ÷ 36720.

Let me compute 28065 ÷ 36720.

Well, 36720 * 0.7645 = 36720 * 0.76 = 27811.2, and 36720 * 0.0045=165.24 → 27811.2 + 165.24=27976.44. Which is close to 28065. So the ratio is about 0.7645.

So the log of 0.7645 is approximately -0.115, leading to pH = 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.095) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.095) = 1e-7 * 0.829=8.29e-8.

So that part is correct.

So, then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.29e-8.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this division more accurately.

Let me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028065.

1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.

Now, 5.0517e-14 divided by 8.29e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 / 8.29e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.29) * 1e-6.

Compute 5.0517 /8.29: Let me do this division.

8.29 * 0.6 = 4.974.

Subtract that from 5.0517: 5.0517 -4.974=0.0777.

Bring down a zero: 0.0777 → 0.7770.

8.29 goes into 7.770 about 0.937 times (since 8.29 * 0.09=0.7461). 0.7770 - 0.7461=0.0309.

Bring down another zero: 0.0309 → 0.3090.

8.29 goes into 0.3090 about 0.037 times (8.29 * 0.0037=0.030873). Subtract that and we get 0.000027.

So total is approximately 0.6 + 0.09 + 0.0037=0.6937.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the long division. Let me think of it differently.

Wait, 5.0517 /8.29 → let's approximate.

8.29 × 0.6 = 4.974 → as before.

So 0.6 gives 4.974. The remainder is 5.0517 -4.974=0.0777.

Now, 0.0777 /8.29 → since 8.29 × 0.00937 = ~0.0777.

So 0.6 + 0.00937=0.60937.

So 5.0517 /8.29 ≈0.60937.

So [PO4^3-] = 0.60937e-6 = 6.0937e-7 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.09e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. So that's very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because PO4^3- is formed from HPO4^2-, but perhaps the solution's pH is slightly different, which affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- correctly, but when considering the third dissociation, the [PO4^3-] is indeed 6.1e-7, which isn't exactly any of the options but is closest to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028065 M, and we're using the third dissociation.

Another approach: Using the expression for Ka3:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]

Which is what we did.

But maybe I should compute [H+] more accurately.

Given that the pH is 7.095, [H+] is 10^-7.095.

Let me compute that.

10^(-7.095) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.095).

Compute 10^(-0.095):

We can write it as 10^(-0.095) = e^(-0.095 * ln(10)).

ln(10) is approximately 2.302585.

So, 0.095 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.218745.

So e^(-0.218745) ≈ 1 - 0.218745 + (0.218745^2)/2 - ... Approximately.

But alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, I know that 10^(-0.1) ≈ 0.7943.

Since 0.095 is slightly less than 0.1, 10^(-0.095) would be slightly higher than 0.7943.

Perhaps closer to 0.829 as I calculated earlier.

So, [H+] = 8.29e-8 M.

So, perhaps the calculation is correct.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.24e-7.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of the salts.

Wait, let me recompute the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 g/mol → 136.09 is approximately 136.1.

1 ÷ 136.1 = 0.007344 moles. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.

177.99 is 178 approximately.

1 ÷ 178 = 0.005618 moles. So 0.005613 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the concentrations are not 0.03672 and 0.028065 M.

Wait, 0.007344 mol in 0.2 L is 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.

0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M. Correct.

So that part is correct.

Another point: perhaps the buffer equation is not the right approach because the solution could have other sources of H+.

Wait, but the solution is made from two salts that only contribute HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, so the buffer equation should be applicable.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possibility of the solution being at the pKa3 of HPO4^2-.

Wait, pKa3 is for the third dissociation, HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 → pKa3 ≈ 11.74.

But the solution's pH is ~7, which is lower than pKa3, meaning that the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2- and doesn't dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but that's correct because the pH (7.095) is much lower than the pKa3 (11.74), so the [PO4^3-] should be very low, which aligns with the options given.

But why is the calculated value not matching any option? Maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem differently.

The total concentration of phosphate species is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] + [H3PO4].

But in this case, [H3PO4] is negligible because the pH is around 7, and H3PO4 is a stronger acid (Ka1 is 7.5e-3, pKa1 around 2.12). So [H3PO4] is likely negligible.

So, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But for [PO4^3-], it's determined by the third dissociation.

Another approach: Using the relation between the species.

From the second dissociation, H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8).

And the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12).

We can also write the overall reaction from H2PO4^- to PO4^3-.

H2PO4^- ⇌ 2H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka = Ka2 * Ka3.

But perhaps that's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of H+ in solution is determined by the buffer, and so [PO4^3-] is as calculated.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the equilibrium for the third dissociation.

At equilibrium,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M (initial) - some x.

But since the pH is around 7 and pKa3 is 11.74, at pH 7, the [PO4^3-] is indeed very small, so x is negligible compared to 0.028065, so we can approximate [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.028065 M.

Thus, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which is the same as before.

So, perhaps the calculation is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: Using the exact solution for the buffer system.

The buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Which is what we did.

So, [H+] = 10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.29e-8.

Wait, perhaps I should use more accurate values for the moles.

Let me compute the exact moles again.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 g/mol → 136.09.

1/136.09 = 0.007344 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.

177.99 → 177.99.

1/177.99 = 0.005613 mol.

Concentration in 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

So the same as before.

After all, perhaps the correct answer is A)6.24e-7 M, but my calculation gives 6.09e-7, which is close.

But perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the solution isn't a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but that doesn't make sense because PO4^3- is much less in concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and that the phosphate exists in multiple forms, but the PO4^3- comes only from the third dissociation.

Hmm, another thought: Maybe the solution's concentration isn't just 0.03672 M for H2PO4^- and 0.028065 for HPO4^2-, because when Na2HPO4 dissolves, it contributes HPO4^2- and Na+ ions. Similarly, KH2PO4 contributes H2PO4^- and K+.

But the Na+ and K+ are spectator ions and don't affect the pH directly.

Wait, another possible mistake: perhaps the total concentration of phosphate is the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but perhaps I should consider the fact that some H2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+, and some HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but in the buffer solution, the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so their concentrations are determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Since my calculation gives approximately 6.1e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7), but perhaps the correct answer is D)3.97e-7 M, and I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution isn't a buffer solution, and the assumption about pH is incorrect. Maybe I should calculate the pH based on the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the phosphate buffer, but that's what I already did.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that HPO4^2- is a base and H2PO4^- is an acid, making the buffer equation correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the pH is correct, and the calculation is right, but when I look at the options, perhaps I should double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact pH.

Wait, let me compute the pH more accurately.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = 7.2076.

log(0.7645) → let me compute it using a more precise method.

Let me use the natural logarithm and then convert.

ln(0.7645) ≈ -0.268.

So log(0.7645) = ln(0.7645) / ln(10) ≈ (-0.268)/2.3026 ≈ -0.116.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.116 = 7.0916.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0916) → compute this precisely.

Compute 10^(-7.0916) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0916).

Compute 10^(-0.0916):

We can use the Taylor series for 10^x around x=0.

Alternatively, using the fact that ln(10^x) = x ln(10).

But perhaps a better approach is to use the approximation:

log(8.25) ≈ 0.916?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 10^0.0916.

Wait, 10^0.09= approx 1.23, 10^0.0916 is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach, 10^(0.0916) ≈ 1.234.

So 10^(-0.0916) ≈ 1/1.234 ≈ 0.810.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.810 ≈ 8.10e-8 M.

Now, recalculating [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.10e-8 → numerator is 5.0517e-14, denominator 8.10e-8.

5.0517e-14 /8.10e-8 → 5.0517 /8.10 → approximately 0.6237 → 0.6237e-6 → 6.237e-7 M.

Ah, so that's about 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A exactly.

So perhaps I made a minor calculation error earlier, but upon more precise calculation, it comes to 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts, $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$ and $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$, and their contributions to the buffer system involving $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ and $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$. The concentration of $\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ arises from the third dissociation step:

\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$ and $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$
- Moles of $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$:
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007344 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Moles of $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$:
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ and $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$
The total volume of the solution is $200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2000 \, \text{L}$. Thus:
- $[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007344 \, \text{mol}}{0.2000 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03672 \, \text{M}$,
- $[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005613 \, \text{mol}}{0.2000 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M}$.

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ (acid) and $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$ (base), with $K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}$:
\[
\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(K_a2) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21.
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}\right),
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.028065}{0.03672}\right).
\]
The ratio $\frac{0.028065}{0.03672} \approx 0.7645$, and $\log(0.7645) \approx -0.115$. Thus:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate $[\text{PO}_4^{3-}]$ using $K_a3$
The third dissociation is:
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]
The expression for $K_a3$ is:
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}.
\]
Rearranging for $[\text{PO}_4^{3-}]$:
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]
From $\text{pH} = 7.095$, $[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.095} \approx 8.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}$. Substituting:
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.29 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065) \approx 5.0517 \times 10^{-14}.
\]
Then, divide by $8.29 \times 10^{-8}$:
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.29 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.09 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of $\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ is approximately $6.09 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$, which is closest to option **A) $6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$**.
