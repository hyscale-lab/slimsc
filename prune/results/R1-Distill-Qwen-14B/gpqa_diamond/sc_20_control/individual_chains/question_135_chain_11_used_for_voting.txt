Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh right, usually in the Lagrangian, the interaction terms involve the coupling of the boson to fermions. So I think this term is saying that the boson X couples to fermions with some coupling strength λ. The fermions involved are probably the ones denoted by ψ_f(y), and f is maybe a type of fermion, like electrons, quarks, etc.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the energy (mass) of X is enough to produce the daughter particles.

Okay, so the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term couples X to two fermions. So the decay X → f f̄ should be possible if the mass of X is at least twice the mass of the fermion f.

Wait, but which fermions are involved here? The Lagrangian includes ψ_f(y), which I think represents various fermions. Let me think about the possible fermions. The options given in the choices include particles like b quarks, c quarks, s, u, d, tau leptons, muons, electrons, etc.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Now, I need to check the rest mass of each possible fermion to see if 6 GeV is at least twice that mass. Because the decay X → f f̄ requires that 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Let me list the masses of the fermions I can think of:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): about 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.777 GeV
- Quarks:
   - Up (u): ~0.003 GeV
   - Down (d): ~0.004 GeV
   - Strange (s): ~0.1 GeV
   - Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
   - Bottom (b): ~4.1 GeV
   - Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Other particles like the W boson are about 80 GeV, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, wait. But in the Lagrangian given, is the coupling to all possible fermions? Because the way it's written, maybe it's a Yukawa coupling, which usually couples to a specific fermion. Wait, the problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So the term is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I'm getting the notation wrong. Wait, perhaps the 'f' is a type of fermion, like each ψ_f is a specific fermion. So the interaction term is for each type of fermion f.

So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair for which the X is heavy enough.

So, for each fermion, check if m_X >= 2 m_f.

Let's go through each possible fermion:

- e: m_e ~ 0.0005 GeV. 2m_e ~ 0.001 GeV. X's mass is 6 GeV, way larger. So decay to e+ e- is allowed.

- μ: m_mu ~ 0.105 GeV. 2m_mu ~ 0.21 GeV. So allowed.

- τ: m_tau ~1.777 GeV. 2m_tau ~3.554 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so allowed.

- u quark: m_u ~0.003 GeV. 2m_u ~0.006 GeV. Allowed.

- d quark: similar to u, 2m_d is about 0.008 GeV. Allowed.

- s quark: m_s ~0.1 GeV, 2m_s ~0.2 GeV. Allowed.

- c quark: m_c ~1.27 GeV, 2m_c ~2.54 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so allowed.

- b quark: m_b ~4.1 GeV, so 2m_b ~8.2 GeV. Oh wait, X is 6 GeV. So 6 < 8.2 → not allowed. So X cannot decay into b quark pair.

Similarly, top quark is way too heavy, but X can't decay into tt̄ anyway because m_t is around 173 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV.

So looking back at the options, which include the possible decay channels.

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

But wait, X can't decay into b b̄ because 6 < 8.2 GeV. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So, c quark mass is 1.27 GeV, 2m_c is 2.54, less than 6 GeV. So allowed. So all these fermions except b are allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, τ, etc. But t is way too heavy, so decay into t t̄ is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Again, b is not allowed because mass is too high.

So the correct option should include all fermions except b and t.

So in the options, only option B includes c, s, u, d, and the leptons (tau, mu, e), but not b or t.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Yes, this is correct. Because all these fermions have 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

Wait, but what about the option D? It includes b, which isn't allowed. So option D is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term given in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion (\( m_X \geq 2m_f \)).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Allowance:
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 8.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_X < 2m_b \)).
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_X \ll m_t \)).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_X < 2m_b \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these decays are allowed, as \( 2m_f \leq m_X \) for all listed fermions. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_X \ll m_t \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_X < 2m_b \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) based on its mass of 6 GeV.
