Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, right, because the interaction term here is what determines the possible decay products. So the interaction is between X and various fermions f.

I remember that in particle physics, when a boson decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decay products depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions involved. Because for a decay to be possible, the energy of the boson must be sufficient to create the fermion pair. So the condition is that the mass of the boson (M) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion (2m_f), since the fermion and antifermion each take some energy.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays. So I need to look at which fermions have a mass less than or equal to half of 6 GeV. Let's calculate half of 6 GeV: 3 GeV. So each fermion must be less than or equal to 3 GeV in mass.

Now, let me list the known fermion masses to see which ones fit. The standard model fermion masses (in GeV) are roughly:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.002 GeV (much smaller)
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Neutrinos are even lighter, so negligible.

Wait, but wait a second. The tau is ~1.777 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.55 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. Oh wait, the boson mass is 6 GeV. Then 6 GeV is the total, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV. So 2m_f <= M_X.

So 2m_f <=6 GeV → m_f <=3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product. Let me list the fermions:

Electron: m=0.0005 GeV → 0.001 GeV <3 GeV → allowed.

Muon: ~0.105 GeV → 0.21 <3 → allowed.

Tau: 1.777 GeV → 3.554 >6? Wait wait no, wait. The tau mass is ~1.777 GeV. So 2m_tau is ~3.554 GeV. The X boson is 6 GeV, which is more than 3.554 GeV. So tau is allowed. Because 3.554 <6, so X can decay into tau and anti-tau.

Wait, no, wait: when the boson's mass is 6 GeV, it needs to be at least 2m_f. So 2m_f <=6 → m_f <=3 GeV.

Tau is about 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 → 2*1.777=3.554 <6 → allowed.

Wait, no, 1.777 *2=3.554. But 3.554 is less than 6, so yes, tau is allowed.

Wait, but that's not all. The up quark is about 0.002 GeV → 0.004 <3 → allowed.

Down quark similar. Strange quark is ~0.1 GeV → 0.2 <3 → allowed. Charm quark is about 1.27 GeV → 2.54 <3 → 2.54 is less than 3 GeV. Oh wait, no, 2.54 is less than 6 GeV, but wait, the condition is that 2m_c ≤6 GeV? 2*1.27 is 2.54 GeV, which is less than 6, so yes, X can decay into c cbar.

Wait, but wait, looking back, the X boson is given with mass 6 GeV. So when X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, that pair's combined mass must be ≤6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be ≤3 GeV.

So the fermions allowed are those with m_f ≤3 GeV.

Let's see:

Electron: yes.

Muon: yes.

Tau: 1.777 ≤3 → yes.

Up, down, strange: yes.

Charm: 1.27 ≤3 → yes.

Bottom: 4.13 >3 → no. So b quark is too heavy.

Top quark: way too heavy (173 GeV), so no.

So the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the decay products would be pairs of these fermions. So the decay channels would be X → f f̄, where f is e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So looking at the options, let's check each.

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b quark is too heavy (4.13 GeV). So X (6 GeV) can't decay into b b̄, because 2m_b = 8.26 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So option A includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's exactly the fermions we just listed. All the fermions in option B are allowed.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, t is the top quark, which is way too heavy (173 GeV). So 2m_t would be 346 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So t t̄ is not allowed. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b b̄ which is not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, what about the charge? The problem statement says the interaction is with ψ_f, which are fermions. So in the Lagrangian, it's ψ_f and ψ̄_f, so they can annihilate or create a fermion-antifermion pair. So for each fermion, you get a charged pair. But since the X is a neutral boson (assuming it's similar to the Higgs, but the exact charge isn't given here), it can decay into any fermion pair as long as the masses are right.

So the allowed decay products are all the f f̄ where f is e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Looking back, option B lists c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option D has more, including b, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer must be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The decays depend on the fermion masses, as the boson can only decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the total mass of the pair is less than or equal to the boson's mass. Specifically, for a fermion \( f \), the condition is \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The known fermion masses (in GeV) are approximately:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, only fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are allowed. This includes \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Fermions like \( b \) and \( t \) are too heavy (\( m_b \sim 4.13 \, \text{GeV}, m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) and cannot be decay products of \( X \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 8.26 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which are all allowed decay channels. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes only the kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
