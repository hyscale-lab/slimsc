Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric. Because dx and dy are the differentials, so it's a 2D space. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which I remember is a type of surface with constant negative curvature. Oh right, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere would be like a hyperbolic plane, but when we talk about a pseudosphere of radius r, I think it's the same as a hyperbolic plane with curvature related to r.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So I need to find the area using this metric.

I remember that in differential geometry, the area element in 2D is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric here is diagonal, so the determinant should be straightforward. Let me write down the metric components.

The metric is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy², where g_{xx}=g_{yy}=32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (g_{xx})^2 - (g_{xy})^2, but since g_{xy}=0 here, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, no. Wait, in 2D, the metric is usually represented as a 2x2 matrix. So for a diagonal metric, the determinant is (g11 * g22 - g12²), but since g12 is zero, it's g11 * g22. But in this case, g11 and g22 are the same because dx² and dy² have the same coefficient. So determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt of (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2 is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh wait, but pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. So maybe the given metric is that of a pseudosphere? Or perhaps this is a model space.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric represents some coordinate system on a pseudosphere. Wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere would have a metric that's conformally flat, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: in 2D, the metric for a hyperbolic plane is usually written in terms of Poincaré coordinates, which is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² + 1)² or something like that. But the given metric here is (32)/(4 - (x² + y²)) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks a bit similar but not exactly the same.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the geometry. The denominator here is (4 - x² - y²). So that's 4 - (x² + y²), which is the same as (2)^2 - (x² + y²). So that makes me think of the metric for a spacetime of constant curvature, perhaps.

Wait, but pseudosphere is a surface embedded in 3D, but when we talk about its intrinsic geometry, it's a 2D hyperbolic space. The metric given might represent a hyperbolic plane.

In any case, the area of the entire pseudosphere (which is an infinite surface) would be infinite. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, the radius in hyperbolic geometry is a bit different. The area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite, but maybe the question is considering a specific region, like a disk of radius r.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Let me read the question again.

The question says: What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2? So perhaps the pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but the given metric is 2D. Maybe the question is about the area of a specific region in this metric.

Wait, but the metric given is for a 2D space. So maybe the pseudosphere in this context is the whole space, making the area infinite. Because pseudosphere is an infinite surface, so its area is infinite.

Wait, looking at the options: option D is +infty, which would make sense if the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a finite region. For example, in 2D hyperbolic space, the area of a circle of radius r is 2π (cosh r - 1), but that's for a unit radius. But this pseudosphere has r=2, so it would be 2π (cosh 2 -1), but that's not any of the options. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, but the metric given is not the standard hyperbolic metric. Let me check.

The standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² + 1)^2. But our metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y^2) (dx² + dy²). Hmm.

Let me make a substitution. Let me set z = x² + y². Then the denominator becomes 4 - z. So 4 - z = 4 - (x² + y²).

Wait, another approach: perhaps this is a metric on a hyperbolic plane scaled in some way.

Suppose the metric is conformally flat, which it is, so the area element is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

But to find the area, I need to do an integral over the entire space. Wait, but where is this metric defined? The denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive, because otherwise the metric would be singular or imaginary.

So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. If the domain is this disk, perhaps it's only a finite area, but wait, looking at the integrand, as (x² + y²) approaches 4, the integrand becomes large. So the integral might diverge.

Let me compute the integral.

In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r². So dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to r=2, θ=0 to θ=2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let's compute the radial integral first: ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is 32*(-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

But the limits are inverted, so I can switch them and remove the negative sign.

So 32 * (1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4.

Which is 16 [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4.

Wait, ln(4) minus ln(0), but ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.

So the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 is infinite, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick because the pseudosphere is an infinite surface, so its area is indeed infinite. But in this case, the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, but the integral over this disk gives an infinite area, which would mean that the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). A pseudosphere is an infinite surface with constant negative curvature, and its intrinsic geometry corresponds to a hyperbolic plane. 

To compute the area, we calculate the area element using the metric. The determinant of the metric tensor is \((32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2))^2\), and the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of the metric is restricted by the condition \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which corresponds to the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). To find the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over this disk. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_{0}^{2} \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{32}{u} \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_{0}^{4} \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_{0}^{4} = 16 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right).
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, indicating that the area is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that a pseudosphere is an infinite surface. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
