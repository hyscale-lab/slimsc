Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully again.

The question has two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, let me break this down. Both reactions seem to involve nitriles, so maybe they're related to nitrile chemistry. The first reaction is adding NaCN to a ketone, but butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh wait, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is a reaction where a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide ion to form a compound with an alcohol and nitrile group.

So the first step is making a cyanohydrin. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, under what conditions does this happen? I think the reaction usually requires an acid catalyst. Oh right, because the ketone's carbonyl is attacked by CN- as a nucleophile, but to make that happen, the carbonyl needs to be protonated, making it a better electrophile. So H+ (acid) is needed as a catalyst here. So for reagent A, maybe it's something like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid or another strong acid). So looking at the options, the possible A's are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite, maybe used in other reactions like the reduction of carbonyl groups or in the hydrolysis of nitriles.

So for the first reaction, A is likely H3O+ because that's the acid catalyst needed for the cyanohydrin formation. So options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3 for A.

Now looking at the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which I think is a nitrile with an adjacent hydroxyl group. The product is the corresponding carboxylic acid. So this looks like a hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. But under what conditions does that happen?

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. Wait, but with H2O as a reagent, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. Let me think about the typical reagents. For nitrile to carboxylic acid, one common method is hydrolysis in acidic conditions, sometimes with heat. For example, using H2SO4 (which would provide H+), and H2O. Alternatively, sometimes it's done with a strong base like NaOH, but that tends to give a carboxylate salt which would then need acid work-up.

Wait, the product here is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must have been done under conditions that protonate the product. So the reaction conditions for hydrolysis to acid would require an acid catalyst. But looking at reagent B: in the options, B can be HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, the second reaction's reagent is written as B (H2O), so B is in the presence of water. So the reaction is hydrolysis.

In the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent (but that's part of a larger structure; perhaps it's a tertiary alcohol near the nitrile). So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

But how? The nitrile group (R-CN) hydrolyzes to R-COOH. The typical conditions for this are either in acidic or basic conditions. Let's think:

1. Acidic hydrolysis: Using a strong acid like H2SO4 and heating. The nitrile hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid.
2. Basic hydrolysis: Using a strong base like NaOH and heating. This gives the carboxylate salt, which upon acidification becomes the carboxylic acid.

In this problem, the reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid. So for the second step, what's needed?

Wait, the first reaction used H3O+ (acid) as a catalyst. The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reagent B is an acid? Or maybe it's H2O and an acid catalyst.

Wait, but in the second reaction, B is the reagent along with H2O. So the options are HCl (which is a strong acid) or acetic acid (a weak acid). So which one is used for hydrolysis of nitriles to acids?

I think in acidic conditions, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires a strong acid and heat. For example, using HCl and water with heat, perhaps. Alternatively, sometimes a mixture with HgSO4 and H2SO4 is used as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.

Wait, but in the options for B, the choices are HCl and CH3COOH. So which one is the right reagent for this hydrolysis?

Alternatively, maybe the second step isn't a direct hydrolysis but another reaction. Wait, the starting material is a hydroxy nitrile. So the compound is R-OH and R-CN adjacent. Maybe the reaction is oxidation of the nitrile group.

Wait, no. The product is a hydroxybutanoic acid. Let me look at the structure:

The starting compound is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Its structure is something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CN

Wait, perhaps it's more accurately:

The structure is (4-benzylphenyl) is a substituent on a carbon chain. Let me correct that. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CN

Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile on the last carbon. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But in this case, the molecule is 2-hydroxy-2-(4-benzylphenyl)butanenitrile. So the structure would be:

(CH2)2CN attached to a central carbon that's connected to a hydroxyl and a benzyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-CH2-C(CH2CN)(OH)-CH3? No, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think. The butanenitrile part is four carbons, with the nitrile on carbon 4. So the structure is:

Position 1: CH3-

Position 2: C(OH)(R)-

Position 3: CH2-

Position 4: CN

Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So 2-hydroxybutanenitrile would be HOCH2CH2CH2CN. But here, the substituent is a 4-benzylphenyl group on the same carbon as the hydroxyl.

So the structure is: the central carbon (carbon 2 of butanenitrile) has a hydroxyl group and a 4-benzylphenyl group attached. So it's:

Ph-CH2-C(OH)(CH2CN)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

Ph-CH2-C(CH2CN)(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so the chain is four carbons in length. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let me focus on the reaction.

In the second reaction, the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid group. So the nitrile (R-CN) becomes R-COOH.

So, the reagent B is used along with H2O. So what conditions are needed for the nitrile to carboxylic acid conversion.

Looking back, for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, I think the conditions are usually either strong acid with heat or strong base with heat followed by acid work-up.

In the options, for B, the choices are HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid).

So HCl is a strong acid, whereas acetic acid is a weak acid. Which condition is suitable?

Wait, another approach: in the first reaction, A was H3O+ (acid), so the reaction was acid-catalyzed cyanohydrin formation.

In the second reaction, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The reaction conditions would likely need a strong acid catalyst. So if B is HCl, that's a strong acid, which would make sense.

But wait, another point: the presence of H2O as a reagent. So hydrolysis probably occurs with an acid catalyst. So if B is HCl, then the conditions would be HCl and H2O, leading to the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if B is acetic acid, perhaps it's a milder condition, but I'm not sure if that's sufficient for nitrile hydrolysis.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A is H3O+ (which is provided by H2SO4, for example, or another strong acid), and in the second reaction, B is either HCl (strong acid) or acetic acid (weak acid). Which one is more likely?

Another thought: sometimes, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done using HCl and H2O under reflux. For example, concentrated HCl and water at high temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is done under basic conditions, but I don't think so because the product is a carboxylic acid, not a salt.

Wait, but maybe the first reaction uses an acid, and the second reaction uses another acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to outline the steps again.

First Reaction:

Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile

This is a cyanohydrin formation. So, the mechanism is:

Ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with CN- (from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst (A). The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. Water leaves, and the hydroxyl group is formed. So sodium cyanide and acid (H3O+ or another acid) would be the conditions.

So A is likely an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+.

Second Reaction:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the nitrile group is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B must be an acid catalyst, possibly HCl or acetic acid.

But let me think about the possible reagents. If the nitrile is in a molecule that's somewhat hindered (due to the benzyl group), maybe the reaction requires a strong acid to proceed.

So HCl would be a strong acid, but acetic acid is weaker. I'm not sure which one is used in such hydrolysis, but I think typically, acidic hydrolysis of nitriles (to carboxylic acids) uses strong acids.

Wait, but another possibility: the presence of H2O and an acid catalyst, like HCl. So when you have H2O and HCl, that's a typical acidic hydrolysis condition.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl → possibility.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → ?

If A is H3O+ and B is HCl, that would fit.

Wait, but let me think about whether NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite) is used in any of these reactions.

Wait, in the first reaction, if A were NaHSO3, that would be providing H+ (from HSO3^-). So maybe that could also work as an acid catalyst. But the product is a cyanohydrin, which is typically formed under acidic conditions. So both H3O+ and NaHSO3 could act as acid catalysts, but NaHSO3 is a milder acid, perhaps.

Wait, but I think the more typical reagent for cyanohydrin formation is a strong acid, like H2SO4, which would provide H3O+ ions. So perhaps A is H3O+.

So with that, looking at options A and B.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

Which of these is correct?

Wait, in the second reaction, the product is the carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be under acidic conditions. So B must be a strong acid. HCl is a strong acid, while acetic acid is a weak acid. So would the hydrolysis proceed with HCl?

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think about another point. The second reaction is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. I think this typically requires either strong acid or strong base conditions, with heat. Let's say for example, using HCl and H2O with heat.

So that would mean that B is HCl, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes, the hydrolysis of nitriles is done using a catalytic amount of H2SO4 (which would provide H3O+) along with H2O and heat. So in that case, reagent B would be HCl, but maybe the H3O+ is from the H2SO4. But in the options, reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid. So for the second reaction, if B is HCl, then it's a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction uses a different condition. Wait, perhaps the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure about that; oxidation of nitriles usually requires specific conditions, like using KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's likely a hydrolysis rather than an oxidation. Oxidation of nitriles typically gives carboxylic acids, but requires harsh conditions. Alternatively, hydrolysis is more straightforward.

So if I think about the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH. If B is HCl, then the conditions are acidic, which would favor the hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.

So putting it all together, for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (from options A or B), and for the second reaction, B is HCl (from option A). So looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

That would fit. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but wait! Wait another thought. The first reaction uses NaCN as a source of CN- and an acid. So the H3O+ in option A would be the acid. So that's correct.

But wait, another consideration: sometimes, when forming cyanohydrins, the reaction can be done with a base, but I think that's less common. The usual condition is acid.

So the first reaction is correct with A=H3O+.

So for the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis is under acidic conditions, which would be HCl (B=HCl). So option A is the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents (A and B) from the given options.

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**

This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. In this reaction, a ketone reacts with cyanide ions (CN⁻) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing CN⁻ to attack and form the cyanohydrin. The typical acid catalyst for this reaction is H₃O⁺, which is consistent with options A and B.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**

Here, the nitrile group (CN) is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions, but since the product is a carboxylic acid, acidic conditions are required. Among the options for B, HCl (a strong acid) is more suitable for this reaction compared to CH₃COOH (a weak acid), as strong acids are generally used for efficient hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation in Reaction 1.  
  - HCl is a strong acid, making it suitable for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid in Reaction 2.  
  - This option is consistent with both reactions.

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - While H₃O⁺ is suitable for Reaction 1, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and less effective for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids in Reaction 2.  
  - This option is less likely.

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation, which requires an acid catalyst like H₃O⁺.  
  - This option is incorrect.

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is not suitable for Reaction 1, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for Reaction 2.  
  - This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** for the first reaction and **B = HCl** for the second reaction, making **Option A** the correct choice.

**Answer: A**
