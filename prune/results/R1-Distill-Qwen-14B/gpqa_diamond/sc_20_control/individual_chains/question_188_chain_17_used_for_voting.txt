Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the plane indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral. Oh right, a rhombohedral crystal is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but I might be mixing that up. Or wait, no, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. It has all sides equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait—interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along a bond, but in a crystal, for a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter a would be the interatomic distance. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice is a bit more complex. Oh wait, I think in a primitive rhombohedral lattice, each atom is at the corners of a rhombohedron, but maybe it's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the interatomic distance here refers to the length of the lattice parameter a. Or perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think—interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. In a simple cubic structure, that would be the lattice parameter a. But in other structures, like hexagonal close-packed, the interatomic distance might be a fraction of the lattice parameter, depending on the direction. Hmm, perhaps in this problem, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. So a = 10 Angstroms.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by something like d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ ), but wait, no—I think that's the formula for the interplanar distance in a general crystal system. Wait, or is it specific to hexagonal systems? Hmm, perhaps I should recall the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice.

Oh right, the general formula is d_{hkl} = (1/√(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ )) * (a / √(1 + 2cos α + 2cos β + 2cos γ + ... )) Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the formula for d is a divided by the square root of (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ ) multiplied by something else? Or perhaps it's simply d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + kl cos β + hl cos γ) ) ?

Wait, maybe to clarify. The interplanar distance formula for a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles α, β, γ between the lattice vectors is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ )

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look this up in my notes, but since I'm working this out, I'll proceed. So for a rhombohedral crystal, all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. And the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging the numbers into the formula. Let me write down the variables:

h = 1, k = 1, l =1

α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

a = 10 Angstrom.

So first calculate the denominator terms:

h² +k² +l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

The cross terms: 2hk cos α = 2*1*1 * cos 30°, 2kl cos β = same, 2hl cos γ= same.

So each cross term is 2 * cos 30°, and there are three of them.

So sum of cross terms: 3 * (2 * cos30°) =6 * cos30.

Wait, cos30° is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660. So 6 * 0.8660 is approximately 5.196.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( (3) - (5.196) ) ?

Wait, wait, wait. Because the formula is sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos alpha - 2kl cos beta - 2hl cos gamma )

So our h² +k² +l² is 3.

The subtracted terms: 2hk cos alpha + 2kl cos beta + 2hl cos gamma.

So 2*(1)(1)*cos30 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30 = 6 cos30.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, so 6 *0.866 is 5.196.

So 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because square roots of negative numbers aren't real. So that suggests I made a mistake in applying the formula. Because the denominator cannot be negative, so perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually different. Maybe I confused the angles in the formula. Because in some cases, in a rhombohedral system, the angle between the vectors is the same for all three, but perhaps in the formula, the angles used are not all the same? Or perhaps I should use a different formula.

Wait, another approach. Maybe in a rhombohedral system, the formula for interplanar distance can be simplified because all angles are equal and all h, k, l are same.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar spacing formula for rhombohedral is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + kl + hl) cos α )

Wait, because in rhombohedral, the angles between the lattice vectors are such that, I think, the formula uses cos α for each of the cross terms. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for a general triclinic system is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos βγ - 2kl cos αγ - 2hl cos αβ ) ... Wait, no, I think that's more complicated.

Wait, another thought. Maybe for a rhombohedral system, the formula is similar to the cubic system but adjusted for the angles. So in cubic, d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in rhombohedral, since angles are not 90, the formula changes.

Wait, I found a formula in my notes: For a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance is given by d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. So in this case, θ is 30 degrees.

So plugging in the numbers:

h=k=l=1.

So numerator is a=10.

Denominator inside the sqrt: 3 - 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos30.

So 3 - 2*(3) * cos30.

So 3 -6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3 *1.732 ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196. That's negative, which doesn't make sense because we can't take the square root of a negative number. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, that suggests either I'm using the wrong formula, or I messed up the signs. Let me think. Oh wait, perhaps the formula has a plus instead of a minus? Or perhaps the angles in the formula are the supplementary angles?

Wait, perhaps I got the formula backward. Let me re-examine the formula derivation.

In a cubic system, the interplanar distance is straightforward. For a general triclinic system, the formula is more complicated. For a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of triclinic with a = b = c and α = β = γ, perhaps the formula is adjusted.

Wait, another approach. Let's model the rhombohedral lattice vectors. Let’s say the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a=10 Angstroms, and the angles between each pair are 30 degrees. So the vectors are a, b, c, each with |a| = |b| = |c| = a, and the angle between any two is 30 degrees.

The (111) plane corresponds to the plane whose Miller indices are h=1, k=1, l=1. The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in that direction.

The formula for interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice vectors is d = 1/|G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal vectors G are given by (h, k, l) in reciprocal space.

But perhaps that's getting too abstract. Alternatively, perhaps using the dot product method.

Wait, the reciprocal space vectors are G = (h, k, l) in terms of the basis vectors a, b, c. The interplanar distance is 1/|G|, but |G| is calculated using the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is given by:

g_11 = a²

g_22 = b²

g_33 = c²

g_12 = g_21 = ab cos γ

g_13 = g_31 = ac cos β

g_23 = g_32 = bc cos α

In rhombohedral system, a=b=c, so g_11 = g_22 = g_33 = a² = 100.

Angles α=β=γ=30 degrees, so cos α = cos 30°= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So the metric tensor is:

[ 100   100 * cos30  100 * cos30 ]

[100 cos30  100   100 cos30 ]

[100 cos30 100 cos30  100 ]

Wait, no, no. Wait, the metric tensor is:

g_ij = [ a²          ab cos γ        ac cos β      ]

         [ ab cos γ    b²          bc cos α      ]

         [ ac cos β    bc cos α      c²           ]

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c =10, and α=β=γ=30 degrees.

So:

g_11 = a² =100

g_22 = b²=100

g_33 = c²=100

g_12 = g_21 = ab cos γ = 10*10 * cos30 = 100 * 0.8660 ≈86.60

g_13 = g_31 = ac cos β = 10*10 * cos30≈86.60

g_23 = g_32 = bc cos α=10*10 * cos30≈86.60

So the metric tensor is:

[100      86.60      86.60 ]

[86.60    100       86.60 ]

[86.60    86.60    100 ]

The reciprocal lattice vector G for (hkl)=(111) is given by:

G = h a* + k b* + l c*,

where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

But perhaps a better way is to compute |G|² = h² g_33 + k² g_22 + l² g_11 - (hk g_23 + hl g_31 + kl g_12 )

Wait, no, wait. The magnitude squared of the vector G is given by:

|G|² = h² g_11 + k² g_22 + l² g_33 + 2 hk g_12 + 2 hl g_13 + 2 kl g_23.

Wait, but in the metric tensor, the components g_ij are the inner products. So when calculating |G|^2 where G = h a* + k b* + l c*, the formula is:

|G|² = h² g_11 + k² g_22 + l² g_33 + hk (g_12 + g_21) + hl (g_13 + g_31) + kl (g_23 + g_32).

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, the reciprocal vectors a*, b*, c* are such that their metric tensor is the inverse of the direct space metric tensor. So perhaps to compute |G|^2, we can use the formula:

|G|² = g_11 h² + g_22 k² + g_33 l² + 2 g_12 hk + 2 g_13 hl + 2 g_23 kl.

Yes, that seems right. So now, let's plug in the numbers.

g_11 =100,

g_22=100,

g_33=100,

g_12=86.60,

g_13=86.60,

g_23=86.60.

h=k=l=1.

So:

|G|^2 = (1)^2 * 100 + (1)^2 * 100 + (1)^2 * 100 + 2*(1)(1)*86.60 + 2*(1)(1)*86.60 + 2*(1)(1)*86.60.

Calculating term by term:

100 +100 +100 = 300.

The next terms are:

2*(1*1)*86.60: this term occurs three times, so 3 * (2*86.60) = 3 * 173.2 = 519.6.

So |G|^2 =300 + 519.6=819.6.

Wait, so |G| is sqrt(819.6). Let me compute that.

What's sqrt(819.6)? Let's see. 28^2 is 784, 29^2 is 841. So sqrt(819.6) is between 28 and 29. Let's compute 28.6^2 = 817.96, 28.7^2=823.69. So 819.6 is between 28.6 and 28.7.

Compute 28.6^2 = 28.6 *28.6 = (28 + 0.6)^2 = 784 + 2*28*0.6 + 0.36 = 784 +33.6 +0.36=817.96.

817.96 is less than 819.6 by 1.64.

So the next step: 28.6^2=817.96, 28.61^2= ?

(28.6 +0.01)^2 =28.6^2 + 2*28.6*0.01 +0.0001 =817.96 +0.572 +0.0001=818.5321.

Still less than 819.6.

Next, 28.62^2= (28.61 +0.01)^2 =818.5321 + 2*28.61*0.01 +0.0001=818.5321 +0.5722 +0.0001=819.1044.

Still less than 819.6.

Next, 28.63^2= 819.1044 + 2*28.62*0.01 +0.0001. Wait, wait, 28.62 is the current number, adding 0.01: (28.62 + 0.01)^2 =28.63^2. So 28.62^2 is 819.1044.

28.63^2= 28.62^2 + 2 *28.62 *0.01 + 0.01^2 → 819.1044 + 0.5724 + 0.0001=819.6769.

Ah, so 28.63^2 ≈819.6769, which is just above 819.6. So |G| is approximately 28.63 Angstrom^-1.

Wait, but wait, the interplanar distance d is 1/|G|.

Wait, no. Wait, the interplanar distance d is 1/ |G|, where |G| is in reciprocal space. Because G is the reciprocal lattice vector, and d is the spacing in real space. So d = 1/|G|.

So |G| is about 28.63 Angstrom^-1, so d ≈ 1/(28.63) Angstrom.

Wait, no, wait—it's reciprocal Angstrom, so 1/ (1/Å) is Å. So 1/(28.63 (Å^-1)) )= 0.0349 Å? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 8-10 Angstrom.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, no—no, I think I messed up the formula. Because the metric tensor in reciprocal space is the inverse of the direct space metric tensor. So when I calculated |G|², it's in reciprocal space, so the magnitude is in reciprocal Angstrom. So the interplanar distance is 1 / |G|, which would be in Angstrom.

Wait, but in this case, |G| is approximately 28.63 (1/Angstrom), so d=1/(28.63 (1/A)) )= 0.0349 Angstrom, which is way too small compared to the options given (8-10 Angstroms). So something's wrong here.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait! Oh no, I think I messed up the formula for |G|².

Wait, the correct formula for |G|² is:

|G|² = h² g_11 + k² g_22 + l² g_33 + 2 hk g_12 + 2 hl g_13 + 2 kl g_23.

Wait, but for the metric tensor g_ij, which I've already computed, are the g_ij in direct space. So when using this in reciprocal space, perhaps I should be using the reciprocal metric tensor G_ij, which is the inverse of g_ij.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The interplanar distance for (hkl) planes is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h a*)^2 + (k b*)^2 + (l c*)^2 + ... )

But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

But that brings me back to the same issue as before, where the denominator becomes negative.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should consider the scalar product of the reciprocal basis vectors.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for d is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, because in rhombohedral, angles are all same, theta. So plugging in, let's try this.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

theta=30 degrees.

So denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(1+1+1) cos30) = sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.8660 ).

6 *0.8660 is 5.196. So 3 +5.196 =8.196.

sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.494 Angstrom.

That's about 3.5 Angstrom, which is way below the options provided (which are around 9 Angstrom). So that can't be right either.

Wait, but perhaps I'm using the wrong formula again. Let me think about the conventional vs primitive unit cells. Oh wait! Rhombohedral can have a conventional unit cell that's larger. Alternatively, perhaps the lattice is such that the formula requires considering a different parameter.

Wait, perhaps I should use the following formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but cosθ is cos30, which is 0.866.

So h=k=l=1.

Denominator = sqrt(3 - 2*(3) *0.866 )

= sqrt(3 - 5.196 )

= sqrt(-2.196 )

Which is impossible. So that's not possible. So this suggests that either the formula is wrong, or the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should instead model the vectors and compute the planes directly.

In a rhombohedral system with lattice parameter a and angles 30 degrees, the (111) plane would have a normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the distance between two planes with normals along (1,1,1), spaced such that their Miller indices are (111).

Another approach: the interplanar distance is the distance between two points along the direction perpendicular to the (111) plane. So, given the lattice vectors, compute the distance between two adjacent planes.

The lattice vectors are a, b, c with |a|=|b|=|c|=10 A, and angles 30 degrees between each pair.

The normal vector to the (111) plane is along (a + b + c). The interplanar distance is the component of the vector from one lattice point to the next along the direction of this normal.

So the vector from one lattice point to the next is (a + b + c). The distance between planes is the projection of this vector onto the normal direction divided by the magnitude of the normal vector.

Wait, let me think. The vector connecting two points in the (111) direction is (a + b + c). The interplanar distance d is the magnitude of this vector projected onto the normal direction, which is (a + b + c) itself. The length of the projection is (a + b + c) · n, where n is the unit vector in the direction of (a + b + c). So the distance d is |(a + b + c)| / |n| ?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The interplanar distance d is the distance between two adjacent planes. The planes are separated by a vector that is perpendicular to the planes. The direction of this vector is along the normal of the planes, which is (1,1,1).

The actual displacement between two adjacent planes is given by the vector (a + b + c) scaled by 1/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the magnitude of (a + b + c) and then the interplanar distance is (a + b + c) / sqrt(3), but that's in a cubic system. But here, the angles are 30 degrees, so it's different.

Wait, let's compute |a + b + c|.

The magnitude squared of (a + b + c) is |a|² + |b|² + |c|² + 2 a·b + 2 a·c + 2 b·c.

Since a, b, c are vectors with |a|=|b|=|c|=10, and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

So:

|a + b + c|² = 10² + 10² +10² + 2*(a·b + a·c + b·c)

The dot product a·b = |a||b| cosθ = 10*10 * cos30 =100 *0.8660=86.60.

Similarly, a·c=86.60, b·c=86.60.

So the sum is 3*100 + 2*(3 *86.60 ) =300 + 2*259.8= 300 + 519.6=819.6.

So |a + b + c| = sqrt(819.6) ≈28.63 A.

But wait, the interplanar distance is the component of this vector along the normal direction. Since the vector itself is along the normal, the distance between two planes would be |a + b + c| multiplied by (1/ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)) ), but perhaps I'm confusing it.

Wait, in the cubic case, the (111) planes are spaced by a / sqrt(3), because the vector (a + b + c) has length sqrt(3) a, and the unit normal is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3). So the distance between planes is (a + b + c) · (1,1,1)/sqrt(3) ) = sqrt(3)a * (1/sqrt(3)) ) = a.

Wait, that makes sense because in cubic, the (111) planes are spaced by a.

But in this rhombohedral case, the normal vector is (1,1,1), but the lattice vectors are not orthogonal. So perhaps the interplanar distance is |a + b + c| divided by the square root of (h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = |a + b + c| / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, another approach: The volume of the unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 θ + 2 cos^3 θ ), where θ is the angle between the vectors (30 degrees in this case).

So V = 10^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.8660)^2 + 2*(0.8660)^3 )

Compute (0.8660)^2 ≈0.75, (0.8660)^3≈0.6495.

So inside the sqrt: 1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) =1 -2.25 +1.299= (1 -2.25)= -1.25 +1.299=0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)=approx 0.2214.

So V≈1000 * 0.2214=221.4 Å³.

The volume can also be expressed as V = (a^3) * (1/(d_{hkl} * h k l ...)) ), but I'm not sure how to relate this to the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) )

Wait, but with θ=30 degrees, and h=k=l=1.

So denominator: sqrt(3 - 2*(3) * 0.866 )

= sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196) → which is imaginary. So that can't be right.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the formula isn't applicable here, or I've made a mistake in applying it.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe using the relation between the interplanar distance and the structure factor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the unit cell and the positions of the planes. The (111) plane would contain points where the Miller indices are (1,1,1). So the distance between two adjacent (111) planes would be the projection of the lattice vectors onto the normal direction.

Wait, another idea: The interplanar distance for (hkl) in a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h + k + l)^2 - 2(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (1 - cosθ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the unit vectors.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. So the reciprocal lattice vector G for (111) is G = (1/a) (b × c) + (1/b) (c × a) + (1/c) (a × b), but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vector components are given by:

G_x = ( (b × c)_x ) / (a · (b × c)) )

Similarly for G_y and G_z.

The magnitude |G| would then be sqrt( G_x^2 + G_y^2 + G_z^2 )

But this seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward formula. Maybe considering the formula from a textbook or lecture notes. Oh wait, in the case of a rhombohedral system where a = b = c and α = β = γ, the interplanar distance for (hkl) can be simplified.

I found a formula online (but since I can't, I have to rely on memory) which says:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

Wait, let's try that. So h=k=l=1, a=10, θ=30°, cosθ=0.866.

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(3) *0.866 )=sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863≈3.494 Å. But the options are around 9-10 Å, which is much larger. So this can't be right. I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ ) / a².

So for our case:

1/d² = (3 + 6 *0.866 ) / 100.

3 +5.196=8.196.

So 1/d²=8.196 /100=0.08196 → d= sqrt(1/0.08196)=sqrt(12.195)= approx 3.494 Å. Again, same result.

But the options given are about 9 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe I should use a different approach, such as computing the distance between two points in the (111) direction.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent lattice points in the direction perpendicular to the (111) plane.

The direction of the normal to the (111) plane is along (1,1,1). So the vector along the normal is (a + b + c). The length of this vector is |a + b + c|=sqrt(819.6)≈28.63.

The number of lattice planes along this direction would be the number of times this vector repeats to form the unit cell. But perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is given by the component of the lattice vector in the direction of the normal. Wait, perhaps the formula is d = |(a + b + c)| / (h +k +l). But h +k +l is 3.

So d=28.63 /3 ≈9.543 Angstrom. Oh, that's one of the options. Option C is 9.54 Angstrom.

Wait, that seems promising. So let me think again. The (111) plane's normal is along (1,1,1) direction, which is a + b + c. The length of this vector is |a + b + c|=28.63. The number of interplanar spacings along this direction would be 3 because the plane indices sum to 3. So the spacing is |a + b + c| /3 ≈28.63/3≈9.54 Angstrom.

That matches option C. So I think this is the correct approach.

To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), we use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta}}
\]

Here, \( h = k = l = 1 \), \( \theta = 30^\circ \), and \( \cos 30^\circ = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \). Substituting the values:

1. **Calculate the denominator**:
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]
   \[
   2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta = 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos 30^\circ = 2(3)(0.866) = 5.196
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
   \]

2. **Calculate \( d \)**:
   \[
   d = \frac{a}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å}
   \]

This result is inconsistent with the provided options, which are much larger (around 9–10 Å). To resolve this, we consider an alternative approach based on the geometry of the rhombohedral lattice.

### Alternative Approach
The interplanar distance \( d \) can also be calculated as the projection of the vector \( \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \) (which is normal to the (111) plane) onto the direction perpendicular to the plane. The magnitude of \( \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \) is:

\[
|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}|^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c})
\]

Since \( a = b = c = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and the angles between the vectors are \( 30^\circ \), the dot products are:

\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot \cos 30^\circ = 86.6
\]

Substituting:

\[
|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}|^2 = 3(10^2) + 2(3)(86.6) = 300 + 519.6 = 819.6
\]
\[
|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}| = \sqrt{819.6} \approx 28.63 \, \text{Å}
\]

The interplanar distance \( d \) is then:

\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}|}{h + k + l} = \frac{28.63}{3} \approx 9.54 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Final Answer
The interplanar distance for the (111) plane is approximately **9.54 Å**, which matches option C.
