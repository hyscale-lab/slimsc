Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's expressed in terms of dx and dy, not involving any dz or higher dimensions. But wait, pseudosphere... Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface, like a sphere but with negative curvature. Oh wait, no, pseudosphere is a different concept, but in any case, the metric here is 2D.

Wait, I should clarify: a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But the metric given here is for a 2D space, so perhaps this is embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but maybe that's not necessary here.

The question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, wait, pseudospheres can be a bit tricky. Wait, the term "pseudosphere" sometimes refers to the tractricoid, which is the surface of revolution of a tractrix. But in any case, the metric is probably describing a 2D space with constant curvature.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Let me analyze this. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². Hmm, that looks similar to the expression for the metric of a sphere or a hyperbolic space, depending on the sign.

Wait, the standard metric for a 2D sphere of radius a is ds² = a² (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²), but that's in some coordinate system where it's expressed in terms of x and y. Alternatively, maybe it's using a different coordinate system, like stereographic coordinates or something else.

Alternatively, for hyperbolic space, the metric would have a plus in the denominator, like 1 + (x² + y²)/a². Because for hyperbolic space, the curvature is negative. So let's see: in this case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So it's 4 minus (x² + y²). So when (x² + y²) approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric singular there. So the region where x² + y² < 4 is allowed, and beyond that, it's not.

Wait, but a pseudosphere with radius 2. So the area would be similar to that of a sphere, but perhaps with a different formula. Wait, for a regular sphere of radius r, the area is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the area is different. Wait, no, wait: a pseudosphere is a specific surface, but perhaps in this context, the metric represents a 2D space with constant negative curvature. Alternatively, maybe this is a hyperbolic plane, but the question refers to a pseudosphere, which is a finite area.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric to figure out the nature of the space. Because the area depends on the curvature and the radius.

The Gaussian curvature K can be found from the metric. For a metric ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the curvature is K = - (1/(2g)) * Δ ln(g), where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D. Alternatively, another formula: For a conformally flat metric, K = - (1/(2g)) ∇² (ln g), where ∇² is the flat Laplacian.

Wait, let's compute K. Let me let g = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Taking the natural logarithm: ln(g) = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²). The Laplacian of this in 2D is Δ ln(g) = Δ [ - ln(4 - r²) ] where r² = x² + y².

The Laplacian in polar coordinates for a radial function f(r) is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr). Let's compute that. Let f = -ln(4 - r²). So df/dr = [ 2r ]/(4 - r²). Then, (1/r) d/dr [ r * (2r)/(4 - r²) ].

Wait, let's compute:

df/dr = [2r]/(4 - r²)
r df/dr = 2r²/(4 - r²)
d/dr [r df/dr] = [ (4r)(4 - r²) + 2r² (2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2
Wait, maybe better to compute directly.

Wait, let me compute the Laplacian of ln(g). Since ln(g) = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²), the Laplacian of ln(32) is zero. So the Laplacian is just the Laplacian of -ln(4 - r²).

In polar coordinates, the Laplacian of f(r) is (1/r) d/dr (r f'(r)). So:

f(r) = -ln(4 - r²)
f'(r) = - [ (2r) / (4 - r²) ) ] * (-1) → wait, no, derivative of ln(a - r²) is (2r)/(a - r²) * (-1). Wait, the derivative of ln(u) is (u’)/u. So d/dr [ - ln(4 - r²) ] = [ (2r)/(4 - r²) ) ].

Wait, so f'(r) = [2r]/ (4 - r²)
Then, (1/r) d/dr (r f’(r)) → compute r f’(r) = [2r²]/(4 - r²)
d/dr [2r²/(4 - r²)] = [ (4r)(4 - r²) + 2r²*(2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2
Wait, wait, no: let's use the quotient rule.

Denominator is (4 - r²), numerator is 2r². So derivative is [ (4r)(4 - r²) + 2r²*(2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait no, more accurately, the derivative of 2r² is 4r, and the derivative of (4 - r²) is -2r. So:

d/dr [2r² / (4 - r²)] = [ (4r)(4 - r²) - 2r² (-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2
= [4r(4 - r²) +4r³ ] / (4 - r²)^2
= [16r -4 r^3 +4 r^3 ] / denominator
= 16r / (4 - r²)^2

So the Laplacian is (1/r) * [16 r / (4 - r²)^2 ] → (16) / (4 - r²)^2.

So the Laplacian of ln(g) is 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by - (1/(2g)) * Laplacian(ln g). Because for a metric ds² = g(dx² + dy²), K = -(1/(2g)) Δ ln g.

Plugging in the numbers:

g = 32/(4 - r²)
Δ ln g = 16/(4 - r²)^2

So,

K = -(1/(2*(32/(4 - r²)))) * (16)/(4 - r²)^2 )
Simplify:

= - ( (4 - r²) )/(64) ) * (16)/(4 - r²)^2 )

= - [ (16 (4 - r²)) ) / (64 (4 - r²)^2) ) ]

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Wait, 1/(2g) is 1/(2 * (32/(4 - r²))) ) → (4 - r²) / (64)

Multiply by Δ ln g: (4 - r²)/(64) * 16/(4 - r²)^2 → [16 (4 - r²)] / [64 (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Which is 16/(64 (4 - r²)) ) → 1/(4 (4 - r²)) )

So K = - [1/(4 (4 - r²) ) ]

Wait, that's negative. So the Gaussian curvature K is negative. So this is a space of negative curvature. So it's a hyperbolic plane metric, but given that the question refers to a pseudosphere, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, but a pseudosphere is different; it's a surface in 3D space with constant negative curvature, but perhaps the metric given here is that of a hyperbolic plane, which is infinite in extent. Hmm, but the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2", which makes me think of a finite area, like a sphere but for negative curvature.

Wait, wait: a sphere of radius r has area 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, or a surface of constant negative curvature, the area is different. Wait, but in the case of a hyperbolic plane, the area is infinite because it's unbounded. However, a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite area surface, like a horn torus but with negative curvature. Hmm, but perhaps I'm confusing concepts here.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the area is similar to a sphere, but with a factor that reflects the negative curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a hyperbolic space, which is infinite, so the area would be infinite. But the options are given, and option D is +infty.

Wait, but let's think again. The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). The denominator 4 - (x² + y²) implies that x² + y² <4, so the domain is a disk of radius 2. So the space is a 2D hyperbolic disk with radius 2. So the area of a hyperbolic disk is larger than the corresponding Euclidean disk as the curvature is negative. Wait, no: for negative curvature, the area grows more rapidly with radius. But wait, the area of a hyperbolic disk of radius r is 4π sinh²(r/(2a)), where a is the curvature radius. Hmm, but perhaps the formula I'm recalling is for curvature K = -1/a². Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the area of a hyperbolic disk of radius r in a space with curvature K = -1 is 2π (cosh r -1). But I'm not sure.

Wait, in our case, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me see if this relates to a standard hyperbolic metric. The standard Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. Comparing to our metric, 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) = 4(1 - r²/4) where r is the radial coordinate in the disk (r = sqrt(x² + y²)).

So, 4 - r² = 4(1 - r²/4 ). So our metric can be written as ds² = [32/(4(1 - r²/4)))] (dr² + r² dθ² ) = (8/(1 - r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ² ). Hmm, the Poincaré metric is [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ² ). So comparing, our metric is [8/(1 - r²/4)] (dr² + r² dθ² ). So it's similar but with a different scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a scaled version. Let me try to find the curvature. Earlier calculation gave K = -1/(4(4 - r²) ). So as r approaches zero, K approaches -1/(16). So curvature is -1/16. So the space has constant negative curvature K = -1/(16). So the radius of curvature a is sqrt(-1/K) = sqrt(16) =4. So a=4.

Wait, a is the radius of curvature, and the area of a hyperbolic disk of radius R (in the sense of the model) is 4π sinh²(R/(2a)).

Wait, but in our case, the maximum r in the disk is 2, since x² + y² <4. So R=2. And a=4. So R/(2a) = 2/(8) = 1/4. So sinh(1/4) is sinh(0.25) ≈ 0.252.

Then, the area would be 4π ( (0.252)^2 ) ≈ around 0.25π, but that's just a rough estimate. But this seems a finite area, which would suggest the area is not infinite.

Wait, but the options don't have a numerical value. The options are A) 0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C) 4π(x² - y²), D) +infty.

Hmm, the options suggest that either it's zero, or a multiple of (x² + y²), which doesn't make sense because the area should be a number, not dependent on x and y. Unless perhaps the question is ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the total area of the pseudosphere, which is finite. But in the case of a hyperbolic disk of radius 2 in a space with curvature K=-1/16, the area would be finite, so the answer wouldn't be D.

But wait, the options don't include a specific finite number. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the metric represents a 2D space that's topologically a sphere but with negative curvature. But in 2D, a compact space with negative curvature isn't possible because of Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Wait, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem says that the integral of Gaussian curvature over a closed surface is 2π times the Euler characteristic. For a sphere, it's 4π. For a torus, it's 0. But in 2D, a pseudosphere is not compact, I think. So perhaps the space described by the metric is non-compact, leading to an infinite area.

Wait, the domain of the metric is x² + y² <4, which is a disk, so it's compact. But for a compact 2D manifold with negative curvature, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem would require that the integral of K is 2π. But for hyperbolic space, the curvature is negative, so that would require the integral to be negative, which would violate Gauss-Bonnet for compact surfaces. So perhaps this metric isn't representing a compact surface.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about this again. The metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, but it's conformally flat. The Gaussian curvature is negative everywhere except at the center, which is a singularity (as the denominator approaches zero as x² + y² approaches 4). So the space is a hyperbolic disk, which is finite in extent, but has infinite area because the curvature is negative. Wait, is that right? No, the area of a hyperbolic disk is finite for a given radius because the area formula depends on hyperbolic functions, which are finite. For example, as the radius R increases, the area tends to infinity, but for a finite R, it's finite.

Wait, but in our case, the maximum radius is 2. So R=2. Let me compute the area of a hyperbolic disk of radius 2, with curvature K=-1/16.

The formula for the area is 4π sinh²(R/(2a)), where a = sqrt(-1/K) = 4.

So R/(2a) = 2/(8) = 0.25. So sinh(0.25) ≈ 0.252. So sinh²(0.25) ≈ (0.252)^2 ≈ 0.0635. Multiply by 4π: ~0.254π.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the entire pseudosphere. But a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of revolution with finite area. But perhaps the metric given isn't representing a pseudosphere but a hyperbolic plane.

Wait, but the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2.' So perhaps the area is 4π times (r^2), but with a negative sign? Or perhaps it's considering the absolute value.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is infinite because the space is the entire hyperbolic plane, but the metric in the question is just a part of it. Wait, no, the metric is defined on x² + y² <4, which is a finite disk, so perhaps it's a compact hyperbolic surface, which would have finite area.

Hmm, but the options don't include a finite number. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again: option D is +infty. Suppose that the area is indeed infinite. How could that be? Well, if the space is a hyperbolic plane, which is infinite in extent, the area would be infinite. But the metric given is only defined on a finite disk (x² + y² <4), so perhaps it's a model of the hyperbolic plane, which is the Poincaré disk model, which is a finite representation of an infinite space. But in reality, the area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite.

Wait, but the area computed in the Poincaré disk is finite because it's a model on the disk. Or wait, no, the Poincaré disk model is a conformal mapping of the hyperbolic plane onto the disk, but the hyperbolic plane itself has infinite area. So perhaps the metric given is just a part of the hyperbolic plane, and the area is indeed infinite.

Wait, but in the metric given, the area can be computed by integrating the determinant of the metric over the domain x² + y² <4. The determinant of ds² is (32/(4 - x² - y²))² (dx dy), so the area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of (32/(4 - r²))² dx dy.

Wait, let's compute this.

In polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So:

Area = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)]² * r dθ dr.

The integral over θ is 2π, so:

Area = 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [32^2 r ] / (4 - r²)^2 dr
= 2π * 1024 ∫ (0 to 2) [ r ] / (4 - r²)^2 dr

Let me compute the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²)^2 dr.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r²)^2 = ∫ (-1/2) du / u² = (-1/2) * ∫ u^(-2) du = (-1/2) * (-1/u) + C = (1)/(2u) + C = 1/(2(4 - r²)) ) + C.

Evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2, denominator is 4 -4=0 → 1/(2*0) → infinity.

At r=0, denominator is 4 → 1/(8).

So the integral from 0 to 2 is [1/(0) ] - [1/(8)] → which is ∞.

So the area is 2π * 1024 * [ ∞ - 1/(8) ] → ∞. So the area is infinite.

So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space with constant negative curvature. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the domain of the metric is the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), with a singularity at \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\). This suggests that the space is a hyperbolic disk of radius 2.

To compute the area of this space, we integrate the determinant of the metric over the domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). In polar coordinates, the area element becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32^2}{(4 - r^2)^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) contributes a factor of \(2\pi\), leaving:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \cdot 1024 \int_0^2 \frac{r}{(4 - r^2)^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int \frac{r}{(4 - r^2)^2} \, dr = \int \frac{-1/2}{u^2} \, du = \frac{1}{2(4 - r^2)} + C.
\]

Evaluating this from \(r = 0\) to \(r = 2\), we find:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{(4 - r^2)^2} \, dr = \left[\frac{1}{2(4 - r^2)}\right]_0^2 = \frac{1}{2(0)} - \frac{1}{2(4)} = \infty.
\]

Thus, the area diverges to infinity. This result is consistent with the fact that the metric describes a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite extent despite being represented on a finite disk in the Poincaré model. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
