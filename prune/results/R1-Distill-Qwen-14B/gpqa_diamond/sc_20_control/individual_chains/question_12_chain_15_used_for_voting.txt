Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the Pi(+) is stationary, and it decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. But since neutrinos are massless (or at least, their mass is negligible compared to other particles in these kinds of problems), their momentum would be equal to that of the muon in magnitude.

Wait, actually, the neutrino has zero rest mass, right? So its energy is equal to its momentum times c, but since we're using units where c=1 (MeV and such), it's just E = p for the neutrino.

So the initial energy is the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since it has no rest mass).

Let me denote the muon's energy as E_mu and the neutrino's energy as E_nu. Then,

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 MeV = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + E_nu

But m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV, so:

139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + E_nu
So, K_mu + E_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Now, for the momentum part. The momentum of the muon is p_mu, and the neutrino has p_nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum must be zero, so p_mu = -p_nu. But the magnitudes are equal, so |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

The muon's momentum is related to its energy and mass by the relativistic equation:

E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2

Again, in units where c=1, this simplifies to E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Similarly, for the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p_nu.

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), we can write E_nu = p_mu.

So, substituting E_mu = m_mu + K_mu, and E_nu = p_mu,

Let me write E_mu as m_mu + K_mu.

So, (m_mu + K_mu)^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Expanding the left side:

(m_mu^2 + 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2) = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Subtract m_mu^2 from both sides:

2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = p_mu^2.

But p_mu is equal to E_nu, which is 33.9 - K_mu (because K_mu + E_nu =33.9).

Wait wait, earlier I had K_mu + E_nu =33.9. So E_nu =33.9 - K_mu.

So p_mu = E_nu =33.9 - K_mu.

Putting that into the equation:

2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2.

Let me compute the right side: (33.9 - K_mu)^2 = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu^2.

So substituting, the equation becomes:

2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu^2.

I can subtract K_mu^2 from both sides, which cancels.

That leaves:

2 m_mu K_mu = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9 K_mu.

Bring all terms to one side:

2 m_mu K_mu + 2*33.9 K_mu - (33.9)^2 = 0.

Factor out K_mu:

K_mu (2 m_mu + 2*33.9) ) = (33.9)^2.

Wait, let me compute that again. Let me reorganize the equation:

2 m_mu K_mu + 2*33.9 K_mu = (33.9)^2.

Factor K_mu:

K_mu (2 m_mu + 2 *33.9) ) = (33.9)^2.

Ah, because the right side is (33.9)^2, which is 33.9 squared.

So, 2 m_mu is 2 *105.7 MeV = 211.4 MeV.

Plus 2*33.9 is 67.8 MeV.

So 211.4 + 67.8 = 279.2 MeV.

So,

K_mu * 279.2 MeV = (33.9 MeV)^2.

Compute 33.9 squared: 33.9 *33.9.

Let me compute that: 30^2 is 900, 3.9^2 is 15.21, and 2*30*3.9 = 234. So (30+3.9)^2=900 + 234 +15.21= 1149.21.

So,

K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

279.2 times 4 is 1116.8. 4.1 *279.2 = 1116.8 +27.92= 1144.72. 4.12 *279.2=1144.72+ (0.02 *279.2)= 1144.72 +5.584=1150.304.

Wait, target is 1149.21.

So 4.12 would give about 1150.3, which is a bit higher than 1149.21. So a bit less than 4.12.

Let me calculate 4.11 *279.2:

4.11 *279.2 = (4 +0.11)*279.2= 4*279.2 +0.11*279.2.

4 *279.2 = 1116.8.

0.11*279.2 = 30.712.

So total is 1116.8 +30.712=1147.512.

Which is less than 1149.21.

So between 4.11 and 4.12.

The difference between 4.11 and 4.12 is 0.01, which leads to an increase of about 2.792 (since 279.2 *0.01= 2.792). So from 4.11 (1147.512) to 4.12 (1150.304), the difference in numerator is 1149.21 -1147.512=1.698.

So how much do I need to add to 4.11 to cover 1.698 in the product. Since each 0.001 of K_mu would add 279.2 *0.001 =0.2792 to the numerator.

So 1.698 /2.792 ≈ 0.606. So approximately 0.00606.

So 4.11 + 0.00606 =4.11606. So K_mu ≈4.116 MeV.

Wait, but wait: 279.2 * K_mu = 1149.21.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: 1149.21 /279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *4.116 = ?

Wait, maybe I should do division: 1149.21 ÷ 279.2.

Dividing 1149.21 by 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *4 = 1116.8.

1149.21 -1116.8 =32.41.

So 32.41 /279.2 ≈0.116.

So K_mu =4.116 MeV approximately.

So about 4.12 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait: the K_mu is 4.12, but what about the neutrino's energy?

Earlier we had K_mu + E_nu =33.9.

So E_nu =33.9 -4.12=29.78 MeV, approximately 29.8 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, neutrinos have negligible mass, so their entire energy is kinetic. So yes, their KE is E_nu.

So the options list the KEs of the product particles, which are mu(+) and nu.

So the answer should be D.

But let me double-check the calculations. Another approach: since the muon's KE is much less than the neutrino's, I think the earlier result makes sense.

Wait, in the decay pi+ → mu+ + nu, the muon gets a small KE and the neutrino a large KE because the muon has a large mass. So the neutrino takes away most of the energy, and the muon only a small part.

So our calculation gives K_mu≈4.12 and E_nu≈29.8. Which matches option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion \( \pi^+ \) into a muon \( \mu^+ \) and a neutrino \( \nu \). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

### Conservation of Energy
The total initial energy is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu,
\]
where \( E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+} \) (rest energy plus kinetic energy of the muon) and \( E_\nu = K_\nu \) (since the neutrino is massless, its energy is entirely kinetic).

Equating initial and final energies:
\[
139.6 = 105.7 + K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the system is zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
\]
For the muon, its energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Substituting \( E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+} \) and \( p_{\mu^+} = K_\nu \) (since \( E_\nu = p_\nu \) for the neutrino), we get:
\[
(m_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+})^2 = K_\nu^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 + 2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2 = K_\nu^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Canceling \( m_{\mu^+}^2 \) from both sides:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2 = K_\nu^2.
\]
Using \( K_\nu = 33.9 - K_{\mu^+} \) (from the energy conservation equation), substitute \( K_\nu \) into the equation:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2 = (33.9 - K_{\mu^+})^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2 = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Canceling \( K_{\mu^+}^2 \) from both sides:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_{\mu^+}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_{\mu^+} = 33.9^2.
\]
Factoring out \( K_{\mu^+} \):
\[
K_{\mu^+} (2 m_{\mu^+} + 2 \cdot 33.9) = 33.9^2.
\]
Substituting \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
K_{\mu^+} (2 \cdot 105.7 + 2 \cdot 33.9) = 33.9^2.
\]
Simplify:
\[
K_{\mu^+} (211.4 + 67.8) = 1149.21.
\]
\[
K_{\mu^+} (279.2) = 1149.21.
\]
Solving for \( K_{\mu^+} \):
\[
K_{\mu^+} = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Neutrino Kinetic Energy
Using \( K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = 33.9 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
K_\nu = 33.9 - K_{\mu^+} = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). This matches option **D**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the Pi(+) is stationary, and it decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. But since neutrinos are massless (or at least, their mass is negligible compared to other particles in these kinds of problems), their momentum would be equal to that of the muon in magnitude.

Wait, actually, the neutrino has zero rest mass, right? So its energy is equal to its momentum times c, but since we're using units where c=1 (MeV and such), it's just E = p for the neutrino.

So the initial energy is the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since it has no rest mass).

Let me denote the muon's energy as E_mu and the neutrino's energy as E_nu. Then,

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 MeV = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + E_nu

But m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV, so:

139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + E_nu
So, K_mu + E_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Now, for the momentum part. The momentum of the muon is p_mu, and the neutrino has p_nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum must be zero, so p_mu = -p_nu. But the magnitudes are equal, so |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

The muon's momentum is related to its energy and mass by the relativistic equation:

E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2

Again, in units where c=1, this simplifies to E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Similarly, for the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p_nu.

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), we can write E_nu = p_mu.

So, substituting E_mu = m_mu + K_mu, and E_nu = p_mu,

Let me write E_mu as m_mu + K_mu.

So, (m_mu + K_mu)^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Expanding the left side:

(m_mu^2 + 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2) = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Subtract m_mu^2 from both sides:

2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = p_mu^2.

But p_mu is equal to E_nu, which is 33.9 - K_mu (because K_mu + E_nu =33.9).

Wait wait, earlier I had K_mu + E_nu =33.9. So E_nu =33.9 - K_mu.

So p_mu = E_nu =33.9 - K_mu.

Putting that into the equation:

2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2.

Let me compute the right side: (33.9 - K_mu)^2 = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu^2.

So substituting, the equation becomes:

2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu^2.

I can subtract K_mu^2 from both sides, which cancels.

That leaves:

2 m_mu K_mu = (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9 K_mu.

Bring all terms to one side:

2 m_mu K_mu + 2*33.9 K_mu - (33.9)^2 = 0.

Factor out K_mu:

K_mu (2 m_mu + 2*33.9) ) = (33.9)^2.

Wait, let me compute that again. Let me reorganize the equation:

2 m_mu K_mu + 2*33.9 K_mu = (33.9)^2.

Factor K_mu:

K_mu (2 m_mu + 2 *33.9) ) = (33.9)^2.

Ah, because the right side is (33.9)^2, which is 33.9 squared.

So, 2 m_mu is 2 *105.7 MeV = 211.4 MeV.

Plus 2*33.9 is 67.8 MeV.

So 211.4 + 67.8 = 279.2 MeV.

So,

K_mu * 279.2 MeV = (33.9 MeV)^2.

Compute 33.9 squared: 33.9 *33.9.

Let me compute that: 30^2 is 900, 3.9^2 is 15.21, and 2*30*3.9 = 234. So (30+3.9)^2=900 + 234 +15.21= 1149.21.

So,

K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

279.2 times 4 is 1116.8. 4.1 *279.2 = 1116.8 +27.92= 1144.72. 4.12 *279.2=1144.72+ (0.02 *279.2)= 1144.72 +5.584=1150.304.

Wait, target is 1149.21.

So 4.12 would give about 1150.3, which is a bit higher than 1149.21. So a bit less than 4.12.

Let me calculate 4.11 *279.2:

4.11 *279.2 = (4 +0.11)*279.2= 4*279.2 +0.11*279.2.

4 *279.2 = 1116.8.

0.11*279.2 = 30.712.

So total is 1116.8 +30.712=1147.512.

Which is less than 1149.21.

So between 4.11 and 4.12.

The difference between 4.11 and 4.12 is 0.01, which leads to an increase of about 2.792 (since 279.2 *0.01= 2.792). So from 4.11 (1147.512) to 4.12 (1150.304), the difference in numerator is 1149.21 -1147.512=1.698.

So how much do I need to add to 4.11 to cover 1.698 in the product. Since each 0.001 of K_mu would add 279.2 *0.001 =0.2792 to the numerator.

So 1.698 /2.792 ≈ 0.606. So approximately 0.00606.

So 4.11 + 0.00606 =4.11606. So K_mu ≈4.116 MeV.

Wait, but wait: 279.2 * K_mu = 1149.21.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: 1149.21 /279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *4.116 = ?

Wait, maybe I should do division: 1149.21 ÷ 279.2.

Dividing 1149.21 by 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *4 = 1116.8.

1149.21 -1116.8 =32.41.

So 32.41 /279.2 ≈0.116.

So K_mu =4.116 MeV approximately.

So about 4.12 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait: the K_mu is 4.12, but what about the neutrino's energy?

Earlier we had K_mu + E_nu =33.9.

So E_nu =33.9 -4.12=29.78 MeV, approximately 29.8 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, neutrinos have negligible mass, so their entire energy is kinetic. So yes, their KE is E_nu.

So the options list the KEs of the product particles, which are mu(+) and nu.

So the answer should be D.

But let me double-check the calculations. Another approach: since the muon's KE is much less than the neutrino's, I think the earlier result makes sense.

Wait, in the decay pi+ → mu+ + nu, the muon gets a small KE and the neutrino a large KE because the muon has a large mass. So the neutrino takes away most of the energy, and the muon only a small part.

So our calculation gives K_mu≈4.12 and E_nu≈29.8. Which matches option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion \( \pi^+ \) into a muon \( \mu^+ \) and a neutrino \( \nu \). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

### Conservation of Energy
The total initial energy is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu,
\]
where \( E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+} \) (rest energy plus kinetic energy of the muon) and \( E_\nu = K_\nu \) (since the neutrino is massless, its energy is entirely kinetic).

Equating initial and final energies:
\[
139.6 = 105.7 + K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the system is zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
\]
For the muon, its energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Substituting \( E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+} \) and \( p_{\mu^+} = K_\nu \) (since \( E_\nu = p_\nu \) for the neutrino), we get:
\[
(m_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+})^2 = K_\nu^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 + 2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2 = K_\nu^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Canceling \( m_{\mu^+}^2 \) from both sides:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2 = K_\nu^2.
\]
Using \( K_\nu = 33.9 - K_{\mu^+} \) (from the energy conservation equation), substitute \( K_\nu \) into the equation:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2 = (33.9 - K_{\mu^+})^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2 = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Canceling \( K_{\mu^+}^2 \) from both sides:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_{\mu^+}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
2 m_{\mu^+} K_{\mu^+} + 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_{\mu^+} = 33.9^2.
\]
Factoring out \( K_{\mu^+} \):
\[
K_{\mu^+} (2 m_{\mu^+} + 2 \cdot 33.9) = 33.9^2.
\]
Substituting \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
K_{\mu^+} (2 \cdot 105.7 + 2 \cdot 33.9) = 33.9^2.
\]
Simplify:
\[
K_{\mu^+} (211.4 + 67.8) = 1149.21.
\]
\[
K_{\mu^+} (279.2) = 1149.21.
\]
Solving for \( K_{\mu^+} \):
\[
K_{\mu^+} = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Neutrino Kinetic Energy
Using \( K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = 33.9 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
K_\nu = 33.9 - K_{\mu^+} = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). This matches option **D**.

Answer: D
