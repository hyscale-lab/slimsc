Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is about an annihilation process: proton plus antiproton annihilate to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they convert into other particles. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can assume that the initial kinetic energy is low compared to the rest mass energy. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving," so perhaps it's moving non-relativistically. But then again, in particle physics, even low speeds can lead to relativistic effects if the mass is large. Wait, but since the mass of A is 300 MeV, which is probably a pion or something similar, but pions are around 140 MeV. Hmm, but maybe it's another particle.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Their rest mass energies are each about 938 MeV. So the total rest mass energy before annihilation is 2 * 938 = ~1876 MeV. The products are four particles: two A+ and two A-. Each A has mass 300 MeV, so the total rest mass after is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the initial rest mass is 1876, products are 1200. So the initial rest mass is higher than the final. That suggests that the annihilation is possible, and there's a lot of energy to distribute.

But wait, the initial antiproton is moving slowly. So in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. Because the antiproton is much lighter than the proton? No, wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, 938 MeV. So if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass. So maybe we can approximate the total energy as just the sum of rest energies plus some small kinetic energy. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So the initial system has proton (rest) and a moving antiproton. The total energy would be the proton's rest energy plus the total energy of the antiproton. The total momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton, since the proton is at rest.

Because the antiproton is moving slowly, its velocity is much less than c, so maybe we can approximate the energy and momentum using classical (non-relativistic) mechanics? Or perhaps we need to use relativistic equations.

Wait, but the products are four particles. So the energy and momentum must be conserved. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is low, so the products have low momentum as well. But given that the mass of A is 300 MeV, which is less than the proton mass, so each A is lighter, but four of them, so their total rest mass is 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial 1876 MeV.

But how do I approach this?

I think I should consider conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial proton is at rest, the total initial momentum is just that of the antiproton.

Let me denote the variables:

Let me denote m_p as the mass of proton (and antiproton, since they are same). So m_p = 938 MeV/c². The antiproton's velocity is v, so its gamma factor is γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Its momentum is p = γ m_p v.

The total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

The total initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v.

After the annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. Let me assume that they are all moving with the same velocity u (since the problem asks for the velocity of A, perhaps all A particles are moving at the same speed? But that's an assumption because the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe they are moving in some symmetric way, perhaps in pairs or something. Hmm, but without knowing the specifics, perhaps we can model the simplest case where all four particles move in the same direction, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the products are moving in opposite directions, but that's not clear.

Wait, the problem says: "the velocity of particle A". So perhaps all A particles have the same velocity. So maybe it's assumed that each A particle has velocity u, and perhaps they are all moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the products are moving symmetrically, perhaps two in one direction and two in the opposite. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the products are all moving in the same direction, but that's an assumption I would need to make.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is symmetric, so the products are moving in a way that their momentum adds up to the initial momentum. Since the initial momentum is all from the antiproton, which is moving in one direction, perhaps the products' momenta add up to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the simplest case is to assume that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the antiproton, each with velocity u. Then, the total momentum of the products would be 4 γ_A m_A u, where γ_A is the Lorentz factor for the A particles.

But wait, no, because each A has its own γ. So perhaps each A has momentum γ m_A u, so the total momentum is 4 γ m_A u.

But then, the initial momentum is p_initial = γ_p m_p v, where γ_p is the gamma for the antiproton.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote:

Initial momentum: p_initial = γ_p m_p v (since the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v).

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + γ_p m_p c².

After annihilation, the four A particles have some energy and momentum. Let's denote their velocity as u. Assuming they all have the same speed u, and maybe they're moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. But that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving in opposite directions symmetrically, but that's more complex.

Wait, considering that the initial momentum is along one direction, perhaps the products are moving in the same direction, each with velocity u. So total momentum after is 4 gamma_A m_A u, where gamma_A is gamma for each A particle.

But wait, each A is moving with speed u, so their momentum is gamma_A m_A u each. So four of them sum to 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Similarly, their total energy would be 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But how can I relate this to the initial conditions?

So, conservation of momentum:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

Conservation of energy:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

Hmm, so I have two equations with two unknowns: gamma_A and u, and gamma_p and v. But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is small compared to c. So perhaps we can approximate gamma_p as approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), because for small v, gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²).

Wait, but if v is slow, then v << c, so we can approximate gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²).

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c², because the antiproton's kinetic energy is small, so E_initial ≈ m_p c² (proton) + m_p c² (antiproton) = 2 m_p c². But in reality, the antiproton's energy is gamma_p m_p c², which is more than m_p c² if it's moving. But if it's moving slowly, gamma_p is close to 1, so E_initial ≈ (1 + 1) m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

Wait, but in the problem, the antiproton is moving, so E_initial is a bit higher than 2 m_p c².

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the equations.

Let me write the two equations:

1. 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

2. 4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

Because the initial energy is m_p c² (proton) + gamma_p m_p c² (antiproton) = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

So, from equation 2, I can express gamma_A in terms of gamma_p, m_p, and m_A.

Let me divide equation 1 by equation 2 to eliminate gamma_A.

So, equation 1 / equation 2: [4 gamma_A m_A u ] / [4 gamma_A m_A c²] ] = [gamma_p m_p v ] / [m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) ) ]

Simplifying left side: (u) / c².

Right side: [gamma_p v ] / [c² (1 + gamma_p) ) ]

So,

u / c² = (gamma_p v ) / ( c² (1 + gamma_p) )

Cancel c² on both sides,

u = (gamma_p v ) / (1 + gamma_p )

So, u = [gamma_p v ] / (1 + gamma_p )

Hmm, interesting. Now, we can write u in terms of gamma_p and v.

But we have another relation: gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v << c, so perhaps we can approximate gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that gamma_p is approximately 1. Because v is small, so the antiproton's energy is approximately m_p c², and its momentum is approximately m_p v.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving with velocity v, then its gamma is about 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), so the momentum is approximately m_p v + (m_p v³)/(6 c²), but for small v, that's about m_p v.

Hmm, but maybe another approach is better. Let's see.

Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum. Let me write the initial energy and momentum and set up the equations.

Initial momentum: p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

After annihilation, the four particles each have energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c² and momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A u.

So,

4 E_A = E_initial → 4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma_p) m_p c².

And,

4 p_A = p_initial → 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

Let me divide the momentum equation by the energy equation.

[4 gamma_A m_A u] / [4 gamma_A m_A c²] = [gamma_p m_p v] / [ (1 + gamma_p) m_p c² ]

Simplify:

u / c² = (gamma_p v) / ( (1 + gamma_p) c² )

Cancel c²:

u = (gamma_p v) / (1 + gamma_p )

Which brings us back to the same equation as before.

So, what's next? Let's substitute gamma_p into this.

gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

But I don't know v yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for u in terms of gamma_p.

Wait, let me see. Let me express u in terms of gamma_p and v.

u = v * [gamma_p / (1 + gamma_p) ]

But since v is the velocity of the antiproton, which is much less than c, perhaps we can approximate gamma_p as being close to 1. So gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

But perhaps that's not helpful yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma_p in terms of u and v, but I'm stuck here.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the particle A's velocity is given, so perhaps I can find gamma_A in terms of u and then substitute.

Wait, let me go back to the energy equation.

4 gamma_A m_A c^2 = (1 + gamma_p) m_p c^2.

So,

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma_p) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

Similarly, from the momentum equation, gamma_A = [ gamma_p m_p v ] / (4 m_A u )

So,

gamma_A = (gamma_p m_p v) / (4 m_A u )

But from the energy equation, gamma_A is also [ (1 + gamma_p) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

So,

( gamma_p m_p v ) / (4 m_A u ) ) = [ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

Cancel m_p and 4 m_A from both sides,

gamma_p v / u = 1 + gamma_p.

So,

gamma_p v = u (1 + gamma_p )

Wait, that's the same as the earlier equation: u = (gamma_p v) / (1 + gamma_p )

Hmm. So, I'm going in circles.

Maybe I should consider that the four A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to p_initial, which is the antiproton's momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an approximation that since the initial antiproton is moving slowly, the velocity of the A particles is also not too high, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can make an assumption that the velocity u of A is high enough that relativistic effects are significant, but the antiproton's velocity is low.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocity u of the A particles by considering that in the center of mass frame, the energy and momentum are easier to compute.

Wait, but the initial frame is the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving. The center of mass frame would have both particles moving, but perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the total initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v, and the total energy is E_initial = (1 + gamma_p) m_p c².

In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, but maybe I can think about the energy in the center of mass frame.

The total energy in the center of mass frame is the sum of the rest energies of the products. So,

E_cm = 4 m_A c².

But the energy in the center of mass frame is also equal to the square root of (E_total^2 - (p_total c)^2 )

So,

E_cm^2 = (E_initial c)^2 - (p_initial c^2 )^2.

Wait, no, the equation is E_cm^2 = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

So,

E_cm^2 = ( (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c^2 )^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c )^2.

But E_cm must be equal to 4 m_A c^2, the rest energy of the products.

So,

( (1 + gamma_p )^2 m_p^2 c^4 ) - ( gamma_p^2 m_p^2 v^2 c^2 ) ) = (4 m_A c^2 )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4,

(1 + gamma_p )^2 m_p^2 - gamma_p^2 m_p^2 (v^2 / c^2 ) = 16 m_A^2.

Hmm, that looks complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it.

Let me factor m_p^2:

m_p^2 [ (1 + gamma_p )^2 - gamma_p^2 (v^2 / c^2 ) ] = 16 m_A^2.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let me try expanding (1 + gamma_p )^2:

(1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 ) - gamma_p^2 (v^2 / c^2 ) = 16 (m_A/m_p )^2.

So,

1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 (1 - v²/c² ) = 16 (m_A/m_p )^2.

But wait, gamma_p is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so 1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma_p^2).

So,

1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 (1/(gamma_p^2 )) ) = 16 (m_A/m_p )^2.

Simplify the term gamma_p^2 * (1/(gamma_p^2)) → 1.

So,

1 + 2 gamma_p + 1 = 16 (m_A/m_p )^2.

So,

2 + 2 gamma_p = 16 (300/938 )^2.

Wait, m_A is given as 300 MeV, and m_p is 938 MeV.

So,

300/938 ≈ 0.3197.

So,

(300/938 )^2 ≈ (0.3197 )^2 ≈ 0.1022.

So,

16 * 0.1022 ≈ 1.635.

So,

2 + 2 gamma_p = 1.635 → 2 gamma_p = 1.635 - 2 = -0.365.

But that can't be, because gamma_p is always greater than 1. Hmm, that must mean I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

The E_cm^2 equation:

E_cm^2 = [ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c² ]² - [ gamma_p m_p v ]² c².

Wait, no. Because p_initial is gamma_p m_p v, and the equation is E_cm^2 = (E_initial)^2 c² - (p_initial c )^2.

Wait, no, the formula is E_cm² = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c )^2.

In natural units where c=1, E_cm² = E_total² - (p_total )².

But when working with units, we have to keep track of the factors of c.

So, E_total is in energy units (like MeV), p_total is in momentum units (MeV/c), so when we compute (p_total c ), that would be (MeV/c) * c = MeV.

So,

E_cm^2 = [ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma_p m_p v ]^2 c^2.

Wait, let me compute each term correctly.

E_total is (m_p c²) + (gamma_p m_p c²) ) = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p )

p_total is gamma_p m_p v.

So,

E_cm^2 = [ m_p c² (1 + gamma_p ) ]^2 - [ gamma_p m_p v c ]^2.

So,

E_cm^2 = m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma_p )² - gamma_p² m_p² v² c².

Factor m_p² c^4:

= m_p² c^4 [ (1 + gamma_p )² - gamma_p² (v²/c²) ]

Hmm, same as before.

Now, let me write gamma_p = 1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so v²/c² = 1 - (1/gamma_p^2 )

So, substitute v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma_p^2.

So,

(1 + gamma_p )^2 - gamma_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 )

= (1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 ) - gamma_p^2 + 1.

Wait, expanding:

= 1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 - gamma_p^2 + 1.

Because,

gamma_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) = gamma_p^2 - 1.

So,

(1 + gamma_p )^2 - (gamma_p^2 - 1 )

= 1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 - gamma_p^2 + 1.

= 2 + 2 gamma_p.

So,

E_cm^2 = m_p^2 c^4 (2 + 2 gamma_p )

But E_cm is also equal to the total rest energy of the products, which is 4 m_A c².

So,

(4 m_A c² )^2 = m_p^2 c^4 (2 + 2 gamma_p )

Divide both sides by c^4,

16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (2 + 2 gamma_p )

Divide both sides by m_p^2,

(16 m_A^2 ) / m_p^2 = 2 (1 + gamma_p )

So,

1 + gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 ) / ( m_p^2 )

Wait, because 16/(2) is 8.

So,

gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 / m_p^2 ) - 1.

Now, plug in the numbers.

m_A = 300 MeV, m_p = 938 MeV.

So,

m_A^2 = 300^2 = 90,000 (MeV)^2.

m_p^2 = 938^2 ≈ 880,  let me compute 938 squared.

938 * 938 = ?

Well, 900^2 = 810,000

(900 + 38)^2 = 900^2 + 2*900*38 + 38^2.

= 810,000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 810,000 + 68,400 = 878,400 + 1,444 = 879,844.

So,

8 m_A^2 / m_p^2 = 8 * 90,000 / 879,844.

Compute numerator: 8 * 90,000 = 720,000.

720,000 / 879,844 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide 720,000 by 879,844.

Approximately, 720,000 ÷ 880,000 ≈ 0.818.

So, 0.818.

Thus,

gamma_p = 0.818 - 1 = -0.182.

Wait, that's impossible because gamma_p is always greater than 1. So I must have made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me double-check the equation.

Earlier, I had:

16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (2 + 2 gamma_p )

So,

16 m_A^2 = 2 m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p )

Divide both sides by 2 m_p^2:

8 m_A^2 / m_p^2 = 1 + gamma_p.

So,

gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 / m_p^2 ) - 1.

Which is what I did.

Plugging the numbers:

gamma_p = (8 * 300^2 ) / (938^2 ) - 1.

Wait, 8 * 300^2 is 8 *90000 = 720,000.

938^2 is 879,844.

So,

720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma_p = 0.818 - 1 = -0.182.

Which is negative, impossible. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, that suggests that my approach is incorrect, which is concerning.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the E_cm calculation. Because the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, but when they annihilate, they produce other particles. The energy in the center of mass frame is the sum of their rest masses. So perhaps the E_cm is the sum of the rest masses of the products, which is 4 m_A c². But the initial E_cm is the sum of the rest masses of the initial particles, each m_p c², but wait, no. Because the annihilation can produce particles with higher or lower mass than the initial. Wait, but the initial system's energy in the center of mass frame is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton, because they are moving towards each other? Or are they?

Wait, no. Because in the lab frame, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving. The center of mass frame would have both moving towards each other. But perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps the mistake lies in the assumption that the entire energy goes into rest mass. Because the initial system has rest mass energy of 2 m_p c², but the products have rest mass 4 m_A c². But 4 m_A is 1200 MeV, which is less than 2 *938 = 1876 MeV. So, the rest mass energy of the products is less than the initial rest mass energy. So, the extra energy must go into kinetic energy.

Wait, but the initial system's energy in the center of mass frame is (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c )^2 )^0.5.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The initial system has energy E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

Momentum p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

The energy in the center of mass frame is E_cm = sqrt( E_initial^2 - (p_initial c )^2 ).

But E_cm should equal the sum of the rest energies of the products, which is 4 m_A c².

So,

4 m_A c² = sqrt( [ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma_p m_p v c ]^2 )

Square both sides,

16 m_A^2 c^4 = [ (1 + gamma_p )^2 m_p^2 c^4 - gamma_p^2 m_p^2 v^2 c^2 ]

Divide both sides by c^4,

16 m_A^2 = (1 + gamma_p )^2 m_p^2 - gamma_p^2 m_p^2 (v^2 / c^2 )

But v^2 / c^2 = 1 - (1/ gamma_p^2 ), because gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) → 1 / gamma_p^2 = 1 - v²/c² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma_p^2.

So,

16 m_A^2 = (1 + gamma_p )^2 m_p^2 - gamma_p^2 m_p^2 ( 1 - 1/gamma_p^2 )

Expand the terms:

(1 + gamma_p )^2 = 1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2.

gamma_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) = gamma_p^2 - 1.

So,

16 m_A^2 = [1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 ] m_p^2 - (gamma_p^2 - 1 ) m_p^2.

= [1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 - gamma_p^2 +1 ] m_p^2.

= [2 + 2 gamma_p ] m_p^2.

So,

16 m_A^2 = 2 m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p )

So,

1 + gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 ) / (m_p^2 )

Hmm, that's the same equation as before.

So,

gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 / m_p^2 ) - 1.

But when m_A is 300, and m_p is 938,

8*(300)^2 = 8*90,000=720,000.

938^2=879,844.

So,

gamma_p = 720000 / 879844 - 1.

720000 / 879844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma_p ≈ 0.818 - 1 = -0.182.

Negative gamma, which is impossible.

Hmm, that's a problem. So that suggests that my approach is wrong. Maybe the initial assumption about the way the products are moving is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the setup.

Wait, another approach: since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can treat the problem non-relativistically, where the kinetic energy is much less than the rest mass energy.

So, in non-relativistic terms, the initial antiproton's momentum is m_p v, and its energy is (m_p v^2 ) / 2.

So, the total initial energy is m_p c² + m_p c² + (m_p v^2 )/(2 ), but when v is small, the kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest energy.

Wait, but the products have rest mass 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV, which is less than 2 m_p c² (1876 MeV). So, the initial rest energy is higher than the final rest energy, so the products must have kinetic energy.

But given that the initial antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps the kinetic energy is small, so the products' velocities may not be too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the products are created at rest in the center of mass frame, but that's not the case here.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the products would have zero net momentum. So the products would have to be moving in such a way that their momenta cancel out.

But in the lab frame, the initial momentum is all from the antiproton, so the products must have a net momentum equal to that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that all four A particles are moving with the same velocity, in the same direction as the initial antiproton. Then their total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But then, using conservation of momentum:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

And conservation of energy:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p )

So, from the momentum equation:

gamma_A u = (gamma_p m_p v )/(4 m_A )

From the energy equation:

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p ]/(4 m_A )

So,

gamma_A u = [ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p ]/(4 m_A ) * u = (gamma_p m_p v )/(4 m_A )

Cancel (m_p)/(4 m_A ) from both sides,

(1 + gamma_p ) u = gamma_p v.

So,

u = [ gamma_p v ] / (1 + gamma_p )

But now, we can also write gamma_p in terms of v, since gamma_p = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

But perhaps I can express v in terms of u.

Wait, but I have two variables: u and v. I need another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find u in terms of gamma_p.

Wait, from u = [gamma_p v ] / (1 + gamma_p )

But v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p^2 )

Wait, because v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p^2 )

So,

u = [ gamma_p * c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) ] / (1 + gamma_p )

Simplify sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) = sqrt( (gamma_p^2 -1 ) / gamma_p^2 ) ) = sqrt(gamma_p^2 -1 ) / gamma_p.

So,

u = [ gamma_p * c * ( sqrt(gamma_p^2 -1 ) / gamma_p ) ] / (1 + gamma_p )

Simplify,

u = [ c sqrt(gamma_p^2 -1 ) ] / (1 + gamma_p )

Hmm, perhaps I can relate this to the velocity of the A particles.

But this seems complicated. Maybe we can make some approximation.

Given that the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so gamma_p is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c² )

But perhaps gamma_p is close to 1, so (gamma_p^2 -1 ) ≈ 2 gamma_p (gamma_p -1 ) ≈ 2 ( (v² )/(2 c² )) ) * something. Maybe that's getting too involved.

Alternatively, since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate gamma_p ≈ 1, so v is much less than c.

If gamma_p ≈ 1, then,

u ≈ [ c * sqrt( (1)^2 -1 ) ] / (1 +1 ) → 0.

Which can't be right because the products need to carry momentum.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think of a different method.

Wait, maybe I can consider the conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame, and express everything in terms of the velocities.

But maybe let's think of the problem in terms of invariant quantities.

The invariant quantity s is the square of the total energy in the center of mass frame, given by s = (E_total )^2 - (p_total c )^2.

In this case,

s = ( m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² )^2 - ( gamma_p m_p v c )^2.

But s must also equal (4 m_A c² )^2, because that's the total rest energy of the products.

So,

( (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c² )^2 - ( gamma_p m_p v c )^2 = (4 m_A c² )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4,

(1 + gamma_p )^2 m_p^2 - gamma_p^2 m_p^2 (v^2 / c^2 ) = 16 m_A^2.

Now, substitute v^2 / c^2 = 1 - 1/gamma_p^2.

So,

(1 + gamma_p )^2 m_p^2 - gamma_p^2 m_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) = 16 m_A^2.

Expand,

(1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 ) m_p^2 - gamma_p^2 m_p^2 + m_p^2 = 16 m_A^2.

Simplify,

[1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 - gamma_p^2 +1 ] m_p^2 = 16 m_A^2.

Which again gives,

(2 + 2 gamma_p ) m_p^2 = 16 m_A^2.

So,

gamma_p = (16 m_A^2 )/(2 m_p^2 ) ) -1 = 8 (m_A^2)/(m_p^2 ) -1.

Which, when plugging in the numbers, leads to a negative gamma_p, which is impossible.

This suggests that either my approach is wrong, or perhaps the assumption that all four A particles move with the same velocity u is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the products don't all move in the same direction. Maybe two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, so their momenta cancel. But that's only possible if their momenta are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, if two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, then their total momentum would be 2 (gamma_A m_A u ) - 2 (gamma_A m_A u ) ) = 0, which can't be because the initial momentum is non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps three move in one direction and one in the opposite, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps two are moving in one direction and two in another, such that their total momentum adds up to the initial momentum.

But without knowing the directions, this could be any arrangement, making it hard to model.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles move in the same direction is incorrect, leading to the impossible gamma_p. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the annihilation process creates two pairs of particles, each pair with opposite momentum, leading to a net momentum equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton.

But that's a possible scenario. For example, two A+ and two A-: perhaps two are moving in the same direction as the antiproton, and two in the opposite, but their momentum adds up to the initial.

But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in such a way that their total momentum is the same as the initial.

Wait, perhaps each A has velocity u, but perhaps two are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and two in the opposite direction, each with velocity u.

In that case, the total momentum would be 2 gamma_A m_A u (in the direction) - 2 gamma_A m_A u (opposite direction) ) → 2 gamma_A m_A u (1) + 2 gamma_A m_A u (-1) ) = 0?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps two are moving in the same direction as the initial, and two in the opposite direction, but with a different velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the A particles are created in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions, but I'm not sure.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that the particles are created in pairs, so their velocities are such that they carry away momentum in a way that the total is the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate that the velocity u of the A particles is non-relativistic, so gamma_A ≈ 1. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, but it's possible that the A particles are moving at relativistic speeds. So perhaps I can't make that approximation.

Wait, another thought: since the initial system's energy is much larger than the rest mass of the products, the A particles must be moving at high speeds.

But without knowing their velocities, perhaps I can find gamma_A from the energy equation.

Wait, let's think again.

From the energy equation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c².

So,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma_p ) m_p / (4 m_A )

Similarly, from the momentum equation:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

So,

gamma_A u = (gamma_p m_p v )/(4 m_A )

But from the energy equation,

gamma_A = ( (1 + gamma_p ) m_p )/(4 m_A )

So,

gamma_A u = [ gamma_p m_p v ] / (4 m_A )

Divide the two equations:

gamma_A u / gamma_A = [ gamma_p m_p v ]/(4 m_A ) / [ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p / (4 m_A ) ]

Simplify,

u = (gamma_p v )/(1 + gamma_p )

Which brings me back to the same equation as before.

So, I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I can express v in terms of gamma_p.

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p^2 )

So,

u = [ gamma_p * c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) ] / (1 + gamma_p )

But from the earlier equation, gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 / m_p^2 ) -1.

Which, when m_A =300, m_p=938, gives gamma_p negative, which is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake lies in the assumption about the number of particles. The problem states that the products are 2 A+ and 2 A-.

Wait, perhaps each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other. But then, since there are two A+ and two A-, perhaps the total momentum is the sum of the A+ and A- momenta.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Maybe it's time to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of four-momentum. The initial four-momentum is the sum of the proton and antiproton four-momenta.

The proton is at rest, so its four-momentum is (m_p c, 0, 0, 0 ).

The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its four-momentum is (gamma_p m_p c^2, gamma_p m_p v c, 0, 0 ).

So, the total initial four-momentum is ( (m_p + gamma_p m_p ) c², gamma_p m_p v c, 0, 0 )

The four-momentum of the products must sum to this. Since there are four A particles, perhaps each has four-momentum (E_A, p_A, 0, 0 ), but that might not be the case unless they're all moving in the same direction, which I'm not sure of.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has energy E_A and momentum p_A, but in different directions.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I can consider that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, so their momenta add up.

Then,

Total energy of products: 4 E_A = (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c^2.

Total momentum: 4 p_A = gamma_p m_p v.

So,

E_A = (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c^2 /4.

p_A = gamma_p m_p v /4.

But for each A, E_A^2 = (p_A c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2.

So,

[ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c^2 /4 ]^2 = [ (gamma_p m_p v /4 ) c ]^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2.

Let me write this equation:

[ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c^2 /4 ]^2 - [ (gamma_p m_p v c /4 ) ]^2 = (m_A c^2 )^2.

Factor out (m_p c^2 /4 )^2,

(m_p c^2 /4 )^2 [ (1 + gamma_p )^2 - gamma_p^2 (v^2 / c^2 ) ] = (m_A c^2 )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4,

(m_p^2 / 16 ) [ (1 + gamma_p )^2 - gamma_p^2 (v^2/c^2 ) ] = m_A^2.

Again, v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/gamma_p^2.

Substitute,

(m_p^2 /16 ) [ (1 + gamma_p )^2 - gamma_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) ] = m_A^2.

Expand,

(m_p^2 /16 ) [ 1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 - gamma_p^2 +1 ] = m_A^2.

Simplify,

(m_p^2 /16 ) [ 2 + 2 gamma_p ] = m_A^2.

Which simplifies to,

m_p^2 (2 + 2 gamma_p ) /16 = m_A^2.

Multiply both sides by 16,

m_p^2 (2 + 2 gamma_p ) = 16 m_A^2.

Divide both sides by 2,

m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p ) = 8 m_A^2.

Again,

gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 / m_p^2 ) -1.

Which, as before, gives a negative gamma_p. So, this approach isn't working.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach or think about the problem differently.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the initial kinetic energy is low, so the products are moving with non-relativistic speeds. So, gamma_A ≈ 1.

If gamma_A ≈ 1, then from the energy equation,

4 m_A c² ≈ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c².

So,

1 + gamma_p ≈ (4 m_A ) / (m_p )

With m_A=300, m_p=938,

4*300 /938 ≈ 1200/938 ≈ 1.28.

So,

gamma_p ≈ 1.28 -1 = 0.28.

But gamma_p must be greater than 1, which it's not in this case. So that's impossible. Hence, the assumption that gamma_A is approximately 1 is incorrect; the products must be moving relativistically.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the possible answers given.

The options are:

A) 0.77c
B) 0.96c
C) 0.91c
D) 0.86c

These are all high velocities, so all the products are moving at relativistic speeds. So perhaps the velocity is close to c, which suggests gamma_A is large.

But earlier, I found that gamma_p would be negative, which is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the products are moving in such a way that their total momentum is equal to the initial momentum, but their velocities are in the same direction, and I can find a way to calculate it without directly finding gamma_p.

Wait, another approach: use the relation between energy and momentum for each A particle.

E_A^2 = (p_A c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2.

But from conservation of energy,

4 E_A = (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c^2.

From conservation of momentum,

4 p_A = gamma_p m_p v.

So,

p_A = (gamma_p m_p v )/(4 )

Substitute into the energy equation,

E_A = sqrt( (p_A c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 )

= sqrt( [ (gamma_p m_p v c ) /4 ]^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 )

But from the energy conservation,

E_A = [ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c^2 ] /4 

So,

[ (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c^2 /4 ]^2 = [ (gamma_p m_p v c )^2 /16 ] + m_A^2 c^4.

Multiply both sides by 16,

(1 + gamma_p )^2 m_p^2 c^4 = gamma_p^2 m_p^2 v^2 c^2 + 16 m_A^2 c^4.

Divide both sides by c^2,

(1 + gamma_p )^2 m_p^2 c^2 = gamma_p^2 m_p^2 v^2 + 16 m_A^2 c^2.

Hmm, but this seems similar to earlier steps. Maybe I can factor out m_p^2 c^2.

(m_p^2 c^2 ) [ (1 + gamma_p )^2 ] = m_p^2 c^2 (gamma_p^2 ) (v^2/c^2 ) + 16 m_A^2 c^2.

Divide both sides by c^2,

m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p )^2 = m_p^2 gamma_p^2 (v^2/c^2 ) + 16 m_A^2.

But v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/gamma_p^2.

So,

m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 ) = m_p^2 gamma_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) + 16 m_A^2.

Simplify,

m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 ) = m_p^2 gamma_p^2 - m_p^2 + 16 m_A^2.

Bring all terms to left,

m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 ) - m_p^2 gamma_p^2 + m_p^2 -16 m_A^2 =0.

Simplify,

m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 - gamma_p^2 +1 ) - 16 m_A^2 =0.

= m_p^2 (2 + 2 gamma_p ) -16 m_A^2 =0.

So,

2 m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p ) =16 m_A^2.

=>

1 + gamma_p = 8 m_A^2 / m_p^2.

As before.

So,

gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 / m_p^2 ) -1.

Which gives a negative value when m_A=300, m_p=938.

This suggests that either the problem is impossible under these conditions, which is unlikely, or I have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass, but the products are moving at high speeds, leading to an impossible gamma_p.

Hmm, but the problem gives the options, so perhaps one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the initial equations but make different assumptions.

Let me think about the velocity of the A particles.

Assuming that the A particles are moving at velocity u.

Each A has energy E_A = gamma u m_A c².

Momentum p_A = gamma u m_A u.

Wait, no, the momentum is gamma m_A u.

Wait, no, more accurately, the momentum is gamma m_A u (since p = gamma m v, and v = u ).

So, for each A, E_A = gamma m_A c².

p_A = gamma m_A u.

So, from conservation:

4 gamma m_A c² = (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c².

4 gamma m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

So, I can write gamma in terms of gamma_p and v.

From the second equation,

gamma = (gamma_p m_p v )/(4 m_A u )

From the first equation,

gamma = (1 + gamma_p ) m_p / (4 m_A )

Set equal,

(1 + gamma_p ) m_p / (4 m_A ) = (gamma_p m_p v )/(4 m_A u )

Cancel terms,

1 + gamma_p = gamma_p (v / u )

So,

v/u = (1 + gamma_p ) / gamma_p.

But v = c * sqrt(1 -1/gamma_p^2 )

So,

v/u = [ 1 + gamma_p ]/( gamma_p )

= (1/gamma_p ) + 1.

So,

u = v / [ (1/gamma_p ) +1 ].

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can express u in terms of gamma_p and v.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write gamma_p in terms of gamma.

Wait, but I'm stuck again.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is designed so that the velocity u of the A particles is given by option B, 0.96c, which is a high velocity, implying a high gamma.

But without further progress, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma_p using the options.

Wait, perhaps I can choose one of the options and see if it gives a positive gamma_p.

Let me try option B: u = 0.96c.

Assuming that u is 0.96c, so gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784 )= 0.28.

So gamma_A=1/0.28≈3.57.

From the energy equation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c².

So,

gamma_p = [4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ] -1.

Plugging in numbers:

gamma_A=3.57, m_A=300, m_p=938.

4 *3.57 *300 = 4*3.57*300= 4*1071=4284.

4284 /938 ≈ 4.56.

So,

gamma_p =4.56 -1=3.56.

Which is positive. So gamma_p=3.56.

Now, check the momentum equation:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

Compute left side: 4*3.57*300*0.96c.

=4 *3.57 *300 *0.96 *c.

=4 *3.57 *288 c.

=4 *1025.76 c.

=4103.04 c.

Right side: gamma_p m_p v.

gamma_p=3.56, m_p=938 MeV/c², v is ?

v = c * sqrt(1 -1/gamma_p^2 )

gamma_p=3.56, so 1/gamma_p^2≈0.079.

1-0.079=0.921.

v= c * sqrt(0.921 )≈0.96c.

So,

gamma_p m_p v=3.56 *938 *0.96c.

Compute:

3.56 *938≈3322.

3322 *0.96≈3182.

So,

3182 c.

But the left side was 4103 c.

Which is not equal.

Hmm, so discrepancy. So perhaps option B is not the correct choice.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute:

gamma_A=3.57.

4 gamma_A m_A =4 *3.57 *300= 4 *1071=4284.

gamma_p = (4284/938 ) -1 ≈ 4.56 -1=3.56.

v = c * sqrt(1 -1/(3.56)^2 )= c * sqrt(1 -1/12.6736 )= c * sqrt(0.9248 )≈0.962c.

So,

gamma_p m_p v=3.56 *938 *0.962 c.

Compute 3.56 *938 ≈3.56 *900=3204, 3.56 *38≈135. So total≈3339.

3339 *0.962≈3210.

So, left side=4103 c, right side=3210 c.

Not equal. So option B doesn't satisfy.

Hmm, but the numbers don't match. So perhaps option C, u=0.91c.

gamma_A=1/sqrt(1 -0.91^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.8281 )=1/sqrt(0.1719 )≈2.425.

So,

gamma_p=(4 *2.425 *300 )/(938 ) -1.

4*2.425=9.7, 9.7*300=2910.

2910/938≈3.105.

So,

gamma_p=3.105-1=2.105.

Now, v= c*sqrt(1-1/(2.105)^2 )

= c * sqrt(1 - 1/4.429 )=sqrt(0.777 )=0.881c.

Now, compute momentum:

4 gamma_A m_A u =4*2.425 *300 *0.91c.

=4 *2.425 *273 c.

=4 *661.725 c.

=2646.9 c.

On the right side,

gamma_p m_p v =2.105 *938 *0.881 c.

2.105 *938≈1973.

1973 *0.881≈1735 c.

Hmm, 2646 c vs 1735 c. Not matching. So option C isn't matching.

Hmm, perhaps option A: u=0.77c.

gamma_A=1/sqrt(1 -0.77² )=1/sqrt(1-0.5929)=1/sqrt(0.4071 )≈1.54.

Then,

gamma_p=(4 *1.54 *300 )/938 -1.

4 *1.54=6.16; 6.16 *300=1848.

1848 /938≈1.968.

gamma_p=1.968-1=0.968.

Negative? No, gamma_p=0.968 would imply v is imaginary, which is impossible.

Because gamma_p must be >=1.

So option A invalid.

Option D: u=0.86c.

gamma_A=1/sqrt(1 -0.86² )=1/sqrt(1-0.7396)=1/sqrt(0.2604 )≈1.93.

gamma_p=(4 *1.93 *300 )/938 -1.

4*1.93=7.72; 7.72*300=2316.

2316/938≈2.47.

gamma_p=2.47-1=1.47.

v= c*sqrt(1-1/(1.47)^2 )=sqrt(1 -1/2.16 )=sqrt(1-0.462)=sqrt(0.538)=0.734c.

Now check momentum:

4 gamma_A m_A u=4*1.93*300*0.86c.

=4 *1.93 *258 c.

=4 *500. (approximately).

Wait,

1.93 *258 =approx 1.93*200=386, 1.93*58=112. So total 500 approximately.

4 *500=2000 c.

Right side: gamma_p m_p v=1.47 *938 *0.734c.

1.47*938≈1378.

1378 *0.734≈1010 c.

Hmm, 2000 vs 1010. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Let me compute more accurately.

gamma_A when u=0.86c:

gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.86)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.7396 )=1/sqrt(0.2604 )=approx 1.930.

So,

gamma_p = (4 *1.930 *300 ) /938 -1.

Compute numerator:

4 *1.930 =7.72.

7.72 *300=2316.

2316 /938 ≈2.47.

So, gamma_p=2.47-1=1.47.

v= c * sqrt(1 -1/(1.47)^2 ).

1/(1.47)^2=1/2.1609≈0.462.

So,

sqrt(1-0.462)=sqrt(0.538)=approx 0.7335 c.

So, v≈0.7335c.

Now, compute 4 gamma_A m_A u:

4 *1.93 *300 *0.86 = 4 *1.93 *258.

1.93 *258 = approx 1.93 *200=386, 1.93*58=112. So 386+112=498.

4*498=1992.

So left side is 1992 c.

Right side: gamma_p m_p v =1.47 *938 *0.7335.

Compute 1.47 *938:

1.47 *900=1323, 1.47 *38=55.86. So total 1378.86.

1378.86 *0.7335= approx 1378.86 *0.7=965.2, 1378.86 *0.0335≈46.2. So total≈965 +46=1011.2.

So 1992 c vs 1011 c. Not equal.

Hmm, so none of the options seem to match so far. But perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial antiproton's velocity v is such that gamma_p is positive and satisfies the equation.

Wait, perhaps I can solve for gamma_p from the earlier equation:

gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 )/(m_p^2 ) -1.

But with m_A=300, m_p=938,

8*(300)^2=720,000.

938^2=879,844.

So,

gamma_p=720000/879844 -1≈0.818-1≈-0.182.

Which is impossible. So perhaps the only way this works is if I have made a wrong assumption in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the products move in opposite directions, canceling some of their momentum. But without knowing the directions, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the products are created at rest, but that's only possible if the initial momentum is zero, which it's not.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles move in the same direction is incorrect. Maybe I should assume that two particles move in one direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum equal to the initial.

So, let me model this.

Assume that two A particles move in the same direction as the initial antiproton with velocity u, and two move in the opposite direction with velocity u.

So, the total momentum would be 2 gamma_A m_A u (forward ) - 2 gamma_A m_A u (backward ) ) =4 gamma_A m_A u.

Which is the same as all four moving in the same direction, leading back to the same equations as before. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps two move in one direction and one in the opposite, but that's getting too speculative.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, the velocity closest to 0.96c (option B) would imply a high gamma, which might make the momentum and energy equations balance.

Alternatively, considering that the initial approach leads to an impossible gamma_p, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm not confident. Another approach is to compute the velocity of the center of mass frame.

Wait, perhaps the velocity of the center of mass frame (u_cm) can be found, and then the A particles are moving at some speed relative to that.

The velocity of the center of mass frame (u_cm) is given by:

u_cm = ( total momentum ) / ( total energy / c² )

Total momentum is gamma_p m_p v.

Total energy is (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c².

So,

u_cm = (gamma_p m_p v ) / ( (1 + gamma_p ) m_p c )

= (gamma_p v )/( (1 + gamma_p ) c )

Which is the same as u = (gamma_p v )/(1 + gamma_p ), which we derived earlier.

Wait, that's the same as the velocity of the A particles in the earlier assumption.

So, if the A particles are all moving in the same direction as the center of mass frame, their velocity in the lab frame would be u = u_cm + something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are at rest in the center of mass frame, but that would require the initial system's momentum to be zero, which it's not.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the options available, I'll take a guess and choose option B) 0.96c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the annihilation process:

\[
p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-
\]

where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle \( A \) is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to determine the velocity of particle \( A \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial and Final Energies and Momenta**:
   - The initial system consists of a proton at rest and a slowly moving antiproton. The total initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy (\( \gamma_p m_p c^2 \)), where \( \gamma_p = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton.
   - After annihilation, the system produces four particles (\( 2A^+ \) and \( 2A^- \)), each with mass \( m_A \). The total energy and momentum of the products must satisfy conservation laws.

2. **Conservation Equations**:
   - **Energy Conservation**:
     \[
     4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = (1 + \gamma_p) m_p c^2
     \]
   - **Momentum Conservation**:
     \[
     4 \gamma_A m_A u = \gamma_p m_p v
     \]
     where \( u \) is the velocity of the \( A \)-particles and \( v \) is the velocity of the antiproton.

3. **Solving for \( \gamma_p \) and \( u \)**:
   - From the energy equation, \( \gamma_A \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     \gamma_A = \frac{(1 + \gamma_p) m_p}{4 m_A}
     \]
   - Substituting \( \gamma_A \) into the momentum equation and simplifying leads to:
     \[
     u = \frac{\gamma_p v}{1 + \gamma_p}
     \]
   - Using \( v = c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma_p^2} \), the velocity \( u \) can be expressed in terms of \( \gamma_p \).

4. **Critical Equation for \( \gamma_p \)**:
   - The invariant \( s \), which is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, must satisfy:
     \[
     s = (4 m_A c^2)^2 = \left[(1 + \gamma_p) m_p c^2\right]^2 - \left[\gamma_p m_p v c\right]^2
     \]
   - Substituting \( v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/\gamma_p^2 \) and simplifying yields:
     \[
     \gamma_p = \frac{8 m_A^2}{m_p^2} - 1
     \]
   - Plugging in \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV} \), the calculation gives:
     \[
     \gamma_p = \frac{8 (300)^2}{(938)^2} - 1 \approx -0.182
     \]
   - This result is unphysical since \( \gamma_p \geq 1 \), indicating an inconsistency in the assumptions or setup.

5. **Testing the Options**:
   - Each option for \( u \) was tested by calculating \( \gamma_A \), \( \gamma_p \), and \( v \), and verifying if the energy and momentum conservation equations hold. None of the options fully satisfied the equations, but the closest match was found for \( u = 0.96c \) (Option B), where the discrepancy was minimized.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the analysis, the most reasonable choice for the velocity of particle \( A \) is:

**Answer: B**
