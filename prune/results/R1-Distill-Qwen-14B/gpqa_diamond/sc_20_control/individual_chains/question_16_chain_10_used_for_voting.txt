Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question in front of me. It's about determining how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chiral centers. But wait, there are other possibilities too, like if there's a plane of symmetry or if the molecule is prochiral or something else. Let me go step by step through each compound.

The compounds are listed as seven, and I need to check each one. The options given are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4. So, four or five of them might be chiral?

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are a chlorine and a double bond (since it's but-1-ene). On C2, there's a methyl group and a double bond. Wait, so the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between 1 and 2. So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH2CH3) with a double bond? No, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, the formula for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but substituted. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait butene is four carbons. But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but with four carbons. Let me count: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would add a methyl on C2. So the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, I think I'm confusing the numbering. Let me try again. For but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Now, 1-chloro would replace one of the H's on C1 with Cl. So, CH2Cl on C1. Then, 2-methyl would add a methyl group on C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, but it's but-1-ene, so it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, because but-1-ene has double bond between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro is on C1, and 2-methyl is on C2. So it's Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, that's three carbons. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, but that's three carbons only. Wait, but it's butene, so four carbons. So perhaps it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? No, that would be five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2? No, but it's butene, so four carbons. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps it's like CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it must be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the correct structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? That doesn't add up because that would be five carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about if this compound has a chiral center. Wait, for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. So in this case, the molecule is (Z)-configured, but does it have a chiral center?

Wait, the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw it as CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's three carbons. No, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, which is CH2Cl. Then, 2-methyl would imply a methyl on C2. So in but-1-ene, C2 has a CH2 group. So adding a methyl would make it CH(CH3), right? So the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's three carbons, but but-1-ene has four. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. But but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the correct structure would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but that would have five carbons, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, so maybe I should move on and come back to it.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, but that's three carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the double bond is at C1-C2, and the substituents around it are Cl on C1, a methyl on C2, etc., but in this case, the molecule would have a double bond. So maybe it's a vinylic compound. Vinylic positions (double bonds) can sometimes lead to chirality if the necessary substituents are present. For a double bond to lead to optical activity, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond must be different. But in this case, on C1, we have Cl and a CH2 group. On C2, a methyl and a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)- with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the substituents on each double bond carbon would be:

C1: Cl, CH2-

Wait, no. Wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two substituents. So, for C1: attached groups are Cl, and a CH2- group (but actually, the double bond is in between). Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. So, maybe this compound isn't chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar and doesn't have a chiral center. So, perhaps this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity. So, moving on.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. That's a mouthful. Let me parse this. Hexahydro suggests a ring with six members and some hydrogenation. Methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: so a benzofuran derivative with a fused ring. Wait, maybe it's a bicyclic system. The substituent is a chloromethylene group (Cl-CH2-) attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is specified with E configuration. Hmm. Now, for a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry. The substituents at each chiral center are important. So, in this case, the molecule has multiple stereocenters (the 3aR and 7aS), so it's a stereoisomer. But is the molecule chiral overall, or does it have a plane of symmetry? Also, the E configuration of the chloromethylene group might influence this. Wait, methylene groups (CH2) attached to a double bond might not contribute to chirality, but if the substituent is part of a larger ring where the molecule lacks symmetry, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The (3aR,7aS) configuration might mirror each other, but the E configuration of the chloromethylene might break that symmetry. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a part of a larger structure that lacks a plane of symmetry. So, perhaps this molecule is chiral and exhibits optical activity. So, I'll count this as one.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Replacing the CH2 groups at 2 and 3 with methyl groups. So, it becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH. So, 2,3-dimethyl would mean a methyl on each of the central CH2 groups. So, HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the structure is symmetrical. Wait, no, because the substituents are on both CH2 groups.

Wait, the two central carbons are each CH(CH3). So, each has two CH3 groups, a COOH group, and a CH(CH3) group. Wait, no, each central carbon is connected to two methyl groups, a COOH on each end, and a central CH(CH3). Wait, no. Let me draw it:

- Carbon 2: attached to COOH (from carbon 1), a CH(CH3), and another CH(CH3) from carbon 3. Wait, no. The structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, each of the central CH2 groups is replaced by CH(CH3), which makes the molecule symmetric. Because the two central carbons are identical. Each has a methyl group, and the same groups on either side. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. Therefore, the molecule is achiral despite having stereocenters. Wait, no, because the configuration is (2R,3S). So, what's the actual structure.

Wait, if the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then the central two carbons are each CH(CH3), but their configurations are R and S. Wait, no, because the central two carbons are each CH(CH3), but attached to the same groups. So, if the configurations are R and S, does that create a chiral molecule?

Wait, each central carbon is connected to:
- COOH group (from C1)
- another CH(CH3) group (from C3)
- two methyl groups? No, wait, each central carbon has one methyl group. Wait, no, no. Wait, each central carbon (C2 and C3) has:

- C2: attached to COOH (C1), a methyl group, and two CH(CH3) groups?

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule is meso. If the molecule has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound and thus achiral.

In this case, the two stereocenters (C2 and C3) are R and S. If the molecule is symmetrical, like a meso compound, then it would not be chiral. Let me see: if I have a plane of symmetry through the center of the molecule, then the left and right sides mirror each other. So, if C2 is R and C3 is S, but the molecule is symmetric, then perhaps the two stereocenters are mirror images of each other, making the molecule achiral. So, the molecule is a meso compound and thus not optically active.

So, the third compound is not chiral.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So, same structure as the third compound, but both stereocenters are R. So, HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with both C2 and C3 as R configuration.

Is this molecule chiral? Because the molecule is symmetric, but the two stereocenters are both R. So, does this make the molecule chiral?

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric (like the two central carbons are mirrored), but both are R, then the configuration would be the same on each side. So, when you have a symmetrical molecule with two stereocenters of the same configuration, would that make it chiral? Let me think. For example, tartaric acid: the meso form has two R and two S stereocenters and is achiral. But the other forms (R,R and S,S) are chiral. So, in this case, if the two stereocenters are both R, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, would that make it a meso compound? Or does the same configuration on both sides lead to no plane of symmetry?

Wait, the third compound is (2R,3S), which would be a meso compound, hence not chiral. The fourth is (2R,3R), which would not be a meso compound, because the stereocenters are the same, so the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Because if you imagine a plane in the middle, the configurations on each side would be R and R, which are the same, so the plane of symmetry may not exist. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps in the case of (2R,3R), the molecule is chiral, while (2R,3S) is meso.

So, if that's the case, then the fourth compound would be chiral and exhibit optical activity. So, that's another compound with optical activity.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So, a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (assuming numbering). The configuration is R. So, the molecule has a chiral center at C1. So, is this molecule chiral? Yes, because the four substituents on C1 are different: the hydroxyl group, the cyclohexene ring (with the double bond), and two different CH2 groups (or something else). Wait, let me think about the substituents. On C1, we have:

- OH group
- The cyclohexene ring, which is connected to C2 and C6
- A CH2 group connected to C2
- A CH2 group connected to C6?

Wait, no, the structure is cyclohexene, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with double bond at 3-4. The hydroxyl is on C1. So, substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- The ring (which includes a double bond at 3-4)
- Two CH2 groups (one leading to C2, one leading to C6). But wait, that would make the substituents on C1: OH, two CH2 groups, and the ring. So, are the two CH2 groups identical? Because C2 is adjacent to the double bond (so maybe it's a CH group), and C6 is also adjacent to C5, which is connected to C4 (which is part of the double bond). Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, in the cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (or maybe one CH and one CH2?), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe more accurately: C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and since the double bond is between C3 and C4, the structure is C1 connected to C2 (which is a CH2?), but wait, in cyclohexene, the double bond is between C1 and C2 in some cases. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, the compound is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the ring is numbered such that the double bond is at 3-4, and the hydroxyl is on C1.

So, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- Ring (which includes C2 and C6)
- Substituents on C2 and C6. So, C2 is connected to C1, C3, and maybe another substituent. C6 is connected to C1 and C5.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- CH2- (to C2, which is adjacent to the double bond)
- CH2- (to C6, which is adjacent to C5)
- The ring itself (but that's not a substituent, it's part of the structure).

Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is connected to two adjacent carbons and two substituents. So, for C1, substituents would be:

- OH
- CH2- (to C2)
- CH2- (to C6)
- And the ring, but perhaps the ring is considered as a substituent. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and the rest of the ring, but the ring's structure may influence whether the substituents are identical.

Wait, if C2 and C6 are each connected to CH2 groups, then the substituents on C1 would be OH, CH2-CH2 (but wait, no, the CH2 groups are part of the ring). Maybe the substituents are all different. If C1 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center, and the molecule would be chiral. So, in this case, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a chiral center, making it optically active. So, another compound with optical activity.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So, a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configurations are all s. Hmm, is this molecule chiral? Let's see. So, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If you have three OH groups on alternate carbons (1,3,5), that would create a symmetrical structure. Wait, but the configuration is 1s,3s,5s. So, all three stereocenters are s.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, substituents can have axial or equatorial positions. But in any case, if all three OH groups are in the same configuration (s), would that create a chiral molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if you have three substituents on a six-membered ring at positions 1, 3, and 5, and all have the same configuration, would the molecule be symmetric?

Wait, suppose the ring is numbered such that positions 1,3,5 are all adjacent to nothing but CH2 groups. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, if the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral.

Wait, for example, if the molecule looks the same when reflected through a plane, it would be achiral. So, in this case, if the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is achiral. Let me imagine: the molecule has three OH groups on alternate carbons, all in the s configuration. Would that make the molecule chiral, or would it have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is similar to a cyclohexane with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, all in the same configuration. If the ring has a plane of symmetry that bisects the ring and reflects the substituents, then the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, but in this case, all three substituents are on the same side? Or are they arranged in a way that creates asymmetry? Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me think of a similar example: cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three OH groups are axial and on the same face, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if they're in a certain configuration, perhaps it's chiral.

Wait, another approach: the number of stereocenters is three, each at 1,3,5 positions. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound. For example, 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane can be a meso compound if the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

In this case, the molecule is 1,3,5-triol, with all s configurations. Let me imagine the structure. If the ring is such that each OH is in the same configuration, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For instance, if the substituents are all on the same face, then a plane of symmetry might exist. Alternatively, if they are arranged in a way that creates a mirror image, perhaps it's achiral.

Wait, but if all three OHs are in the same configuration (s), and the ring is symmetric, the molecule might be achiral. For example, if the ring has a plane of symmetry that goes through the center and reflects the substituents. So, perhaps this molecule is not chiral, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of three substituents doesn't allow a plane of symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. For instance, each substituent is on a different position, but without symmetry.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of a center of inversion. If the molecule has a center of inversion, it would be achiral. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. If not, it's chiral. So, if the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically (same configuration, same positions), perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, but 1,3,5-triol with all s configurations. Let me imagine the chair conformation. If each OH is axial, pointing upwards, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the configurations are mixed, but in this case, all are s, which might correspond to axial positions. So, if all OH groups are axial and on the same face, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral.

Therefore, the sixth compound might not be chiral. So, no optical activity.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure: butan-1-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO, which is 2-butanone. But 1-butanone is CH3CH2CH2CO, which isn't possible because that would have four carbons with the ketone at the end. Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2CH2CH2CH3. So, the structure is (CH2)3-CO. But the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, substituents are:

- At position 1: cyclopentyl group.
- At position 3: methyl group.

So, the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH2CH3?

No, wait. Let's think again. The butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, positions are 1 (carbonyl), 2, 3, 4. So, substituents at position 1 is cyclopentyl, and at position 3 is methyl.

So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? Or wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The important point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's see: any carbon attached to four different groups?

Looking at the structure, the carbonyl is at position 1. The substituents would be:

At position 2: CH2 connected to O=C, and also to position 3.

At position 3: a methyl group and a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon (position 3) has substituents:

- CH2-C=O (from position 2)
- CH2-cyclopentyl (from position 4)
- methyl group
- and another CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH3.

So, the carbon at position 3 is CH(CH2-cyclopentyl), connected to:

- position 2: CH2-C=O
- position 4: CH3
- position 3: CH2-cyclopentyl
- and another substituent?

Wait, no, carbon 3 is CH(CH2-cyclopentyl), connected to:

- carbon 2: CH2-C=O
- carbon 4: CH3
- and two substituents: a methyl group and a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

Structure: O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH3.

So, the carbon at position 3 is CH(CH2-cyclopentyl) connected to:

- CH2-C=O (left)
- CH3 (right)
- and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps:

Wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-C5H9)-CH3.

So, the carbon at position 3 is CH2 attached to CH(CH2-C5H9)-CH3. No, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-C5H9)-CH2-CH3? No, but that would be pentanone, not butanone. Wait, but the compound is butan-1-one, which has four carbons. So, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-C5H9)-CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

But regardless, the key point is whether any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Let's consider the central carbon (position 3). Is it connected to four different groups?

Assuming the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH2CH3, then the carbon at position 3 (the one with the CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)) would be connected to:

- CH2-C=O (left)
- CH2CH3 (right)
- CH2-cyclopentyl (down)
- And perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, if that's the case, then the substituents would be:

- CH2-C=O (from position 2)
- CH2CH3 (from position 4)
- CH2-cyclopentyl (another substituent)
- And a hydrogen.

So, four different substituents: so this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule would have a chiral center and exhibit optical activity. So, the seventh compound is chiral.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on either side of the central carbon are the same, it wouldn't be a chiral center. But in this case, the substituents around the central carbon (position 3) are different: CH2-C=O, CH2CH3, CH2-cyclopentyl, and H. So, all four substituents are different, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the seventh compound is chiral and optically active.

So, summarizing each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not sure, but perhaps no chiral center. Maybe no.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Chiral, yes. So 1.
3. (2R,3S): Meso, so no.
4. (2R,3R): Not meso, so yes. 1.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes, chiral. 1.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Probably no, as it's symmetric.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes, chiral. 1.

Wait, so that's compounds 2,4,5,7 are chiral. So four compounds would exhibit optical activity. So the answer would be D)4.

But let me double-check each one.

Compound 1: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Could this have a chiral center? The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, but no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, 2-methyl on C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's three carbons. Or perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but if the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, then it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 with double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. But that's five carbons, which can't be. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons: CH2=CHCH2CH3. So, 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. 2-methyl would add a methyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a double bond and a substituent arrangement that leads to a chiral center. Let me think: if the substituents on each side of the double bond are different, do they contribute to chirality? No, because the double bond itself is not a chiral center; however, if a carbon adjacent to the double bond has four different substituents, it can be a chiral center.

Wait, in this case, the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the C1 (Cl attached) is CH2Cl, with a double bond to C2 (which has CH(CH3)), and then two more CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. So, I'll assume compound 1 does not exhibit optical activity.

So, the count would be:

2. Yes (1)
4. Yes (2)
5. Yes (3)
7. Yes (4)

Three compounds: 2,4,5,7. That's four.

Wait, but I thought the seventh compound was number 7.

So, the total is four compounds that are chiral. So, the answer should be D)4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is chiral if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or if it lacks a plane of symmetry, even if it has multiple stereocenters. Below is the analysis for each compound:

---

### 1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
- The structure is **CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2**.  
- The double bond is between C1 and C2.  
- The substituents on C1 are **Cl**, **CH2**, and two hydrogens.  
- The substituents on C2 are **CH3**, **CH2**, and two hydrogens.  
- No carbon in this molecule is bonded to four different groups, and there is no chiral center.  
- **Not chiral; does not exhibit optical activity.**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question in front of me. It's about determining how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chiral centers. But wait, there are other possibilities too, like if there's a plane of symmetry or if the molecule is prochiral or something else. Let me go step by step through each compound.

The compounds are listed as seven, and I need to check each one. The options given are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4. So, four or five of them might be chiral?

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are a chlorine and a double bond (since it's but-1-ene). On C2, there's a methyl group and a double bond. Wait, so the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between 1 and 2. So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH2CH3) with a double bond? No, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, the formula for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but substituted. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait butene is four carbons. But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but with four carbons. Let me count: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would add a methyl on C2. So the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, I think I'm confusing the numbering. Let me try again. For but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Now, 1-chloro would replace one of the H's on C1 with Cl. So, CH2Cl on C1. Then, 2-methyl would add a methyl group on C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, but it's but-1-ene, so it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, because but-1-ene has double bond between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro is on C1, and 2-methyl is on C2. So it's Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, that's three carbons. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, but that's three carbons only. Wait, but it's butene, so four carbons. So perhaps it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? No, that would be five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2? No, but it's butene, so four carbons. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps it's like CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it must be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the correct structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? That doesn't add up because that would be five carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about if this compound has a chiral center. Wait, for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. So in this case, the molecule is (Z)-configured, but does it have a chiral center?

Wait, the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw it as CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's three carbons. No, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, which is CH2Cl. Then, 2-methyl would imply a methyl on C2. So in but-1-ene, C2 has a CH2 group. So adding a methyl would make it CH(CH3), right? So the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's three carbons, but but-1-ene has four. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. But but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the correct structure would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but that would have five carbons, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, so maybe I should move on and come back to it.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, but that's three carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the double bond is at C1-C2, and the substituents around it are Cl on C1, a methyl on C2, etc., but in this case, the molecule would have a double bond. So maybe it's a vinylic compound. Vinylic positions (double bonds) can sometimes lead to chirality if the necessary substituents are present. For a double bond to lead to optical activity, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond must be different. But in this case, on C1, we have Cl and a CH2 group. On C2, a methyl and a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)- with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the substituents on each double bond carbon would be:

C1: Cl, CH2-

Wait, no. Wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two substituents. So, for C1: attached groups are Cl, and a CH2- group (but actually, the double bond is in between). Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. So, maybe this compound isn't chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar and doesn't have a chiral center. So, perhaps this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity. So, moving on.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. That's a mouthful. Let me parse this. Hexahydro suggests a ring with six members and some hydrogenation. Methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: so a benzofuran derivative with a fused ring. Wait, maybe it's a bicyclic system. The substituent is a chloromethylene group (Cl-CH2-) attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is specified with E configuration. Hmm. Now, for a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry. The substituents at each chiral center are important. So, in this case, the molecule has multiple stereocenters (the 3aR and 7aS), so it's a stereoisomer. But is the molecule chiral overall, or does it have a plane of symmetry? Also, the E configuration of the chloromethylene group might influence this. Wait, methylene groups (CH2) attached to a double bond might not contribute to chirality, but if the substituent is part of a larger ring where the molecule lacks symmetry, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The (3aR,7aS) configuration might mirror each other, but the E configuration of the chloromethylene might break that symmetry. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a part of a larger structure that lacks a plane of symmetry. So, perhaps this molecule is chiral and exhibits optical activity. So, I'll count this as one.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Replacing the CH2 groups at 2 and 3 with methyl groups. So, it becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH. So, 2,3-dimethyl would mean a methyl on each of the central CH2 groups. So, HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the structure is symmetrical. Wait, no, because the substituents are on both CH2 groups.

Wait, the two central carbons are each CH(CH3). So, each has two CH3 groups, a COOH group, and a CH(CH3) group. Wait, no, each central carbon is connected to two methyl groups, a COOH on each end, and a central CH(CH3). Wait, no. Let me draw it:

- Carbon 2: attached to COOH (from carbon 1), a CH(CH3), and another CH(CH3) from carbon 3. Wait, no. The structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, each of the central CH2 groups is replaced by CH(CH3), which makes the molecule symmetric. Because the two central carbons are identical. Each has a methyl group, and the same groups on either side. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. Therefore, the molecule is achiral despite having stereocenters. Wait, no, because the configuration is (2R,3S). So, what's the actual structure.

Wait, if the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then the central two carbons are each CH(CH3), but their configurations are R and S. Wait, no, because the central two carbons are each CH(CH3), but attached to the same groups. So, if the configurations are R and S, does that create a chiral molecule?

Wait, each central carbon is connected to:
- COOH group (from C1)
- another CH(CH3) group (from C3)
- two methyl groups? No, wait, each central carbon has one methyl group. Wait, no, no. Wait, each central carbon (C2 and C3) has:

- C2: attached to COOH (C1), a methyl group, and two CH(CH3) groups?

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule is meso. If the molecule has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound and thus achiral.

In this case, the two stereocenters (C2 and C3) are R and S. If the molecule is symmetrical, like a meso compound, then it would not be chiral. Let me see: if I have a plane of symmetry through the center of the molecule, then the left and right sides mirror each other. So, if C2 is R and C3 is S, but the molecule is symmetric, then perhaps the two stereocenters are mirror images of each other, making the molecule achiral. So, the molecule is a meso compound and thus not optically active.

So, the third compound is not chiral.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So, same structure as the third compound, but both stereocenters are R. So, HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with both C2 and C3 as R configuration.

Is this molecule chiral? Because the molecule is symmetric, but the two stereocenters are both R. So, does this make the molecule chiral?

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric (like the two central carbons are mirrored), but both are R, then the configuration would be the same on each side. So, when you have a symmetrical molecule with two stereocenters of the same configuration, would that make it chiral? Let me think. For example, tartaric acid: the meso form has two R and two S stereocenters and is achiral. But the other forms (R,R and S,S) are chiral. So, in this case, if the two stereocenters are both R, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, would that make it a meso compound? Or does the same configuration on both sides lead to no plane of symmetry?

Wait, the third compound is (2R,3S), which would be a meso compound, hence not chiral. The fourth is (2R,3R), which would not be a meso compound, because the stereocenters are the same, so the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Because if you imagine a plane in the middle, the configurations on each side would be R and R, which are the same, so the plane of symmetry may not exist. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps in the case of (2R,3R), the molecule is chiral, while (2R,3S) is meso.

So, if that's the case, then the fourth compound would be chiral and exhibit optical activity. So, that's another compound with optical activity.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So, a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (assuming numbering). The configuration is R. So, the molecule has a chiral center at C1. So, is this molecule chiral? Yes, because the four substituents on C1 are different: the hydroxyl group, the cyclohexene ring (with the double bond), and two different CH2 groups (or something else). Wait, let me think about the substituents. On C1, we have:

- OH group
- The cyclohexene ring, which is connected to C2 and C6
- A CH2 group connected to C2
- A CH2 group connected to C6?

Wait, no, the structure is cyclohexene, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with double bond at 3-4. The hydroxyl is on C1. So, substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- The ring (which includes a double bond at 3-4)
- Two CH2 groups (one leading to C2, one leading to C6). But wait, that would make the substituents on C1: OH, two CH2 groups, and the ring. So, are the two CH2 groups identical? Because C2 is adjacent to the double bond (so maybe it's a CH group), and C6 is also adjacent to C5, which is connected to C4 (which is part of the double bond). Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, in the cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (or maybe one CH and one CH2?), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe more accurately: C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and since the double bond is between C3 and C4, the structure is C1 connected to C2 (which is a CH2?), but wait, in cyclohexene, the double bond is between C1 and C2 in some cases. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, the compound is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the ring is numbered such that the double bond is at 3-4, and the hydroxyl is on C1.

So, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- Ring (which includes C2 and C6)
- Substituents on C2 and C6. So, C2 is connected to C1, C3, and maybe another substituent. C6 is connected to C1 and C5.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- CH2- (to C2, which is adjacent to the double bond)
- CH2- (to C6, which is adjacent to C5)
- The ring itself (but that's not a substituent, it's part of the structure).

Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is connected to two adjacent carbons and two substituents. So, for C1, substituents would be:

- OH
- CH2- (to C2)
- CH2- (to C6)
- And the ring, but perhaps the ring is considered as a substituent. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and the rest of the ring, but the ring's structure may influence whether the substituents are identical.

Wait, if C2 and C6 are each connected to CH2 groups, then the substituents on C1 would be OH, CH2-CH2 (but wait, no, the CH2 groups are part of the ring). Maybe the substituents are all different. If C1 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center, and the molecule would be chiral. So, in this case, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a chiral center, making it optically active. So, another compound with optical activity.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So, a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configurations are all s. Hmm, is this molecule chiral? Let's see. So, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If you have three OH groups on alternate carbons (1,3,5), that would create a symmetrical structure. Wait, but the configuration is 1s,3s,5s. So, all three stereocenters are s.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, substituents can have axial or equatorial positions. But in any case, if all three OH groups are in the same configuration (s), would that create a chiral molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if you have three substituents on a six-membered ring at positions 1, 3, and 5, and all have the same configuration, would the molecule be symmetric?

Wait, suppose the ring is numbered such that positions 1,3,5 are all adjacent to nothing but CH2 groups. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, if the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral.

Wait, for example, if the molecule looks the same when reflected through a plane, it would be achiral. So, in this case, if the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is achiral. Let me imagine: the molecule has three OH groups on alternate carbons, all in the s configuration. Would that make the molecule chiral, or would it have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is similar to a cyclohexane with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, all in the same configuration. If the ring has a plane of symmetry that bisects the ring and reflects the substituents, then the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, but in this case, all three substituents are on the same side? Or are they arranged in a way that creates asymmetry? Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me think of a similar example: cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three OH groups are axial and on the same face, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if they're in a certain configuration, perhaps it's chiral.

Wait, another approach: the number of stereocenters is three, each at 1,3,5 positions. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound. For example, 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane can be a meso compound if the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

In this case, the molecule is 1,3,5-triol, with all s configurations. Let me imagine the structure. If the ring is such that each OH is in the same configuration, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For instance, if the substituents are all on the same face, then a plane of symmetry might exist. Alternatively, if they are arranged in a way that creates a mirror image, perhaps it's achiral.

Wait, but if all three OHs are in the same configuration (s), and the ring is symmetric, the molecule might be achiral. For example, if the ring has a plane of symmetry that goes through the center and reflects the substituents. So, perhaps this molecule is not chiral, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of three substituents doesn't allow a plane of symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. For instance, each substituent is on a different position, but without symmetry.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of a center of inversion. If the molecule has a center of inversion, it would be achiral. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. If not, it's chiral. So, if the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically (same configuration, same positions), perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, but 1,3,5-triol with all s configurations. Let me imagine the chair conformation. If each OH is axial, pointing upwards, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the configurations are mixed, but in this case, all are s, which might correspond to axial positions. So, if all OH groups are axial and on the same face, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral.

Therefore, the sixth compound might not be chiral. So, no optical activity.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure: butan-1-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO, which is 2-butanone. But 1-butanone is CH3CH2CH2CO, which isn't possible because that would have four carbons with the ketone at the end. Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2CH2CH2CH3. So, the structure is (CH2)3-CO. But the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, substituents are:

- At position 1: cyclopentyl group.
- At position 3: methyl group.

So, the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH2CH3?

No, wait. Let's think again. The butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, positions are 1 (carbonyl), 2, 3, 4. So, substituents at position 1 is cyclopentyl, and at position 3 is methyl.

So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? Or wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The important point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's see: any carbon attached to four different groups?

Looking at the structure, the carbonyl is at position 1. The substituents would be:

At position 2: CH2 connected to O=C, and also to position 3.

At position 3: a methyl group and a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon (position 3) has substituents:

- CH2-C=O (from position 2)
- CH2-cyclopentyl (from position 4)
- methyl group
- and another CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH3.

So, the carbon at position 3 is CH(CH2-cyclopentyl), connected to:

- position 2: CH2-C=O
- position 4: CH3
- position 3: CH2-cyclopentyl
- and another substituent?

Wait, no, carbon 3 is CH(CH2-cyclopentyl), connected to:

- carbon 2: CH2-C=O
- carbon 4: CH3
- and two substituents: a methyl group and a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

Structure: O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH3.

So, the carbon at position 3 is CH(CH2-cyclopentyl) connected to:

- CH2-C=O (left)
- CH3 (right)
- and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps:

Wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-C5H9)-CH3.

So, the carbon at position 3 is CH2 attached to CH(CH2-C5H9)-CH3. No, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-C5H9)-CH2-CH3? No, but that would be pentanone, not butanone. Wait, but the compound is butan-1-one, which has four carbons. So, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-C5H9)-CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

But regardless, the key point is whether any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Let's consider the central carbon (position 3). Is it connected to four different groups?

Assuming the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-CH2CH3, then the carbon at position 3 (the one with the CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)) would be connected to:

- CH2-C=O (left)
- CH2CH3 (right)
- CH2-cyclopentyl (down)
- And perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, if that's the case, then the substituents would be:

- CH2-C=O (from position 2)
- CH2CH3 (from position 4)
- CH2-cyclopentyl (another substituent)
- And a hydrogen.

So, four different substituents: so this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule would have a chiral center and exhibit optical activity. So, the seventh compound is chiral.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on either side of the central carbon are the same, it wouldn't be a chiral center. But in this case, the substituents around the central carbon (position 3) are different: CH2-C=O, CH2CH3, CH2-cyclopentyl, and H. So, all four substituents are different, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the seventh compound is chiral and optically active.

So, summarizing each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not sure, but perhaps no chiral center. Maybe no.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Chiral, yes. So 1.
3. (2R,3S): Meso, so no.
4. (2R,3R): Not meso, so yes. 1.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes, chiral. 1.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Probably no, as it's symmetric.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes, chiral. 1.

Wait, so that's compounds 2,4,5,7 are chiral. So four compounds would exhibit optical activity. So the answer would be D)4.

But let me double-check each one.

Compound 1: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Could this have a chiral center? The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, but no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, 2-methyl on C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's three carbons. Or perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but if the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, then it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 with double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. But that's five carbons, which can't be. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons: CH2=CHCH2CH3. So, 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. 2-methyl would add a methyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a double bond and a substituent arrangement that leads to a chiral center. Let me think: if the substituents on each side of the double bond are different, do they contribute to chirality? No, because the double bond itself is not a chiral center; however, if a carbon adjacent to the double bond has four different substituents, it can be a chiral center.

Wait, in this case, the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the C1 (Cl attached) is CH2Cl, with a double bond to C2 (which has CH(CH3)), and then two more CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. So, I'll assume compound 1 does not exhibit optical activity.

So, the count would be:

2. Yes (1)
4. Yes (2)
5. Yes (3)
7. Yes (4)

Three compounds: 2,4,5,7. That's four.

Wait, but I thought the seventh compound was number 7.

So, the total is four compounds that are chiral. So, the answer should be D)4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is chiral if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or if it lacks a plane of symmetry, even if it has multiple stereocenters. Below is the analysis for each compound:

---

### 1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
- The structure is **CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2**.  
- The double bond is between C1 and C2.  
- The substituents on C1 are **Cl**, **CH2**, and two hydrogens.  
- The substituents on C2 are **CH3**, **CH2**, and two hydrogens.  
- No carbon in this molecule is bonded to four different groups, and there is no chiral center.  
- **Not chiral; does not exhibit optical activity.**
