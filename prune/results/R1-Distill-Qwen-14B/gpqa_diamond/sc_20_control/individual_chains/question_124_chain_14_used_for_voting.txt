Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and a detector. Hmm, let me try to think it through. 

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types, so maybe I don't need to worry about their specifics. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

Wait, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. So I need to find a different gamma value that changes the fraction from 1/3 to 2/3.

I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since these particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) will be longer than their proper lifetime. 

The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. Let's denote that as tau (τ). The lab frame will see a longer lifetime, gamma times tau. So the time the particle has to travel is gamma * tau.

The particles need to reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters, so the distance the particle must travel is 30 meters. 

The speed of the particle would be v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²), but since gamma is large (like 20), and the particles are ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c. So I can approximate v as c for simplicity, but maybe I should check if that's a valid assumption.

Wait, but wait. The time each particle takes to reach the wall depends on their speed and the distance. So the time t is distance divided by velocity. Since they're moving at speed v, which is close to c, t = 30 m / v.

But for the particle to reach the detector, this time t must be less than or equal to the lifetime of the particle as observed in the lab frame. So t ≤ gamma * tau.

Wait, but the problem also mentions the fraction that reaches the walls. Originally, with gamma = 20, one third reach the walls. Now, we need two-thirds to reach, so perhaps the time available is such that a higher fraction of particles decay before they reach the wall.

Wait, no, maybe the other way around. Let me think again.

Each particle has a certain probability of decaying as it travels. The probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/tau), where tau is the proper lifetime. So the number of particles that reach the wall is proportional to e^(-t/(gamma tau)) because t in the lab frame is measured as gamma tau * (t0), where t0 is the proper time. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the proper lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. Because of time dilation. So the time available for the particle to travel is t = 30 m / v. But v is approximately c. So t ≈ 30 / (3e8) = 1e-8 seconds or something? Wait, that's not right. Wait, 30 meters at the speed of light... light travels 3e8 meters per second. So 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds, which is 1e-7 s. That's 100 nanoseconds. Hmm.

Wait, but the particles' lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times their proper lifetime. So if the proper lifetime is, say, tau, then in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau. So the particles have to live longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. So the probability of survival is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no, because the decay process follows an exponential decay law. The number of particles that decay before time t is 1 - e^(-t/tau'), where tau' is the mean lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma * tau. So the fraction that reach the wall is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but in the original scenario, with gamma =20, the fraction reaching the walls is 1/3. So e^(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.

I need to find the gamma where e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the fraction that reaches is e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = fraction.

Wait, because if the lifetime is longer (higher gamma), then more particles would reach the wall, right? Because they live longer, so more have time to reach the wall. So when gamma increases, fraction increases.

In the original case, gamma =20, fraction is 1/3. Now we want fraction to be 2/3, so gamma must increase.

Hmm, but wait, let me think again. The problem states that when the gamma is 20, one third reach. So I thought that the fraction is e^{-t/(gamma tau)} = 1/3. So to get 2/3, the exponent must be ln(1/3) and then ln(2/3) respectively.

Wait, what is the relation between t and gamma? Because t is the time it takes to reach the detector wall, which is fixed because the radius is fixed. So t is 30 / v. But since gamma is different, v is different. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, but for a given gamma, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So when gamma is 20, v is quite close to c. Let me compute v for gamma=20.

gamma = 20, so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/400) = sqrt(399/400) ≈ sqrt(0.9975) ≈ 0.99875. So beta is approximately 0.99875, so v ≈ 0.99875 c ≈ 2.996e8 m/s.

So t=30 / (0.99875e8) ≈ 30/(3e8) * 1.000625 ≈ 1.000625e-7 seconds. So about 1.0006e-7 seconds. So approximately 1.0006e-7 s.

So t ≈ 1.0006e-7 s. Let's just approximate it as 1e-7 s.

So t = 1e-7 s.

Now, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the particles will decay with a probability of 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the original case, gamma=20.

So, fraction reaching = e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3.

So, e^(- t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.

Taking natural logs: - t/(20 tau) = ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986.

So, t/(20 tau) ≈ 1.0986.

So, tau = t/(20 * 1.0986).

Since t is 1e-7 s, tau is (1e-7 s) / (21.972) ≈ 4.55e-9 s.

Wait, that's the proper lifetime.

Now, when gamma increases, the fraction would be higher because the exponent becomes smaller, so e^(-t/(gamma tau)) increases.

So, let's say we want the fraction to be 2/3.

So,

e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = 2/3.

Taking ln on both sides:

-t/(gamma tau) = ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055.

So,

t/(gamma tau) = 0.4055.

But from the original condition, when gamma=20, t/(20 tau) = 1.0986.

So,

tau = t/(20 * 1.0986) ≈ t/(21.972).

Now, substituting into the new condition:

t/(gamma * tau) = t/(gamma * [t/(21.972)]) ) = 21.972 / gamma = 0.4055.

So,

21.972 / gamma = 0.4055.

So,

gamma = 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.2.

Wait, so gamma is approximately 54.2. Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.

So the answer would be A) 54.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, when gamma increases, the Lorentz factor increases, so the lifetime in the lab frame increases. Therefore, the time to reach the wall (t) is the same because the distance and velocity are the same (but wait, velocity isn't the same because gamma changes). Wait, no, if gamma increases, velocity changes. Oh, right, so v depends on gamma.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier by approximating v as c, but actually, v is a function of gamma. So when gamma increases, beta decreases, meaning v is lower. Oh wait, no, higher gamma means higher beta? Wait, no, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So as beta approaches 1 (closer to c), gamma increases. So higher gamma means higher velocity (closer to c).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For a given gamma, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So as gamma increases, beta approaches 1. So higher gamma means higher speed, so higher velocity. So the time t (distance / velocity) would decrease as gamma increases.

So t = 30 m / (beta c) = 30 / (beta * 3e8) m/s.

Wait, so t is inversely proportional to beta. So for a higher gamma, beta is higher, making t smaller.

Wait, so when gamma increases, t decreases. Because the particle is moving faster, so it takes less time to reach the wall.

But in the previous approach, I kept t fixed because I approximated v as c. That was an approximation, but perhaps it's not correct. Because in reality, when gamma changes, v changes, which changes t. So the initial approach of assuming t is fixed might not be accurate. So I need to redo the calculation considering that t depends on gamma.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let me try to model it correctly.

Let me denote:

- R = 30 m: radius of detector.

- beta = v/c: velocity as a fraction of c.

- gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

- tau: proper lifetime.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

The time taken for the particle to reach the wall is t = R / (beta c).

The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

So the fraction that reach the wall is e^(- t/(gamma tau) ) = e^(- R/(beta c gamma tau) ).

In the original scenario, when gamma=20, the fraction is 1/3.

So,

e^(- R/(beta c * 20 tau) ) = 1/3.

We need to find gamma such that e^(- R/(beta c gamma tau) ) = 2/3.

Let me write both equations.

Equation 1:

e^(- R/(beta c * 20 tau) ) = 1/3 → - R/(beta c * 20 tau) = ln(1/3) → R/(beta c * 20 tau) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

Equation 2:

e^(- R/(beta c * gamma tau) ) = 2/3 → R/(beta c gamma tau) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

Wait, wait, because ln(2/3) is negative. Let me correct that.

Wait, equation 2:

e^(- R/(beta c gamma tau)) = 2/3 → - R/(beta c gamma tau) = ln(2/3) → R/(beta c gamma tau) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So, from Equation 1:

R/(beta c tau) = 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

From Equation 2:

R/(beta c tau) = gamma * 0.4055.

But from Equation 1, R/(beta c tau) = 21.972. So substituting into Equation 2:

21.972 = gamma * 0.4055 → gamma = 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.2.

So the same result as before.

So the Lorentz factor needs to be approximately 54.2. Looking at the options, the closest is A)54.

Wait, so is that correct? Because in the initial approach, I considered t as fixed, but in reality, t depends on beta (and hence gamma). But the result came out the same.

So the correct answer is 54, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor ($\gamma$), the proper lifetime ($\tau$), and the fraction of particles reaching the detector walls. The particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, and their lifetime in the lab frame is $\gamma \tau$ due to time dilation. The time taken for a particle to reach the detector wall is $t = \frac{R}{\beta c}$, where $R = 30 \, \text{m}$ is the detector radius, $\beta = v/c$, and $c$ is the speed of light.

The fraction of particles that reach the detector walls is given by the survival probability:

\[
\text{Fraction} = e^{-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}} = e^{-\frac{R}{\beta c \gamma \tau}}.
\]

### Step 1: Original Case ($\gamma = 20$, Fraction = $1/3$)
For $\gamma = 20$, the fraction of particles reaching the walls is $1/3$. Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
e^{-\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
-\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau} = 1.0986.
\]

Simplify to find:

\[
\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot \tau} = 20 \cdot 1.0986 \approx 21.972.
\]

### Step 2: Desired Case (Fraction = $2/3$)
For the desired fraction of $2/3$, we use the survival probability formula again:

\[
e^{-\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau}} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
-\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau} = 0.4055.
\]

From Step 1, we know $\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot \tau} = 21.972$. Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{21.972}{\gamma} = 0.4055.
\]

Solve for $\gamma$:

\[
\gamma = \frac{21.972}{0.4055} \approx 54.2.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The Lorentz factor needed for approximately two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is $\gamma \approx 54.2$. Among the given options, the closest value is **54**.
