Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I need to figure out what the energy levels look like based on this potential.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for a particle is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. So, the Hamiltonian H is (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ). Since the potential depends on r and θ, which are polar coordinates, the system is probably in two dimensions, maybe polar coordinates, which suggests maybe using the polar form of the Schrödinger equation. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact approach here.

Looking at the potential, V(r,θ) has two terms: the first is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential, because the standard harmonic oscillator in 2D would have V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², but here it's kr². Wait, but wait, actually, in 2D, the harmonic oscillator potential is often written in terms of x and y, but when expressed in polar coordinates, it's (1/2) m ω² r². So this first term is like a 2D harmonic oscillator part.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos squared theta makes me think about angular dependence. Cos²θ is (1 + cos(2θ))/2, so perhaps that term can be rewritten. Let me think: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait no, because 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ equals kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the potential as a sum of two terms. So V(r) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out kr²: V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Alternatively, maybe I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts. But wait, the potential depends on r² times a function of θ. So the potential is not purely radial because of the cos²θ term. That complicates things because in a purely radial potential, the angular part of the wavefunction would decouple, but here, the potential depends on the angle, so the angular momentum might play a role or not.

Wait, perhaps I can think about this as a sum of two potentials. Wait, no, perhaps another approach: maybe if I can write the potential in terms of cartesian coordinates. Let me think: in 2D polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the second term in the potential is (3/2)kr² (x²/r²) ) = (3/2)k x². So the potential could be written as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, this is interesting. Because if I do that, then the potential is V(x, r) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². But wait, r² is x² + y², so substituting that in, the potential becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me compute that: (1/2 k (x² + y²) ) + (3/2 k x²) ) = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) ) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) x² ) + (1/2 y² ) ) = (2 x² ) + (1/2 y² ) ) multiplied by k/2? Wait, no, let's see:

Wait, 1/2 k (x² + y²) is (k/2)(x² + y²). Adding 3/2 k x² gives (k/2 x² + k/2 y²) + (3k/2 x²) = ( (k/2 + 3k/2) x² ) + (k/2 y² ) = (2k x²) + (k y² / 2 ). So the total potential is V = 2k x² + (k/2) y².

Wait, that seems like a combination of two harmonic oscillators, but with different coefficients for x² and y². Oh, so perhaps this is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions?

Wait, because a standard 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator has the same frequency in x and y, but here, the x term is 2k x², and the y term is (k/2) y². So the potential is V = 2k x² + (k/2) y².

But wait, harmonic oscillators have the form (1/2)mω² x². So if I have V(x) = (1/2) m ω_x² x², and V(y) = (1/2) m ω_y² y², then the potential becomes (1/2)mω_x² x² + (1/2)mω_y² y². So comparing to the given V, which is 2k x² + (k/2) y², that suggests that (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k, and (1/2) m ω_y² = k/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the potential in terms of harmonic oscillator potentials in x and y directions. So, the system is similar to two independent harmonic oscillators, one in x and one in y, with different frequencies.

In that case, the energy levels would be the sum of the energies from each oscillator. For each direction, the energy levels are (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x for x, and (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y for y. So total energy would be E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

So I need to find ω_x and ω_y in terms of k and m.

From the potential terms, the x part is 2k x², which is (1/2) m ω_x² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y part is (k/2) y² → (1/2) m ω_y² = k/2 → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So substituting back into the energy expression, E = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m). Let's factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = ℏ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ].

Simplify the terms inside the brackets:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the transformation.

Another approach: maybe I can think about the potential in polar coordinates. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr^2 + (3/2) kr^2 cos^2θ. Let me factor out r²: V = kr² [ 1/2 + (3/2) cos^2θ ].

Wait, but that's the same approach as before. Alternatively, perhaps I can separate into radial and angular parts. But since the potential isn't purely radial, the angular part would not separate. Hmm, but if I look for solutions in terms of angular momentum, perhaps the problem is separable.

Wait, another thought: the potential also can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr^2 (1 + cos2θ)/2. Because cos^2θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So V(r,θ) becomes (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (1/2)kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). Wait, that would make V(r,θ) = (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So that's (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this helps in any way. Alternatively, perhaps the angular part can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum operator. Hmm, but since the potential has a cos2θ term, which is related to the angular momentum squared operator.

Wait, the angular momentum L_z in 2D is ħ r² (d/dθ). The square would give L_z^2 = ħ² r² (d²/dθ²). But wait, I'm not sure how that ties into the potential. The potential has a term proportional to cos2θ, which suggests that the angular part of the solution might involve higher angular momentum numbers. But perhaps this approach is complicating things.

I think my initial approach of transforming the potential into Cartesian coordinates and recognizing it as two harmonic oscillators with different frequencies is correct. That leads me to the energy expression as in option C.

The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). The potential can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates as \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), where \( x = r\cos\theta \) and \( y = r\sin\theta \). This reveals the potential as a combination of two independent harmonic oscillators, one in the \( x \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and one in the \( y \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

The energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by \( E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer. For the \( x \)-direction, the energy levels are \( E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x \), and for the \( y \)-direction, the energy levels are \( E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y \). The total energy is the sum of these contributions:

\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right].
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

This matches the energy spectrum given in option C. The other options are inconsistent with the derived energy expression.

Wait, 1/2 k (x² + y²) is (k/2)(x² + y²). Adding 3/2 k x² gives (k/2 x² + k/2 y²) + (3k/2 x²) = ( (k/2 + 3k/2) x² ) + (k/2 y² ) = (2k x²) + (k y² / 2 ). So the total potential is V = 2k x² + (k/2) y².

\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right].
\]

Simplifying further:

\]

This matches the energy spectrum given in option C. The other options are inconsistent with the derived energy expression.
