Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so this must be about calculating the energy required to accelerate a nucleus to a specific speed.

The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium normally has 3 protons. The number of neutrons would be 3 because the problem says X has 3 neutrons. That makes it lithium-6, right? Because the atomic number is 3 (Li), and the mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is ^6Li.

Now, the speed is 0.96c. I'll need to use the relativistic equations for kinetic energy because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Newtonian mechanics won't cut it here.

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. Is that the kinetic energy or the total energy? I think in colliders, they usually refer to the kinetic energy, but sometimes people might mean the total energy. I need to be careful here.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". From what I recall, particle colliders typically state their energy in terms of the kinetic energy imparted to each beam. But sometimes, especially in heavy ion contexts, they might refer to the total energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Oh wait, in the case of colliders, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy. So maybe I should calculate the kinetic energy.

But wait, another thought: the total energy (gamma m c²) includes both rest mass and kinetic. So if the question is about the energy of the collider, it's the kinetic energy that's provided. So I'll proceed with calculating the kinetic energy.

The formula for kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) m c². So first, I need to calculate gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c.

So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more precisely. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, correct. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784—wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the mass of the nucleus X is the mass of ^6Li. The mass number is 6, but I need the rest mass in appropriate units. Since we're dealing with GeV, I should convert the mass into energy using E=mc². So I need the rest mass of ^6Li in GeV/c².

The atomic mass of ^6Li is known. The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539 ×10^-27 kg. But I think there's a shortcut here. I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, protons: 3 × 938 MeV/c² each. Neutrons: 3 × 939 MeV/c² each. So total rest mass energy would be (3×938 + 3×939) MeV.

Calculating that: 3*(938 + 939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV. 5631 MeV is 5.631 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The exact masses might be a bit more precise. Let me think. The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So let's be precise.

Protons: 3 × 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

Neutrons: 3 × 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. That's 5.633511 GeV.

So m c² = 5.633511 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma minus 1 is 2.5714.

Multiplying by m c²: 2.5714 × 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that. 2.5714 × 5.6335 ≈ Let's compute 2.5 ×5.6335 is 14.08375, and 0.0714 ×5.6335 is approximately 0.404. So total is about 14.08375 + 0.404 ≈ 14.48775 GeV.

Wait, that seems a bit low, but I'm probably approximating too much. Let me compute it more accurately.

2.57142857 × 5.633511.

Breaking it down:

2 ×5.633511 = 11.267022.

0.57142857 ×5.633511.

Let me compute 5.633511 × 0.5 = 2.8167555.

5.633511 × 0.07142857 ≈ Let's see, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

5.633511 × (1/14) ≈ 0.4023936.

So adding 2.8167555 and 0.4023936: 3.219149.

So total gamma -1 times m c² is (2.57142857) ×5.633511 = 14.487 GeV approximately.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 18, 20, 23 GeV. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake. Because 14 GeV isn't among the options. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, gamma is 3.5714, which is correct. The mass of ^6Li is 5.6335 GeV/c². So (gamma-1) is 2.5714. 2.5714 ×5.6335 GeV is approximately:

Let me compute 2.5714 *5.6335.

Wait, 5.6335 *2 =11.267.

5.6335 *0.5714 is approximately:

0.5714 is roughly 4/7.

5.6335 * 0.5714 = approximately 5.6335 ×0.5=2.81675, plus 5.6335 ×0.0714≈0.402. So about 3.21875.

Adding to 11.267 gives 14.48575 GeV.

So I get about 14.486 GeV. But all the options are higher. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass of ^6Li.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should use the exact mass of lithium-6. Because the actual mass might be less than the sum of protons and neutrons due to binding energy or mass defect.

Ah, right! Because in reality, the mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to the mass defect (energy released when forming the nucleus). So my previous approach was incorrect because I added the masses of protons and neutrons without considering the mass defect. So that's a mistake.

So to get the correct rest mass of ^6Li, I need to look up its exact atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using known data.

Wait, I'm working in the realm of problem-solving, so maybe the question expects me to use the mass number as the mass in GeV/c². Oh wait, no, that's not correct because the mass defect is significant. But maybe for the sake of this problem, they approximated the mass as the sum of protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the atomic mass in u and then convert to GeV.

Let me try that. The standard atomic weight of ^6Li is 6.015122 u (I think I remember that, but I'm not entirely sure; perhaps I should double-check.)

Wait, if I can't remember the exact value, perhaps I can look up the approximate mass of ^6Li. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed by considering that the mass is approximately 6 u, but that's not precise.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the rest mass of ^6Li is about 6 × (1.66e-27 kg) × c² in Joules, then converted to GeV. But that's a lot of steps. Let me see.

Let me think: 1 u is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So 1 u c² is 1.660539e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 1.660539e-27 *9e16 = 1.494485e-10 J.

To convert Joules to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 u c² is 1.494485e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 9.327e8 eV ≈ 932.7 MeV.

So 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV). So 6 u would be approximately 6 × 0.9315 ≈5.589 GeV.

But that's an approximation. The exact value of ^6Li's atomic mass is about 6.015122 u. So that would be 6.015122 × 0.9315 GeV ≈ Let's compute that.

6.015122 * 0.9315 = ?

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.015122 *0.9315 ≈0.01406.

So total is approximately 5.603 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but earlier calculation without considering the mass defect gave me 5.633 GeV, but considering the actual mass is lower because of binding energy, so 5.603 GeV is more accurate.

So then, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) * m c² = (3.5714 -1) *5.603 GeV = 2.5714 *5.603 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.5714 *5.603.

Let me compute 2 *5.603 =11.206.

0.5714 *5.603= 3.199.

Adding together: 11.206 +3.199 =14.405 GeV.

Hmm, but that's still about 14 GeV, which isn't one of the options. The options are 18.475, 23.069, 20.132, 21.419 GeV. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the energy being referred to is the total energy (gamma m c²) rather than the kinetic. Because 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV is around 20 GeV. Let's see:

3.5714 *5.603 ≈ 20 GeV? Let me compute.

3 *5.603=16.809.

0.5714 *5.603=3.199.

So 16.809 +3.199=20.008 GeV.

Ah, so that's about 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419. Hmm, close to 20.

But wait, why would the problem refer to the total energy? Because in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic. Unless the problem states it's the total. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps the energy here is the kinetic. But according to my earlier calculation, that's about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps I messed up the mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact mass of ^6Li. Let me think again.

The exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122 u. So, 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

6.015122 *931.5 = Let's compute.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015122 *931.5 = approximately 14.06 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.06 =5603.06 MeV, which is 5.60306 GeV.

So m c² is 5.60306 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.5714, so KE is (gamma -1)*m c² = 2.5714 *5.60306 ≈ Let me compute this accurately.

2.5714 *5.60306.

Let me compute 2.5 *5.60306 =14.00765.

0.0714 *5.60306 ≈0.4013.

So total KE is approximately 14.00765 +0.4013=14.40895 GeV, about 14.409 GeV.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in gamma.

Wait, let's recalculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

v² = (0.96c)^2 =0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon? No, because the question is about the nucleus X, so the energy should be for the whole nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires the total energy (gamma m c²) rather than the kinetic.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 * 5.60306 GeV ≈ ?

3 *5.60306 =16.80918.

0.5714 *5.60306 ≈3.198.

So 16.80918 +3.198 =20.00718 GeV.

So approximately 20.007 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So that's close.

But wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly, so gamma is 3.5714285714...

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) again.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216, correct. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 ×0.28 =0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, but perhaps the actual calculation of the mass is more precise. Let me use more precise values.

The exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.0151222 u.

So m c² = 6.0151222 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

So 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.0151222 *931.494 = Let's compute that. 0.0151222 *931.494.

Compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.0051222 *931.494 ≈ Let's compute 0.005 *931.494 =4.65747.

0.0001222 *931.494 ≈0.1136.

So 4.65747 +0.1136=4.77107.

So 9.31494 +4.77107 =14.086 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 +14.086 =5603.05 MeV =5.60305 GeV.

So m c² is 5.60305 GeV.

Now, (gamma -1) is 2.57142857.

So KE = 2.57142857 *5.60305 GeV.

Compute this with more precision:

2.57142857 *5.60305.

Let me compute this as:

= (2 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) *5.60305

= 2*5.60305 + 0.5 *5.60305 +0.07142857 *5.60305.

Compute each part:

2 *5.60305 =11.2061.

0.5 *5.60305 =2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

So 5.60305 /14 = approx 0.400217857.

So 0.07142857 *5.60305 ≈0.400217857.

Adding all together:

11.2061 +2.801525 =14.007625.

14.007625 + 0.400217857=14.40784286 GeV.

So KE ≈14.4078 GeV.

But looking at the options, this isn't an option. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy.

Total energy would be gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.60305 GeV.

3 *5.60305 =16.80915.

0.57142857 *5.60305.

0.5 *5.60305 =2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305 ≈0.40021786.

So 2.801525 +0.40021786=3.20174286.

Adding to 16.80915: 16.80915 +3.20174286=20.01089 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than this. So perhaps due to more precise calculations, it's 20.01 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the mass calculation. Let me recompute the mass of ^6Li more accurately.

The exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.0151222 u.

m c² =6.0151222 u * (931.494 MeV/u) = ?

6.0151222 * 931.494.

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.0151222 *931.494 MeV.

Let me compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494 MeV.

0.0051222 *931.494.

0.005 *931.494=4.65747 MeV.

0.0001222 *931.494=0.113598 MeV.

Adding 4.65747 +0.113598=4.771068 MeV.

So 9.31494 +4.771068=14.086008 MeV.

Total m c² =5588.964 +14.086008=5603.050008 MeV =5.603050008 GeV.

So that's precise.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

Total energy E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603050008 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3 *5.603050008=16.809150024.

0.5 *5.603050008=2.801525004.

0.07142857 *5.603050008.

Well, 0.07142857 is 1/14.

So 5.603050008 /14 =0.400217858.

So 0.57142857 *5.603050008 = (0.5 *5.60305) + (0.07142857 *5.60305) =2.801525 +0.400217858=3.201742858.

So total E =16.809150024 +3.201742858=20.01089288 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma? Let me recheck gamma.

v = 0.96 c.

v² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps the sqrt is slightly different. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So no mistake there.

Hmm, so why is the calculated energy about 20.01 GeV, but the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of ^6Li.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact mass of the nucleus in terms of the sum of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of a single nucleon, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon. But no, the nucleus X is ^6Li, so it's six nucleons. Wait, but the question is about the nucleus, not the nucleons. So that approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each ion has a certain charge and mass, and the energy is per ion, not per nucleon.

Wait, but the energy I calculated is around 20 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV). So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me check with another approach. For example, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.015122 u. So 6.015122 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

6.015122 *931.494 = ?

Let me compute this more carefully.

6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.015122 *931.494 = 0.01 *931.494=9.31494; 0.005122 *931.494= 4.77106.

So 9.31494 +4.77106=14.086.

So total is 5588.964 +14.086=5603.05 MeV=5.60305 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but according to the precise calculation, the total energy is 20.0109 GeV, and the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, perhaps it's not exactly 0.28. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) with more precision.

Wait, 0.28 *0.28=0.0784 exactly, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the energy in the center-of-mass frame, but that's more complicated and I don't think so. The question states the speed of the nucleus, implying it's moving in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of (gamma * m c²):

gamma =3.57142857.

m c²=5.60305 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.60305.

Let me compute this as 3.57142857 *5.60305.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.60305 =16.80915.

0.57142857 *5.60305.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.60305 =2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305.

Compute 0.07142857 *5.60305:

= (1/14) *5.60305.

5.60305 /14 =0.400217857.

So 0.57142857 *5.60305 =2.801525 +0.400217857=3.201742857.

Adding to 16.80915:

16.80915 +3.201742857=20.010892857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. What's the discrepancy here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check another source: the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.0151222 u, which converts to 5.60305 GeV/c². So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the charge, but in the RHIC, it's about heavy ions, which are usually fully stripped (charge Z=3 for Li?), but I'm not sure how that affects the energy calculation. Wait, in terms of acceleration, the charge affects the accelerating voltage, but the energy calculation uses the rest mass regardless of charge.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem requires the calculation of the total energy, including the kinetic, but in the problem statement, the options don't have 20.01, but option C is 20.132, which is close. So perhaps due to more precise calculation, it's higher.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma using more decimal places.

Wait, v is 0.96c. So beta =0.96.

So gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is more accurately 5.603 GeV, but perhaps the exact calculation would yield a slightly higher value. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using the sum of protons and neutrons without considering the mass defect, which would give a higher m c². Let me compute that.

If I sum the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons as 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV.

Proton: 938.272 MeV.

Neutron:939.565 MeV.

So 3*(938.272 +939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So m c²=5.633511 GeV.

Now, the total energy would be gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.633511=?

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is 1/14, so 5.633511 /14 ≈0.4023936.

So 0.57142857 *5.633511 =2.8167555 +0.4023936=3.2191491.

So total E=16.900533 +3.2191491=20.11968 GeV.

Ah, so approximately 20.1197 GeV. Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So this must be the correct approach.

Ah, so I see now. Earlier, I used the exact mass of ^6Li, which includes the mass defect. But perhaps in the problem, it's expected to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses (without the mass defect), which leads to a higher m c², hence a higher energy.

So the correct approach is to sum the masses of protons and neutrons without considering the binding energy, giving m c²=5.6335 GeV.

So gamma is 3.5714.

So (gamma -1) * m c² =2.5714 *5.6335=14.48 GeV (as before), but the problem is asking for the energy, which I think is the kinetic energy. But in this approach, the total energy would be 3.5714 *5.6335=20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Wait, but the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". I thought RHIC's energy is given as the kinetic energy per ion. But perhaps in this context, the problem wants the total energy. So the answer would be option C, 20.132 GeV.

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) that accelerates a ^6Li nucleus to a speed of 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The nucleus ^6Li has a mass of approximately 6.015122 u, which converts to 5.60305 GeV/c² when multiplied by the conversion factor for atomic mass units to energy (931.494 MeV/u). 

The Lorentz factor, $\gamma$, is calculated using the formula:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For $v = 0.96c$, we find:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

Substituting $\gamma = 3.5714$ and $m c^2 = 5.60305$ GeV:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.60305 \approx 20.0109 \, \text{GeV}
\]

However, if the problem assumes the sum of the individual nucleon masses (protons and neutrons) without accounting for the mass defect, the rest energy is slightly higher. For ^6Li, this gives:

\[
m c^2 = 3 \times (938.272 + 939.565) \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Using this value, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This result closely matches option C, 20.132 GeV. Given the problem's context and the options provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the energy being referred to is the total energy, and the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so this must be about calculating the energy required to accelerate a nucleus to a specific speed.

The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium normally has 3 protons. The number of neutrons would be 3 because the problem says X has 3 neutrons. That makes it lithium-6, right? Because the atomic number is 3 (Li), and the mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is ^6Li.

Now, the speed is 0.96c. I'll need to use the relativistic equations for kinetic energy because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Newtonian mechanics won't cut it here.

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. Is that the kinetic energy or the total energy? I think in colliders, they usually refer to the kinetic energy, but sometimes people might mean the total energy. I need to be careful here.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". From what I recall, particle colliders typically state their energy in terms of the kinetic energy imparted to each beam. But sometimes, especially in heavy ion contexts, they might refer to the total energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Oh wait, in the case of colliders, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy. So maybe I should calculate the kinetic energy.

But wait, another thought: the total energy (gamma m c²) includes both rest mass and kinetic. So if the question is about the energy of the collider, it's the kinetic energy that's provided. So I'll proceed with calculating the kinetic energy.

The formula for kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) m c². So first, I need to calculate gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c.

So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more precisely. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, correct. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784—wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the mass of the nucleus X is the mass of ^6Li. The mass number is 6, but I need the rest mass in appropriate units. Since we're dealing with GeV, I should convert the mass into energy using E=mc². So I need the rest mass of ^6Li in GeV/c².

The atomic mass of ^6Li is known. The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539 ×10^-27 kg. But I think there's a shortcut here. I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, protons: 3 × 938 MeV/c² each. Neutrons: 3 × 939 MeV/c² each. So total rest mass energy would be (3×938 + 3×939) MeV.

Calculating that: 3*(938 + 939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV. 5631 MeV is 5.631 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The exact masses might be a bit more precise. Let me think. The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So let's be precise.

Protons: 3 × 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

Neutrons: 3 × 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. That's 5.633511 GeV.

So m c² = 5.633511 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma minus 1 is 2.5714.

Multiplying by m c²: 2.5714 × 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that. 2.5714 × 5.6335 ≈ Let's compute 2.5 ×5.6335 is 14.08375, and 0.0714 ×5.6335 is approximately 0.404. So total is about 14.08375 + 0.404 ≈ 14.48775 GeV.

Wait, that seems a bit low, but I'm probably approximating too much. Let me compute it more accurately.

2.57142857 × 5.633511.

Breaking it down:

2 ×5.633511 = 11.267022.

0.57142857 ×5.633511.

Let me compute 5.633511 × 0.5 = 2.8167555.

5.633511 × 0.07142857 ≈ Let's see, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

5.633511 × (1/14) ≈ 0.4023936.

So adding 2.8167555 and 0.4023936: 3.219149.

So total gamma -1 times m c² is (2.57142857) ×5.633511 = 14.487 GeV approximately.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 18, 20, 23 GeV. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake. Because 14 GeV isn't among the options. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, gamma is 3.5714, which is correct. The mass of ^6Li is 5.6335 GeV/c². So (gamma-1) is 2.5714. 2.5714 ×5.6335 GeV is approximately:

Let me compute 2.5714 *5.6335.

Wait, 5.6335 *2 =11.267.

5.6335 *0.5714 is approximately:

0.5714 is roughly 4/7.

5.6335 * 0.5714 = approximately 5.6335 ×0.5=2.81675, plus 5.6335 ×0.0714≈0.402. So about 3.21875.

Adding to 11.267 gives 14.48575 GeV.

So I get about 14.486 GeV. But all the options are higher. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass of ^6Li.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should use the exact mass of lithium-6. Because the actual mass might be less than the sum of protons and neutrons due to binding energy or mass defect.

Ah, right! Because in reality, the mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to the mass defect (energy released when forming the nucleus). So my previous approach was incorrect because I added the masses of protons and neutrons without considering the mass defect. So that's a mistake.

So to get the correct rest mass of ^6Li, I need to look up its exact atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using known data.

Wait, I'm working in the realm of problem-solving, so maybe the question expects me to use the mass number as the mass in GeV/c². Oh wait, no, that's not correct because the mass defect is significant. But maybe for the sake of this problem, they approximated the mass as the sum of protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the atomic mass in u and then convert to GeV.

Let me try that. The standard atomic weight of ^6Li is 6.015122 u (I think I remember that, but I'm not entirely sure; perhaps I should double-check.)

Wait, if I can't remember the exact value, perhaps I can look up the approximate mass of ^6Li. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed by considering that the mass is approximately 6 u, but that's not precise.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the rest mass of ^6Li is about 6 × (1.66e-27 kg) × c² in Joules, then converted to GeV. But that's a lot of steps. Let me see.

Let me think: 1 u is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So 1 u c² is 1.660539e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 1.660539e-27 *9e16 = 1.494485e-10 J.

To convert Joules to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 u c² is 1.494485e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 9.327e8 eV ≈ 932.7 MeV.

So 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV). So 6 u would be approximately 6 × 0.9315 ≈5.589 GeV.

But that's an approximation. The exact value of ^6Li's atomic mass is about 6.015122 u. So that would be 6.015122 × 0.9315 GeV ≈ Let's compute that.

6.015122 * 0.9315 = ?

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.015122 *0.9315 ≈0.01406.

So total is approximately 5.603 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but earlier calculation without considering the mass defect gave me 5.633 GeV, but considering the actual mass is lower because of binding energy, so 5.603 GeV is more accurate.

So then, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) * m c² = (3.5714 -1) *5.603 GeV = 2.5714 *5.603 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.5714 *5.603.

Let me compute 2 *5.603 =11.206.

0.5714 *5.603= 3.199.

Adding together: 11.206 +3.199 =14.405 GeV.

Hmm, but that's still about 14 GeV, which isn't one of the options. The options are 18.475, 23.069, 20.132, 21.419 GeV. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the energy being referred to is the total energy (gamma m c²) rather than the kinetic. Because 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV is around 20 GeV. Let's see:

3.5714 *5.603 ≈ 20 GeV? Let me compute.

3 *5.603=16.809.

0.5714 *5.603=3.199.

So 16.809 +3.199=20.008 GeV.

Ah, so that's about 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419. Hmm, close to 20.

But wait, why would the problem refer to the total energy? Because in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic. Unless the problem states it's the total. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps the energy here is the kinetic. But according to my earlier calculation, that's about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps I messed up the mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact mass of ^6Li. Let me think again.

The exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122 u. So, 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

6.015122 *931.5 = Let's compute.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015122 *931.5 = approximately 14.06 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.06 =5603.06 MeV, which is 5.60306 GeV.

So m c² is 5.60306 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.5714, so KE is (gamma -1)*m c² = 2.5714 *5.60306 ≈ Let me compute this accurately.

2.5714 *5.60306.

Let me compute 2.5 *5.60306 =14.00765.

0.0714 *5.60306 ≈0.4013.

So total KE is approximately 14.00765 +0.4013=14.40895 GeV, about 14.409 GeV.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in gamma.

Wait, let's recalculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

v² = (0.96c)^2 =0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon? No, because the question is about the nucleus X, so the energy should be for the whole nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires the total energy (gamma m c²) rather than the kinetic.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 * 5.60306 GeV ≈ ?

3 *5.60306 =16.80918.

0.5714 *5.60306 ≈3.198.

So 16.80918 +3.198 =20.00718 GeV.

So approximately 20.007 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So that's close.

But wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly, so gamma is 3.5714285714...

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) again.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216, correct. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 ×0.28 =0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, but perhaps the actual calculation of the mass is more precise. Let me use more precise values.

The exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.0151222 u.

So m c² = 6.0151222 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

So 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.0151222 *931.494 = Let's compute that. 0.0151222 *931.494.

Compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.0051222 *931.494 ≈ Let's compute 0.005 *931.494 =4.65747.

0.0001222 *931.494 ≈0.1136.

So 4.65747 +0.1136=4.77107.

So 9.31494 +4.77107 =14.086 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 +14.086 =5603.05 MeV =5.60305 GeV.

So m c² is 5.60305 GeV.

Now, (gamma -1) is 2.57142857.

So KE = 2.57142857 *5.60305 GeV.

Compute this with more precision:

2.57142857 *5.60305.

Let me compute this as:

= (2 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) *5.60305

= 2*5.60305 + 0.5 *5.60305 +0.07142857 *5.60305.

Compute each part:

2 *5.60305 =11.2061.

0.5 *5.60305 =2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

So 5.60305 /14 = approx 0.400217857.

So 0.07142857 *5.60305 ≈0.400217857.

Adding all together:

11.2061 +2.801525 =14.007625.

14.007625 + 0.400217857=14.40784286 GeV.

So KE ≈14.4078 GeV.

But looking at the options, this isn't an option. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy.

Total energy would be gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.60305 GeV.

3 *5.60305 =16.80915.

0.57142857 *5.60305.

0.5 *5.60305 =2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305 ≈0.40021786.

So 2.801525 +0.40021786=3.20174286.

Adding to 16.80915: 16.80915 +3.20174286=20.01089 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than this. So perhaps due to more precise calculations, it's 20.01 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the mass calculation. Let me recompute the mass of ^6Li more accurately.

The exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.0151222 u.

m c² =6.0151222 u * (931.494 MeV/u) = ?

6.0151222 * 931.494.

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.0151222 *931.494 MeV.

Let me compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494 MeV.

0.0051222 *931.494.

0.005 *931.494=4.65747 MeV.

0.0001222 *931.494=0.113598 MeV.

Adding 4.65747 +0.113598=4.771068 MeV.

So 9.31494 +4.771068=14.086008 MeV.

Total m c² =5588.964 +14.086008=5603.050008 MeV =5.603050008 GeV.

So that's precise.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

Total energy E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603050008 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3 *5.603050008=16.809150024.

0.5 *5.603050008=2.801525004.

0.07142857 *5.603050008.

Well, 0.07142857 is 1/14.

So 5.603050008 /14 =0.400217858.

So 0.57142857 *5.603050008 = (0.5 *5.60305) + (0.07142857 *5.60305) =2.801525 +0.400217858=3.201742858.

So total E =16.809150024 +3.201742858=20.01089288 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma? Let me recheck gamma.

v = 0.96 c.

v² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps the sqrt is slightly different. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So no mistake there.

Hmm, so why is the calculated energy about 20.01 GeV, but the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of ^6Li.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact mass of the nucleus in terms of the sum of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of a single nucleon, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon. But no, the nucleus X is ^6Li, so it's six nucleons. Wait, but the question is about the nucleus, not the nucleons. So that approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each ion has a certain charge and mass, and the energy is per ion, not per nucleon.

Wait, but the energy I calculated is around 20 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV). So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me check with another approach. For example, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.015122 u. So 6.015122 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

6.015122 *931.494 = ?

Let me compute this more carefully.

6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.015122 *931.494 = 0.01 *931.494=9.31494; 0.005122 *931.494= 4.77106.

So 9.31494 +4.77106=14.086.

So total is 5588.964 +14.086=5603.05 MeV=5.60305 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but according to the precise calculation, the total energy is 20.0109 GeV, and the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, perhaps it's not exactly 0.28. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) with more precision.

Wait, 0.28 *0.28=0.0784 exactly, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the energy in the center-of-mass frame, but that's more complicated and I don't think so. The question states the speed of the nucleus, implying it's moving in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of (gamma * m c²):

gamma =3.57142857.

m c²=5.60305 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.60305.

Let me compute this as 3.57142857 *5.60305.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.60305 =16.80915.

0.57142857 *5.60305.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.60305 =2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305.

Compute 0.07142857 *5.60305:

= (1/14) *5.60305.

5.60305 /14 =0.400217857.

So 0.57142857 *5.60305 =2.801525 +0.400217857=3.201742857.

Adding to 16.80915:

16.80915 +3.201742857=20.010892857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. What's the discrepancy here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check another source: the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.0151222 u, which converts to 5.60305 GeV/c². So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the charge, but in the RHIC, it's about heavy ions, which are usually fully stripped (charge Z=3 for Li?), but I'm not sure how that affects the energy calculation. Wait, in terms of acceleration, the charge affects the accelerating voltage, but the energy calculation uses the rest mass regardless of charge.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem requires the calculation of the total energy, including the kinetic, but in the problem statement, the options don't have 20.01, but option C is 20.132, which is close. So perhaps due to more precise calculation, it's higher.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma using more decimal places.

Wait, v is 0.96c. So beta =0.96.

So gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is more accurately 5.603 GeV, but perhaps the exact calculation would yield a slightly higher value. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using the sum of protons and neutrons without considering the mass defect, which would give a higher m c². Let me compute that.

If I sum the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons as 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV.

Proton: 938.272 MeV.

Neutron:939.565 MeV.

So 3*(938.272 +939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So m c²=5.633511 GeV.

Now, the total energy would be gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.633511=?

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is 1/14, so 5.633511 /14 ≈0.4023936.

So 0.57142857 *5.633511 =2.8167555 +0.4023936=3.2191491.

So total E=16.900533 +3.2191491=20.11968 GeV.

Ah, so approximately 20.1197 GeV. Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So this must be the correct approach.

Ah, so I see now. Earlier, I used the exact mass of ^6Li, which includes the mass defect. But perhaps in the problem, it's expected to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses (without the mass defect), which leads to a higher m c², hence a higher energy.

So the correct approach is to sum the masses of protons and neutrons without considering the binding energy, giving m c²=5.6335 GeV.

So gamma is 3.5714.

So (gamma -1) * m c² =2.5714 *5.6335=14.48 GeV (as before), but the problem is asking for the energy, which I think is the kinetic energy. But in this approach, the total energy would be 3.5714 *5.6335=20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Wait, but the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". I thought RHIC's energy is given as the kinetic energy per ion. But perhaps in this context, the problem wants the total energy. So the answer would be option C, 20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) that accelerates a ^6Li nucleus to a speed of 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The nucleus ^6Li has a mass of approximately 6.015122 u, which converts to 5.60305 GeV/c² when multiplied by the conversion factor for atomic mass units to energy (931.494 MeV/u). 

The Lorentz factor, $\gamma$, is calculated using the formula:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For $v = 0.96c$, we find:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

Substituting $\gamma = 3.5714$ and $m c^2 = 5.60305$ GeV:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.60305 \approx 20.0109 \, \text{GeV}
\]

However, if the problem assumes the sum of the individual nucleon masses (protons and neutrons) without accounting for the mass defect, the rest energy is slightly higher. For ^6Li, this gives:

\[
m c^2 = 3 \times (938.272 + 939.565) \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Using this value, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This result closely matches option C, 20.132 GeV. Given the problem's context and the options provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the energy being referred to is the total energy, and the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
