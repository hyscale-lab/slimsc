Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are given—Star_1 has 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. They want to know the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, right. I remember that for black body radiation, the peak wavelength depends on the temperature. The wavelength where a star emits most strongly is inversely proportional to its temperature. Oh wait, that's Wien's Law. So Wien's displacement law says that λ_max * T = constant, which is approximately 2.9×10^-3 m·K. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1 = λ2 implies T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So they have the same λ_max, so same T. That’s an important point.

Now, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Since both stars have the same temperature T, because λ_max is the same, the luminosity ratio would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, that ratio becomes (R1² / R2²).

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So R1² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 should be 2.25 times that of Star_2. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25.

But wait, wait another second. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. How does that play into this?

Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh! Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength changes. So if Star_2 is moving away (since its radial velocity is positive 700 km/s, I think that's the convention), but wait, wait. No, actually, radial velocity can be either towards or away. The sign indicates direction. But in any case, the observed wavelength from Star_2 would be different from its rest wavelength. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps we have to adjust for the Doppler shift?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The original wavelengths are the same after accounting for Doppler effect? Or are the observed wavelengths the same?

The question says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But if Star_2 is moving, then its observed λ would be different from its rest λ.

So let me think. The actual λ emitted by each star is λ_rest = λ0. But due to their velocities, the observed λ would be λ_observed = λ0 * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (v_r positive for moving away, negative for moving towards). 

But in this problem, the stars have the same observed λ_max. So the Doppler shift must adjust the actual λ_max (from their rest frame) to the observed same value.

So let's denote:

For Star_1: v_r1 = 0 → λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. Let's compute the Doppler factor.

Wait, but wait. If Star_2 is moving, then the observed λ_obs2 is different from λ_rest2. But the problem states that both λ_obs1 and λ_obs2 are the same.

So, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) because if Star_2 is moving away, the wavelength is redshifted. But wait, if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is blue-shifted (shorter). The radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. But I'm not told the direction. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 is stationary relative to us, perhaps, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But the direction isn't specified. So I need to think about whether the velocity is towards or away.

But given that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, we can set up an equation.

Let me denote:

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (because v_r1 is 0).

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But from Wien's law, λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (T2 / T1) 

But earlier, we thought that T1 = T2 because λ_rest would be same. But wait, no. Because if the observed λ_max is same, and considering Doppler shift, their rest λ_max might not be same.

Wait, this complicates things. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong because the observed wavelengths are same, but the rest wavelengths could be different because of Doppler shift.

So let's make it more precise.

Let’s denote λ_obs as the observed wavelength where each star appears brightest. Star_1 has v_r1 = 0 → λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

Star_2 has v_r2 = 700 km/s. So λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c ), where c is speed of light.

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But from Wien's law, λ_rest is proportional to 1/T. So,

λ_rest1 = (constant) / T1,

λ_rest2 = (constant) / T2.

So,

(1/T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, but wait, the Doppler effect formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But that's an approximation valid for small v_r compared to c. Since 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light (c ≈ 3e5 km/s), so the approximation should be okay.

So, back to the problem. We have:

λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ_rest1 = (c * T1) / (hc) ? Wait, no, wait.

Wien's displacement law states that λ_max * T = b, where b is approx 2.9e-3 m·K. So,

λ_rest1 = b / T1,

λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) (1 + v_r2 / c )

Cancel b from both sides,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2 / c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, but since v_r2 is 700 km/s, let's compute v_r2 / c.

v_r2 = 700e3 m/s (since 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s).

c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

v_r2 /c = 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.02333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.02333 ≈ T2 * (0.977) ?

Wait, no: wait, 1/(1.02333) is approximately 0.977.

So T1 is lower than T2 by about 2.3%?

Wait, that's interesting because earlier I thought T1 and T2 were same, but that's without considering the Doppler effect.

So, the initial assumption that T1 = T2 is incorrect because the Doppler effect shifts the observed wavelengths, so the rest wavelengths are different, leading to different temperatures.

So now, the actual temperatures are T1 and T2, with T1 = T2 / 1.02333.

So, T1 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

Now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

So L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

The ratio L1/L2 is (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

For the temperature ratio: T1 = T2 / 1.02333 → T1/T2 = 1 / 1.02333 ≈ 0.977.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.977^4.

Compute step by step:

0.977^2: 0.977 * 0.977.

Let me compute 977 * 977.

977 * 977: Let's compute (1000 - 23)^2 = 1000^2 - 2*1000*23 + 23^2 = 1,000,000 - 46,000 + 529 = 954,529.

So 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Then 0.954529^2: (≈ 0.9545^2 )

Let me compute 954.529 * 954.529.

Wait, perhaps better to compute as (0.95)^2 = 0.9025. But 0.9545 is a bit more.

Alternatively, 0.9545 * 0.9545:

= (0.95 + 0.0045)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.0045 + (0.0045)^2

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107025.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.977^4 as (1 - 0.023)^4, using binomial expansion.

But for approximation, (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4.

x is 0.02333, so x ≈ 0.0233.

So:

1 -4x = 1 - 0.0933 = 0.9067.

+6x²: 6*(0.0233)^2 = 6*(0.000543) ≈ 0.003258 → 0.9067 + 0.003258 = 0.909958.

-4x^3: 4*(0.0233)^3 ≈ 4*(0.0000124) = 0.0000496 → 0.909958 -0.0000496 ≈ 0.909908.

+x^4: (0.0233)^4 ≈ 0.000000288 → negligible.

So approximately 0.9099.

But earlier, using 0.977^2 = 0.9545, then square again, I got 0.91107. Hmm, so which is it? The binomial approximation suggests around 0.9099, which is about 0.91, while the exact calculation would be a little higher.

But perhaps using a calculator would be better. Let me think, 0.977^4 is approximately 0.909.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.909.

So now, the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (0.909) ≈ 2.25 * 0.909.

Calculating that: 2 *0.909=1.818, 0.25*0.909=0.22725. Total is 1.818+0.22725=2.04525.

Wait, that can't be right because 2.25 * 0.909 is about 2.045, which is less than 2. But that's not matching any of the options. Wait, the options are around 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

Wait, but I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no: R1 is 1.5 R2. So (R1/R2)^2 = (3/2)^2 = 9/4 = 2.25. Correct.

Now, (T1/T2)^4 is approximately (0.9774)^4. Let me compute 0.9774^4 accurately.

Compute 0.9774^2: Let's compute 9774 * 9774.

Wait, that's a bit tedious. Alternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach.

Wait, 0.9774 is close to 0.98. Let's compute 0.98^4.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

0.9604^2 = (0.96)^2 + 0.0004^2 + 2*(0.96)(0.0004). Wait, exact computation:

0.9604 * 0.9604 = ?

Compute 9604 * 9604.

Wait, 96^2 = 9216, so 9604^2 = (9600 +4)^2 = 9600² + 2*9600*4 +4² = 92,160,000 + 76,800 +16 = 92,236,816. Wait, but 9604 is 9.604e3, so its square is (9.604e3)^2 = 92.236816e6 → 92.236816 million.

But in terms of 0.9604^2, that's 0.92236816, which is approximately 0.922368.

So 0.98^4 = 0.922368.

But our T ratio is 0.9774, which is a bit less than 0.98. So 0.9774^4 would be a bit less than 0.9223.

Let me compute 0.9774^2:

0.9774 * 0.9774.

Let me compute 9774 * 9774.

Alternatively, compute (0.9774)^2:

= (0.977 + 0.0004)^2 = 0.977² + 2 * 0.977 * 0.0004 + 0.0004².

0.977² ≈ calculate as (1 - 0.023)^2 = 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 = 0.954529.

So 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Now, 2 * 0.977 * 0.0004 = 2 * 0.977 * 0.0004 = 0.977 * 0.0008 ≈ 0.0007816.

0.0004^2 = 0.00000016.

So 0.9774^2 ≈ 0.954529 + 0.0007816 + 0.00000016 = approximately 0.95531076.

Now, square that to get 0.9774^4.

So (0.95531076)^2.

Compute 0.95531076 * 0.95531076.

Again, perhaps use (0.95 + 0.00531076)^2.

(0.95)^2 = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.00531076 = 0.009968.

(0.00531076)^2 ≈ 0.0000282.

So sum is 0.9025 + 0.009968 + 0.0000282 ≈ 0.9125.

Wait, but that's approximate. Alternatively, compute 0.9553 * 0.9553.

Compute 9553 * 9553.

But perhaps a better way is to think: 0.9553 ≈ 0.955, so (0.955)^2 = 0.912025. But wait, 0.9553 is a bit higher than 0.955, so squaring gives a bit higher result.

So (0.9553)^2 ≈ ~0.9125.

So 0.9774^4 ≈ 0.9125.

So the temperature ratio to the fourth power is approximately 0.9125.

So now, L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9125) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9125.

Compute 2 * 0.9125 = 1.825.

0.25 * 0.9125 = 0.228125.

Sum: 1.825 + 0.228125 = 2.053125.

Wait, that's about 2.053. Hmm, but that's not close to any of the options given, which are around 2.23 to 2.35.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the Doppler shift.

Wait, when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c).

In our case, Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. But what direction? If Star_2 is moving away, then λ_obs2 > λ_rest2. But Star_1 is at rest, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

But according to the problem, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, so:

λ_rest1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T. So:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Which, as earlier, gives T1 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

Wait, that part seems correct. So T1 is lower than T2.

So the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (0.977^4 )

Which is approximately 2.25 * 0.9125 = 2.053.

But none of the options are near 2.05. So something's wrong with my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the Doppler shift. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. So their rest frames could have different λ_max, but due to Doppler shift, they appear same.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when a source emits at λ_rest, and it's moving, the observed λ_obs is λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ). So if two stars have the same observed λ_max, their rest λ_max must satisfy λ_rest1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_rest2*(1 + v_r2/c). So this is correct.

But then, using Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T, so T is inversely proportional to λ_rest.

So, T1 = b/(λ_rest1) = b/(λ_obs1) = (b/(λ_rest2*(1 + v_r2/c))) ) = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So yes, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c ) 

Which is about T2 * (1/(1.02333)) ≈ T2 * 0.977.

Hmm.

So I think my calculation is correct, but the conclusion is that L1/L2 is about 2.05, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed brightness peak but not the actual temperature. Or perhaps the question is considering the rest frame, so no Doppler effect on the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. So perhaps the Doppler effect doesn't affect the temperature, but only the observed wavelength. So the actual temperature is determined without considering radial velocity.

But that can't be right because the observed wavelength is used to compute the temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem without considering Doppler shift, because the problem says that the stars' observed brightness peaks are at same wavelength. So perhaps their rest frames have same T.

Wait, but then the Doppler shift would imply that their rest wavelengths are different. But let's think again.

Wait, maybe the approach should be that the observed λ_max is same, but their rest λ_max are different, leading to different temperatures.

So, Star_1's observed λ is λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since v_r1=0).

Star_2's observed λ is λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 (1 + v_r2/c )

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 + v_r2 / c )

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T → λ_rest1 = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

→ 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T1 = T2 * (1/(1 + 0.02333 )) = T2 * 0.977.

So, now, L1 = 4π R1^2 sigma T1^4.

Similarly for L2.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

As R1 = 1.5 R2 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T1 = 0.977 T2 → (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.9125.

So, 2.25 * 0.9125 ≈ 2.053.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (0.977)^4.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise numbers.

Let me compute 0.977^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.977^2 first.

0.977 * 0.977 = ?

0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.

0.9 * 0.077 = 0.0693.

0.077 * 0.9 = 0.0693.

0.077 * 0.077 ≈ 0.005929.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 977 * 977.

977 * 977 = ?

Let me compute:

Compute 977 * 900 = 879,300.

977 * 70 = 68,390.

977 * 7 = 6,839.

Total: 879,300 + 68,390 = 947,690 + 6,839 = 954,529.

So, 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Now, compute (0.954529)^2.

0.954529 * 0.954529.

Let me compute 954529 * 954529.

Hmm, that's a big number. Alternatively, compute 0.954529 squared.

= (0.95 + 0.004529)^2.

= 0.95^2 + 2 * 0.95 * 0.004529 + 0.004529^2.

= 0.9025 + 2*(0.95 * 0.004529) + 0.0000205.

0.95 * 0.004529 ≈ 0.00429755.

Multiply by 2: 0.0085951.

0.004529^2 ≈ ~0.0000205.

So sum:

0.9025 + 0.0085951 = 0.9110951 + 0.0000205 ≈ 0.9111156.

So, 0.954529^2 ≈ 0.9111156.

Thus, 0.977^4 ≈ 0.9111156.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9111156 ≈ 2.0525.

Hmm, that's around 2.05, which isn't close to any of the options given. The options are from 2.23 to 2.35. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, not the temperature. Wait, no. The observed wavelength would shift, which affects the perceived temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed brightness but not the calculated temperature.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the Doppler effect in the temperature. Let me think again.

The problem states that the astronomers found the stars' brightest wavelengths to be the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is same, but their actual temperatures are different.

But according to black body radiation, the flux peaks at λ_max based on T. So if the observed λ_max are same, but Doppler shifted, their actual T would be different.

But perhaps the astronomers corrected for the Doppler shift when determining the temperature. So, maybe they calculate T based on the rest wavelength, which would require knowing the radial velocity.

Wait, but the problem says that the luminosity was computed assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. So the luminosity would be based on their actual R and T, not the observed wavelength.

Wait, but the T is determined from the observed λ_max via Wien's law, which would be incorrectly calculated if the star is moving. So if they don't correct for radial velocity, their T would be wrong.

But the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosities, so perhaps they used the observed T, which is wrong because of Doppler shift. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps they used the correct T, considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that they corrected for Doppler shift in determining T. So perhaps they used λ_obs to compute T, leading to wrong T values.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem without considering the Doppler shift. Because if the observed λ_max are same, but the actual λ_rest are different, then their temperatures are different. But perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect, assuming it's negligible or that the velocities are towards us and thus blueshifted, making λ_obs smaller, but then T higher.

Wait, that's possible. Let's think: If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, then its observed λ_max would be blueshifted. So λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v_r2 / c ), assuming v_r is towards us and we're using the relativistic Doppler shift formula.

Wait, wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving towards is λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta = v_r/c.

Wait, but for small velocities, it's approximated as λ ≈ λ0 (1 - v_r/c ), but wait, no, for approaching, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v_r/c ), but that's only a good approximation when v_r is much less than c.

Alternatively, the more accurate formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c )^{-1} when moving towards. Because when a source emits at λ_rest and is moving towards you, the observed λ is shorter by a factor of (1 + v_r/c )^{-1}.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me recall the exact Doppler shift formula.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ), where β = v_r / c.

But this is when the source is moving away (positive v_r). If the source is moving towards, v_r is negative, so the formula would give a wavelength shorter than λ_rest.

Alternatively, for small velocities, the non-relativistic approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c ), when the source is moving away. When moving towards, v_r is negative, so λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - v_r / c ).

Wait, no. Wait, if the source is moving towards, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_rest (1 - v_r / c ), but I think that's an approximation.

Alternatively, the exact formula for wavelength when source is moving towards observer is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = v_r/c. For β positive (source moving away), λ_obs > λ_rest. For β negative (source moving towards), λ_obs < λ_rest.

So, let me correct this.

In our problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But the direction isn't specified—so it could be moving towards or away. The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Radial velocity is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards.

In any case, the observed λ_max for Star_2 is same as Star_1, which has radial velocity 0.

So, for Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

But Doppler factor depends on the direction of Star_2's velocity.

If Star_2 is moving away, then Doppler factor is (1 + v_r2 / c ), and as earlier, λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c ).

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then using the relativistic formula, the Doppler factor is (1 - v_r2/c ) / sqrt(1 - (v_r2/c )^2 ) ), but for small v_r, it's approximately (1 - v_r2/c ).

But my head is getting a bit messy. Let me think in terms of the Doppler shift formula.

Another approach: The observed flux from a star depends on its luminosity, distance, and any Doppler shifts. But in this problem, perhaps the distance isn't a factor because we're only comparing the two stars.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention distance, so I think the Doppler effect here is about the observed wavelength, not the flux. So, correction for Doppler shift in the observed wavelength is needed to find the correct T.

So, going back:

Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c ), assuming v_r2 is moving away.

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

As before.

But if Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v_r2/c ), so λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v_r2/c )

Which would give T1 = T2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, wait. Because λ_rest = b / T → T = b / λ_rest.

So, if λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c ), then T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

If the star is moving towards, λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v_r2/c ), so T1 = T2 / (1 - v_r2/c )

Which would make T1 larger than T2.

Hmm, but that's only if the star is moving towards. So the direction of velocity matters.

But the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But it's not clear if this is moving away or towards. So, perhaps I should consider both possibilities.

Let me consider both cases.

Case 1: Star_2 is moving away (v_r2 positive).

Then,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = λ_obs2 → λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c ) ≈ T2 * 0.977.

Case 2: Star_2 is moving towards (v_r2 negative, so 700 km/s towards us, but the radial velocity is given as positive? Or maybe negative?)

Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. So perhaps it's moving away because radial velocity is positive by convention. Alternatively, maybe it's moving towards us if the velocity is negative, but the problem gives it as 700 km/s, which is positive. So I think it's moving away.

So, the earlier case applies, and T1 is 0.977 T2.

Thus, L1/L2 is about 2.05, but none of the options are close. So perhaps the problem doesn't consider the Doppler effect, and the temperatures are the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the Doppler effect. Let's see.

If we assume T1 = T2 because λ_obs is same, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Which matches option A.

But why would the problem give the radial velocities then? It must be relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocities are given to compute the actual luminosity considering the Doppler effect on the observed brightness.

Wait, but the luminosity formula doesn't include Doppler effect, because luminosity is intrinsic. The observed flux would be affected by Doppler, but luminosity is the intrinsic brightness.

Wait, luminosity is the total energy emitted per second. So it's independent of the observer's position or velocity. So the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, not the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, then why is the radial velocity given? That part confuses me. Because if we're to compute the intrinsic luminosity, the radial velocity shouldn't matter. Unless they're trying to trick us into including it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed wavelengths are same, but the actual λ_rest are different, leading to different T, which affects the luminosity.

But according to the calculation earlier, that gives a luminosity ratio of about 2.05, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to say that the stars' brightness maxima are at same observed wavelength, but their actual temperatures are different, and we have to use their calculated T based on λ_rest.

Wait, let me think differently.

The problem says that the stars have the same observed λ_max, but their actual λ_rest (emitted wavelengths) are different because of their velocities.

But for a black body, the luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, if both stars have same observed λ_max, but different actual temperatures, which affects their luminosity.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed λ_max is same, so when astronomers compute the temperature using λ_obs, they think the T is same for both stars. But in reality, the T is different because of Doppler shift. So perhaps the astronomers made a mistake, thinking T is same, but actual T is different.

But the problem says to compute the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2, assuming that they radiate as black bodies. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the actual T, not the observed T.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the luminosity using the observed T, which would be incorrect, leading to a miscalculation.

But this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity is given to compute the Doppler shift in the observed flux, but that doesn't affect luminosity.

I'm stuck. Let me think again.

If I ignore the Doppler shift (i.e., assume that the observed λ_max is same as rest λ_max), then T1 = T2.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 → option A.

But the problem gives the radial velocities, so perhaps that's the intended path.

Wait, but why would the radial velocities be relevant if we're ignoring them? Because the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is already considered in determining that the observed λ_max are same.

So the actual λ_rest for each star would be different, leading to different T.

But when calculating L, we need the actual T.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute L using the actual T, considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, but how to find the actual T.

From the observed λ_max, we can find the actual T if we know the Doppler shift.

Wait, the problem says that the observed λ_max are same. So,

λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But,

λ_rest1 = b / T1,

λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

As before.

So, the actual temperature of Star_1 is T1 = T2 / (1.02333) ≈ 0.977 T2.

So,

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

The ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (0.977^4 )

As computed earlier, 0.977^4 ≈ 0.9111.

2.25 * 0.9111 ≈ 2.05.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of 0.977^4.

Let me compute 0.977^4 again.

0.977^2 = 0.954529.

0.954529^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.9545 * 0.9545.

= (0.95 + 0.0045)^2.

= 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)(0.0045) + (0.0045)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025.

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 = 0.91105; plus 0.00002025 is 0.91107025.

So, 0.977^4 = (0.977^2)^2 ≈ 0.91107.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.0529.

But the options are all above 2.2. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires using the Doppler shift in the other direction.

Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us, so v_r2 is negative.

Then, the Doppler formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c )/(1 - v_r/c ) )

But when v_r is negative (moving towards), this becomes λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - |v_r|/c )/(1 + |v_r|/c ) )

But for small |v_r|, this is approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - (v_r/c )).

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 (1 - v_r2/c )

But λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 - v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 - v_r2/c )

v_r2 is 700 km/s, so v_r2/c ≈ 0.002333.

So,

1 - v_r2/c ≈ 0.997667.

So,

T1 = T2 / 0.997667 ≈ T2 * 1.00234.

So, T1 is slightly higher than T2.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4.

Compute 1.00234^4:

(1.00234)^2 ≈ 1.00468.

Then, (1.00468)^2 ≈ 1.00941.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (1.00941 ) ≈ 2.2706.

Hmm, 2.2706 is close to option B (2.32), but not exact.

Wait, but let's compute more accurately.

Compute (1.00234)^4.

First, compute (1.00234)^2 = 1.00234 * 1.00234.

= 1 + 2*(0.00234) + (0.00234)^2.

= 1 + 0.00468 + 0.0000054756 ≈ 1.0046854756.

Now, square that to get (1.004685)^2.

= (1 + 0.004685 )^2 = 1 + 2*(0.004685) + (0.004685)^2.

= 1 + 0.00937 + 0.00002195 ≈ 1.00939195.

So, (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00939195.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00939195 ≈ 2.2705.

Which is approximately 2.27.

But the options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

Hmm, 2.27 isn't close to any of them, but perhaps using more precise numbers would get closer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the Doppler shift factor correctly, considering that Star_2 is moving towards us, leading to a higher T, which increases the luminosity.

But given that, the ratio is about 2.27, which is closer to option B (2.32) than option A (2.25).

But neither is a perfect match. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of the Doppler factor.

If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, then the Doppler factor is (1 + v_r/c )^{-1}.

Because when a source moves towards you, the observed wavelength is shorter.

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v_r2/c )

Wait, no, for small velocities, λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - v_r/c ), but the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta = v_r/c.

But for beta = 0.002333,

sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = sqrt( (0.997667)/(1.002333) ) ≈ sqrt(0.99536) ≈ 0.99768.

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.99768.

But since λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.99768.

So,

T1 = b / λ_rest1 = (b / λ_rest2 ) * (1/0.99768 )

= T2 * (1 / 0.99768 ) ≈ T2 * 1.00234.

Thus,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.0094.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.2705.

Which is approximately 2.27.

The options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

So 2.27 is closest to option B (2.32), but not by much.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact Doppler factor.

Wait, perhaps using more precise calculations.

Compute (1.00234)^4:

Compute:

1.00234^2 = (1 + 0.00234)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00234 + 0.00234^2 = 1.00468 + 0.0000054756 ≈ 1.0046854756.

Now, square this:

1.0046854756^2 = ?

Let me compute 1.004685^2.

= (1 + 0.004685 )^2 = 1 + 2*0.004685 + (0.004685)^2.

= 1 + 0.00937 + 0.00002195 ≈ 1.00939195.

So,

(1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00939.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00939 ≈ 2.2705.

Hmm, so approximately 2.27, which is between options A (2.25) and B (2.32).

But none of the options exactly match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to L1/L2=2.25, which is option A.

But the problem includes the radial velocities, which suggests that the Doppler effect is intended to be considered.

Given that, the correct answer would be around 2.27, but since it's not an option, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem using the Doppler formula in terms of frequency.

Because sometimes, when dealing with black body radiation, it's easier to think in terms of frequency, ν = c/λ.

The peak frequency ν_max is proportional to T.

So, maybe using frequency is a better approach.

The observed frequency ν_obs is related to the emitted frequency ν_rest via the Doppler shift.

ν_obs = ν_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ), where beta = v_r/c.

But for small beta, this approximates to ν_obs ≈ ν_rest (1 + beta ) when moving away.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relation between observed and rest temperatures.

Wait, another approach: The observed wavelength is given by λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c )

But for Star_1, v_r is 0, so λ_obs1=λ_rest1.

For Star_2, v_r=700e3 m/s, so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e8 )

= λ_rest2 * (1 + 0.002333 )

= λ_rest2 * 1.002333.

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 1.002333.

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * 1.002333 → T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.99068.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.99068 ) ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23, option D.

Ah! So this gives an answer matching option D, which is ~2.23.

So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering Star_2 moving towards, while the correct approach is that Star_2 is moving away, leading to a lower T and thus lower luminosity.

Wait, but earlier, the calculation for Star_2 moving away led to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05, which didn't match any option. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (0.99767)^4 accurately.

0.99767^2 = ?

0.99767 * 0.99767.

Approximately, let me compute as (1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953454.

Then, square that:

0.9953454^2.

= (0.9953454)^2.

≈ 1 - 2*0.00465456 + (0.00465456)^2 ≈ 0.99076.

Wait, more accurately:

0.9953454 * 0.9953454.

Let me compute 9953454 * 9953454, but it's easier to compute as (approx 0.995345)^2.

= approximately 0.9907.

So,

(0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is about 2.23, matching option D.

So, the correct approach is to consider that Star_2 is moving away, leading to a lower T, and thus lower L, making L1/L2 about 2.23.

So the answer should be option D, ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves comparing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2. Both stars have the same observed wavelength at which they appear brightest, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s. The goal is to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Wien's Law and Temperature**:
   - The observed wavelength at which the stars appear brightest is the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, the rest-frame wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}
     \]
     where \(b \approx 2.9 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K}\).  
     Since the observed wavelengths are the same, the rest-frame wavelengths of the stars must account for the Doppler shift due to their radial velocities.

2. **Doppler Shift**:
   - For Star_1 (radial velocity \(v_r1 = 0\)), the observed wavelength is equal to the rest-frame wavelength:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}
     \]
   - For Star_2 (radial velocity \(v_r2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)), the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its motion away from the observer:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r2}{c}\right)
     \]
     Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), it follows that:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r2}{c}\right)
     \]

3. **Temperature Ratio**:
   - Using the relationship \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}\), the temperature ratio is:  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_r2}{c}}
     \]
     Substituting \(v_r2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\):  
     \[
     \frac{v_r2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
     \]
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.99767
     \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
     \[
     L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     The luminosity ratio is:  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
     Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99767\):  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
     \]
     - Compute \((1.5)^2 = 2.25\).  
     - Compute \((0.99767)^4\):  
       \[
       (0.99767)^2 \approx 0.99535, \quad (0.99535)^2 \approx 0.9907
       \]
     - Thus:  
       \[
       \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
       \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. This matches option **D**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**
