Okay, I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me try to think it through. So the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same throughout space, right? Or wait, maybe it's about their distribution on the celestial sphere. Wait, no, uniform distribution in the sky probably refers to their positions on the sky's surface, but their actual density in space might depend on distance. Or maybe it's assuming that the number of stars doesn't change with distance. Hmm, I might be getting confused.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer the star, the larger the parallax. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, I recall that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger. So plx = 1/distance, something like that. So as plx increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax. So, the question is, if I look at stars within a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there per unit dplx?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means the number density of stars (stars per unit volume) is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on how much of that volume is there.

Parallax is related to distance. Let's think about a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell is 4π r² dr, since it's a spherical shell. But wait, the parallax plx is equal to 1/d, right? Because plx (in arcseconds) is approximately 1/(distance in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

So the distance in terms of plx is d = 1/plx. Now, if I consider a small change in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Since plx is inversely proportional to d, a small change in plx (dplx) would correspond to a change in d of approximately d = 1/(plx + dplx) - 1/plx. Let me calculate that. 

Hmm, let me approximate it. Since d is small compared to plx (assuming small dplx), I can use a Taylor expansion. The change in d would be dd = -d² * dplx. Because d = 1/plx, so dd/dplx = - (1/plx^2). So, dd = - (1/plx^2) * dplx. But since plx is in the denominator, higher plx means closer stars, so a small change in plx would correspond to a larger change in d when plx is small (far away). 

Wait, but the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume. So the volume element is 4π d² dd, where d is the distance. Let me express that in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, d² is 1/plx². And dd is - (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element becomes 4π * (1/plx²) * (-1/(plx²)) dplx ). Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction of change, but for the number of stars, we're interested in the magnitude.

So the volume is 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, wait, I think I messed that up. Let me go step by step.

The volume element (dV) for a shell at distance d with thickness dd is dV = 4π d² dd. So substituting d = 1/plx, we have d² = 1/plx², and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So,

dV = 4π * (1/plx²) * (-1/(plx²)) dplx )
= 4π (-1/plx^4) dplx.

But dV is positive, so ignoring the sign, dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Now, the number of stars in this volume would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume dV. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, n is a constant. So the number of stars (dN) is n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which is dN / dplx. So,

dN/dplx = n * 4π (1/plx^4).

So the number per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4?

Wait, that's option A. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again because I might have made a mistake in substituting.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a given volume is n * volume. The volume for a shell at distance d is 4π d² dd. We can write d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. So,

dd = (d dplx) / (d/dplx) ) = d dplx * (d/dplx)^{-1}.

Wait, that's a bit more precise. Let me compute d/d plx of d:

d = 1/plx → dd/dplx = -1/(plx²).

So, dd = (-1/plx²) dplx.

Thus, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) dplx) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

The negative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but for the number count, we take the magnitude. So,

dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Multiply by the number density n:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = 4π n (1/plx^4).

Wait, that's 1 over plx^4. So the number of stars per unit range of plx (like a slice of plx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I thought I heard somewhere that the number of stars per unit of distance increases with distance because the volume increases with the cube of radius. Oh wait, but here we're talking about per unit of plx, which is inverse distance. So how does that play in?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of differential number per unit parallax. Let's see, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * (4π/3) [ (1/(plx))³ - (1/(plx+dplx))³ ].

Expanding for small dplx, this becomes approximately N ≈ n *4π (1/plx²) * dplx / (3 plx^4? Wait, no, maybe the expansion is better done using derivatives.

Wait, let me compute the differential: dN = n * 4π d^2 dd.

We can express dN in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd/dplx = -1/plx² → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So,

dN = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) dplx.

The negative is just because as plx increases, d decreases. The magnitude is:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Therefore, the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

So the dependence is 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because I thought for stars distributed uniformly in space, the number per unit volume is constant, so the number per unit distance would decrease with distance cubed. But wait, here we're dealing with parallax, which is inverse distance.

Wait, let's think in terms of number density. The number of stars in a volume V is N = n * V. If the stars are uniformly distributed, n is a constant. So, for a shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is N = n * 4π d² dd.

Now, if I consider that the shell's thickness is dd, and I want to find N per unit dd, it's n * 4π d².

So, if I express everything in terms of plx, where d=1/plx, then N per unit dd is n *4π (1/plx)^2.

But I want N per unit plx. So, how to relate dd to dplx.

dd = (dd/dplx) dplx = (-1/plx²) dplx.

So, for a small change in plx, dplx, the corresponding dd is -1/plx² dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is (N per unit dd) divided by (dd per unit plx), which is (n*4π (1/plx²)) ) / (1/plx²) ) ) → n *4π.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because N per unit dd is n *4π (1/plx)². And since dd is - (1/plx²) dplx, the number per unit dplx is (n *4π (1/plx²)) ) / (1/plx²) ) = n 4π. That would imply it's a constant, which can't be right because when plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx shouldn't stay the same.

Wait, maybe that approach is wrong. Let me think differently. How about, to find the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx, we can express it as:

N = n * [ (4/3) π (1/plx)^3 - (4/3) π (1/(plx + dplx))^3 ].

For small dplx, the change can be approximated using a Taylor expansion. Let me let x =1/plx. So x + dx = 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because plx is in the denominator, it's a bit more involved.

Alternatively, for small dplx, the change in x (where x=1/plx) is dx = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So,

N ≈ n * (4π/3) x^2 dx.

Substituting, x =1/plx, dx = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So,

N ≈ n (4π/3) (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx²) dplx.

The negative sign indicates direction, but we can ignore it for the magnitude. So,

N ≈ n (4π/3) (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number of stars per unit plx is N/dplx = (4π/3) n (1/plx^4).

So again, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because another line of thought makes me think maybe it's 1/plx^3. Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance.

Parallax plx = 1/d (in parsecs), so d = 1/plx.

The volume of a sphere with radius d is (4/3)π d^3.

The number of stars within distance d is N = n * (4/3 π d^3).

So, number density n is stars per cubic parsec. So for a given d, N = n * (4/3 π (1/plx)^3 ).

If I want the number of stars per unit plx, maybe I can take the derivative of N with respect to plx.

So dN/dplx = derivative of [n (4/3 π) (1/plx^3) ].

Which is n (4/3 π) * (-3)/plx^4 → -n 4 π / plx^4.

The negative indicates that as plx increases, N decreases, which makes sense. So the magnitude is 4 π n / plx^4. So again, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the distribution of stars under the assumption of uniform density in space. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). 

Expressing \( d \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we have \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting into the volume element, the number of stars in the shell becomes:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right),
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of stars. Simplifying, we find:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is then:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
