Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the formation of the ylide, which is a method to generate a strong base, like theHoffmann elimination or in some cases for dehydrohalogenation. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus reacting with HI is usually part of the (CH3)3P=CH2 reagent, right? That's used in the Wittig reaction. Oh wait but wait, when you have a dihalide, maybe it's a different scenario.

Looking at the data provided for Compound X, it has IR and NMR spectra. Let's see what those can tell me.

Starting with the IR data: peaks at 3400-2500 cm^-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches, but since the options don't have amines, it's probably an O-H group. The other IR peaks are at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl (like a ketone or ester or acid), 1610 and 1450, which might be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or an acid derivative.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which often corresponds to an O-H proton. Like in a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols usually have broad peaks but they might be around 1-5 ppm. Wait, wait, no, carboxylic acid O-H is usually around 10-12 ppm, so this fits. So there's a carboxylic acid proton here.

Wait, but the IR had a peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl of an acid. So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets each with 2H suggest that. For example, if there are two substituents across from each other on the benzene ring, like a para-substituted group.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH next to another CH2 or something like that.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet. Maybe adjacent to a CH or another group, like a CH2CH2 or something.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, which might be a CH3 group attached to something that's split into a doublet. Maybe a CH(CH3) group, like an isopropyl or something similar?

Wait, wait, 1.4 as a doublet of 3H could be a CH3 attached to a CH that's coupled with another group. Like in an isopropyl group, the CH(CH3) would lead to a triplet for the CH3 if it's next to a CH2, but wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary CH, like in a -CH(CH2CH3)- group?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to map this out.

If the aromatic ring is para-substituted, with two substituents opposite each other. One substituent could be a methyl group, and another could be an isopropyl group? Or perhaps one substituent is a methyl and another is a group with a carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So the substituent would have a carbonyl group attached to the ring. So maybe the ring is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone, ester, or acid.

Wait, the O-H is present, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid attached to the ring, as in benzoic acid. But then, what's the other substituent?

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet for the aromatic protons. Oh no, wait no, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. So the ring must have two substituents in para positions. For example, in 4-substituted benzoic acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the aromatic signals are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Let me think: in para-substituted benzoic acid, the two protons adjacent to the substituent (like the COOH) would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield? Wait, benzoic acid has a COOH group. The ortho protons to COOH are typically deshielded and appear as a singlet, but in this case, the NMR shows two doublets for two protons each. So maybe the substituents are in para positions, but they're not both COOH. Because then the ortho protons would be in a specific pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and a carbonyl group. Wait, if the ring is para-methyl and para-ketone, but that doesn't seem quite right. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a methyl and another is a carbonyl-containing group, such as a ketone or an ester.

Wait, the NMR also has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). A triplet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe there's an ethyl group attached to something else. For example, a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). Let's see: 0.9 is a triplet so maybe it's a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, if I imagine a chain like CH2-CH2-CH3, the CH3 would be a triplet. The CH2 in the middle would be a quartet if next to another CH2, but in this case, the 1.7 is a multiplet for 2H. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a branching point.

Wait, 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to another group. Like maybe a CH(CH3) group. Then the 1.7 is a multiplet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 connected to the CH.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (since IR has 1720 cm^-1) and another substituent that's an ethyl group or a branched chain.

Wait, the O-H (10.5 ppm) suggests a carboxylic acid. So the ring has a -COOH group. Then, the other substituent would be in the para position.

Wait, but there's a 1.7 ppm (2H, m) and 0.9 ppm (3H, t), which could be from an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group? Let me think:

Wait, the 0.9 is a triplet (t), which comes from a CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 is a multiplet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 connected to a CH that's connected to another group.

So maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)- group. Or perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me think about the entire structure:

Assuming the benzene ring is para-substituted with a COOH group and another group. The other group is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Or maybe a branching point.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Let me think about the substituent's structure. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH that's connected to another group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to that CH. So, for example:

-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-

But then where does the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) come in? That would be the end of a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group? But that would be a pentyl group, but maybe it's a butyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an isopropyl group attached to a CH2. So maybe the structure is -CH2-C(CH3)2? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's a secondary substituent, like a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So perhaps the chain is something like CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the ring.

So, putting it all together, the substituents on the benzene ring would be:

- COOH (from the O-H and carbonyl IR peaks, and the aromatic protons)
- And another group which is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Or perhaps it's a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, no, let me try to piece it together. The substituent attached to the benzene would have a structure that includes a chain with a CH3 attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2, which is next to a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group. Let me think: 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which is from CH2CH2CH3 (the end of an ethyl group). Then, 1.7 is a multiplet for 2H, which could be a CH2 adjacent to a CH. The 1.4 is a doublet (3H), which is CH3 attached to a CH.

So imagine a structure like:

Ph-CO-OH (wait, no, because the O-H is present, it's Ph-COOH. Wait, but where is the substituent with the chain?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? Or maybe Ph-CO-O-R, but that would be an ester, but the IR shows a strong O-H (carboxylic acid).

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which could be a carbonyl of a ketone or ester. But the O-H suggests a carboxylic acid, so maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let me consider all the NMR signals again.

The aromatic protons are two doublets, 8.0 (2H) and 7.2 (2H), which suggests a para substitution. So the benzene ring has two substituents opposite each other. One is a -COOH group, and the other is a substituent with a chain leading to the signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

So the substituent would be something like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). Let me see: the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group? Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But I'm not getting it clearly.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a benzoic acid group (COOH) at position 4 (para) and a sec-butyl group.

What's a sec-butyl group? It's a four-carbon group where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think. The structure of a sec-butyl group would be:

The butyl group has four carbons. The point of attachment is on the second carbon, so it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me correct: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that might not be correct.

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's not quite right.

Wait, wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to draw it. The butyl chain is four carbons. The substituents are attached to the second carbon. So it's:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The butyl group can be either straight chain or branched.

Wait, the sec-butyl group is a four-carbon group where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, perhaps it's CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the substituent. So if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, it's:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's a propyl group attached to a CH, but I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that's a pentyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should think about each option and see which one fits the NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the structure would have a benzene ring with ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2. Wait, but the substituents are in the 2 and 4 positions? Or is it at position 4 and 2? Wait, perhaps it's a benzene with a propanoic acid at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So the benzene would have two substituents: one at position 2 (propanoic acid) and one at position 4 (ethyl group). But the NMR shows a para-substituted pattern, so the two substituents would be opposite each other. So if the substituents are at positions 2 and 4, that would mean they're meta to each other, not para. So perhaps option A is not the correct structure.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups in the 1 and 4 positions. But the NMR shows a carboxylic acid, which would have an O-H, but option B doesn't have a COOH group. So this is probably not the right option.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 4 as well? Wait, no, wait. Position 4 would be para to position 1. So if the substituents are at position 4, that might not make sense. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. So benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4. So the substituents are in the para positions.

So the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

What would the NMR of that look like?

The aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern, as observed. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, so the ortho protons to COOH would be at positions 2 and 6, and the meta positions would be 3 and 5. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are COOH at 1 and sec-butyl at 4. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, which are para to each other.

So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. But with substituents at 1 and 4, the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and adjacent to the sec-butyl group.

Wait, but in this scenario, the substituents are para, so the aromatic protons would split into two sets. The protons ortho to the COOH group would be more deshielded (higher ppm), and the protons meta to COOH and adjacent to the substituent would be less deshielded.

In the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So that suggests two pairs of doublets, each integrating to 2H, which would fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the 1 and 4 positions.

Now, looking at the substituent (the sec-butyl group), which would have a structure. Let me think: the sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So it's a four-carbon group attached at the second carbon. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

But wait, the NMR has a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) which is a CH3 attached to a CH, and a 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) which is a CH2CH3 group.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be:

Ph-COOH (at position 1) and Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- (but wait, that would be a pentyl group? Or wait, no. Wait, the substituent is sec-butyl, which is a four-carbon group where the point of attachment is the second carbon. So it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's a five-carbon chain? Hmm, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. No, that's a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is a butyl group attached at the second carbon.

In that structure, the substituent would have a CH2 connected to a CH(CH2CH3), which is connected to the benzene. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Now, let's see the NMR signals for that.

The substituent would have:

- The CH2 (next to the ring) would be at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) because it's adjacent to the CH(CH2CH3).

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have two H's attached, but wait, no, the CH(CH2CH3) would have two H's on the CH and a CH2CH3 group attached. Wait, no, the CH(CH2CH3) would have two H's on the CH, which is adjacent to the CH2 next to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the CH(CH2CH3) would have the H's split into a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H). The CH2 next to it would be around 1.7 ppm (2H), and then the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (3H, triplet).

So the substituent would have a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, leading to the following NMR signals:

- The CH2 adjacent to the ring (connected to the CH(CH2CH3)): this would be split into a quartet because it's adjacent to a CH. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly. Let me think about the substituent's structure again. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure is:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon substituent. So the substituent is:

–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)– attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the structure would have:

–CH2– (connected to ring) –CH(CH2CH3)–.

The CH2 would be next to the ring, and the CH would be next to that. The CH2CH3 would be at the end.

So the NMR signals would be:

- The CH2 (next to ring) would be a triplet or quartet around 2.9 ppm, but in the data, it's a multiplet (m, 1H). Hmm, that doesn't fit exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituents are at position 4 (sec-butyl) and position 1 (COOH). Then, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, which matches the NMR.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure is benzene with a COOH at 1 and a sec-butyl at 4.

The substituent (sec-butyl) would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached at position 4.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a -(CH2)2CH(CH3)- group? No, because sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-?

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Let me try to look at each NMR peak and see what it could represent.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is likely a CH that's part of a chain, maybe a CH adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be a CH2 that's adjacent to a CH and another group.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to another group.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group.

Wait, that would be a propyl group with a branching. Let me try to imagine the structure.

So the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the benzene ring. But where would the 1.7 and 1.4 signals come from?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, but then the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would correspond to the end CH2CH3, which would be the CH2 at the end. The CH(CH3) would have a CH2 next to it, which would be at 1.7 ppm. The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

So the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group? No, that can't be right, because that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, which is a butyl group. Wait, but with the signals given, perhaps it's a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. So the substituent would be a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, another approach: the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 adjacent to that CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH3 group. So the structure would be CH3-CH-CH2-CH2CH3. But that would be a pentyl group, not a butyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a propyl group with a branching.

So the structure would be benzene ring with COOH and -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- substituents.

In that case, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

So the CH2 next to the ring would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), the CH(CH2CH3) would have its own protons, but perhaps the CH2 is split into a multiplet, and the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Wait, but the CH(CH2CH3) would have two H's attached to it, which would be a triplet or quartet, but the NMR shows 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (1H), which doesn't add up. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's a pentyl group, which might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. So the substituent is a butyl group with a branching.

In that case, the structure would be:

Ph–COOH (at position 1) and Ph–CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- (at position 4).

But then, the NMR signals would have:

The CH2 next to the ring (position adjacent to CH(CH3)) would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

The CH(CH3) would have its own signals, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to draw this structure.

Another approach: the reaction conditions. Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What type of reaction is that?

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the formation of the ylide, but more commonly, they're used in the substitution of halides. Wait, but if Compound X has a leaving group (like a halide), reacting with red phosphorus and HI would lead to a substitution reaction, perhaps an SN2.

But wait, another possibility: if Compound X is an alkyne, red phosphorus and HI could be used for hydration, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, no, perhaps Compound X is a benzylic halide. Reacting with HI in the presence of red phosphorus would convert the halide into a carbonyl group via the formation of a ylide, leading to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: the reaction of an alkyl halide with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to the formation of a carbonyl compound. For example, if the starting material is an alkyl bromide, the reaction would form an aldehyde or ketone.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material (Compound X) has a carbonyl group in its structure, as indicated by the IR at 1720 cm^-1.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (generated from X with PPh3 and an alkyl halide) would react with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. For example, if X is a vicinal dihalide, reacting with red phosphorus and HI could lead to elimination, forming a double bond.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the reaction is between X and red phosphorus and HI. So the usual reaction is that X is a primary alkyl halide, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI produces an alkyne. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an allylic halide, and the reaction forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

The NMR and IR data suggest that the starting compound (X) is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), because it has a COOH group (O-H at 10.5 ppm, carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1), and the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would account for the other NMR signals.

So, if X is option C, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the formation of the ylide, which is used in the Wittig reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkyl halide, and the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, but in this case, X is a benzoic acid derivative. I'm not sure how it would react with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is somehow involved. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester or another compound with a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used to prepare the ylide from an alkyl halide. The ylide has a strong base and can attack carbonyl groups in a Wittig reaction to form alkenes.

But in this case, perhaps the starting material doesn't have a carbonyl group but instead a leaving group. So, if X is an alkyl bromide, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would form an ylide, which could then react with a carbonyl group.

But in the problem statement, X already has a carbonyl group (IR at 1720 cm^-1), so perhaps the reaction is a Wittig reaction where the ylide reacts with the carbonyl group in X to form an alkene.

Wait, but that would require X to have a carbonyl group and a leaving group. So perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a leaving group.

But that's getting a bit too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HX to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps X is a vicinal dihalide, and reaction with red phosphorus and HI would eliminate two equivalents of HI to form a double bond.

But without knowing exactly what X is, it's hard to predict.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a halide is replaced by an isopropyl group or something else.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think differently.

Another approach: the IR and NMR data of X suggest it's a benzoic acid with a substituent that's a sec-butyl group. So X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is transformed into something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of an alkyne. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride from the carboxylic acid. But that usually involves SOCl2, not red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, where the -OH of the COOH group acts as a leaving group. But that's not likely because COOH is a strong acid and the O-H is not a good leaving group.

Hmm, I'm stuck on the reaction mechanism. Let me think again about the possible options and what the reaction would do.

Wait, if the reaction is a substitution, and X has a leaving group (like a bromide) in the substituent, then reacting with HI would substitute that leaving group with an iodo group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, removing HX to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps X is an allylic bromide, and the reaction forms a double bond.

But without knowing the structure of X beyond the NMR and IR, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

Wait, but X's structure as per the NMR doesn't show any clear signs of a double bond (the IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm^-1, which could be aromatic C=C, but not an alkene).

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts a carbonyl group (like a ketone) into an alcohol, but I don't know.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a formation of an acid chloride, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of an alcohol to form an alkene, but again, I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to focus on the reaction conditions and the possible products.

The reaction uses red phosphorus and HI. One possible reaction is the formation of a phosphine ylide, which can then react with a carbonyl group in a Wittig reaction to form an alkene.

But for that, X would need to have a carbonyl group. So, if X has a carbonyl group, the reaction would form a ylide, which would then react with another carbonyl group to form an alkene.

Wait, but if X is the carbonyl compound, then perhaps the ylide would attack it, forming an alkene.

So, for example, if X is a ketone, the ylide (like from an alkyl halide) would form an alkene.

But in this case, X has a COOH group and a substituent with a chain. So perhaps the reaction would form an alkene by removing a hydrogen and a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the leaving group is replaced by a hydrogen.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a elimination reaction. For example, if X is a benzyl bromide, the reaction with HI in presence of red phosphorus could eliminate to form a benzene ring with a double bond.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by iodide, but that doesn't seem to fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

Wait, if X is a dihalide, reaction with HI and red phosphorus could eliminate two equivalents of HI, forming a double bond.

So, for example, if X has two leaving groups (like two bromines) on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond.

But again, without knowing X's structure beyond the NMR, I'm not sure.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show any signals indicative of a dihalide, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should focus back on the reaction between X and red phosphorus and HI, and what the product would be.

Wait, another possibility: if X is an alkyne, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could lead to the formation of a carbonyl group via hydration. But the IR data doesn't show a strong peak for a triple bond, which would be around 2100 cm^-1. The IR data has peaks around 3400-2500 (maybe OH and CH stretches), 1720 (carbonyl), and the aromatic C=C.

So, perhaps X has a carbonyl group, and the reaction is a Wittig reaction where the ylide reacts with the carbonyl to form an alkene.

In that case, the product would have an alkene where the carbonyl was.

So, if X is a benzaldehyde derivative, the product would be a styrene-type compound.

But let's think: X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). If the carbonyl group of the benzoic acid reacts in a Wittig reaction, the product would be a benzyl group with an alkene.

Wait, but the benzoic acid has a COOH group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Would that affect the Wittig reaction? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a Wittig but something else.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think about the reaction for each option.

The options are the products of the reaction. So the correct option would be the one formed when X (as determined from NMR and IR) reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

If X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

What would happen when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce a carbonyl group. For example, in the reduction of ketones to alkanes using H2P=PH3 (the ylide) in the presence of HI. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an ylide from an alkyl halide, which then reacts with a carbonyl group.

But again, without knowing the structure of X beyond its NMR and IR, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl halide, and the reaction with HI would substitute the halide with iodide. But the options don't show any iodide in the products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating a molecule of HX to form a double bond.

So, if X has a substituent with a leaving group and adjacent hydrogen, the reaction would form a double bond.

But, again, without knowing X's structure beyond the NMR data, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond adjacent to the leaving group, leading to a shorter chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is transformed. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a Barton reaction, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, another angle: what's the product of the Wittig reaction applied to benzoic acid? The Wittig reaction typically converts carbonyl groups (like ketones or aldehydes) into alkenes. So if X is a benzaldehyde, the product would be a styrene.

But X is a benzoic acid, not an aldehyde. So perhaps the reaction isn't a Wittig.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the benzoic acid into a benzyl iodide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by iodide. But that would require the COOH to be a good leaving group, which it isn't under these conditions.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the data.

The NMR and IR data point to X being 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction forms an ylide that then removes the COOH group, leading to substitution or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, removing the COOH group as CO2 and forming a double bond.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the carboxylic acid, but that usually requires stronger conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is a hydrolysis, but the options don't show that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, such as a Grignard addition, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are used for that.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the product is the same as X, but that doesn't make sense since the question asks for the product of the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent's leaving group is replaced. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond in the substituent.

If X's substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-), and the reaction eliminates H and X to form a double bond, then the substituent would become CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- with a double bond, perhaps leading to an isoprene-like structure.

But looking at the options, none seem to fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into a longer chain.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene in the substituent.

If X's substituent is a secondary or tertiary halide, elimination would form a double bond.

But without knowing X's structure beyond the NMR, it's hard to say.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction forms an alkene from the substituent. So, for example, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group, elimination would form a double bond between the first and second carbons.

Wait, but without knowing where the leaving group is, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, but I don't see how.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but that's the starting material, not the product.

Wait, no, the question is to find the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So the product can't be the same as X.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is transformed into something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a butyl group.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction decarboxylates to form 4-sec-butylbenzene.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which doesn't fit. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which also doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH group, leading to a benzene ring with just the substituent.

Wait, but then the product would be 4-sec-butylbenzene, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction that adds another group.

But I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with the initial analysis that X is option C and the reaction forms an alkene via a Wittig reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI. I found that sometimes, carboxylic acids can be converted into acyl phosphoranes using red phosphorus and iodine, but I'm not certain about HI's role.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. But that usually requires SOCl2 or PCl5, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make a guess based on the data.

The NMR and IR data point to X being 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into an iodide, but that doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent's bromide is replaced by iodide, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl iodide, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the carboxylic acid, leading to the formation of an anhydride, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with option C as the starting material and assume that the reaction doesn't change it, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis or something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes. So, for example, if X has a ketone group, the reaction would reduce it to a CH2 group.

But X's IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, which could be a ketone or an acid. If it's a ketone, then the product would have an additional CH2 group.

But X is a benzoic acid, with a COOH group. So perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into something else.

Wait, if the reaction reduces the COOH group, perhaps it becomes a CH2OH group. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into a CH2I group, but again, not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck, but I think I'll have to go with option C as the starting material and perhaps the reaction doesn't change it, but that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces a different product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent's bromide is replaced by iodide, but that's not reflected in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes elimination to form a double bond, leading to a product like 4-(allyl)benzoic acid, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the substituent, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted my options and need to make a guess. Based on the NMR and IR data, X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would likely involve the COOH group, possibly converting it into an acid chloride or something else, but since that's not an option, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution that replaces the substituent's group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a bromine, and the reaction substitutes it with iodide, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a leaving group, leading to an elimination reaction that forms a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group, elimination would form a double bond between the first and second carbons, leading to a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- structure becoming -CH2-CH=CH(CH3)-, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent becomes a propyl group after substitution.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with option C as the product, but that can't be right because the question asks for the product after reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the substituent, but I don't see how.

Another thought: the reaction could be a Hofmann elimination, converting an amide into an amine, but X doesn't have an amide group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and have to make a guess. Based on the NMR data, I'll go with option C as the starting material, and the reaction forms an alkene, leading to a product that's not among the options. But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure. But that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. I think I've thought this through as much as I can. I'll go with option C as the starting material and assume the reaction doesn't change it, but that's probably incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the product is option C with the substituent modified.

Wait, another angle: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a substitution where the leaving group in the substituent is replaced by hydrogen, leading to a shorter chain.

If the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, substitution of a leaving group (like Br) with hydrogen would form -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't change the structure.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but that's the starting material, not the product. So perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure, but the question implies it does. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the substituent, leading to a double bond. So if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, elimination would form a double bond between the first and second carbons, leading to a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group becoming -CH2-CH=CH2, but I'm not sure.

But without knowing the substituent's structure, it's hard to say.

I think I've reached the limit of my knowledge here. I'll have to make a guess. Based on the data, I'll say the product is option C, but that can't be right because the question asks for the product after reaction. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a dehydration of the carboxylic acid to form an acid anhydride, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, but I don't see how.

Hmm. I think I've to conclude that the correct answer is option C, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X:

1. **IR Data**:
   - Peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - A strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
   - Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of aromatic C=C bonds.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm confirms the presence of an O-H proton, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
   - Two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring.
   - A multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) indicate a CH group adjacent to a CH₂ group.
   - A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
   - A triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) indicates a CH₂CH₃ group.

From this data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C), which has a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

3. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to generate a ylide, which can participate in Wittig reactions. However, the exact reaction mechanism and product are unclear in this case.
   - The reaction conditions suggest a possible substitution or elimination reaction, but the data does not clearly indicate the transformation of the carboxylic acid group or the sec-butyl substituent.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid does not match the para-substitution pattern observed in the NMR.
   - **Option B**: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene lacks a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.
   - **Option C**: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid matches the IR and NMR data perfectly, indicating it is the starting material.
   - **Option D**: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene also lacks a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the data.

Given the ambiguity of the reaction mechanism and the lack of clear evidence for a transformation, the most reasonable conclusion is that Compound X remains unchanged after the reaction. However, since the question explicitly asks for the product, the analysis defaults to identifying Compound X itself as the correct answer based on the provided data.
