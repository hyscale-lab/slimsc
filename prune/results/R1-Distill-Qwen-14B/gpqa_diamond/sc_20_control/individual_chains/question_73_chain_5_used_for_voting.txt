Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that relativistic mechanics can get tricky because of things like time dilation and the fact that velocities don't just add up linearly. Let me think.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, wait. Wait, the question says "relative speed"—so I think that means the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference. Oh right, because each astronaut is in their own inertial frame, so their relative speed isn't just the difference of the two speeds. I remember the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²), where u and v are the velocities in the original frame. But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me write that out. Let me say u is 0.6c (Astronaut A's speed) and v is 0.5c (Astronaut B's speed). The relative speed would be (v - u) [because from A's perspective, B is moving at v - u, but wait no, wait: wait, if both are moving in the same direction, when you're in A's frame, B is moving slower. So if A is at 0.6c and B is at 0.5c, then in A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Because the velocity addition formula is (u' - v) / (1 - (u' v)/c²), where u' is the velocity of the object as measured in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the frame itself. So if I'm in the original frame (let's say the rest frame S), and I'm calculating the velocity of object 2 (B) as seen from object 1 (A), which is moving at velocity u = 0.6c. So the formula would be (u_B - u_A) / (1 - (u_B u_A)/c²). Wait, but u_B is 0.5c and u_A is 0.6c. So substituting, we get (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator separately. Numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But since speed is positive, it's 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Oh, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. So each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². Wait, but wait, their masses are 2m and 3m. So for each astronaut, I need to compute their energy and sum them.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Because in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each object. So each one's energy is their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma. So for astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_A = gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approx 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, which is approximately 5.96 m c². So looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. That matches. Option D says E=5mc², which is roughly 5, but our sum is about 5.96. So option C is the choice.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (Astronaut A's speed) and \(v = 0.5c\) (Astronaut B's speed). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

1. **Numerator**: \(0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c\)
2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the speed is positive, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

1. **For Astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):**
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **For Astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):**
   \[
   \gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

Adding these energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
