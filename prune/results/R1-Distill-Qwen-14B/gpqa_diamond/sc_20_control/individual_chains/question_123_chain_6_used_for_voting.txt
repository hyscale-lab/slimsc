Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, right, I remember that in such cases, we often have to deal with reference frames and maybe some special relativity concepts, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which means they're not accelerating, so no worries about changing velocities or anything like that. Oh, and gravity is ignored, so no gravitational effects to consider. Also, the rotation and revolution of the Galaxy are neglected. That simplifies things a bit.

From the ejecta's reference frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at that speed. But since the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta must be approaching at the same speed but in the opposite direction. Because in inertial frames, the relative speed is the same when you swap the frames. So if in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards at the same speed.

Wait, but is that always the case? Oh right, in Newtonian mechanics, velocities just add up, but in special relativity, you can't just add them like that because of the relativity of velocity measurements. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether they are using relativistic speeds. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let me think about the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 0.2 times the speed of light. Hmm, that's a significant fraction, about 20% the speed of light. So perhaps relativistic effects are important here.

Wait, but the question is about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we need to relate the proper time in the ejecta's frame to the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Ah, right, time dilation comes into play here. Because according to special relativity, moving clocks run slower. So the time experienced in the ejecta (proper time) is different from the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The ejecta is moving at velocity v relative to the Galaxy. The proper time for the ejecta is t', and the time in the Galaxy's frame is t.

The relation between the two is given by the Lorentz transformation. So the time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

But in this case, we're dealing with the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance would be the velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, right? Because distance = speed × time.

So, the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s. Wait, but the question says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is v = 60,000 km/s.

So the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame is t. But the time given is t' = 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

So we need to relate t and t'. Let's think about the relationship between the two.

In special relativity, the relation between the proper time (t') and the coordinate time (t) depends on the relative velocity. The proper time is the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), and the coordinate time is in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame).

But wait, which frame is the rest frame here? Hmm. The Galaxy is considered an inertial frame, and so is the ejecta. So when the ejecta is moving at speed v relative to the Galaxy, the time experienced by the ejecta (proper time) is the time in its own frame, t', and the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation.

So the formula is t = gamma * t'.

Wait, but to get gamma, we need v. v is 6e4 km/s. Let me calculate it in terms of c.

c is about 3e5 km/s, so v = 6e4 km/s = (6e4)/(3e5) c = 0.2c.

So v = 0.2c.

Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Plugging in v = 0.2c:

v²/c² = (0.04 c²)/c² = 0.04.

So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma ≈ 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 seconds ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the time in the ejecta's frame is t', and the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma t', meaning more time has passed in the Galaxy's frame. So the ejecta would have been moving for longer in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance would be v * t.

So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

6e4 km/s * 51.03 s = 6e4 * 51.03 km.

Wait, 6e4 is 60,000. So 60,000 * 51.03.

Compute 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.

60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800 km.

So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but let me double-check the gamma calculation. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, the exact value of gamma when v = 0.2c.

sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = sqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.979795897.

So 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020612.

So t = 50 * 1.020612 ≈ 51.0306 seconds.

Then the distance is 6e4 km/s * 51.0306 s = 6e4 * 51.0306.

6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 * 51.0306 = ?

Let me compute 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.0306 = 60,000 *1 =60,000 + 60,000 *0.0306 =60,000 *0.03 = 1,800, 0.0006 is 36.

So 60,000 * 0.0306 = 1,836.

So 60,000 *1.0306 = 60,000 + 1,836 =61,836.

So total is 3,000,000 + 61,836 = 3,061,836 km.

But looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

So 3,061,836 is approximately 3,060,000 km, which matches option D.

Wait, but wait a moment. Did I get the direction correct? The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, so the distance it travels in the Galaxy's frame would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But let me make sure that I didn't mix up the proper time and the other frame.

In the ejecta's frame, the time elapsed is t' = 50 seconds. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer: t = gamma * t'.

So the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame is v * t = 6e4 * gamma * 50.

Which is what I calculated.

So the distance is approximately 3,061,836 km, which is close to 3,060,000 km, so option D.

But wait, maybe I should calculate gamma more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.96) is exactly sqrt(96/100) = (4 * sqrt(6))/10 = (2 * sqrt(6)) /5.

Wait, sqrt(6) is approximately 2.4495, so 2 * 2.4495 = 4.899.

Divide by 5: 4.899 /5 ≈ 0.9798.

So gamma is 1/0.9798 ≈1.0206.

So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes non-relativistic speeds. Let me think. If the speeds are non-relativistic, then time dilation isn't considered, and you can just use Galilean transformations. In that case, the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame. So the distance would be 6e4 km/s *50 s=3e6 km, which is option B.

But wait, 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so we can't ignore relativistic effects. So the correct approach is to use the time dilation formula.

But wait, the problem states that both frames are inertial. So the correct approach is to use special relativity.

So the answer should be option D: 3,060,000 km.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach is using velocity addition. But perhaps I'm confusing which frame is which.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the velocity of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta is -60,000 km/s (assuming the positive direction is away from the Galaxy).

But the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy, which is negative, so -60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no, the direction depends on how you set up the coordinates. Let me clarify.

Suppose in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So in that frame, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s (assuming positive is away from the center).

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's velocity is v' = +60,000 km/s (since the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, the Galaxy is approaching it).

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula in special relativity, the velocity of the Galaxy as observed from the ejecta is not simply v, but due to the relative motion, it's adjusted by the Lorentz transformation.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of proper time and the distance.

Wait, let me think about the proper time. The proper time is in the ejecta's frame. So the time that passes in the ejecta's frame is t' =50 s.

In the Galaxy's frame, the elapsed time is longer. So t = gamma * t'.

So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t = v * gamma * t'.

So substituting the numbers:

v =6e4 km/s,

gamma ≈1.0206,

t'=50 s.

So v * gamma * t' =6e4 * 1.0206 *50.

Wait, that's 6e4 *50 *1.0206.

6e4 *50 =3e6.

3e6 *1.0206=3,061,800 km.

Which matches what I calculated earlier.

So the distance is approximately 3.0618e6 km, which is 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use time dilation correctly.

So the answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame using special relativity. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), and in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy appears to move towards it at the same speed. The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \), and we need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.

### Step 1: Time Dilation
In special relativity, the proper time \( t' \) in the ejecta's frame is related to the coordinate time \( t \) in the Galaxy's frame by the time dilation formula:
\[
t = \gamma t',
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Given \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), we calculate:
\[
v^2/c^2 = \left(\frac{60,000}{300,000}\right)^2 = 0.04, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.96, \quad \sqrt{0.96} \approx 0.9798.
\]
Thus:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206.
\]
The time in the Galaxy's frame is:
\[
t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame
The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
\[
\text{Distance} = v \cdot t.
\]
Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
\[
\text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
\]

### Step 3: Matching the Closest Option
The calculated distance is approximately \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \), which is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**. The relativistic effects are significant here due to the high speed of the ejecta (\( 0.2c \)), and the time dilation factor \( \gamma \) must be accounted for to determine the correct distance.
