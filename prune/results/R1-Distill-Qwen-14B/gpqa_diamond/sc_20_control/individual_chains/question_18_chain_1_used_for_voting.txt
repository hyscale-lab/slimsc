Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if that matters for the problem. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, right?

They gave me some abundance values using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. The values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. I think I need to find the [Si/H] for both stars and then find the ratio.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, so maybe it's [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2? Or maybe the ratio of their abundances? Let me think.

First, let's figure out what each of those abundance values means. The notation [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Oh wait, no, more accurately, it's log(nX/nY) minus the solar ratio, so [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_☉.

So for [Fe/H]_1 being 0. That means [Fe/H] = 0 implies that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_☉ / nH_☉. Similarly for [Mg/H]_2=0, nMg_2 / nH_2 = nMg_☉ / nH_☉.

Now, for Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = 0.3 means log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_☉ = 0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that tells me that nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_☉/nH_☉. So for Star_1, the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. Therefore, nFe_1 = nFe_☉ * (nH_1/nH_☉).

Wait, maybe I should express the abundances in terms of solar values. Let me structure this.

Let me denote the solar values as subscript 's'. So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe_1 / nH_1) = log(nFe_s / nH_s) → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_s / nH_s → So nFe_1 = (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So:

[Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_s / nFe_s) = 0.3.

But since we know nFe_1 = (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1, let's substitute that into the [Si/Fe] equation.

So:

log( (nSi_1) / ( (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1 ) ) - log(nSi_s / nFe_s) ) = 0.3.

Simplify inside the log:

(nSi_1 * nH_s) / (nFe_s * nH_1) ) = 10^{0.3 + log(nSi_s / nFe_s)}.

Wait, maybe I should break it down. Let me compute the [Si/Fe]_1 equation.

log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_s / nFe_s).

So nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nFe_s).

But nFe_1 = (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1.

So nSi_1 = [10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nFe_s)] * nFe_1.

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nFe_s) * (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1.

Simplify:

The nFe_s cancel, so:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s) * (nH_1 / nH_s).

Hmm. So nSi_1 = (10^0.3) * (nSi_s) * (nH_1 / nH_s).

But I don't know nH_1 relative to the Sun. Wait, but since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the Fe abundance is same as Sun, so nH_1 = (nH_s) * (nFe_1 / nFe_s).

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can express [Si/H]_1.

Because [Si/H] is log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_s/nH_s).

But from the earlier equation:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s) * (nH_1/nH_s).

So, nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nH_s).

Taking the log:

log(nSi_1/nH_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_s / nH_s).

So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_s.

What's [Si/H]_s? Since for the sun, the value is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7.

Wait, the given solar values are 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^-4.5.

Similarly, log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about [Si/H]_s? The sun's [Si/H] is probably given or we need to calculate it. Wait, perhaps the sun’s [Si/H] is based on what? Do I have any data about Si in the sun? The question provides Fe and Mg, but not Si.

Hmm, maybe I can get [Si/H]_s from the solar data provided. Wait, maybe I can find [Mg/Si]_s. Because [Mg/Si]_2 is given as 0.3, but perhaps for the sun it's different.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] isn't given, but perhaps I can compute it based on the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Similarly, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

But what about [Si/H]?

Hmm, perhaps I can assume that in the Sun, [Si/H] is, let's see, there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question doesn't require knowing the Sun's [Si/H], because for Star_1 and Star_2, we can relate their [Si/H] to their [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], and for Star_2, their [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H].

Wait, let's get back to Star_1.

We have [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, and [Fe/H]_1=0.

As I found earlier, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Wait, is that correct? Because [Si/Fe] is the log ratio relative to solar, and [Fe/H] is the log ratio relative to solar. So [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]. Because:

[Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_s/nH_s) = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H], since [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_s/nH_s) = log(nFe/nH) - [Fe/H]_s.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Let's express [Si/H] in terms of [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

We have [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_s/nH_s).

But nSi/nH = (nSi/nFe) * (nFe/nH) → log(nSi/nH) = log(nSi/nFe) + log(nFe/nH).

So:

[Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H].

Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_s/nH_s) → no, wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_s.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The general formula for abundance is [X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY in star) - log(nX/nY in Sun).

So, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1 / nH_1) - log(nSi_s / nH_s).

But nSi_1 / nH_1 = (nSi_1 / nFe_1) * (nFe_1 / nH_1).

So, log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) + log(nFe_1/nH_1).

Which means:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.

Because:

[Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_s/nH_s) = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.

Because [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_s/nH_s).

So yes, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

So the abundance of Si relative to H in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. So nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nH_s).

Similarly, for Star_2, let's process the given data.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 =0.

So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY)_star - log(nX/nY)_s =0.3.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s) + 0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_s/nH_s) → nMg_2 = (nMg_s /nH_s) * nH_2.

So, let's express [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of nH_2.

log( (nMg_2) / (nSi_2) ) = log( ( (nMg_s /nH_s) * nH_2 ) / nSi_2 ).

Which equals log(nMg_s /nH_s * nH_2 / nSi_2 ).

So, log(nMg_s /nH_s) + log(nH_2) - log(nSi_2) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s) +0.3.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express nMg_2 in terms of nH_2.

nMg_2 = (nMg_s /nH_s) * nH_2.

Then, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log( nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) = log( nMg_s /nSi_s ) + 0.3.

So, nMg_2 /nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_s /nSi_s).

Substituting nMg_2:

( (nMg_s /nH_s) * nH_2 ) / nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_s /nSi_s).

Simplify:

(nMg_s * nH_2 ) / (nH_s * nSi_2) ) = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_s /nSi_s).

Cancel nMg_s from both sides:

nH_2 / (nH_s * nSi_2) ) = 10^{0.3} /nSi_s.

So, nSi_2 = (nH_2 / (nH_s )) ) * (nSi_s) / (10^{0.3}).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can express [Si/H]_2.

[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_s/nH_s).

From the equation above, nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_s /nH_s) ) / 10^{0.3}.

Because:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_s) * (nSi_s / 10^{0.3}).

So, nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_s / nH_s) / 10^{0.3}.

Taking log:

log(nSi_2/nH_2) = log(nSi_s/nH_s) - 0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = (log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_s/nH_s)) ) → which is (log(nSi_s/nH_s) -0.3 ) - log(nSi_s/nH_s) )= -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait that's interesting. So for Star_2, silicon is 0.3 dex less than the Sun.

Wait, let me double-check.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_s/nSi_s) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2)=log(nMg_s/nH_s).

So, nMg_2 = (nMg_s/nH_s) * nH_2.

Substituting into [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

log( (nMg_s * nH_2 ) / (nH_s * nSi_2) ) = log( nMg_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

Which can be written as:

log( (nMg_s /nH_s ) * (nH_2 /nSi_2) ) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

Log(a*b)= log a + log b.

So, log(nMg_s /nH_s ) + log(nH_2 /nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

Move terms around:

log(nH_2 /nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s ) +0.3 - log(nMg_s /nH_s ).

Compute the RHS:

= log( nMg_s /nSi_s ) - log( nMg_s /nH_s ) ) +0.3.

Which is log( (nMg_s /nSi_s ) / (nMg_s /nH_s )) ) +0.3.

Simplify inside the log:

(nMg_s /nSi_s ) * (nH_s /nMg_s ) ) = nH_s /nSi_s.

So, log(nH_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

So:

log(nH_2 /nSi_2 ) = log(nH_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

Take exponentials:

nH_2 /nSi_2 = (nH_s /nSi_s ) * 10^{0.3}.

Rearranged:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_s ) * (nSi_s ) / (10^{0.3}).

So, nSi_2 /nH_2 = (nSi_s /nH_s ) / 10^{0.3}.

So, when I take log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_s/nH_s ), I get [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, Star_1 has [Si/H] = 0.3, Star_2 has [Si/H] =-0.3.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so that's (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2).

Which can be written as (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

But nSi_1 = (nSi_s /nH_s ) * 10^{0.3} *nH_1.

Wait, earlier we have:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s) * (nH_1 /nH_s).

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_s ) * (nSi_s) / 10^{0.3}.

So, nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s /nH_s).

nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_s /nH_s ) /10^{0.3}.

So, their ratio is:

(10^{0.3} * (nSi_s /nH_s )) / ( (nSi_s /nH_s ) /10^{0.3} ) ) = (10^{0.3} ) / (1/10^{0.3}) ) = 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} = 10^{0.6}.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is close to option A) ~3.9.

Wait, but let me compute 10^0.6. 0.6 is 3/5, and 10^(0.6) is about 3.98. So the ratio is approximately 4, but the options only have ~3.9, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3. So the ratio (nSi_1 /nH_1)/(nSi_s/nH_s) )=10^0.3 ≈ 2.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. So (nSi_2 /nH_2)/(nSi_s/nH_s) )=10^(-0.3)≈ 0.5.

So the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_2/nH_2) = (2) / (0.5) = 4, which matches the earlier calculation.

Wait, but another approach: the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}) ) = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is option A) ~3.9.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2: (nSi_1/nH_1) divided by (nSi_2/nH_2) → which is (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

Which would be nSi_1 nH_2 / (nH_1 nSi_2).

But based on earlier calculations:

nSi_1 =10^{0.3} (nSi_s) (nH_1 /nH_s).

nSi_2= (nH_2 /nH_s) (nSi_s / 10^{0.3}).

So, nSi_1 *nH_2=10^{0.3} nSi_s nH_1/(nH_s) * nH_2.

nH_1 *nSi_2 =nH_1 * (nH_2/(nH_s) ) (nSi_s /10^{0.3} ).

So, ratio= [10^{0.3} nSi_s nH_1 nH_2/(nH_s) ] / [ nH_1 nH_2 nSi_s / (nH_s 10^{0.3}) ) ].

Simplify: numerator is 10^{0.3} nSi_s nH1 nH2 /nH_s.

Denominator is (nH1 nH2 nSi_s )/(nH_s 10^{0.3} ).

So ratio = [10^{0.3} nSi_s ... ] / [ (nH1 nH2 ... )/(nH_s 10^{0.3} ) ].

Wait, when I take the ratio, the nH1, nH2, and nSi_s terms cancel out, as well as nH_s.

Left with (10^{0.3} ) / (1/(10^{0.3} )) )=10^{0.6}.

So again, 10^0.6≈3.98, so option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and solar composition.

### Key Data and Definitions:
1. **Abundance Notation**: The abundance ratio [X/Y] is defined as:
   \[
   [X/Y] = \log_{10}(n_X / n_Y) - \log_{10}(n_X / n_Y)_{\odot}
   \]
   where \(n_X\) and \(n_Y\) are the number densities of elements \(X\) and \(Y\), and the subscript \(\odot\) denotes solar values.

2. **Star 1**:
   - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\)
   - \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\)
   - \([Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3\).

3. **Star 2**:
   - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\)
   - \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\).
   - Using the relationship \([Si/H]_2 = -[Mg/Si]_2 + [Mg/H]_2\), we find:
     \[
     [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3
     \].

4. **Solar Composition**:
   - \(\log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H)_{\odot} = -4.5\)
   - \(\log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H)_{\odot} = -5\).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}/n_{H,1}}{n_{Si,2}/n_{H,2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}
\]
Substituting \([Si/H]_1 = 0.3\) and \([Si/H]_2 = -0.3\):
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}/n_{H,1}}{n_{Si,2}/n_{H,2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
\]
Using \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately \(3.9\).

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is closest to **3.9**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if that matters for the problem. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, right?

They gave me some abundance values using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. The values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. I think I need to find the [Si/H] for both stars and then find the ratio.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, so maybe it's [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2? Or maybe the ratio of their abundances? Let me think.

First, let's figure out what each of those abundance values means. The notation [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Oh wait, no, more accurately, it's log(nX/nY) minus the solar ratio, so [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_☉.

So for [Fe/H]_1 being 0. That means [Fe/H] = 0 implies that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_☉ / nH_☉. Similarly for [Mg/H]_2=0, nMg_2 / nH_2 = nMg_☉ / nH_☉.

Now, for Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = 0.3 means log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_☉ = 0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that tells me that nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_☉/nH_☉. So for Star_1, the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. Therefore, nFe_1 = nFe_☉ * (nH_1/nH_☉).

Wait, maybe I should express the abundances in terms of solar values. Let me structure this.

Let me denote the solar values as subscript 's'. So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe_1 / nH_1) = log(nFe_s / nH_s) → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_s / nH_s → So nFe_1 = (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So:

[Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_s / nFe_s) = 0.3.

But since we know nFe_1 = (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1, let's substitute that into the [Si/Fe] equation.

So:

log( (nSi_1) / ( (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1 ) ) - log(nSi_s / nFe_s) ) = 0.3.

Simplify inside the log:

(nSi_1 * nH_s) / (nFe_s * nH_1) ) = 10^{0.3 + log(nSi_s / nFe_s)}.

Wait, maybe I should break it down. Let me compute the [Si/Fe]_1 equation.

log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_s / nFe_s).

So nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nFe_s).

But nFe_1 = (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1.

So nSi_1 = [10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nFe_s)] * nFe_1.

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nFe_s) * (nFe_s / nH_s) * nH_1.

Simplify:

The nFe_s cancel, so:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s) * (nH_1 / nH_s).

Hmm. So nSi_1 = (10^0.3) * (nSi_s) * (nH_1 / nH_s).

But I don't know nH_1 relative to the Sun. Wait, but since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the Fe abundance is same as Sun, so nH_1 = (nH_s) * (nFe_1 / nFe_s).

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can express [Si/H]_1.

Because [Si/H] is log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_s/nH_s).

But from the earlier equation:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s) * (nH_1/nH_s).

So, nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nH_s).

Taking the log:

log(nSi_1/nH_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_s / nH_s).

So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_s.

What's [Si/H]_s? Since for the sun, the value is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7.

Wait, the given solar values are 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^-4.5.

Similarly, log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about [Si/H]_s? The sun's [Si/H] is probably given or we need to calculate it. Wait, perhaps the sun’s [Si/H] is based on what? Do I have any data about Si in the sun? The question provides Fe and Mg, but not Si.

Hmm, maybe I can get [Si/H]_s from the solar data provided. Wait, maybe I can find [Mg/Si]_s. Because [Mg/Si]_2 is given as 0.3, but perhaps for the sun it's different.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] isn't given, but perhaps I can compute it based on the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Similarly, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

But what about [Si/H]?

Hmm, perhaps I can assume that in the Sun, [Si/H] is, let's see, there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question doesn't require knowing the Sun's [Si/H], because for Star_1 and Star_2, we can relate their [Si/H] to their [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], and for Star_2, their [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H].

Wait, let's get back to Star_1.

We have [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, and [Fe/H]_1=0.

As I found earlier, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Wait, is that correct? Because [Si/Fe] is the log ratio relative to solar, and [Fe/H] is the log ratio relative to solar. So [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]. Because:

[Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_s/nH_s) = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H], since [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_s/nH_s) = log(nFe/nH) - [Fe/H]_s.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Let's express [Si/H] in terms of [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

We have [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_s/nH_s).

But nSi/nH = (nSi/nFe) * (nFe/nH) → log(nSi/nH) = log(nSi/nFe) + log(nFe/nH).

So:

[Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H].

Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_s/nH_s) → no, wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_s.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The general formula for abundance is [X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY in star) - log(nX/nY in Sun).

So, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1 / nH_1) - log(nSi_s / nH_s).

But nSi_1 / nH_1 = (nSi_1 / nFe_1) * (nFe_1 / nH_1).

So, log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) + log(nFe_1/nH_1).

Which means:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.

Because:

[Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_s/nH_s) = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.

Because [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_s/nH_s).

So yes, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

So the abundance of Si relative to H in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. So nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s / nH_s).

Similarly, for Star_2, let's process the given data.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 =0.

So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY)_star - log(nX/nY)_s =0.3.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s) + 0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_s/nH_s) → nMg_2 = (nMg_s /nH_s) * nH_2.

So, let's express [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of nH_2.

log( (nMg_2) / (nSi_2) ) = log( ( (nMg_s /nH_s) * nH_2 ) / nSi_2 ).

Which equals log(nMg_s /nH_s * nH_2 / nSi_2 ).

So, log(nMg_s /nH_s) + log(nH_2) - log(nSi_2) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s) +0.3.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express nMg_2 in terms of nH_2.

nMg_2 = (nMg_s /nH_s) * nH_2.

Then, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log( nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) = log( nMg_s /nSi_s ) + 0.3.

So, nMg_2 /nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_s /nSi_s).

Substituting nMg_2:

( (nMg_s /nH_s) * nH_2 ) / nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_s /nSi_s).

Simplify:

(nMg_s * nH_2 ) / (nH_s * nSi_2) ) = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_s /nSi_s).

Cancel nMg_s from both sides:

nH_2 / (nH_s * nSi_2) ) = 10^{0.3} /nSi_s.

So, nSi_2 = (nH_2 / (nH_s )) ) * (nSi_s) / (10^{0.3}).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can express [Si/H]_2.

[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_s/nH_s).

From the equation above, nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_s /nH_s) ) / 10^{0.3}.

Because:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_s) * (nSi_s / 10^{0.3}).

So, nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_s / nH_s) / 10^{0.3}.

Taking log:

log(nSi_2/nH_2) = log(nSi_s/nH_s) - 0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = (log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_s/nH_s)) ) → which is (log(nSi_s/nH_s) -0.3 ) - log(nSi_s/nH_s) )= -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait that's interesting. So for Star_2, silicon is 0.3 dex less than the Sun.

Wait, let me double-check.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_s/nSi_s) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2)=log(nMg_s/nH_s).

So, nMg_2 = (nMg_s/nH_s) * nH_2.

Substituting into [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

log( (nMg_s * nH_2 ) / (nH_s * nSi_2) ) = log( nMg_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

Which can be written as:

log( (nMg_s /nH_s ) * (nH_2 /nSi_2) ) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

Log(a*b)= log a + log b.

So, log(nMg_s /nH_s ) + log(nH_2 /nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

Move terms around:

log(nH_2 /nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_s /nSi_s ) +0.3 - log(nMg_s /nH_s ).

Compute the RHS:

= log( nMg_s /nSi_s ) - log( nMg_s /nH_s ) ) +0.3.

Which is log( (nMg_s /nSi_s ) / (nMg_s /nH_s )) ) +0.3.

Simplify inside the log:

(nMg_s /nSi_s ) * (nH_s /nMg_s ) ) = nH_s /nSi_s.

So, log(nH_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

So:

log(nH_2 /nSi_2 ) = log(nH_s /nSi_s ) +0.3.

Take exponentials:

nH_2 /nSi_2 = (nH_s /nSi_s ) * 10^{0.3}.

Rearranged:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_s ) * (nSi_s ) / (10^{0.3}).

So, nSi_2 /nH_2 = (nSi_s /nH_s ) / 10^{0.3}.

So, when I take log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_s/nH_s ), I get [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, Star_1 has [Si/H] = 0.3, Star_2 has [Si/H] =-0.3.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so that's (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2).

Which can be written as (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

But nSi_1 = (nSi_s /nH_s ) * 10^{0.3} *nH_1.

Wait, earlier we have:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s) * (nH_1 /nH_s).

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_s ) * (nSi_s) / 10^{0.3}.

So, nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_s /nH_s).

nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_s /nH_s ) /10^{0.3}.

So, their ratio is:

(10^{0.3} * (nSi_s /nH_s )) / ( (nSi_s /nH_s ) /10^{0.3} ) ) = (10^{0.3} ) / (1/10^{0.3}) ) = 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} = 10^{0.6}.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is close to option A) ~3.9.

Wait, but let me compute 10^0.6. 0.6 is 3/5, and 10^(0.6) is about 3.98. So the ratio is approximately 4, but the options only have ~3.9, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3. So the ratio (nSi_1 /nH_1)/(nSi_s/nH_s) )=10^0.3 ≈ 2.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. So (nSi_2 /nH_2)/(nSi_s/nH_s) )=10^(-0.3)≈ 0.5.

So the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_2/nH_2) = (2) / (0.5) = 4, which matches the earlier calculation.

Wait, but another approach: the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}) ) = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is option A) ~3.9.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2: (nSi_1/nH_1) divided by (nSi_2/nH_2) → which is (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

Which would be nSi_1 nH_2 / (nH_1 nSi_2).

But based on earlier calculations:

nSi_1 =10^{0.3} (nSi_s) (nH_1 /nH_s).

nSi_2= (nH_2 /nH_s) (nSi_s / 10^{0.3}).

So, nSi_1 *nH_2=10^{0.3} nSi_s nH_1/(nH_s) * nH_2.

nH_1 *nSi_2 =nH_1 * (nH_2/(nH_s) ) (nSi_s /10^{0.3} ).

So, ratio= [10^{0.3} nSi_s nH_1 nH_2/(nH_s) ] / [ nH_1 nH_2 nSi_s / (nH_s 10^{0.3}) ) ].

Simplify: numerator is 10^{0.3} nSi_s nH1 nH2 /nH_s.

Denominator is (nH1 nH2 nSi_s )/(nH_s 10^{0.3} ).

So ratio = [10^{0.3} nSi_s ... ] / [ (nH1 nH2 ... )/(nH_s 10^{0.3} ) ].

Wait, when I take the ratio, the nH1, nH2, and nSi_s terms cancel out, as well as nH_s.

Left with (10^{0.3} ) / (1/(10^{0.3} )) )=10^{0.6}.

So again, 10^0.6≈3.98, so option A is the correct answer.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and solar composition.

### Key Data and Definitions:
1. **Abundance Notation**: The abundance ratio [X/Y] is defined as:
   \[
   [X/Y] = \log_{10}(n_X / n_Y) - \log_{10}(n_X / n_Y)_{\odot}
   \]
   where \(n_X\) and \(n_Y\) are the number densities of elements \(X\) and \(Y\), and the subscript \(\odot\) denotes solar values.

2. **Star 1**:
   - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\)
   - \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\)
   - \([Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3\).

3. **Star 2**:
   - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\)
   - \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\).
   - Using the relationship \([Si/H]_2 = -[Mg/Si]_2 + [Mg/H]_2\), we find:
     \[
     [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3
     \].

4. **Solar Composition**:
   - \(\log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H)_{\odot} = -4.5\)
   - \(\log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H)_{\odot} = -5\).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}/n_{H,1}}{n_{Si,2}/n_{H,2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}
\]
Substituting \([Si/H]_1 = 0.3\) and \([Si/H]_2 = -0.3\):
\[
\frac{n_{Si,1}/n_{H,1}}{n_{Si,2}/n_{H,2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
\]
Using \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately \(3.9\).

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is closest to **3.9**.
