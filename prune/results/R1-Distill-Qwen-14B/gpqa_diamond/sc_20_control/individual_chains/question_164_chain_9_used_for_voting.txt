Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read the question again.

Alright, so there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, from spectroscopic observations, they get radial velocity (RV) variations. 

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And the mass is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses. The idea is that the stars orbit a common center of mass, and their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, the more massive star moves slower, and the less massive one moves faster.

But how does that relate to the mass function and the actual masses? Oh right, the mass function gives a lower limit on the mass, but when you have both stars' velocities, you can get the actual masses.

Wait, the mass function formula is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but when you have both velocities, you can find the mass ratio. Oh, right, the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = (V1 / V2 ), where V1 and V2 are the velocities of the two stars. Because the center of mass requires M1 V1 = M2 V2, so V1/V2 = M2/M1. So, q = V1/(V2) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Let me say M1 and M2 are the masses. The velocities are V1 and V2. Since the system's center of mass requires M1 V1 = M2 V2, so M1/M2 = V2/V1. That makes sense because if M1 is bigger, V1 is smaller. So, the velocity amplitude ratio is V1/V2 = M2/(M1) = q, where q is the mass ratio (M2/M1). So, q = V1/V2.

Wait, no, because from M1 * V1 = M2 * V2, rearranging, M1/M2 = V2/V1. So, q = M2/M1 = V1/V2. Hmm, okay, I think that's correct.

So in system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. But wait, which is which? The problem says the two stars display sinusoidal variations with those amplitudes. Oh wait, system_1 has amplitudes 10 and 5. So, let's say star A has 10, star B 5. So, V_A=10, V_B=5. So the mass ratio q1 = V_A / V_B = 10/5 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2. Or wait, is it M1/M2 = V_A/V_B? Because M1 * V1 = M2 * V2. So M1/M2 = V2/V1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So, q1 (M2/M1) = 0.5. Wait, no, q is defined as M2/M1. So q1 = 0.5, which means M2 is half the mass of M1.

So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 0.5 M1 = 1.5 M1. So M1_total = 1.5 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. Let me denote them as V_A=15, V_B=10. So V_A is bigger than V_B. So M2 (the star with V_A) is less massive than M1 (with V_B). Wait, no, because the more massive star moves slower, so the larger velocity means smaller mass.

Wait, M1 = mass of star with velocity V1, M2 with V2. From M1 V1 = M2 V2, so if V1 > V2, then M1 < M2.

Wait, let me think with system_2. V_A=15 (star A) and V_B=10 (star B). So, M_A * 15 = M_B * 10. So M_A / M_B = 10/15 = 2/3. So M_A = (2/3) M_B. So the mass ratio q (M_A / M_B) is 2/3. So M_A = (2/3) M_B.

So the total mass of system_2 is M_A + M_B = (2/3 M_B) + M_B = (5/3) M_B.

Wait, but how does this relate to the orbital periods? Because the period is the same for both stars since they orbit each other.

Wait, the orbital period is given for each system. For system_1, the period is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year.

The mass function in binary stars relates the period, the velocity, and the masses. The mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + q)^2 ) ), but I think in this case, since the inclination isn't given, but both systems are eclipsing, so i is 90 degrees, so sin i = 1.

So, the mass function would then be f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + q)^2 ), but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, I remember that the total mass can be found from the velocity amplitudes and the period. The formula is M_total = (4 π^2 / G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P^2, but I'm not sure about the exact form.

Wait, another approach. The mass of the binary system is determined by Kepler's third law. The formula is P^2 = (4 π² G)⁻¹ (4 π² a³) / (G(M1 + M2)), but I think it's better to express it as (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³) / (G P²).

Wait, but we don't have the semi-major axis, a. However, the semi-major axes are related to the velocities. Since the stars orbit the center of mass, a1 and a2 are their respective semi-major axes. And from the center of mass condition, M1 a1 = M2 a2. So, a1/a2 = M2/M1 = q.

So, a1 = q a2.

The sum a1 + a2 is the separation between the two stars, a = a1 + a2 = a2 (q + 1). But without knowing a, maybe it's tricky.

Alternatively, the velocities are related to the orbital period and the semi-major axes. The velocity of each star is v = 2 π a / P. So, v1 = 2 π a1 / P, v2 = 2 π a2 / P.

But since a1 = q a2, we can write a2 = a1 / q. So, a1 = q a2.

So, v1 = 2 π a1 / P, v2 = 2 π a2 / P.

But since a1 = q a2, substituting into v2: v2 = 2 π (a1 / q ) / P = (v1 ) (1/q ).

Hmm, so v2 = v1 / q.

Wait, but from the mass ratio, q = M2 / M1. So, if q is 0.5, then M2 is half of M1. So, v2 is v1 / 0.5 = 2 v1.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to write down the equations step by step.

We have:

M1 * a1 = M2 * a2.

And the period P is the same for both, so P = 2 π a1 / v1 = 2 π a2 / v2.

So from both expressions, a1 / v1 = a2 / v2.

But from the mass equation, a1 = (M2/M1) a2.

So, substituting a1 = (M2/M1) a2 into a1 / v1 = a2 / v2:

(M2/M1 a2) / v1 = a2 / v2.

Cancel a2 on both sides:

(M2/M1) / v1 = 1 / v2.

=> v2 = (v1 M1 ) / M2.

But M1/M2 = 1/q, since q = M2/M1.

So, v2 = v1 / q.

So, in system_1:

v1 is 10 km/s, v2 is 5 km/s.

So, v2 = 5 = 10 / q1.

So, 5 = 10 / q1 → q1 = 2. So q1 = M2/M1 = 2. So M2 = 2 M1.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought M2 is less than M1. Wait, no. If q = M2/M1 = 2, then M2 is twice as massive as M1. Wait, but in system_1, the larger velocity (10 km/s) would belong to the less massive star. Because the more massive star has lower velocity. So if M2 is twice M1, then M1 is smaller, so M2 has higher velocity? No, wait, no.

Wait, no, because the velocities are: the more massive star moves slower.

So, if M2 is more massive than M1, it should have a smaller velocity. But in system_1, v1 =10 is higher than v2=5. So that would mean M2 is more massive than M1, but that's not possible because if M2 is more massive, v2 should be smaller than v1.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me go back. Let's say system_1's stars are M1 and M2. Their velocities are v1=10 and v2=5.

From the center of mass condition, M1 v1 = M2 v2.

So M1 / M2 = v2 / v1.

v2 is 5, v1 is 10.

So M1 / M2 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2 → which means M2 is twice as massive as M1.

So M1 = 0.5 M2.

So total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

But we can express this in terms of M1: 1.5*(2 M1) )= 3 M1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try to write the masses in terms of each other.

In system_1: M1/M2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2 → M2 = 2 M1.

So, the total mass is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 → which is 1.5 M2.

But since M2 is 2 M1, M_total = 1.5 * 2 M1 = 3 M1. Alternatively, M_total = 1.5 M2 = 1.5*(2 M1) = 3 M1.

Hmm, that's one way. Now, how about Kepler's third law?

Ah, Kepler's third law for binary systems is P² = (4 π² / G) (a³) / (M1 + M2).

But a is the sum of a1 and a2, which are the semi-major axes of the two stars around the center of mass.

But a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a.

Similarly, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a.

But without knowing a, perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, since both systems are eclipsing binaries, their orbital periods are known, and their velocities are known. So, perhaps we can find the mass function for each, and then find the ratio.

The mass function is f(M) = (v1^3 P) / (2 π G), where v1 is the velocity amplitude and P is the orbital period in seconds. But wait, I'm not sure about the units here.

Alternatively, the mass function is: 

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + q)^2 )

But since the system is eclipsing, i is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. So f(M) becomes:

f(M) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + q)^2 )

But since q = M2/M1, 1 + q = (M1 + M2)/M1. So,

f(M) = M2^3 / [ (M1 + M2)^2 * ( (M1 + M2)/M1 )^2 ) ]

Simplify denominator:

(M1+M2)^2 * ( (M1+M2)^2 / M1^2 )

So denominator becomes (M1 + M2)^4 / M1^2.

So,

f(M) = M2^3 * M1^2 / (M1 + M2)^4.

But I'm not sure if that helps me directly.

Wait, another approach: Mass function can also be expressed as f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + q)^2 )

But when i=90, and q = M2/M1, we can express f(M) in terms of known velocities and period.

Alternatively, the mass function is also given by:

f(M) = (v1^3 P ) / (2 π G) 

Where v1 is the velocity of the companion, and P is the orbital period, and G is the gravitational constant.

Wait, but I think the mass function formula is:

f(M) = ( (P day) * (v1 km/s)^3 ) / (245.3 )

But I'm not certain about the exact coefficients. Wait, I think there's a version where f(M) is (v1^3 P)/(2 π G) but in appropriate units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

M_total * sin^3 i = ( (4 π²) / (G P²) ) * (a1 + a2)^3

But since a1 + a2 = a, and a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a, then a1 + a2 = a.

But another way, since v = 2 π a / P, so a = v P / (2 π).

So, a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * (v1 P / (2 π) )

Similarly, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * (v2 P / (2 π) )

But I'm getting stuck in the equations. Maybe I should think about the mass ratio and the period.

The key here is that for each system, we can find the total mass in terms of the velocity and period. Because from Kepler's third law, the total mass is proportional to (a1 + a2)^3 / P^2.

But since a = a1 + a2 = v P / (2 π), because v = 2 π a / P → a = v P / (2 π).

So, a = (v1 P) / (2 π) because a1 + a2 = a, and the velocity of each is proportional to their mass ratio.

Wait, but for each system, the two stars have velocities v1 and v2. So the average velocity is (v1 + v2)/2, but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, the separation a is equal to v1 * P / (2 π) because, for a circular orbit, the orbital circumference is 2 π a, and the star completes this in period P. So, v = 2 π a / P → a = v P / (2 π).

But wait, in reality, each star's velocity is v1 and v2, so their individual orbits have a1 and a2. So, a1 is (v1 * P) / (2 π), and a2 is (v2 * P) / (2 π). And the total separation is a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) P / (2 π).

So, substituting into Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² G⁻¹) * (a)^3 / (M1 + M2).

So,

M1 + M2 = (4 π² G⁻¹) (a)^3 / P².

But a = (v1 + v2) P / (2 π).

So,

a^3 = [ (v1 + v2) P / (2 π) ]^3.

Substituting this back into M_total:

M_total = (4 π² G⁻¹) * [ (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 / (2 π)^3 ) ] / P².

Simplify:

M_total = (4 π² G⁻¹) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3) ) / P^2.

Simplify the exponents:

= (4 π² / (8 π^3 G)) ) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^(3-2).

Simplify 4/8 = 0.5, π²/π^3 = 1/π.

So,

M_total = (0.5) ( (v1 + v2)^3 ) P ) / (G π ).

Wait, but this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure about the units. Maybe I can express the ratio of the masses between the two systems.

So, system_1 has P1 = 2 years, velocities v1a = 10, v1b=5.

System_2: P2=1 year, velocities v2a=15, v2b=10.

We need to find the ratio of their total masses, M1_total / M2_total.

So, let's compute M1 and M2.

M1_total = (4 π² / G) * (a1_total)^3 / (P1^2 ), and similarly for M2.

But a1_total = (v1a + v1b) * P1 / (2 π )

Similarly, a2_total = (v2a + v2b) * P2 / (2 π )

So,

M1_total = (4 π² / G) * [ (10 +5) * 2 / (2 π) ) ]^3 / (2^2 )

M2_total = (4 π² / G) * [ (15 +10) * 1 / (2 π) ) ]^3 / (1^2 )

Let me compute the terms inside the cubed brackets first.

For system_1:

a1 = (15) * 2 / (2 π) ) = (30) / (2 π) ) = 15 / π.

a1^3 = (15/π)^3.

Denominator for M1: 2^2 =4.

So,

M1_total = (4 π² / G) * (15/ π )^3 / 4.

Simplify:

= (4 π² / G) * (3375 ) / ( π^3 * 4 )

= (4 π² ) / (4 G ) ) * 3375 / π^3

= ( π² / G ) * 3375 / π^3

= 3375 / ( G π )

Similarly, for system_2:

a2 = (25) * 1 / (2 π ) = 25/(2 π )

a2^3 = (25/(2 π ))^3 = (15625 ) / (8 π^3 )

Denominator: 1^2 =1.

So,

M2_total = (4 π² / G) * (15625 / (8 π^3 )) ) / 1

= (4 π² * 15625 ) / ( G 8 π^3 )

Simplify:

= (4 *15625 ) / (8 G π )

= (62500 ) / (8 G π )

= 7812.5 / ( G π )

Now, the ratio M1_total / M2_total is:

[3375 / ( G π ) ] / [7812.5 / ( G π ) ]

The G π terms cancel.

= 3375 / 7812.5

= (3375 * 2 ) / (7812.5 * 2 )

Wait, let me compute 3375 / 7812.5.

Hmm, 3375 ÷ 7812.5.

Well, 7812.5 × 0.432 = ?

Wait, 7812.5 × 0.4 = 3125.

Wait, 3375 is 3125 + 250.

3125 is 0.4 ×7812.5.

250 is 0.032 ×7812.5 (because 7812.5 *0.032 = 250).

So, total is 0.432.

Wait, 0.4 ×7812.5 is 3125.

0.03 ×7812.5 = 234.375.

0.002 ×7812.5= 15.625.

So, 0.432 ×7812.5 = 3125 + (0.03 ×7812.5=234.375) + (0.002 ×7812.5=15.625) = 3125 + 234.375=3359.375 +15.625=3375.

Yes, so 3375 ÷7812.5 = 0.432.

So, M1_total / M2_total = 0.432.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B ~0.6. So 0.432 is approximately 0.4, so the answer would be A.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, M1_total = 3375 / ( G π )

M2_total = 7812.5 / ( G π )

So, ratio is 3375 /7812.5.

Compute that:

3375 ÷ 7812.5.

I can write this as (3375 * 100000) / (7812.5 *100000) = 337500000 / 781250000.

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 25: 13500000 / 31250000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 13500 / 31250.

Divide numerator and denominator by 50: 270 / 625.

270 divided by 625.

625 × 0.4 = 250, 625 ×0.432= 270.

Yes, so 270/625 = 0.432.

Hmm, so the ratio is approximately 0.43. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So the ratio is M1_total / M2_total = 0.43.

Which is about 0.4 times. So system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So it is 0.4 times as massive, meaning it's about 25% the mass of system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if the ratio M1/M2 is 0.43, system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive. So the factor is approximately 0.43, which is option A: ~0.4.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 0.4

B) ~ 0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So, the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationships between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total mass in binary star systems.

### Key Information:
1. **System_1**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( v_{1a} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_{1b} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Total velocity: \( v_1 = v_{1a} + v_{1b} = 15 \, \text{km/s} \)

2. **System_2**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( v_{2a} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_{2b} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Total velocity: \( v_2 = v_{2a} + v_{2b} = 25 \, \text{km/s} \)

3. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   The total mass of a binary system is proportional to \( \frac{a^3}{P^2} \), where \( a \) is the orbital separation. Since \( a \propto v \cdot P \), the total mass can be expressed as:
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} \propto \frac{(v \cdot P)^3}{P^2} = v^3 \cdot P
   \]

4. **Mass Ratio**:
   The ratio of the total masses of the two systems is:
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{v_1^3 \cdot P_1}{v_2^3 \cdot P_2}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
   \]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately \( 0.43 \) times as massive as system_2. This corresponds to a factor of \( \sim 0.4 \), as given in option A.

**Answer: A**
