Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them, and the shifts in the spectral lines are given. Planet 1's shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet 2's is 7. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet 2 is compared to Planet 1.

Wait, what do I remember about the radial velocity method? RV detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to move towards and away from us. The shift in wavelength depends on the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

The formula related to this is probably the one involving the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift formula for light is something like (Δλ/λ) = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. But wait, the problem gives the shifts in milliangstroms, which are 5 and 7. Since the shifts are inversely related to the velocity (because a bigger shift means higher velocity), but wait, no, actually a bigger shift in wavelength would mean a larger velocity change. Because if the star is moving more, the spectral lines would shift more. So a 7 milliangstrom shift is larger than 5, meaning the star's velocity variation is higher.

But how does that relate to the planet's orbital period? Or orbital period of the planet?

Wait, the orbital period of the planet is the same as the star's period because they're orbiting each other. So the period of the planet's orbit is the same as the star's wobble period.

The RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / a) * sin(i)

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the RV method equation. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(2/3) ) )

But M_p is much smaller than M_star (since Neptune is much smaller than the Sun), so 1/(1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1. So this simplifies to K ≈ (27 * M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

But maybe another way to express this is using the formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period, the planet's mass, and the star's mass.

Alternatively, I think that the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1 / sqrt(a^3/(G(M_star + M_p))) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach. For circular orbits, the velocity of the star is related to the planet's orbital period and the mass of the planet.

Wait, if I have two planets, both around stars of the same mass (solar mass), same planet mass (Neptune), then the ratio of their K (velocity amplitudes) depends on the orbital period. Because K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period, or something like that.

Wait, another approach: the RV method amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for K is:

K = ( ( (27 * pi ) / (2 * c) ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate (M_star + M_p) as M_star, and (1 + M_p/M_star) as 1. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 pi / (2 c))^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

But sin i is close to 1 since we're detecting the planet, so we can ignore that. So K is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, but both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have the same mass as Neptune. So M_p and M_star are the same for both planets.

Therefore, K_1 / K_2 = (P_2 / P_1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So the velocity amplitude for planet 2 is higher. Wait, because K is higher, which would mean that P is shorter? Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, K is the velocity amplitude. Let me clarify. The star's velocity is highest when the planet is closest, so higher K means higher star velocity, which could be due to a shorter period or a more massive planet, but in this case, masses are same.

So, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is inversely proportional to K^(3).

So P1/P2 = (K2 / K1 )^3

Wait, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3). So P ∝ 1/(K)^(3).

So P1 = (some constant) / K1^3

P2 = (same constant) / K2^3

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, wait:

If K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/K^3. So P2 = (constant) / K2^3 and P1 = (constant)/ K1^3.

Therefore, P2/P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So the ratio of periods (P2/P1) is (K1/K2)^3.

In the problem, K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 =5/7.

So (5/7)^3 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Wait, no. No, the question is, How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So the ratio is P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So P2's period is shorter than P1's. So the period of planet 2 is ~0.36 times that of planet 1. So planet 1's period is longer.

Wait, but wait, maybe I have it reversed. Let me think again. K is the semi-amplitude of velocity.

If K is larger, that could mean a more massive planet or shorter period (since higher velocity due to faster orbit). But in this problem, planet masses are the same. So a higher K implies shorter period. So planet 2 has a larger K than planet 1. So planet 2's period is shorter than planet 1's.

Wait, so the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times longer, which is 36% of P1. So 0.36 times.

So the answer would be option A, 0.36.

But let me double-check the reasoning. Because K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is proportional to (M_p / (M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, when you have K ∝ (M_p / (M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, wait. Let me get the correct formula. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (sin i) / (2π) * (1 / a )

But a is the semi-major axis, so using Kepler's third law, a^3 = [ G (M_star + M_p) P^2 ] / (4 π^2 )

So a = [ G (M_star + M_p) P^2 / (4 π^2) ]^(1/3 )

So substituting a into the K equation:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * sin i / (2 π) * [ 4 π^2 / ( G (M_star + M_p) P^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify this expression:

Let me compute the exponents.

First, factor each term.

The numerator inside the first cube root is G M_p.

The denominator inside the first cube root is (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e^2).

So the first cube root is [ G M_p / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/9) (1 - e^2)^(1/3) )

Then, multiply by sin i/(2 pi), and then multiply by [4 pi^2 / (G (M_star + M_p) P^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the exponents for each factor.

G terms:

(G)^(1/3) from first term,

(G)^(-1/3) from the second term.

So G terms cancel.

M_p terms: (M_p)^(1/3) from first term.

(M_star + M_p) terms:

First term: (M_star + M_p)^(-1/9)

Second term: [ (M_star + M_p) ]^(-1/3 )

So combined: (M_star + M_p)^(-1/9 - 1/3 ) = (M_star + M_p)^(-4/9 )

(1 - e^2) terms: (1 - e^2)^(-1/3) from first term.

sin i term: sin i.

pi terms:

First term: (2 pi)^(-1) = 1/(2 pi )

Second term: (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) = (2^2 pi^2 )^(1/3 ) = 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3)

So combining:

1/(2 pi) ) * 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3 )

= (2^(2/3) ) / (2 pi) ) * pi^(2/3 )

= 2^(2/3 - 1) ) * pi^(2/3 - 1 )

= 2^(-1/3) * pi^(-1/3 )

So putting it all together:

K = [ (M_p)^(1/3) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(4/9) ) (1 - e^2)^(-1/3) ) ] * [ 2^(-1/3) pi^(-1/3) ) ] * sin i

Wait, did I get that right? Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can reorganize.

Alternatively, I can think that for small M_p compared to M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So approximating, we can set M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So then, K becomes:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star )^(1/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (2 pi ) * (4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) )^(1/3 )

Let me compute each part:

The first part: (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(1/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/3) )

The second part: sin i / (2 pi )

The third part: [4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me combine these.

Multiply the first part by the third part:

= [ (G M_p )^(1/3) / M_star^(1/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/3) ) ] * [ (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) ) / ( G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify the G terms:

G^(1/3) in numerator and denominator: (G^(1/3) ) / (G^(1/3) ) ) = 1.

M_p^(1/3) remains.

M_star terms: denominator has M_star^(1/3) * M_star^(1/3) = M_star^(2/3 )

So M_p^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3 )

Similarly, 4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3), pi^(2/3) in numerator, and (1 - e^2)^(-1/3) remains.

Denominator: (1 - e^2)^(1/3) from the first part, wait no, wait:

Wait, first part denominator: (1 - e^2)^(1/3). So when multiplied by the third part, which in the denominator has (1 - e^2)^0, since the third part's denominator comes from [1/(1 - e^2)]^something? Wait no, the third part is [4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) ]^(1/3 ), so it doesn't have (1 - e^2). So I think the (1 - e^2) term is only in the first part.

Wait, let me correct. The first part is [ (G M_p ) / ( M_star (1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think that for circular orbits (e=0), the (1 - e^2) term is 1, so we can ignore it.

So K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / (2 pi ) * (4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) )^(1/3 )

Let me compute this.

First, combine the terms:

( (G M_p ) / M_star )^(1/3 ) * (4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 )) )^(1/3 )

= [ (G M_p) / M_star * 4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (M_p *4 pi^2 ) / ( M_star^2 P^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= (4 pi^2 M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) )

So K is:

(4 pi^2 M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (2 pi )

Simplify:

4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3). pi^(2/3) in numerator, and 2 pi in denominator.

So:

= [2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) M_p^(1/3) ] / [ M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) ] * [ 1/(2 pi ) ]

= (2^(2/3) / 2 ) ) * ( pi^(2/3) / pi ) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) )

= (2^(2/3 -1 )) ) * ( pi^(2/3 -1 )) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) )

2^(2/3 - 1) = 2^(-1/3 ) = 1/(2^(1/3)) ≈ 0.7937.

pi^(2/3 -1 ) = pi^(-1/3) ≈ 1/(1.4646) ≈ 0.681.

So combining constants: 0.7937 * 0.681 ≈ 0.54.

But wait, perhaps it's better to write in exponents.

Alternatively, let me see:

K = (4 pi^2 M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi) )

Simplify the constants:

4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3 )

pi^(2/3) from numerator, divided by pi (from denominator) is pi^(2/3 -1 ) = pi^(-1/3 )

So 2^(2/3) / 2 = 2^(2/3 -1) = 2^(-1/3 )

So:

K = [ 2^(-1/3) * pi^(-1/3) * M_p^(1/3) ) ] / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) )

= [ ( M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) ] * (2 pi )^(-1/3 )

So, K = [ M_p / ( M_star^2 P^2 ) ]^(1/3) ) * (2 pi )^(-1/3 )

But since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, and the stars have same mass, the only varying term is P.

So for the two planets, K1 and K2:

K1 = [ M_p / ( M_star^2 P1^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) * (2 pi )^(-1/3 )

K2 = [ M_p / ( M_star^2 P2^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) * (2 pi )^(-1/3 )

Dividing K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = [ ( P2^2 ) / ( P1^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(2/3 )

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because earlier I thought K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), but now I'm getting K ∝ 1/(P^(2/3) ). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.

Wait, in the formula I derived, K is proportional to ( M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) )

Since M_p and M_star are same, K is proportional to 1/( P^(2/3) )

So K ∝ 1/( P^(2/3) )

So the ratio K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(2/3 )

In the problem, K1 =5, K2=7.

So K1/K2 =5/7.

So (5/7) = (P2/P1 )^(2/3 )

So to find (P2/P1 ), we raise both sides to the power of (3/2):

(P2/P1 ) = (5/7 )^(3/2 )

Wait, (5/7 )^(3/2 ) is equal to (5/7 )^1 * sqrt(5/7 )

Compute 5/7 ≈0.7143.

sqrt(0.7143 )≈ 0.845.

So 0.7143 * 0.845 ≈ 0.605.

Wait, that's about 0.605. So P2 is about 0.6 times P1. So planet 2's period is shorter than planet 1's by a factor of ~0.605.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? 0.605 times as long.

Looking at the options:

Option A is ~0.36, option D is ~0.85.

Hmm, 0.605 is approximately 0.6, which is not an option. But I must have made a mistake in the derivation, perhaps.

Wait a second, earlier I thought K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3) ), but now I'm getting K ∝ 1/(P^(2/3) )

Which is correct? Let me think.

Wait, in the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(2/3 ), so K ∝ 1/P^(2/3 )

So when P increases, K decreases.

So, for two planets with same M_p and M_star, if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then K2 > K1. So K2 is larger, implying that P2 is smaller than P1.

So K1/K2 =5/7= (P2/P1 )^(2/3 )

To solve for P2/P1:

Take both sides to the power of 3/2.

(5/7 )^(3/2 ) = P2/P1.

Compute (5/7 )^3 = 125/343 ≈0.364. Then take square root: sqrt(0.364 )≈0.603.

So P2/P1 ≈0.603.

So P2 is about 0.6 times as long as P1.

But looking at the options, none exactly match. The options are A: ~0.36, B: ~1.40, C: ~1.96, D: ~0.85.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when I have K1/K2 =5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(2/3 )

So, (P2/P1 ) = (5/7 )^(3/2 )

Wait, (5/7 )^(3/2 ) is same as (5^3 /7^3 )^(1/2 ) = (125/343 )^(1/2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.364) ≈ 0.603.

So that's about 0.603. So the ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.603, which is about 0.6, which is not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: the RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's orbital period.

The formula connecting K, period P, mass of planet M_p, and mass of star M_star is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(sqrt(a^3/(G M_star))) ) )

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe another approach.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and for circular orbits, e=0, so (1 - e^2)^(1/2) =1.

So K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So K ∝ 1 / ( P^(1/3) )

Because M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So K1 =5, K2=7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (5/7 )^3 = P2/P1.

5/7 is approximately 0.714, cubed is 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

Thus, planet 2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet 1.

So the answer would be option A: ~0.36.

Wait, that makes sense now. Earlier, I thought K was proportional to 1/(P^(2/3) ), which would give a different result, but perhaps I made a mistake in that derivation.

But with this formula, K is proportional to 1/( P^(1/3) ), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So yes, that would make P2/P1 = (5/7 )^3 ≈0.364.

Thus, the correct answer is A) ~0.36.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's motion due to the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), given by the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) is related to the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

To solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \), raise both sides to the power of \( 3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (~0.36):** Matches the calculated value of \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364 \).
- **Option B (~1.40):** Incorrect, as it suggests \( P_2 \) is longer than \( P_1 \), which contradicts the inverse relationship between \( K \) and \( P \).
- **Option C (~1.96):** Incorrect, as it also suggests \( P_2 \) is longer than \( P_1 \).
- **Option D (~0.85):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.

### Final Answer:
The orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them, and the shifts in the spectral lines are given. Planet 1's shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet 2's is 7. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet 2 is compared to Planet 1.

Wait, what do I remember about the radial velocity method? RV detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to move towards and away from us. The shift in wavelength depends on the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

The formula related to this is probably the one involving the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift formula for light is something like (Δλ/λ) = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. But wait, the problem gives the shifts in milliangstroms, which are 5 and 7. Since the shifts are inversely related to the velocity (because a bigger shift means higher velocity), but wait, no, actually a bigger shift in wavelength would mean a larger velocity change. Because if the star is moving more, the spectral lines would shift more. So a 7 milliangstrom shift is larger than 5, meaning the star's velocity variation is higher.

But how does that relate to the planet's orbital period? Or orbital period of the planet?

Wait, the orbital period of the planet is the same as the star's period because they're orbiting each other. So the period of the planet's orbit is the same as the star's wobble period.

The RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / a) * sin(i)

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the RV method equation. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(2/3) ) )

But M_p is much smaller than M_star (since Neptune is much smaller than the Sun), so 1/(1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1. So this simplifies to K ≈ (27 * M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

But maybe another way to express this is using the formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period, the planet's mass, and the star's mass.

Alternatively, I think that the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1 / sqrt(a^3/(G(M_star + M_p))) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach. For circular orbits, the velocity of the star is related to the planet's orbital period and the mass of the planet.

Wait, if I have two planets, both around stars of the same mass (solar mass), same planet mass (Neptune), then the ratio of their K (velocity amplitudes) depends on the orbital period. Because K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period, or something like that.

Wait, another approach: the RV method amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for K is:

K = ( ( (27 * pi ) / (2 * c) ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate (M_star + M_p) as M_star, and (1 + M_p/M_star) as 1. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 pi / (2 c))^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

But sin i is close to 1 since we're detecting the planet, so we can ignore that. So K is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, but both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have the same mass as Neptune. So M_p and M_star are the same for both planets.

Therefore, K_1 / K_2 = (P_2 / P_1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So the velocity amplitude for planet 2 is higher. Wait, because K is higher, which would mean that P is shorter? Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, K is the velocity amplitude. Let me clarify. The star's velocity is highest when the planet is closest, so higher K means higher star velocity, which could be due to a shorter period or a more massive planet, but in this case, masses are same.

So, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is inversely proportional to K^(3).

So P1/P2 = (K2 / K1 )^3

Wait, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3). So P ∝ 1/(K)^(3).

So P1 = (some constant) / K1^3

P2 = (same constant) / K2^3

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, wait:

If K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/K^3. So P2 = (constant) / K2^3 and P1 = (constant)/ K1^3.

Therefore, P2/P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So the ratio of periods (P2/P1) is (K1/K2)^3.

In the problem, K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 =5/7.

So (5/7)^3 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Wait, no. No, the question is, How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So the ratio is P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So P2's period is shorter than P1's. So the period of planet 2 is ~0.36 times that of planet 1. So planet 1's period is longer.

Wait, but wait, maybe I have it reversed. Let me think again. K is the semi-amplitude of velocity.

If K is larger, that could mean a more massive planet or shorter period (since higher velocity due to faster orbit). But in this problem, planet masses are the same. So a higher K implies shorter period. So planet 2 has a larger K than planet 1. So planet 2's period is shorter than planet 1's.

Wait, so the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times longer, which is 36% of P1. So 0.36 times.

So the answer would be option A, 0.36.

But let me double-check the reasoning. Because K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is proportional to (M_p / (M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, when you have K ∝ (M_p / (M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, wait. Let me get the correct formula. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (sin i) / (2π) * (1 / a )

But a is the semi-major axis, so using Kepler's third law, a^3 = [ G (M_star + M_p) P^2 ] / (4 π^2 )

So a = [ G (M_star + M_p) P^2 / (4 π^2) ]^(1/3 )

So substituting a into the K equation:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * sin i / (2 π) * [ 4 π^2 / ( G (M_star + M_p) P^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify this expression:

Let me compute the exponents.

First, factor each term.

The numerator inside the first cube root is G M_p.

The denominator inside the first cube root is (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e^2).

So the first cube root is [ G M_p / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/9) (1 - e^2)^(1/3) )

Then, multiply by sin i/(2 pi), and then multiply by [4 pi^2 / (G (M_star + M_p) P^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the exponents for each factor.

G terms:

(G)^(1/3) from first term,

(G)^(-1/3) from the second term.

So G terms cancel.

M_p terms: (M_p)^(1/3) from first term.

(M_star + M_p) terms:

First term: (M_star + M_p)^(-1/9)

Second term: [ (M_star + M_p) ]^(-1/3 )

So combined: (M_star + M_p)^(-1/9 - 1/3 ) = (M_star + M_p)^(-4/9 )

(1 - e^2) terms: (1 - e^2)^(-1/3) from first term.

sin i term: sin i.

pi terms:

First term: (2 pi)^(-1) = 1/(2 pi )

Second term: (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) = (2^2 pi^2 )^(1/3 ) = 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3)

So combining:

1/(2 pi) ) * 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3 )

= (2^(2/3) ) / (2 pi) ) * pi^(2/3 )

= 2^(2/3 - 1) ) * pi^(2/3 - 1 )

= 2^(-1/3) * pi^(-1/3 )

So putting it all together:

K = [ (M_p)^(1/3) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(4/9) ) (1 - e^2)^(-1/3) ) ] * [ 2^(-1/3) pi^(-1/3) ) ] * sin i

Wait, did I get that right? Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can reorganize.

Alternatively, I can think that for small M_p compared to M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So approximating, we can set M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So then, K becomes:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star )^(1/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (2 pi ) * (4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) )^(1/3 )

Let me compute each part:

The first part: (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(1/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/3) )

The second part: sin i / (2 pi )

The third part: [4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me combine these.

Multiply the first part by the third part:

= [ (G M_p )^(1/3) / M_star^(1/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/3) ) ] * [ (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) ) / ( G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify the G terms:

G^(1/3) in numerator and denominator: (G^(1/3) ) / (G^(1/3) ) ) = 1.

M_p^(1/3) remains.

M_star terms: denominator has M_star^(1/3) * M_star^(1/3) = M_star^(2/3 )

So M_p^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3 )

Similarly, 4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3), pi^(2/3) in numerator, and (1 - e^2)^(-1/3) remains.

Denominator: (1 - e^2)^(1/3) from the first part, wait no, wait:

Wait, first part denominator: (1 - e^2)^(1/3). So when multiplied by the third part, which in the denominator has (1 - e^2)^0, since the third part's denominator comes from [1/(1 - e^2)]^something? Wait no, the third part is [4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) ]^(1/3 ), so it doesn't have (1 - e^2). So I think the (1 - e^2) term is only in the first part.

Wait, let me correct. The first part is [ (G M_p ) / ( M_star (1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think that for circular orbits (e=0), the (1 - e^2) term is 1, so we can ignore it.

So K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / (2 pi ) * (4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) )^(1/3 )

Let me compute this.

First, combine the terms:

( (G M_p ) / M_star )^(1/3 ) * (4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 )) )^(1/3 )

= [ (G M_p) / M_star * 4 pi^2 / ( G M_star P^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (M_p *4 pi^2 ) / ( M_star^2 P^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= (4 pi^2 M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) )

So K is:

(4 pi^2 M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (2 pi )

Simplify:

4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3). pi^(2/3) in numerator, and 2 pi in denominator.

So:

= [2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) M_p^(1/3) ] / [ M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) ] * [ 1/(2 pi ) ]

= (2^(2/3) / 2 ) ) * ( pi^(2/3) / pi ) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) )

= (2^(2/3 -1 )) ) * ( pi^(2/3 -1 )) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) )

2^(2/3 - 1) = 2^(-1/3 ) = 1/(2^(1/3)) ≈ 0.7937.

pi^(2/3 -1 ) = pi^(-1/3) ≈ 1/(1.4646) ≈ 0.681.

So combining constants: 0.7937 * 0.681 ≈ 0.54.

But wait, perhaps it's better to write in exponents.

Alternatively, let me see:

K = (4 pi^2 M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi) )

Simplify the constants:

4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3 )

pi^(2/3) from numerator, divided by pi (from denominator) is pi^(2/3 -1 ) = pi^(-1/3 )

So 2^(2/3) / 2 = 2^(2/3 -1) = 2^(-1/3 )

So:

K = [ 2^(-1/3) * pi^(-1/3) * M_p^(1/3) ) ] / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) )

= [ ( M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) ] * (2 pi )^(-1/3 )

So, K = [ M_p / ( M_star^2 P^2 ) ]^(1/3) ) * (2 pi )^(-1/3 )

But since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, and the stars have same mass, the only varying term is P.

So for the two planets, K1 and K2:

K1 = [ M_p / ( M_star^2 P1^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) * (2 pi )^(-1/3 )

K2 = [ M_p / ( M_star^2 P2^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) * (2 pi )^(-1/3 )

Dividing K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = [ ( P2^2 ) / ( P1^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(2/3 )

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because earlier I thought K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), but now I'm getting K ∝ 1/(P^(2/3) ). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.

Wait, in the formula I derived, K is proportional to ( M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(2/3) ) )

Since M_p and M_star are same, K is proportional to 1/( P^(2/3) )

So K ∝ 1/( P^(2/3) )

So the ratio K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(2/3 )

In the problem, K1 =5, K2=7.

So K1/K2 =5/7.

So (5/7) = (P2/P1 )^(2/3 )

So to find (P2/P1 ), we raise both sides to the power of (3/2):

(P2/P1 ) = (5/7 )^(3/2 )

Wait, (5/7 )^(3/2 ) is equal to (5/7 )^1 * sqrt(5/7 )

Compute 5/7 ≈0.7143.

sqrt(0.7143 )≈ 0.845.

So 0.7143 * 0.845 ≈ 0.605.

Wait, that's about 0.605. So P2 is about 0.6 times P1. So planet 2's period is shorter than planet 1's by a factor of ~0.605.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? 0.605 times as long.

Looking at the options:

Option A is ~0.36, option D is ~0.85.

Hmm, 0.605 is approximately 0.6, which is not an option. But I must have made a mistake in the derivation, perhaps.

Wait a second, earlier I thought K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3) ), but now I'm getting K ∝ 1/(P^(2/3) )

Which is correct? Let me think.

Wait, in the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(2/3 ), so K ∝ 1/P^(2/3 )

So when P increases, K decreases.

So, for two planets with same M_p and M_star, if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then K2 > K1. So K2 is larger, implying that P2 is smaller than P1.

So K1/K2 =5/7= (P2/P1 )^(2/3 )

To solve for P2/P1:

Take both sides to the power of 3/2.

(5/7 )^(3/2 ) = P2/P1.

Compute (5/7 )^3 = 125/343 ≈0.364. Then take square root: sqrt(0.364 )≈0.603.

So P2/P1 ≈0.603.

So P2 is about 0.6 times as long as P1.

But looking at the options, none exactly match. The options are A: ~0.36, B: ~1.40, C: ~1.96, D: ~0.85.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when I have K1/K2 =5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(2/3 )

So, (P2/P1 ) = (5/7 )^(3/2 )

Wait, (5/7 )^(3/2 ) is same as (5^3 /7^3 )^(1/2 ) = (125/343 )^(1/2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.364) ≈ 0.603.

So that's about 0.603. So the ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.603, which is about 0.6, which is not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: the RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's orbital period.

The formula connecting K, period P, mass of planet M_p, and mass of star M_star is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(sqrt(a^3/(G M_star))) ) )

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe another approach.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and for circular orbits, e=0, so (1 - e^2)^(1/2) =1.

So K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So K ∝ 1 / ( P^(1/3) )

Because M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So K1 =5, K2=7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (5/7 )^3 = P2/P1.

5/7 is approximately 0.714, cubed is 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

Thus, planet 2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet 1.

So the answer would be option A: ~0.36.

Wait, that makes sense now. Earlier, I thought K was proportional to 1/(P^(2/3) ), which would give a different result, but perhaps I made a mistake in that derivation.

But with this formula, K is proportional to 1/( P^(1/3) ), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So yes, that would make P2/P1 = (5/7 )^3 ≈0.364.

Thus, the correct answer is A) ~0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's motion due to the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), given by the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) is related to the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

To solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \), raise both sides to the power of \( 3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (~0.36):** Matches the calculated value of \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364 \).
- **Option B (~1.40):** Incorrect, as it suggests \( P_2 \) is longer than \( P_1 \), which contradicts the inverse relationship between \( K \) and \( P \).
- **Option C (~1.96):** Incorrect, as it also suggests \( P_2 \) is longer than \( P_1 \).
- **Option D (~0.85):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.

### Final Answer:
The orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1.

**Answer: A**
