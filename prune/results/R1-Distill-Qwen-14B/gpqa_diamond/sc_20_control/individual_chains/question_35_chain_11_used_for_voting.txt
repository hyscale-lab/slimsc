Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, first, I need to write down the matrix Ay.

Wait, the problem says Ay = c·S. So let's compute that. Since c is h/(4π), Ay would be [0, -i*(h/4π)] in the first row, and [i*(h/4π), 0] in the second row. Alternatively, maybe I should factor that in. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0          -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0          ]

Hmm, okay. Now I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and a is the eigenvalue.

So let's set up the matrix Ay - aI:

[ -a          -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  -a          ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating that, determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So that term is (h^2/(16 π²)) * 1. So determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a can be ± h/(4 π). Oh, but wait, wait. Wait a second, no, because when you compute (-i)(i), you have (-i)*i = -i². i squared is -1, so -i² is -(-1) = 1. So the term is 1*(h²/(16 π²)).

So the equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait! I think I might have made a mistake. Because the matrix S is given, and Ay = c·S. So S itself is a matrix, and perhaps it's related to the Pauli matrices. Oh! Wait a minute, Pauli matrices. Let me think again.

S is given as:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Wait, that's actually the form of the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, right? Because the Pauli Y matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Yes, so S is equal to the Pauli Y matrix. So, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but wait, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, right? Because the Pauli matrices are dimensionless. But in this case, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1, and then Ay is c multiplied by S, so the eigenvalues would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S.

Wait, wait no. Let me think again. The eigenvalues of S (Pauli Y) are ±1. So when you multiply S by c, the eigenvalues become c * (±1) → ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues would be h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π).

Looking back at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±2πh and real parts of ±h/(4π). That seems off because the eigenvalues I calculated are real: ±h/(4π). So A's eigenvalues would have imaginary parts, which can't be right because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, let me check the matrix of Ay. The matrix is:

[ 0          -i c ]
[ i c         0  ]

Since c is real, the (1,2) element is -i c, and the (2,1) is i c. The conjugate transpose would swap these, but with i and -i. So the conjugate transpose of Ay is:

[ 0       i c ]
[ -i c    0 ]

Which is not the same as Ay. So unless c is zero, which it isn't, Ay is not Hermitian. Wait, that can't be right. Because angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, probably I made a mistake in representing the matrix S. Let me think again. The matrix S given is:

0 -i

i 0

Which is the same as the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, right? Because Pauli Y is usually written as:

0 -i

i 0 

Wait, no, wait. No, wait! Pauli Y is actually:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Which is exactly the matrix S in this problem. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1, but for spin systems, the spin matrices are (σ/2), so the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, wait. The spin matrices S are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, for example, S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. So in this case, S is the Pauli matrix σ_y, so Ay = c * S = c σ_y.

Wait, but in the problem, S is defined as the matrix given, which is σ_y. So S is σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay = c * σ_y, so its eigenvalues are c * (±1) → ±c. Since c = h/(4 π), the eigenvalues would be ± h/(4 π).

But wait, earlier I thought about S being the Pauli Y matrix, but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps S is (σ_y) as given, so when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues are ±c.

Wait, but the problem says that Ay is c times S, so each eigenvalue of S is multiplied by c. So if S has eigenvalues ±1, then Ay has eigenvalues ±c, which is ± h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are real, not complex.

Looking back at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±2πh. That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So option A is wrong. Similarly, option B's eigenvalues are ±1/2 and ±1, which seems off because c is h/(4π), which is a real number but not necessarily in the range of ±1/2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the matrix wrong. Let me recompute the eigenvalues. Let's write the matrix Ay again.

Ay = c * S, where S is:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

So c is h/(4 π). So:

Ay = [ 0       -i (h/(4π)) ]
      [ i (h/(4π)) 0 ]

So to find the eigenvalues, we compute the determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

Matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a       -i (h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π))  -a      ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i (h/(4π)))(i (h/(4π))) ) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i * i) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

Compute the second term: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (1 * h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

So the eigenvalues are real: ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues have zero imaginary parts. Therefore, any option suggesting the eigenvalues have imaginary components must be incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Im eigenvalues ±2πh. No, because eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2. Also wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Hmm, because A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. Since for any angular momentum component, the eigenfunctions of one component are not eigenfunctions of another unless they are in the same state, but generally, eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. But what about A²? A² is the Casimir operator, so it commutes with all components, so the eigenfunctions of Ay would indeed be eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct, but the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay and Az are different, except for m=0 states, but in this case, since the matrix is 2x2, perhaps it's spin-½, so the eigenfunctions of Ay would have eigenvalues of Ay, but not of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That sounds correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions would be the eigenvectors, which are the eigenfunctions. So I'm not sure about this. It depends on the context. The eigenvectors form a basis for the space, but the question is whether they are the basis functions of Ay. Not entirely sure, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's think about each option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay form a basis for the vector space, but the "basis functions of the matrix operator" might not be the right way to put it. Or perhaps the matrix is 2x2, so the basis would be the eigenvectors. So D is correct in that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. Hmm, but perhaps that's not the right way to think about it. I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay will share eigenfunctions with A², which is the total angular momentum squared. Because A² commutes with Ay, so they can be simultaneously diagonalized.

Wait, for spin-½ particles, the total angular momentum J² commutes with each component Jx, Jy, Jz, so the eigenstates of Jx are also eigenstates of J². So if A is analogous to J, then the same applies here. So the eigenfunctions of Ay would indeed be eigenfunctions of A². But for different components like Az, they would not share eigenfunctions unless in specific cases.

So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Alternatively, let's think about the eigenvectors. Let's compute them. For Ay, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). Let's find the eigenvectors for each.

For a = h/(4 π):

The matrix is Ay - a I:

[ -h/(4 π)   -i h/(4 π) ]
[ i h/(4 π)   -h/(4 π) ]

So the equations:

(-h/(4 π)) φ1 + (-i h/(4 π)) φ2 = 0 → φ1 = (-i φ2 )

So the eigenvector can be written as [ -i φ2, φ2 ]^T. Let's take φ2 = 1, then the eigenvector is ( -i, 1 )^T. To make it a unit vector, perhaps we can normalize it, but since we're just looking for the form, that's sufficient.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4 π):

The matrix is:

[ h/(4 π)   -i h/(4 π) ]
[ i h/(4 π)   h/(4 π) ]

The equations:

(h/(4 π)) φ1 + (-i h/(4 π)) φ2 = 0 → φ1 = i φ2.

So the eigenvector is (i, 1)^T. Again, unit vectors would require normalization.

So the eigenvectors are ( -i, 1 ) and (i, 1 ). Let me check if these are orthogonal. Their inner product is (-i)(i) + (1)(1 ) → ( (-i)(i) ) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So 1 + 1 = 2. Not orthogonal? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the inner product is (-i)(i) + (1)(1) → (-i * i) is - (i^2 ) → - (-1) = +1. So 1 + 1 = 2. So the inner product is 2, but for orthonormal vectors, the inner product should be zero. So I must have made a mistake in normalization.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvectors are not normalized. Let me compute the normalization. For the first eigenvector ( -i, 1 ), the inner product with itself is ( (-i)(i) ) + (1)(1) → (-i^2) +1 → 1 +1 = 2. So to normalize, we divide by sqrt(2): [ (-i, 1) ] / sqrt(2).

Similarly for the other eigenvector (i, 1), the inner product is (i)(-i) + (1)(1) → (-i^2) + 1 = 1 +1=2. So same as above.

So the normalized eigenvectors are [ (-i, 1) ] / sqrt(2) and [ (i, 1) ] / sqrt(2).

Now, considering that, let's look back at the options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. The basis functions of the operator would refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, that's correct. So D would be correct in that sense.

But wait, let me think about the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions can be the same. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, any operator's eigenvectors form a basis (if they are diagonalizable), so D is correct as well. But perhaps the statement is more about whether the basis used is the same as the operator's basis.

Hmm, but let me re-examine the options:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is, the eigenvectors form the basis for the operator. So yes, because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are two linearly independent vectors, they form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but then the options can't have both C and D correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of them.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps only one option is correct.

Looking again, option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct, because A² commutes with Ay.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the matrix Ay acts on these eigenfunctions, and when represented in this basis, the matrix is diagonal. So yes, they are the basis functions for Ay. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option D because it's correct, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the options again.

But wait, let me look at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Which is correct? Let's go back.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of an operator form a basis for the vector space. So the matrix operator Ay has those eigenvectors as its basis. So D is correct.

But then, looking back at the problem, the options are given, and only one is correct. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² is the square of the intrinsic angular momentum, which is S·S in this case. So A² is (S_x^2 + S_y^2 + S_z^2). Therefore, A² commutes with each S_i, so the eigenfunctions of S_y (Ay) are also eigenfunctions of A². However, they are not eigenfunctions of S_z, because S_z has different eigenstates. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis, so the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. So D is also correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. That is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But the options are presented as possible statements, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should revisit the problem. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Let's think about option D: the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is, the matrix can be expressed in terms of these basis functions. Since Ay is diagonal in its eigenbasis, the matrix in that basis is diagonal with the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the statement is correct.

But wait, perhaps the answer is option C. Let me think. Since the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation, perhaps the correct choice is C, because when we have an eigenvalue equation, the eigenfunctions are orthogonal, and they can belong to multiple commuting operators. So option C is correct.

So to sum up, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are out because their eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts.

Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, but perhaps the wording is a bit off, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the calculation would show that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( a \) is the eigenvalue. Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) becomes:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{pmatrix} -a & -i c \\ i c & -a \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a^2 - (c^2).
\]

Setting \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), we find:

\[
a^2 = c^2 \implies a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. This eliminates options A and B, as they incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as having imaginary parts.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -\frac{h}{4\pi} & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -\frac{h}{4\pi} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first row, \( -\frac{h}{4\pi} \phi_1 - i \frac{h}{4\pi} \phi_2 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( \phi_1 = -i \phi_2 \). Taking \( \phi_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\phi = \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), a similar calculation gives the eigenvector:

\[
\phi = \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

These eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, meaning the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can indeed serve as the basis functions of the operator \( A_y \). This makes option D correct.

### Step 3: Commutativity and Simultaneous Eigenfunctions
The operator \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), as \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components of angular momentum. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This confirms the correctness of option C.

### Step 4: Final Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are real, not complex.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \pm 1 \).
- **Option C**: Correct, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
- **Option D**: Correct, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the operator \( A_y \).

Since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, the best choice is **C**, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), which is central to the problem.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, first, I need to write down the matrix Ay.

Wait, the problem says Ay = c·S. So let's compute that. Since c is h/(4π), Ay would be [0, -i*(h/4π)] in the first row, and [i*(h/4π), 0] in the second row. Alternatively, maybe I should factor that in. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0          -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0          ]

Hmm, okay. Now I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and a is the eigenvalue.

So let's set up the matrix Ay - aI:

[ -a          -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  -a          ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating that, determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So that term is (h^2/(16 π²)) * 1. So determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a can be ± h/(4 π). Oh, but wait, wait. Wait a second, no, because when you compute (-i)(i), you have (-i)*i = -i². i squared is -1, so -i² is -(-1) = 1. So the term is 1*(h²/(16 π²)).

So the equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait! I think I might have made a mistake. Because the matrix S is given, and Ay = c·S. So S itself is a matrix, and perhaps it's related to the Pauli matrices. Oh! Wait a minute, Pauli matrices. Let me think again.

S is given as:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Wait, that's actually the form of the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, right? Because the Pauli Y matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Yes, so S is equal to the Pauli Y matrix. So, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but wait, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, right? Because the Pauli matrices are dimensionless. But in this case, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1, and then Ay is c multiplied by S, so the eigenvalues would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S.

Wait, wait no. Let me think again. The eigenvalues of S (Pauli Y) are ±1. So when you multiply S by c, the eigenvalues become c * (±1) → ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues would be h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π).

Looking back at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±2πh and real parts of ±h/(4π). That seems off because the eigenvalues I calculated are real: ±h/(4π). So A's eigenvalues would have imaginary parts, which can't be right because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, let me check the matrix of Ay. The matrix is:

[ 0          -i c ]
[ i c         0  ]

Since c is real, the (1,2) element is -i c, and the (2,1) is i c. The conjugate transpose would swap these, but with i and -i. So the conjugate transpose of Ay is:

[ 0       i c ]
[ -i c    0 ]

Which is not the same as Ay. So unless c is zero, which it isn't, Ay is not Hermitian. Wait, that can't be right. Because angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, probably I made a mistake in representing the matrix S. Let me think again. The matrix S given is:

0 -i

i 0

Which is the same as the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, right? Because Pauli Y is usually written as:

0 -i

i 0 

Wait, no, wait. No, wait! Pauli Y is actually:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Which is exactly the matrix S in this problem. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1, but for spin systems, the spin matrices are (σ/2), so the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, wait. The spin matrices S are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, for example, S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. So in this case, S is the Pauli matrix σ_y, so Ay = c * S = c σ_y.

Wait, but in the problem, S is defined as the matrix given, which is σ_y. So S is σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay = c * σ_y, so its eigenvalues are c * (±1) → ±c. Since c = h/(4 π), the eigenvalues would be ± h/(4 π).

But wait, earlier I thought about S being the Pauli Y matrix, but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps S is (σ_y) as given, so when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues are ±c.

Wait, but the problem says that Ay is c times S, so each eigenvalue of S is multiplied by c. So if S has eigenvalues ±1, then Ay has eigenvalues ±c, which is ± h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are real, not complex.

Looking back at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±2πh. That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So option A is wrong. Similarly, option B's eigenvalues are ±1/2 and ±1, which seems off because c is h/(4π), which is a real number but not necessarily in the range of ±1/2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the matrix wrong. Let me recompute the eigenvalues. Let's write the matrix Ay again.

Ay = c * S, where S is:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

So c is h/(4 π). So:

Ay = [ 0       -i (h/(4π)) ]
      [ i (h/(4π)) 0 ]

So to find the eigenvalues, we compute the determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

Matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a       -i (h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π))  -a      ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i (h/(4π)))(i (h/(4π))) ) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i * i) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

Compute the second term: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (1 * h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

So the eigenvalues are real: ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues have zero imaginary parts. Therefore, any option suggesting the eigenvalues have imaginary components must be incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Im eigenvalues ±2πh. No, because eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2. Also wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Hmm, because A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. Since for any angular momentum component, the eigenfunctions of one component are not eigenfunctions of another unless they are in the same state, but generally, eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. But what about A²? A² is the Casimir operator, so it commutes with all components, so the eigenfunctions of Ay would indeed be eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct, but the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay and Az are different, except for m=0 states, but in this case, since the matrix is 2x2, perhaps it's spin-½, so the eigenfunctions of Ay would have eigenvalues of Ay, but not of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That sounds correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions would be the eigenvectors, which are the eigenfunctions. So I'm not sure about this. It depends on the context. The eigenvectors form a basis for the space, but the question is whether they are the basis functions of Ay. Not entirely sure, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's think about each option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay form a basis for the vector space, but the "basis functions of the matrix operator" might not be the right way to put it. Or perhaps the matrix is 2x2, so the basis would be the eigenvectors. So D is correct in that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. Hmm, but perhaps that's not the right way to think about it. I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay will share eigenfunctions with A², which is the total angular momentum squared. Because A² commutes with Ay, so they can be simultaneously diagonalized.

Wait, for spin-½ particles, the total angular momentum J² commutes with each component Jx, Jy, Jz, so the eigenstates of Jx are also eigenstates of J². So if A is analogous to J, then the same applies here. So the eigenfunctions of Ay would indeed be eigenfunctions of A². But for different components like Az, they would not share eigenfunctions unless in specific cases.

So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Alternatively, let's think about the eigenvectors. Let's compute them. For Ay, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). Let's find the eigenvectors for each.

For a = h/(4 π):

The matrix is Ay - a I:

[ -h/(4 π)   -i h/(4 π) ]
[ i h/(4 π)   -h/(4 π) ]

So the equations:

(-h/(4 π)) φ1 + (-i h/(4 π)) φ2 = 0 → φ1 = (-i φ2 )

So the eigenvector can be written as [ -i φ2, φ2 ]^T. Let's take φ2 = 1, then the eigenvector is ( -i, 1 )^T. To make it a unit vector, perhaps we can normalize it, but since we're just looking for the form, that's sufficient.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4 π):

The matrix is:

[ h/(4 π)   -i h/(4 π) ]
[ i h/(4 π)   h/(4 π) ]

The equations:

(h/(4 π)) φ1 + (-i h/(4 π)) φ2 = 0 → φ1 = i φ2.

So the eigenvector is (i, 1)^T. Again, unit vectors would require normalization.

So the eigenvectors are ( -i, 1 ) and (i, 1 ). Let me check if these are orthogonal. Their inner product is (-i)(i) + (1)(1 ) → ( (-i)(i) ) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So 1 + 1 = 2. Not orthogonal? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the inner product is (-i)(i) + (1)(1) → (-i * i) is - (i^2 ) → - (-1) = +1. So 1 + 1 = 2. So the inner product is 2, but for orthonormal vectors, the inner product should be zero. So I must have made a mistake in normalization.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvectors are not normalized. Let me compute the normalization. For the first eigenvector ( -i, 1 ), the inner product with itself is ( (-i)(i) ) + (1)(1) → (-i^2) +1 → 1 +1 = 2. So to normalize, we divide by sqrt(2): [ (-i, 1) ] / sqrt(2).

Similarly for the other eigenvector (i, 1), the inner product is (i)(-i) + (1)(1) → (-i^2) + 1 = 1 +1=2. So same as above.

So the normalized eigenvectors are [ (-i, 1) ] / sqrt(2) and [ (i, 1) ] / sqrt(2).

Now, considering that, let's look back at the options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. The basis functions of the operator would refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, that's correct. So D would be correct in that sense.

But wait, let me think about the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions can be the same. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, any operator's eigenvectors form a basis (if they are diagonalizable), so D is correct as well. But perhaps the statement is more about whether the basis used is the same as the operator's basis.

Hmm, but let me re-examine the options:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is, the eigenvectors form the basis for the operator. So yes, because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are two linearly independent vectors, they form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but then the options can't have both C and D correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of them.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps only one option is correct.

Looking again, option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct, because A² commutes with Ay.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the matrix Ay acts on these eigenfunctions, and when represented in this basis, the matrix is diagonal. So yes, they are the basis functions for Ay. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option D because it's correct, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the options again.

But wait, let me look at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Which is correct? Let's go back.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of an operator form a basis for the vector space. So the matrix operator Ay has those eigenvectors as its basis. So D is correct.

But then, looking back at the problem, the options are given, and only one is correct. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² is the square of the intrinsic angular momentum, which is S·S in this case. So A² is (S_x^2 + S_y^2 + S_z^2). Therefore, A² commutes with each S_i, so the eigenfunctions of S_y (Ay) are also eigenfunctions of A². However, they are not eigenfunctions of S_z, because S_z has different eigenstates. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis, so the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. So D is also correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. That is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But the options are presented as possible statements, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should revisit the problem. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Let's think about option D: the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is, the matrix can be expressed in terms of these basis functions. Since Ay is diagonal in its eigenbasis, the matrix in that basis is diagonal with the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the statement is correct.

But wait, perhaps the answer is option C. Let me think. Since the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation, perhaps the correct choice is C, because when we have an eigenvalue equation, the eigenfunctions are orthogonal, and they can belong to multiple commuting operators. So option C is correct.

So to sum up, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are out because their eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts.

Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, but perhaps the wording is a bit off, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the calculation would show that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( a \) is the eigenvalue. Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) becomes:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{pmatrix} -a & -i c \\ i c & -a \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a^2 - (c^2).
\]

Setting \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), we find:

\[
a^2 = c^2 \implies a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. This eliminates options A and B, as they incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as having imaginary parts.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -\frac{h}{4\pi} & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -\frac{h}{4\pi} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first row, \( -\frac{h}{4\pi} \phi_1 - i \frac{h}{4\pi} \phi_2 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( \phi_1 = -i \phi_2 \). Taking \( \phi_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\phi = \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), a similar calculation gives the eigenvector:

\[
\phi = \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

These eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, meaning the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can indeed serve as the basis functions of the operator \( A_y \). This makes option D correct.

### Step 3: Commutativity and Simultaneous Eigenfunctions
The operator \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), as \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components of angular momentum. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This confirms the correctness of option C.

### Step 4: Final Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are real, not complex.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \pm 1 \).
- **Option C**: Correct, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
- **Option D**: Correct, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the operator \( A_y \).

Since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, the best choice is **C**, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), which is central to the problem.
