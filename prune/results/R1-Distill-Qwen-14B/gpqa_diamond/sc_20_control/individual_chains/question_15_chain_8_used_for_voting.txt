Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet is more likely to transit, between Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose the one with the higher probability because they have limited time. Let's think through the details.

Both planets have the same minimum mass, so their masses are equal. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1 has P/3. That probably means Planet_1 is closer to its star since orbital period relates to distance.

Wait, the host stars are different too. The star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, same radius but different masses. I remember that more massive stars are usually larger, but here they evolved in a way that their radii are the same. Interesting. So the host star of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius.

Now, transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But without knowing the exact orientation, it's probabilistic. The probability of a transit is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, since the planets have the same mass, their radii might be similar? Or maybe they're Earth-like, so similar in size. Let's assume R_planet is the same for both.

But wait, no. The transit probability formula is actually 2 * (R_star + R_planet) / a. Because the planet can cross the star's disk from either side. But more accurately, the probability is (2 * R_star) / a, assuming planet radius is much smaller than star, which is the case for Earth-like planets. Since Earth's radius is much smaller than the star. So it's approximately (2R/a) * (some function based on the orbital inclination). But since we're considering probabilities, it's based on the fraction of the orbit where the planet passes in front of the star relative to our line of sight.

Wait, no, the formula for transit probability is (R_star + R_planet)/a, but more precisely, it's (R_star / a) multiplied by (some function of the star's and planet's size). Maybe it's (R_star/(a)) * (something), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance. So, the higher this ratio, the higher the probability.

So, the probability P is roughly (2 R_star) / (a) ), since the planet's size is negligible. Or wait, no, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. I think I should get this right.

Wait, transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it crosses our line of sight. The probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, if the planet's orbit is edge-on. But wait, that's not exactly right. Because the planet must pass through a specific region in front of the star. The probability is ( (R_star + R_planet) ) / a, but only if the planet's orbital inclination allows it. Actually, the probability is ( (R_star + R_planet) / a ) * (something about the inclination). Oh, right, the actual transit probability is (R_star + R_planet)/a multiplied by the probability that the inclination is just right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the formula. The probability of a transit is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but this is only true when the planet's orbital distance a is much larger than R_star. Which is the case for planets, so the 'R_planet' is negligible. So the probability is approx R_star / a.

But wait, more accurately, the transit probability is (R_star / a) * (something else). Let me recall. The transit probability is (R_star / a) * (2 / sqrt(1 - e²)), where e is the eccentricity. But since the orbits are circular (e=0), it becomes R_star / a * 2. So the probability is (2 R_star) / a.

Wait, but another source says that the transit probability is (R_star / a) * (2 / (1 + sqrt(1 - (b^2 / a^2)) )) ), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The probability of a transit is proportional to (R_star / a), because the planet needs to be at the right position in its orbit relative to our line of sight.

Wait, no. Another approach: the transit probability is (R_star / a), because the area where the planet can be in front of the star is a circle with radius R_star, while the planet's orbital area is a circle of radius a. So the probability is (R_star / a)^2 times some factor? No, that's the area, but probability is more about being in the right position. Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the angular area covered.

Alternatively, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by 2, because the planet can transit on either side. So, P ≈ (2 R_star) / a.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting ideas. Let me think again.

The transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit where it is in front of the star from our point of view. Since the star's disk is a circle, the planet must pass within a certain region. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance, multiplied by 2, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but for Earth-like planets, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately R_star / a.

But wait, I've read that the probability is (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), but that's not correct without considering inclination. Alternatively, without knowing the inclination, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability of the inclination allowing a transit. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, the formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but only when the planet's orbital plane is within a certain angle of our line of sight. Since the inclination is random, the probability is ( R_star + R_planet ) / a multiplied by the solid angle factor. But perhaps for simplicity, the probability is (R_star / a) * (2 / ( (a/R_star) * sqrt(1 - (R_star/a)^2) )) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is roughly (R_star / a), assuming edge-on orbit, but that's not considering the actual geometry. Wait, no. The probability is the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front. So the probability is (R_star / a) * (something).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (R_star / a) * (2 / (a) ), but I'm really not getting it. Let me try to find a better approach.

Alternatively, the transit probability can be approximated as (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (a / R_star)) ), but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare the two planets by their a and R_star. Let's compute (R_star / a) for each planet.

But first, let's find the semi-major axis a for each planet.

We can use Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = (M_star) / (4π²), but in correct units.

Wait, the version of Kepler's law in astronomical units is (a^3)/(P^2) = (M_star + M_planet)/M_sun, but M_planet is negligible, so a^3 = (M_star / M_sun) * P^2.

Wait, more accurately, Kepler's third law in SI units is: a^3 = [G (M_star + M_planet) P^2 ]/(4π²). But for Earth-like planets, M_planet << M_star, so we can ignore it.

But since the planets are around different stars, each with their own M_star, we can compute a for each.

Given that Planet_1 has a period P1, Planet_2 has P2=3*P1.

The host star of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 * M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host.

So, for Kepler's law: (a1^3)/(P1^2) = G (M1) / (4π²)

Similarly, (a2^3)/(P2^2) = G (M2) / (4π²)

Let's compute a1 and a2 in terms of M1, M2, P1, P2.

We can write a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2)/(4π²)

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2)/(4π²)

Take the ratio a1/a2:

(a1/a2)^3 = (M1 P1²) / (M2 P2²) )

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P2 = 3 P1.

So,

(a1/a2)^3 = (2 M2 * P1²) / (M2 * (3 P1)^2 )

Simplify:

= [2 * 1 ] / [9 ]

= 2/9

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculate that. 2 is about 2, 9 is about 9.

2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Which means a2 ≈ a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, maybe it's better to plug numbers more accurately.

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 = 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is the same as (0.2222)^(1/3). Let me compute this:

0.2222^(1/3) ≈ e^( (ln 0.2222)/3 )

ln(0.2222) ≈ -1.504.

Divided by 3: -0.5013.

e^(-0.5013) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Therefore, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.648 a1.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_2 is longer than that of Planet_1. This makes sense because Planet_1's orbital period is shorter, so it's closer in.

Now, transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a). But wait, the star's radius is the same for both (same R_star), because the question says both host stars have the same radii.

So, (R_star / a1) for Planet_1 and (R_star / a2) for Planet_2.

Since a2 is larger, (R/a) is smaller for Planet_2.

Wait, wait, but the probability is higher when (R/a) is larger.

So, the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1), and for Planet_2, it's (R/a2). Since a1 is smaller than a2, (R/a1) is larger than (R/a2). So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

But wait, according to our earlier calculation, a1 ≈ 0.606 a2 → a2 ≈ 1.648 a1.

So, (R/a1) = R/(a1) = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ (R/a2) * 1.648.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.648 times that of Planet_2.

So, Planet_1 has higher probability, so researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the ratio.

Let me recompute the a1 and a2 ratio.

We have:

a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 * P1^2) / (M2 * P2^2)

Given M1 =2 M2, P2=3 P1.

So,

= (2 M2 * P1^2) / [ M2 * (3 P1)^2 ]

= (2 * P1^2) / (9 P1^2 )

= 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9.

Thus, a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

Then,

(R/a1) = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ (R/a2) * 1.648.

So the probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

So, Planet_1 has higher probability. Therefore, option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but let me think again. The transit probability is proportional to (R/a) multiplied by the probability of the inclination. Wait, no, the inclination is already considered in the formula. The transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a * (something about the inclination). Alternatively, the formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (R_star / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5 )) )

Wait, no, perhaps the correct expression is:

P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but for circular orbits, e=0, so it's (R_star /a).

Wait, but I think the correct formula is (R_star/(a)) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since e=0, it's R_star/a.

Wait, another source I can recall: The transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a) * (1 / (1 + sqrt(1 - (R_star + R_planet)^2/a^2)) ) ), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the probability (without knowing the inclination) is:

P = ( (R_star + R_planet) / a ) * (1 / sin i )

But since the inclination i is random, the average probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a multiplied by the solid angle factor. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should find the ratio of the transit probabilities without getting into the exact formula. Let me model the transit probability for each planet.

Let me denote:

P1 = transit probability for Planet_1

P2 = transit probability for Planet_2

Assuming that (R_planet << R_star), which is the case, so R_planet can be neglected.

Then, P1 ≈ (R_star ) / a1

Similarly, P2 ≈ R_star / a2.

Since R_star is same for both, the ratio P1/P2 = a2 / a1.

Because P1 = R/(a1), P2 = R/(a2). So P1/P2 = a2/a1.

From earlier, a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.648 a1.

Thus, P1/P2 = a2/a1 = 1.648.

So P1 is about 1.65 times larger than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So, the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So that's the correct answer.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information and compute the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2. The transit probability is proportional to the ratio \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_{\text{star}} \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \).

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axis ratio
Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2 \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1: \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)
- Planet_2: \( M_2 \), \( P_2 \)

The ratio of the semi-major axes is given by:

\[
\left( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \right)^3 = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{(2M_2)(\frac{P_2}{3})^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

From Step 1, \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65 \). Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a 1.5 times higher probability.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a 2.7 times higher probability.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting due to its smaller semi-major axis, making it the preferred target for observation. The transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet is more likely to transit, between Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose the one with the higher probability because they have limited time. Let's think through the details.

Alternatively, the transit probability can be approximated as (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (a / R_star)) ), but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare the two planets by their a and R_star. Let's compute (R_star / a) for each planet.

But first, let's find the semi-major axis a for each planet.

We can use Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = (M_star) / (4π²), but in correct units.

Wait, the version of Kepler's law in astronomical units is (a^3)/(P^2) = (M_star + M_planet)/M_sun, but M_planet is negligible, so a^3 = (M_star / M_sun) * P^2.

Wait, more accurately, Kepler's third law in SI units is: a^3 = [G (M_star + M_planet) P^2 ]/(4π²). But for Earth-like planets, M_planet << M_star, so we can ignore it.

But since the planets are around different stars, each with their own M_star, we can compute a for each.

Given that Planet_1 has a period P1, Planet_2 has P2=3*P1.

The host star of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 * M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host.

So, for Kepler's law: (a1^3)/(P1^2) = G (M1) / (4π²)

Similarly, (a2^3)/(P2^2) = G (M2) / (4π²)

Let's compute a1 and a2 in terms of M1, M2, P1, P2.

We can write a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2)/(4π²)

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2)/(4π²)

Take the ratio a1/a2:

(a1/a2)^3 = (M1 P1²) / (M2 P2²) )

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P2 = 3 P1.

So,

(a1/a2)^3 = (2 M2 * P1²) / (M2 * (3 P1)^2 )

Simplify:

= [2 * 1 ] / [9 ]

= 2/9

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculate that. 2 is about 2, 9 is about 9.

2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Which means a2 ≈ a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, maybe it's better to plug numbers more accurately.

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 = 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is the same as (0.2222)^(1/3). Let me compute this:

0.2222^(1/3) ≈ e^( (ln 0.2222)/3 )

ln(0.2222) ≈ -1.504.

Divided by 3: -0.5013.

e^(-0.5013) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Therefore, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.648 a1.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_2 is longer than that of Planet_1. This makes sense because Planet_1's orbital period is shorter, so it's closer in.

Now, transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a). But wait, the star's radius is the same for both (same R_star), because the question says both host stars have the same radii.

So, (R_star / a1) for Planet_1 and (R_star / a2) for Planet_2.

Since a2 is larger, (R/a) is smaller for Planet_2.

Wait, wait, but the probability is higher when (R/a) is larger.

So, the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1), and for Planet_2, it's (R/a2). Since a1 is smaller than a2, (R/a1) is larger than (R/a2). So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

But wait, according to our earlier calculation, a1 ≈ 0.606 a2 → a2 ≈ 1.648 a1.

So, (R/a1) = R/(a1) = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ (R/a2) * 1.648.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.648 times that of Planet_2.

So, Planet_1 has higher probability, so researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the ratio.

Let me recompute the a1 and a2 ratio.

We have:

a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 * P1^2) / (M2 * P2^2)

Given M1 =2 M2, P2=3 P1.

So,

= (2 M2 * P1^2) / [ M2 * (3 P1)^2 ]

= (2 * P1^2) / (9 P1^2 )

= 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9.

Thus, a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

Then,

(R/a1) = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ (R/a2) * 1.648.

So the probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

So, Planet_1 has higher probability. Therefore, option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but let me think again. The transit probability is proportional to (R/a) multiplied by the probability of the inclination. Wait, no, the inclination is already considered in the formula. The transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a * (something about the inclination). Alternatively, the formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (R_star / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5 )) )

Wait, no, perhaps the correct expression is:

P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but for circular orbits, e=0, so it's (R_star /a).

Wait, but I think the correct formula is (R_star/(a)) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since e=0, it's R_star/a.

Wait, another source I can recall: The transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a) * (1 / (1 + sqrt(1 - (R_star + R_planet)^2/a^2)) ) ), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the probability (without knowing the inclination) is:

P = ( (R_star + R_planet) / a ) * (1 / sin i )

But since the inclination i is random, the average probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a multiplied by the solid angle factor. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should find the ratio of the transit probabilities without getting into the exact formula. Let me model the transit probability for each planet.

Let me denote:

P1 = transit probability for Planet_1

P2 = transit probability for Planet_2

Assuming that (R_planet << R_star), which is the case, so R_planet can be neglected.

Then, P1 ≈ (R_star ) / a1

Similarly, P2 ≈ R_star / a2.

Since R_star is same for both, the ratio P1/P2 = a2 / a1.

Because P1 = R/(a1), P2 = R/(a2). So P1/P2 = a2/a1.

From earlier, a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.648 a1.

Thus, P1/P2 = a2/a1 = 1.648.

So P1 is about 1.65 times larger than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So, the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So that's the correct answer.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information and compute the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2. The transit probability is proportional to the ratio \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_{\text{star}} \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \).

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axis ratio
Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2 \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1: \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)
- Planet_2: \( M_2 \), \( P_2 \)

The ratio of the semi-major axes is given by:

\[
\left( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \right)^3 = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{(2M_2)(\frac{P_2}{3})^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

From Step 1, \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65 \). Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a 1.5 times higher probability.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a 2.7 times higher probability.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting due to its smaller semi-major axis, making it the preferred target for observation. The transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2.
