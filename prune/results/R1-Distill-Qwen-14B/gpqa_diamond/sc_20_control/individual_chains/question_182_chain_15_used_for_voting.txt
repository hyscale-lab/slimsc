Okay, so I have this physics question about the Mott-Gurney equation. I need to figure out which statement is true regarding its validity. Let me think through what I know.

The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device when it's in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. From what I remember, dark current is the current that flows even when there's no light, and it's due to thermionic emission or other mechanisms.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²)/(L³). So J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage, and L is the length of the device.

I think the SCLC regime occurs when the space charge (the accumulation of charge near the cathode) is so much that the electric field is strong enough to affect the current. This usually happens at higher voltages.

Now, the question is about the validity conditions of the Mott-Gurney equation. Let me recall the assumptions behind it. I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under certain approximations. One key assumption is that the device is single-carrier. That is, it's either electrons or holes, not both. So if a device has both electrons and holes (like a bipolar device), the equation wouldn't apply. So any option with two-carrier can be eliminated.

Looking at the options, D mentions a two-carrier device. So D is probably not correct.

Another point is about the contacts. Ohmic contacts mean that there's no barrier for the carriers to move across. But in real devices, especially with metal-semiconductor contacts, there's a potential barrier. However, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes an Ohmic contact because it relies on the idea that all carriers can contribute without any injection barriers. Wait, no—wait. Let me think. No, I think the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the carriers can inject without any barrier. So like, it's a trap-free scenario. So it's for a device where carriers can move freely, which would imply an Ohmic contact, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is derived considering that the current is due to the emission of carriers from the cathode, which requires that the work function of the cathode allows for easy injection. So if there's a Schottky barrier (like in a diode), it might complicate things because you have a barrier that affects the current. So the equation probably assumes no such barriers, meaning Ohmic contacts or no injection barriers. So options that include Schottky contacts might be incorrect.

Looking at the options again. Option C mentions a Schottky contact. So if the equation requires an Ohmic contact, then C is wrong.

Another point is about the current transport mechanism. The SCLC regime implies that the current is limited by the space charge, which means that the electric field is so strong that it's the dominant factor. This usually occurs in the high voltage region where the space charge has built up enough to limit the current.

The derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is due to the field emission (like Fowler-Nordheim tunneling?), but wait, no, that's a different regime. Oh, wait, no. The Mott-Gurney equation comes from the Child-Langmuir law, which is for the current in the space-charge-limited region, where the field is so strong that the space charge itself creates a potential gradient that limits the current. So the field is strong, and the current is limited by the space charge.

In the derivation, it's also assumed that the device is single-carrier. So no option with two carriers is correct.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. Hmm. Wait, in the SCLC regime, the current is limited by the space charge, which implies that the dominant current is drift current, not diffusion. So if the equation says it's valid when drift current is negligible, that can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is applicable in the SCLC region. In that region, the current is limited by the space charge, which is a result of the accumulation of charge. So the dominant transport is drift because the electric field is strong. Therefore, the equation inherently includes drift current. So if an option says "negligible drift current," that can't be correct because drift is the main thing.

Wait, but let me think. The options are about the validity conditions. So the Mott-Gurney equation is applicable when the current is space-charge limited, which is when the drift current is the main component. So if an option says "negligible drift current," that would mean the equation doesn't apply because the drift is significant. So if the equation is valid when drift is the main thing, the option that says "negligible drift" would be incorrect.

Looking again at the options:

Option B says: trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.

So, if the Mott-Gurney equation is valid when drift current is dominant, then having negligible diffusion current would make sense because diffusion is less important than drift in that high-field scenario. Because in the SCLC region, the electric field is strong, so drift (E-dependent) dominates over diffusion (concentration gradient-dependent). So if the option says that diffusion is negligible, that would align with the conditions for the equation's validity.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the equation is valid when drift is significant, not negligible. So the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the current is space charge limited, which implies that the drift current is the main factor. So, for the equation to hold, the drift current is dominant, so diffusion is negligible, right?

Wait, no. Because the equation itself includes the mobility (μ) which is a drift parameter. So if diffusion were significant, the current would also depend on the gradient of carrier concentration, which isn't in the Mott-Gurney equation. So the equation assumes that the current is purely drift-driven, which would require that diffusion is negligible.

So the conditions are: single-carrier, no traps (so carrier can move freely without scattering), Ohmic contact (so no barrier for injection, or at least that the injection doesn't limit the current), and that the current is dominated by drift (so diffusion is negligible? Or is it the other way around?)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the derivation.

The Mott-Gurney equation comes from the Child-Langmuir law. The derivation usually assumes that the current is limited by the space charge, and that the carriers are in the SCLC regime. The derivation uses Poisson's equation to find the electric field profile and then uses the drift-diffusion equation. But under the SCLC conditions, the space charge creates an electric field that is so strong that the drift velocity is the main transport mechanism, and diffusion is negligible compared to drift.

So, during SCLC, diffusion current is negligible because the drift dominates. Therefore, the equation would be valid when diffusion current is negligible.

Wait, but in some derivations, I think that the assumption is that the current is due to drift only. So the equation holds when the diffusion current is negligible.

So, looking at the options:

Option B says "negligible diffusion current." So that would fit.

Option A says "negligible drift current." That would not fit, because in the SCLC regime, drift is dominant, so the equation is applicable when drift is not negligible.

So the correct option would have single-carrier, no traps, no carrier injection barrier (which would imply Ohmic contact or that the barrier is negligible, allowing easy injection), and negligible diffusion current.

Looking at the options:

Option B: trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.

So that seems correct.

Option C: Schottky contact—so that implies a barrier, which the equation probably doesn't account for. So B is better.

So the correct statement is option B.

The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is given as:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where \( \epsilon \) is the dielectric constant, \( \mu \) is the charge carrier mobility, and \( L \) is the length of the device. The validity of this equation depends on specific assumptions and conditions, which are analyzed below:

1. **Single-Carrier Device**: The Mott-Gurney equation is derived for single-carrier devices, meaning it applies to devices where only one type of carrier (electrons or holes) dominates the current. Two-carrier devices are not valid for this equation.

2. **Trap-Free Condition**: The equation assumes that the device is trap-free, meaning there are no impurities or defects that scatter carriers. This ensures that the current is not interrupted by trapping effects.

3. **Ohmic Contact**: The equation assumes negligible carrier injection barriers, which implies an Ohmic contact. If there is a Schottky barrier (as in a diode), the current would be affected by the barrier, and the equation would not hold.

4. **Dominance of Drift Current**: In the SCLC regime, the electric field is strong, and the current is dominated by drift current rather than diffusion current. Diffusion current becomes negligible compared to drift current under these conditions.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: This option mentions "negligible drift current," which contradicts the conditions for the SCLC regime. In this regime, drift current is dominant, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: This option states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation, as diffusion current is negligible in the SCLC regime, and the device must be single-carrier and trap-free.
- **Option C**: This option mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces a barrier that affects the current. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes no such barriers, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: This option refers to a two-carrier device, which is not valid for the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation applies only to single-carrier devices, so this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option B**, as it accurately reflects the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid: a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
