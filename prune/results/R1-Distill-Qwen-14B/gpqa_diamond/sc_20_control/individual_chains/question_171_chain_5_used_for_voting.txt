Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I remember that electrophilic substitution usually happens on aromatic rings, right? The question is about the para-isomer yield for six different benzene derivatives when they react with excess bromine. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Wait, the weight fraction of the para-isomer... Oh, I think that refers to how much of the product is the para-substituted version. So, if a substituent directs the incoming electrophile to certain positions, the para isomer might be more or less favored.

Each substituent has a directing effect. Activating groups direct substitution to certain positions, while deactivating groups might make the ring less reactive, but they still direct. Let me recall:

- Groups like -NH2, -OH, -O- (like in ethers) are strongly activating and para/ortho directors. But wait, in this case, the substituents are different.

Looking at the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl chain. It's an ortho/para director. So, when bromine is added, the substitution would be more likely at the ortho and para positions relative to the methyl.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzoyloxy ethyl group? Wait, no. Wait, it's C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh, so that's a phenyl ester. The substituent is a COOEt group, which is an ester. Esters are electron-withdrawing (because of the carbonyl), so they are meta directors. So, the incoming electrophile would add at the meta position.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is a substituent. Chlorine is a deactivating group (because of the electronegativity, it's an electron-withdrawing). But it's also an ortho/para director because of the +M effect (even though deactivating, it's a halide). So, substitution occurs ortho and para.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro groups are strongly deactivating (due to -I and -M effects) and are meta directors. So, the incoming electrophile will substitute at the meta position.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's an activating, ortho/para director. So substitution at o and p positions.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group. The -COOH is a strong deactivating group (because of the electron-withdrawing effect) and is a meta director. So substitution happens at meta.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the para-isomer. So for each substituent, how much of the product is para?

In electrophilic substitution, the substituent's directing effect determines where the incoming group goes. If the substituent is an activating group (like methyl or ethyl), then substitution occurs more in ortho and para. But when the substituent is deactivating, substitution occurs meta.

Wait, but for each substituent, what is the major position for substitution?

So for each compound:

1) Methyl: o/p director. So when bromine adds, it's more likely to add para to methyl. But wait, in a mono-substituted benzene, the major product is a mix. However, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed, which suggests maybe under certain conditions, but maybe it's a typo. Or perhaps each substituent directs in a certain way, and the para isomer is the major product.

Wait, the question states that each substance undergoes electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe each has only one possible substitution? Or perhaps the substituent is such that only one position is possible? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a meta director, so the bromine adds only in the meta position, making a single product. Or perhaps some substituents are strongly activating or deactivating, leading to only one major product.

Wait, perhaps for some substituents, the para isomer is more or less favored. Let's think about each:

1) Methyl (activating, o/p): So substitution can occur in ortho or para. Which is more? I think that for substituents like methyl, the para isomer is the major product because of steric hindrance in the ortho position. Or wait, maybe in some cases, ortho is more favored. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, when a substituent is an activating group, the ortho and para are possible. But for the case of methyl, the para isomer is actually more favored because the ortho positions are closer to the bulky substituent, leading to less steric strain in the para product. So for methyl, the para isomer would be the major product.

2) COOEt (ester): deactivating, meta director. So substitution occurs only at meta. So the product would be meta bromide. So the para isomer is not formed, so the weight fraction is zero? Or wait, does this mean that for COOEt, the para isn't formed? So in this case, the para isomer is zero, but that can't be because the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. So for COOEt, substitution occurs only in meta, so the para product isn't formed. So the fraction for para is zero.

3) Cl: deactivating, o/p director. So substitution occurs in ortho and para. So the para isomer is formed, along with ortho. So in this case, the para isomer is a significant fraction.

4) NO2: deactivating, meta director. So substitution only at meta. So no para product. So the fraction is zero.

5) C2H5 (ethyl): same as methyl. Activating, o/p director. So para isomer is major.

6) COOH: deactivating, meta director. So substitution only at meta. So para isomer fraction is zero.

Wait, but the question is asking about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each, what is the percentage of para product.

Wait, let me go through each substituent:

1) CH3 (activating, o/p). When the substituent is ortho/para directing, the incoming electrophile can add to o or p. But, for activating groups, the para isomer is usually more favored because the ortho positions are adjacent to the substituent, leading to more steric hindrance. So the para isomer is major. So its weight fraction is high.

2) COOEt (ester, deactivating, meta). So substitution is meta, so no para product. So the fraction is 0%.

3) Cl (deactivating, o/p). So substitution can be ortho or para. But the substituent is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. However, since the directing is o/p, the incoming electrophile adds in ortho and para. The para isomer would be formed, but since Cl is a weak deactivating group, the para might be less favored? Or perhaps in o/p directors, para is the major product.

Wait, for substituents that are o/p directors, like Cl, the para product is generally the major one because the meta positions are not activated. So the para isomer is major.

Wait, no. Let me think again: in the case of a substituent that is a deactivating group (like Cl), but o/p directing. Because Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, the ring is less activated, so the reaction is slower, but when it does happen, substitution occurs at o and p. For such substituents, which is major, ortho or para? I think that in cases where the substituent is an o/p director, the para isomer is the major product because the ortho positions are more sterically hindered. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene gives more para product than ortho.

So for substituent 3 (Cl), para is the major product.

4) NO2 (deactivating, meta). So substitution occurs meta, so no para product. So para fraction is zero.

5) C2H5 (similar to CH3). Activating, o/p. Para is major.

6) COOH (deactivating, meta). So substitution occurs meta, so no para product. So fraction is zero.

Wait, but for the given problem, the substituents are as follows:

1: methyl - o/p, para is major.

2: COOEt - meta, para fraction 0.

3: Cl - o/p, para major.

4: NO2 - meta, para fraction 0.

5: ethyl - o/p, para major.

6: COOH - meta, para fraction 0.

So, the para fractions:

1: high

2: 0

3: high

4: 0

5: high

6: 0

Wait, but the question is about increasing order of the para weight fraction. So from least to most.

Wait, but wait, all of substituents 2,4,6 have para fraction zero. So when arranged in order, their positions would come first. But that can't be because the options don't have all three at the start.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps for some substituents, the para isomer may not be the only product. For example, in the case of COOEt (ester), which is a meta director, the bromine would add only in the meta position, so the product is a single isomer, which is meta. So in that case, the para isomer doesn't form. So for substituent 2, the para fraction is zero.

Similarly, substituent 4 (NO2) is meta, so para fraction zero.

Substituent 6 (COOH) is meta, para fraction zero.

So, what about the others:

Substituent 1: methyl, o/p. So the product is a mix of ortho and para. But which is more?

I think that for methyl, the para isomer is more favored because the ortho positions are adjacent to the methyl group, leading to steric hindrance. So the para isomer is the major product, maybe like 60% or something.

Substituent 3: Cl, o/p. Cl is a meta director? Wait no, Cl is o/p, but it's deactivating. So substitution occurs in o and p. Which is more? For chlorobenzene, the major product is para, I believe. So substituent 3's para fraction is high.

Substituent 5: ethyl, o/p. Para is major.

So, in terms of para fractions:

Substituent 2: 0

Substituent 4: 0

Substituent 6: 0

Substituent 1,3,5: high.

Wait, but all of 2,4,6 have zero para fraction. So when arranged in increasing order, they would be first. But the problem asks for the order of the weight fraction of the para isomer. So the ones with zero will be the lowest, then the others.

But looking at the options, the options don't have all three at the beginning. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A)4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, but if substituents 2,4,6 have zero para, then they should be in the first positions. Which option starts with 4, 2, 6 or similar? Looking at the options, option A starts with 4<2<6. But wait, 4, 2, 6 all have zero, so they should be the first three.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe some substituents do produce some para product.

Wait, perhaps for substituents that are meta directors, the para product is zero, but for others, the para product is a certain percentage.

Wait, the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That's confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and it's meant to be that only one is possible, but that's not the case for o/p directors.

Alternatively, perhaps for some substituents, the para isomer is not formed, so their weight fraction is zero.

Wait, the question says each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution with bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed.

Wait, that can't be right. For example, if you have a methyl group, which is o/p directing, multiple products are possible. So perhaps the question is that, for each substituent, the bromine adds only once, so mono substitution, but perhaps the positions are determined by the substituents.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for each substituent, the para isomer is the product, and how much of it is formed in terms of weight.

Wait, but if the substituent is a meta director, then the substitution occurs only in the meta position, so the para isomer is not formed. But wait, the substituent is on the benzene ring, and the incoming Br adds in a position relative to it. So for substituent 2 (COOEt), the para position would be across from it, but since the substituent is meta-directing, the Br adds in the meta position relative to the substituent. Wait, no. Let's think. Let's imagine the substituent is in position 1. The meta positions would be 3 and 5. The para position is 4. So if the substituent is meta-directing, the Br adds in 3 or 5, but not 4. So the para position from the substituent's point of view is 4, but the Br adds in meta, which is 3 and 5, so no para product? Hmm, but the substituent itself is in 1, so the para position would be 4. So the substitution occurs in meta (positions 3 and 5), so the product would be 3-bromo and 5-bromo. So the para product (i.e., 4-bromo) would not form. So for substituent 2, no para product.

Wait, but wait, the substituent is in position 1. The incoming Br could add into position 4 (para to substituent) or positions 2,6 (ortho) or 3,5 (meta). But if the substituent is a meta director, the Br adds in the meta positions (3 or 5). So the product would be 3-bromo or 5-bromo, and para product (4-bromo) is not formed.

So for substituent 2, the para isomer is 0%.

Similarly, substituent 4 (NO2) is meta, so Br adds in meta positions. So no para product.

Substituent 6 (COOH) is meta, so no para product.

So back to substituent 1: methyl, which is o/p. So for substituent 1, the para product is formed. So what is the percentage?

In the case of toluene (methyl benzene), when brominated, the para isomer is the major product.

Similarly, substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p director, so para is major.

Substituent 5 (ethyl) is o/p, so para is major.

So, the para fractions:

Substituent 1: high (like 60%)

Substituent 3: high (like 60%)

Substituent 5: high (like 60%)

Substituents 2,4,6: 0%

Now, the question is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of para isomer. So from the lowest to highest.

The substituents with 0% are 2,4,6. Then the substituents with high are 1,3,5.

But wait, the options don't have all three at the start. Let me look at the options again.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5

But substituents 4,2,6 are all 0%. So their order would be same, since their fractions are zero. But the option arranges them in order 4<2<6. But since they're all zero, their order doesn't matter. So perhaps in the options, they are arranged based on substituents' directing effects.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps for substituent 3 (Cl), the ring is deactivating, so the para product is formed but in lower amounts compared to activating groups. Because in activating groups, the ring is more reactive, so para is major. For deactivating groups, the ring is less reactive, but still, for o/p directors, the para product is formed.

Wait, so substituents 1,3,5 have para products, but the amounts vary.

Wait, for substituent 1 (methyl), which is activating, the para isomer is major, perhaps higher than substituent 3 (Cl, deactivating).

Wait, but if the substituent is activating, the ring is more reactive, so the para isomer is formed in higher amounts. For substituent 3 (Cl), which is deactivating, but o/p director, the para isomer is formed but perhaps in lower amounts than substituent 1.

Similarly, substituent 5 (ethyl) is activating, so para isomer is high, perhaps similar to substituent 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the relative amounts between substituents 1,3,5.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is based on the activating/deactivating nature and the directing.

Wait, perhaps the activating groups (1,3,5) form more para product than the deactivating groups (2,4,6), which don't form any. So the order would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5.

But within the activating groups, how do they compare? Methyl (1), Cl (3), ethyl (5). Cl is a deactivating group, but for substituent 3, it's o/p directing. So substituent 3 is a deactivating group but o/p director. So the para product is formed, but perhaps in lower amounts than substituent 1 and 5, which are activating.

Wait, so substituent 1 and 5 are activating; substituent 3 is deactivating but o/p.

So, the para fractions would be:

Sub 3: lower than 1 and 5, but higher than 2,4,6.

Ah, that's a possibility. So substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 2,4,6 but lower than 1 and 5.

So the order would be 2,4,6 < 3 < 1,5.

Wait, but 1 and 5 are activating, so their para fractions are higher than 3.

So, substituent 1 and 5 have higher para fractions than substituent 3.

So overall, the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

2,4,6 (0%) < 3 (some para) < 1,5 (high para).

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p directing but deactivating. So the para product is formed, but perhaps in less quantity than for the activating substituents.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 2,4,6 but lower than 1 and 5.

So, when arranging in increasing order:

2 (0%) < 4 (0%) < 6 (0%) < 3 (low) < 1 (high) <5 (high).

Wait, but substituent 5 is ethyl, which is activating, so perhaps it's similar to substituent 1.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is less than 1 and 5, but more than 2,4,6.

So, in the order:

2,4,6 <3 <1,5.

But the problem is that substituent 5 is ethyl, same as substituent 1 (methyl), both activating. So their para fractions are higher.

Wait, but what determines the exact order between 1,3,5?

I think the activating groups (1,5) have higher para fractions than 3, which is deactivating but o/p.

So the order within 1,3,5 is 3 <1 <5 (assuming ethyl is more activating than methyl? Or is it the other way around?).

Wait, methyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl chain. So is ethyl. But perhaps ethyl is more bulky, leading to more steric hindrance, making para the major product. Or perhaps ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl, but I don't think so. Alkyl groups are generally activating, but their relative strengths are similar.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 (methyl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 3 (Cl), but substituent 5 (ethyl) has a higher than 3. So in the order, 3 <1 <5.

But is ethyl more activating than methyl? I'm not sure. But perhaps in terms of directing, both have similar para fractions. So their order may not matter.

But let's proceed.

So the order from least to most para fraction would be:

2,4,6 (0%) < 3 (some) <1,5 (high).

But the options don't have this exact arrangement.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5

So 4 (NO2), 2 (COOEt), 6 (COOH) are all 0%, so same as each other. Then comes 3 (Cl), then 1, then 5.

But in our analysis, 3 is higher than 1 and 5. Wait, no, I thought 1 and 5 are higher than 3.

Ah, wait, in option A, 3 comes after 2,4,6, but before 1 and 5. So according to option A, substituent 3 has a lower para fraction than 1 and 5, which fits our analysis.

So substituent 3's para fraction is lower than 1 and 5. So option A's order is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Which would be correct if substituent 3's para fraction is less than 1 and 5.

But why would substituent 3 have a lower para fraction than 1 and 5?

Because substituent 3 is Cl, which is deactivating, so even though it's o/p, the ring is less reactive, leading to lower para product compared to activating substituents like methyl and ethyl.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 2,4,6 but lower than 1,5.

So, the order would be:

2,4,6 < 3 <1,5.

Looking at the options, option A lists them as 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But in reality, 2,4,6 have the same (0) para fraction.

So perhaps the order between them doesn't matter. But option A has 4 first, then 2, then 6, which are all 0.

So, the correct order is 2,4,6 come first, then 3, then 1,5.

In the options, option A starts with 4, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So the order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But why would substituent 3 come before substituent 1 and 5? Because substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 0, but lower than 1 and 5.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 2,4,6, but lower than 1 and 5.

Thus, in the sequence, 4,2,6 are at the lowest, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So the order would be 4 < 2 < 6 <3 <1 <5.

Which matches option A.

Wait, but substituent 5 is ethyl, which is activating, so why is it after substituent 1 (methyl)? Maybe because the question isn't about the substituent's activating power but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 5 is ortho/para, but maybe ethyl is more bulky, making para the major product. So substituent 5's para fraction is higher than substituent 1.

Wait, that's possible. Methyl is less bulky than ethyl, so substitution in para is major for methyl. With ethyl, which is bulkier, perhaps para is even more favored, so substituent 5's para fraction is higher than substituent 1.

So the order would be 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: the para weight fraction depends on the substituent's directing effect and the possibility of para substitution.

Each substituent's effect:

1. CH3: o/p, activating → para is major.

2. COOEt: meta → para is zero.

3. Cl: o/p, deactivating → para is major but less than activating groups.

4. NO2: meta → para is zero.

5. C2H5: o/p, activating → para is major.

6. COOH: meta → para is zero.

So, the para fractions are 0 for 2,4,6. For 1,3,5, they have non-zero para fractions.

Which substituents have higher para fractions?

Among 1,3,5:

1: (activating) → high.

3: (deactivating but o/p) → lower than 1 and 5.

5: (activating) → high, perhaps same as 1.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is lower than 1 and 5.

So the order is 2,4,6 (0) <3 <1,5.

But in the options, the order is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Which matches option A.

Alternatively, the substituents 2,4,6 are all 0, but the option orders them as 4, then 2, then 6.

But why? Perhaps considering the strength of the directing group or something else.

Alternatively, maybe there's another factor I'm missing. For example, when the substituent is strongly deactivating, even if it's an o/p director, the para product is less than in activating groups.

So, substituent 3 (Cl) would have lower para fraction than 1 (methyl) and 5 (ethyl).

Thus, substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 0 but lower than 1 and 5.

So the overall order is: 2,4,6 (lowest, 0) <3 <1 <5.

But wait, substituent 5 is ethyl; does it have a higher para fraction than methyl? I'm not certain. Both are activating, so their para fractions are high, but perhaps ethyl is more bulky, leading to more para substitution. So substituent 5 would have higher para fraction than 1.

In that case, the order within 1 and 5 would be 1 <5.

So, substituent 5 has higher para fraction than 1.

So, the order would be 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 3 is higher than 2,4,6 but lower than 1 and 5.

So, the order is: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, which option fits this?

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → 2,4,6 are in positions 1-3, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Yes, that matches.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 5's para fraction is higher than substituent 1. So 1 would come before 5.

Wait, but this is getting too speculative. Based on substituent's activating power, methyl and ethyl are both activating, so their para fractions would be similar. So 1 and 5 would have similar high para fractions, but perhaps 5 is higher.

In any case, the correct order according to the options is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given compounds undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring:

### Substituent Analysis:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl)**:  
   - Activating group (ortho/para director).  
   - The para-isomer is the major product due to steric hindrance in the ortho positions.  
   - High weight fraction of the para-isomer.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester)**:  
   - Deactivating group (meta director).  
   - Substitution occurs exclusively at the meta position.  
   - Para-isomer is not formed.  
   - Weight fraction of the para-isomer is **0%.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**:  
   - Deactivating group (ortho/para director).  
   - Substitution occurs at the ortho and para positions, but the para-isomer is favored due to steric hindrance in the ortho positions.  
   - Moderate weight fraction of the para-isomer, lower than activating groups.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**:  
   - Strongly deactivating group (meta director).  
   - Substitution occurs exclusively at the meta position.  
   - Para-isomer is not formed.  
   - Weight fraction of the para-isomer is **0%.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl)**:  
   - Activating group (ortho/para director).  
   - Similar to methyl, the para-isomer is the major product due to steric hindrance in the ortho positions.  
   - High weight fraction of the para-isomer, potentially higher than methyl due to increased bulk.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid)**:  
   - Deactivating group (meta director).  
   - Substitution occurs exclusively at the meta position.  
   - Para-isomer is not formed.  
   - Weight fraction of the para-isomer is **0%.

### Order of Increasing Weight Fraction of the Para-Isomer:
- Substituents 2, 4, and 6 have **0%** para-isomer due to meta-directing effects.  
- Substituent 3 (Cl) has a low but non-zero para-isomer fraction.  
- Substituents 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5) have high para-isomer fractions, with ethyl likely having a slightly higher fraction than methyl due to increased steric hindrance.

Thus, the order is **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Correct Option:
**A) 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

Answer: A
