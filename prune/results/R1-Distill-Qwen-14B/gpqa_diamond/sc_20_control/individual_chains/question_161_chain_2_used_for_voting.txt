Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope that's under ultra-high vacuum conditions, right? The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr, which is really low. But even with that, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

He determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1 before the electron beam was turned on. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember. It's calculated using the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. So, factors like the volume, pressure, and temperature of the sample compartment affect λ1.

But then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is asking what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1. The options include whether λ2 is larger, smaller, the same, or falls in a certain range.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? I think the electron beam itself might cause some changes. Oh, maybe because the beam has a high energy, it interacts with the gas molecules. That interaction could cause the gas to ionize or get excited. When gas molecules are ionized, they become charged particles, right?

In such a case, the ionized gas molecules would behave differently. They might stick to the walls of the chamber more easily or perhaps even cause more collisions because their charge affects their movement. Alternatively, maybe the ions can be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, which could alter their paths.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path is affected by the number density of the gas. The formula for mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure (since P is proportional to density). Oh, but wait, the pressure didn't change because the pumps are still running. So why would λ change? Because the electron beam might affect the gas in another way.

Another thought: when the electron beam is on, it's possible that some gas molecules are being knocked out of the chamber. Maybe electrons collide with the gas, giving them enough energy to escape the vacuum chamber. If the gas molecules are being removed, the pressure would effectively decrease, which would increase the mean free path because lower pressure means fewer molecules and longer average paths between collisions.

So if the pressure drops when the beam is on, the mean free path λ should increase. Because λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. But wait, does that actually happen in practice? Because the electron beam is a source of energy, but the vacuum pumps are running, so they should be removing any gas that's being released.

Hmm, but the question states that Mike accurately determined λ1 under the existing conditions. Then when the beam is on, he measures λ2. Maybe the beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize or move in a way that affects their effective density.

Wait, another angle: What's the formula for mean free path? λ = 1/(√2 * n * d), where n is the number density, and d is the mean collision diameter. So if n decreases, λ increases.

But why would n decrease when the beam is on? Because the beam could be causing some sputtering of the sample or the chamber walls, releasing more gas? Or perhaps the opposite: the beam causes gas molecules to be removed. Wait, in an electron microscope, the electron beam can cause gas molecules to be ionized, and those ions could be attracted to the walls or pumped out if there's a way to remove them. So perhaps the effective pressure decreases when the beam is on, leading to a higher λ.

So if the pressure is now lower, then λ2 would be larger than λ1. Because λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 *λ1
Option C: λ2 < λ1
Option D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1

Wait, but the question says that the temperature remains the same. So in the formula for mean free path, if pressure decreases, λ increases. So λ2 should be higher than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

So the options that have λ2 >λ1 are A and D if λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1, or A could be anything >=1.22. But why would it be exactly 1.22 times? That number is familiar—it's the factor for the mean free path when considering the most probable speed vs the average speed or something.

Wait, another point. The initial mean free path λ1 is calculated based on the ideal gas conditions without any external influences. When the electron beam is applied, the gas molecules may undergo different interactions. For example, if the beam causes ionization, the mean free path could change because the charged particles might interact more or less frequently.

But wait, in an ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is already very long. So perhaps when the beam is on, the gas molecules are being pumped out more efficiently, leading to a lower effective pressure. Or maybe the electron beam itself causes some molecules to leave the system, effectively reducing the number density n, which increases λ.

So, if λ2 is higher than λ1, that would mean option A or D is possible. But why would λ2 be >= 1.22λ1 or maybe just a bit higher.

Wait, considering that the mean free path calculation might have other factors when the gas is ionized. For instance, when gas is ionized, the mean free path could change because ionized particles might have different collision cross-sections or different behavior in the electric fields.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional forces. The electron beam has a certain electric field, and ionized particles would be accelerated. So their motion could change, affecting their mean free path.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, the mean free path might actually decrease because the ions could interact more with the chamber walls or other charged particles. Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, another approach. Under normal conditions, the mean free path is determined by the collisions between gas molecules. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being excited or ionized, leading to more frequent collisions because the ions can stick to the walls more. Or maybe the ions are being extracted from the chamber, making the effective pressure lower, hence λ increases.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause some of the gas molecules to be removed from the system. So n would decrease, which would make λ increase. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

In that case, if the pressure was P before, and now it's P', where P' < P, then λ2 = λ1 * (P / P') which would be greater than λ1.

So which option says λ2 is greater than λ1?

Options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1
C) λ2 < λ1
D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22λ1.

So, the question is whether λ2 is greater than λ1, possibly by a factor of 1.22 or more, or just a little bit more.

Wait, another thought. The initial λ1 was calculated as the mean free path under the given pressure. When the beam is on, the effective pressure might be lower, so λ increases. But how much does it increase?

In the case of a vacuum system, the mean free path is often calculated using the formula λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2 * P). So for a fixed T and d, λ is inversely proportional to P.

If the pressure decreases, λ increases. So λ2 = λ1 * (P_initial / P_beam_on). Since P_beam_on < P_initial, λ2 > λ1.

But by how much? The question says that Mike accurately determined λ1, so perhaps the presence of the electron beam modifies the gas behavior. For example, if the gas is ionized, the mean free path calculation changes because the effective diameter or the effective cross-section changes.

Wait, when a gas is ionized, the molecules can have a larger effective diameter because they carry charges and might interact differently. So perhaps the effective diameter d increases when ionized, which would decrease the mean free path because λ is inversely proportional to d squared.

So if d increases, λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me think clearly.

If the gas is neutral, the mean free path is λ1. If the gas is ionized, maybe the mean free path is shorter because:

1. The ionized particles might have a larger effective diameter (d increases), so λ decreases.

2. Alternatively, the ions could be more likely to stick to the walls, effectively reducing the number of particles in the system, which would increase λ.

Wait, but sticking to the walls would reduce n, the number density, so n' = n_initial * (something less than 1). So λ2 = 1/(n' d' sqrt(2) π) would be larger than λ1 if n' is lower and d' is similar or higher.

But if the ions are more likely to stick, then n' would be lower, so λ2 increases.

Wait, but sticking to walls would lower the number density, so λ increases. So the mean free path would be longer than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

So that brings us back to λ2 being larger than λ1.

But earlier I thought that ionization could cause a larger d, leading to shorter λ, but that might not be right if the dominant effect is the reduction in n.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect of ionization is negligible compared to the change in the system's pressure.

Wait, but in the given scenario, Mike found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1, but that could be due to a change in the actual pressure. So if the beam is causing some of the gas to be removed, the pressure would drop, making λ2 longer.

But why would the mean free path change? Because the pressure changed.

Wait, but the problem says the sample compartment's temperature remained the same, but it doesn't say the pressure remained the same. So perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes a change in the pressure, leading to a change in λ.

But how? Because the vacuum pumps are running, so they should maintain the pressure. Unless the beam causes gas to be released.

Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing gas to be released from the sample or the chamber walls, increasing the pressure, which would decrease λ2. But that contradicts the earlier idea.

Hmm, maybe the electron beam causes some gas to be adsorbed onto the sample or other surfaces, effectively removing them from the gas phase. So the number of gas molecules in the compartment would decrease, leading to lower pressure and thus longer mean free path.

Wait, that makes sense. If the electron beam causes gas molecules to stick to the sample or other surfaces, n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But how much? The options suggest possible ranges. The question is, how much could λ2 be compared to λ1?

Is there a factor that determines this? Let's think about the initial setup. The initial pressure is P, and when the beam is on, the effective pressure is P', which is lower because some molecules are removed. So λ2 = λ1 * (P / P') = λ1 * (n_initial / n_beam_on).

If the pressure drops by a factor, say, x, then λ2 = x * λ1.

So if the pressure is lower, λ2 is higher.

But without knowing the exact change in pressure, we can't say exactly by how much. However, the options only give relative possibilities.

Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22 *λ1

B) λ2 = λ1 → which Mike's observation contradicts.

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 *λ1

So, if the mean free path increases, then either A or D is correct.

But which is it?

Another thought: the mean free path in a vacuum system can be calculated using the formula:

λ = (1.38e-23 J/K * K) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P)

But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the effective pressure isn't just from the gas in the chamber but also includes any additional effects from the beam. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is being ionized, which affects the calculation.

Wait, the formula for mean free path for an ideal gas is:

λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P)

But if the gas is ionized, it's no longer neutral, and the behavior might change. For example, ionized particles might stick to the chamber walls more effectively, thus reducing the effective pressure.

Wait, but sticking would lower the pressure because the particles are no longer in the gas phase. So P' is lower, so λ = λ1 * (P / P') → λ2 increases.

But how much does P' decrease? If the pressure drops by a certain amount, λ increases by the inverse factor.

But without knowing the exact change, perhaps the problem expects us to realize that the mean free path must increase, so λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, the only option where λ2 is larger than λ1 is A or D.

But why would λ2 be more than 1.22 times λ1, or just a bit more?

Wait, maybe the mean free path in a vacuum is given by λ = 1.22 * L, where L is something else. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the factor 1.22 is from the mean speed of the gas molecules.

Wait, the mean free path can also be expressed in terms of the average speed. The formula is λ = v_avg * τ, where τ is the mean time between collisions. The average speed v_avg is sqrt(8kT/(π m)), and the root mean square speed is sqrt(3kT/m).

Wait, maybe the initial calculation of λ1 didn't account for the speed distribution of the molecules, and when the beam is on, it affects this somehow. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is present, it introduces additional factors that change the effective mean free path. For example, if the beam causes the gas to ionize, the mean free path could change if the ions have a different collision cross-section.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the scenario. The presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to either be removed or ionized. Either way, the number density n decreases, which increases λ.

So, λ2 > λ1.

The options that fit are A and D.

But why would λ2 be more than λ1 but less than 1.22 λ1? Or why would it be >=1.22.

Wait, perhaps the initial setup was at a pressure P1, and the presence of the beam causes the pressure to drop to P2, where P2 is lower than P1. But how much lower?

If the pressure drops by a factor of x, then λ2 = x * λ1.

If x is greater than 1, λ2 increases.

But without knowing the exact change in pressure, perhaps we can't determine the exact factor, but the question is about which of the options is correct.

Wait, the question says that when the beam is on, the mean free path is no longer λ1. So, if Mike accurately calculated λ1 under the initial conditions, but when the beam is on, the presence of the beam introduces a change in the effective conditions.

But perhaps the beam causes gas molecules to be removed more quickly than the pumps can compensate, leading to a lower effective pressure. So, perhaps the pressure drops, leading to an increase in λ.

But the problem says that the temperature remains the same, so the mean free path would be longer.

Therefore, λ2 is larger than λ1. So, the options are A and D.

But looking at the options, D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22*λ1. Option A says λ2 is >=1.22*λ1.

Wait, why 1.22? Maybe that comes from the mean speed of the gas molecules.

Wait, another thought. The mean free path is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² P). If the pressure remains the same, but the temperature changes, but the question says temperature remains the same. So, perhaps the change in λ is due to a change in pressure.

But Mike's initial calculation of λ1 was based on the existing conditions, which included the pressure. When the beam is on, perhaps the effective pressure is lower, as some gas is being pumped out more efficiently.

So, the pressure could drop, making λ2 larger than λ1. So, λ2 > λ1.

If the pressure drops a lot, λ2 would be much larger. But if it drops a little, it's just a bit larger.

So, without knowing the exact change in pressure, we can't say whether λ2 is more than 1.22 times λ1 or just a bit more.

But the options don't give a general 'greater than' option except for A and D. So, I have to choose between A and D.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces other effects. For example, the beam could cause the gas to become more ionized, leading to a change in the collision cross-section. If the ions have a larger effective diameter (because they're charged and perhaps larger in some sense), the collision cross-section increases, which would decrease the mean free path.

Wait, but then λ would decrease, making λ2 less than λ1, which would correspond to option C. But earlier, we thought that the number density would decrease, leading to a higher λ.

Ah, this is getting complicated. So, if the gas is ionized, two effects are possible:

1. The number density (n) decreases because ions are sticking to walls or being removed, leading to higher λ.

2. The collision cross-section (d) increases because ions are larger or more likely to collide, leading to lower λ.

Which effect dominates?

Well, if the pressure is already extremely low (ultra-high vacuum), even a small change in n would have a large effect on λ. On the other hand, if the collision cross-section increases, that would reduce λ.

But which effect is more significant?

Suppose that the number of gas molecules decreases (n decreases), which would have a more significant effect on λ than any change in d due to ionization. Because λ is inversely proportional to n, and n is dropping. So, if n decreases, λ increases.

So, in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer would be either A or D.

But I'm still not certain why option A is 1.22 times or more. Wait, I recall that the mean free path in an ideal gas can be approximated as λ = (1.33 * 10^8 nm) * (T^(0.5) / P), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the factor comes from the relation between mean speed and the average path.

Wait, another approach: The mean free path can also be expressed using the average speed v of the gas molecules. The formula λ = v * τ, where τ is the mean time between collisions.

The average speed v is sqrt(8kT/(π m)), and τ is (sqrt(2) π d² P)/(k T). So combining, λ = (sqrt(8kT/(π m))) * (sqrt(2) π d² P)/(k T) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the ideal gas law. PV = nRT. So, n = PV/(RT). The mean free path λ = 1/(sqrt(2) π d² n) = RT/(sqrt(2) π d² P).

So, if P decreases, λ increases.

In the scenario, when the beam is on, perhaps P is lower, so λ2 is higher.

But without knowing the exact change in pressure, perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So, the options that say λ2 is larger are A and D.

But why would the options give 1.22 as a factor?

Wait, I think I might be overcomplicating this. The question says that Mike accurately determined λ1, but when the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2. The key point is that the electron beam may cause the gas to ionize, which affects the mean free path in a way that depends on the ion's behavior.

Wait, another approach: in the presence of an electron beam, the gas molecules may become ionized. Ionized gas (plasma) behaves differently than neutral gas. In a plasma, the mean free path can be shorter because the charged particles experience electric forces and may collide more frequently. Alternatively, in a strong electric field, charged particles may be accelerated, leading to different collision dynamics.

Wait, but in an electron microscope, the electron beam has a high voltage, which can create an electric field. Charged gas molecules (ions) would be accelerated by this field. But in a vacuum chamber, the ions might be pulled towards the walls, which could cause them to stick or be removed by the pumps. That would reduce the pressure, leading to a longer mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions are more likely to collide with the walls, so the effective number of gas particles in the chamber decreases, which increases the mean free path.

But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam induces more electron scattering events, but that might not directly affect the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the initial determination of λ1 didn't account for the possibility of electron scattering, and λ2 is the actual value under beam operation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in electron microscopy, when the electron beam interacts with the sample, it can cause various effects like heating, charging, or even sputtering of the sample material. But in this case, the problem is about gas molecules in the chamber.

Wait, going back to the question. The correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1. So the options are A or D.

But why would the answer be C? If the mean free path decreased, that would mean λ2 < λ1. But why would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be more dense. For example, if the beam somehow heated the gas, increasing the pressure (unlikely, since the temperature is the same). Or perhaps the beam caused gas molecules to be released from the walls, increasing the pressure, thus reducing the mean free path.

But the question says the temperature remains the same, so heating due to the beam is not a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more ionized, which leads to more frequent collisions because the ions have a larger effective diameter. So, the mean free path decreases.

In that case, λ2 would be less than λ1, which would make option C correct.

But earlier, I thought that the main effect would be a decrease in n, leading to λ2 > λ1.

Hmm. I'm stuck between whether λ2 is larger or smaller. I need to decide.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure. So if the pressure decreases, the mean free path increases.

So, if the beam causes the pressure to decrease (e.g., by removing gas molecules), λ2 increases, so λ2 > λ1.

Thus, the correct answer must be either A or D.

Looking at the options again, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, and D says λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1.

So, why 1.22? Where does that number come from?

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is calculated using the formula that includes the square root of the molecular mass or something else. But I'm not recalling the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor 1.22 comes from the mean speed of the molecules. The mean free path can be expressed as λ = v_avg * τ, where v_avg is the average speed and τ is the mean time between collisions.

The average speed v_avg is sqrt(8kT/(π m)), and the mean time τ is inversely proportional to the pressure and the collision cross-section.

Wait, maybe the factor 1.22 is a ratio that comes from comparing the mean free path under different conditions, perhaps involving the beam's influence.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces a factor that changes the effective pressure by a certain amount, leading to λ2 being exactly 1.22 times λ1.

But I'm not certain. Maybe the correct approach is to think that in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules are ionized, leading to a higher collision cross-section (d increases), which would decrease the mean free path.

Wait, but that would make λ2 smaller than λ1. So this would point to option C.

But earlier, I thought that the number density decreases, leading to a longer mean free path.

Which effect is stronger? If ionization increases d, it would decrease λ. If the beam's presence reduces n, it would increase λ.

Which effect is dominant?

I think that the change in number density would have a more significant impact, especially under ultra-high vacuum conditions where even a small decrease in pressure leads to a large increase in mean free path.

So, if the number density decreases, λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Thus, the correct option is either A or D.

But the question is about the change in the mean free path when the electron beam is applied.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas is more likely to be ionized, and the ions are more likely to stick to the walls or other surfaces. So, the effective number density decreases, making λ longer.

So, λ2 is longer than λ1.

In that case, the correct answer is either A or D.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the intended answer is that λ2 increases, so the options are A or D.

Wait, but the question says that Mike accurately determined λ1, so perhaps the beam's presence doesn't change the pressure, but changes other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam causes the gas to ionize, and the ionized gas has a higher effective cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path.

But which effect is stronger?

I think I'm going in circles here. I'll have to make a decision.

Given that the electron beam is on, and the mean free path is changing, the most plausible scenario is that the pressure effectively decreases, leading to a longer mean free path.

Therefore, λ2 > λ1. So, the options are A and D.

But the options don't specify the exact factor, so perhaps the correct answer is A, where λ2 is >= 1.22 λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The initial mean free path was λ1. When the beam is on, electron scattering occurs, which may cause more gas molecules to be removed from the chamber, effectively lowering the pressure and increasing λ.

So, λ2 would be larger than λ1. Which makes options A and D possible.

But why would the answer be D, which says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1?

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is due to the beam's energy. The electron beam's energy is 1000 kV, which is 1e9 eV. That's a lot of energy, so the gas molecules could be accelerated and perhaps have more collisions.

Wait, but that would lead to more frequent collisions, shorter mean free path. So that would decrease λ2, making it smaller than λ1.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm getting too stuck, but the initial reasoning suggests that the mean free path should increase, making λ2 > λ1. So the correct answer is either A or D.

Looking at the options, the only option where λ2 is greater than λ1 is A.

But the question says that upon initiating the beam, λ2 is found. The mean free path is now λ2, not the same as before. So, the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1.

Therefore, the answer is either A or D.

But what's the reason for 1.22? Maybe it's a known factor in electron microscopy, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path in the presence of the beam is longer, but not significantly. So it's within a factor of 1.22.

But I'm not able to conclusively decide between A and D. However, the problem states that the mean free path is no longer λ1, but Mike accurately calculated λ1. So he probably accounted for all variables except the beam. When the beam is on, the pressure might decrease, but perhaps not by much, leading to λ2 being slightly larger than λ1, making option D correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is due to the beam's effect on the gas, leading to a specific increase.

But I'm not certain. The most logical conclusion seems to be that λ2 is longer than λ1, so the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, another thought: The initial λ1 is calculated under the assumption of a neutral gas. When the gas is ionized, the mean free path formula changes because the ions have a different effective diameter. But without knowing that, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is longer. So the only options are A or D.

But given that I'm not certain about the factor, perhaps the intended answer is C, but that would mean the mean free path decreases, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another angle: the electron beam could cause more scattering, thereby increasing the effective pressure inside the chamber. But that would mean λ2 decreases, which is option C.

But that doesn't make sense because the pumps would maintain the pressure. If the beam is causing gas to be released, the pressure would drop.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this. The most logical conclusion is that the mean free path increases because the effective pressure is lower when the beam is on. So, λ2 > λ1.

Among the options, A and D are possible. Without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the best choice is A: λ2 >= 1.22λ1.

But wait, the question is about the mean free path based on electron scattering. So, the beam is scattering electrons, but the gas is in the chamber.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam scatters off the gas molecules, it causes the gas to lose energy, cooling the gas. But the question says the temperature remains the same, so that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam causes the gas to expand, lowering the pressure, which would increase λ.

But again, I'm not certain.

I think the correct answer is either A or D, but I'm not sure. Maybe the intended answer is C, but in that case, the reasoning would be that the collision cross-section increases, causing λ to decrease.

But given all the back and forth, I think the correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so the answer is A or D.

Wait, looking back, the question says that Mike accurately determined λ1. So, when the beam is on, perhaps the pressure is the same, but the effective collisions are different because the gas is ionized, leading to a shorter mean free path.

So, if the pressure is the same (pumps are working) but the gas is ionized, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 < λ1, which would be option C.

But I'm not sure. This is really tricky.

After much consideration, I think the correct answer is C: λ2 < λ1. Because when the gas is ionized, the collision cross-section increases, leading to a shorter mean free path.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating under ultra-high vacuum conditions (<10⁻⁹ Torr). Initially, the mean free path is determined as λ₁ based on the given pressure, temperature, and molecular properties. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ₂, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path is given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
   \]
   where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is temperature, \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(P\) is pressure. The mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure and depends on the collision cross-section.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:
   - The electron beam can ionize gas molecules, altering their behavior. Ionized particles may stick to the chamber walls or be removed, effectively reducing the number density (\(n\)) of gas molecules in the chamber.
   - A decrease in \(n\) (due to ionization or removal) would increase the mean free path (\(\lambda\)) because \(\lambda \propto 1/n\).
   - However, ionization can also increase the effective collision cross-section (\(d\)), as charged particles interact differently, potentially decreasing \(\lambda\).

3. **Temperature and Pressure**:
   - The temperature remains constant, so changes in \(\lambda\) are due to changes in pressure or collision dynamics.
   - The vacuum pumps maintain the overall pressure, but the presence of the electron beam may alter the effective pressure by removing gas molecules or ionizing them.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a significant increase in the mean free path. While plausible if the pressure decreases significantly, the factor 1.22 is not explicitly justified in the scenario.
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This contradicts the observation that \(\lambda\) changes when the beam is initiated.
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This implies a shorter mean free path, which could occur if ionization increases the collision cross-section (\(d\)), making collisions more frequent.
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a moderate increase in \(\lambda\), which could occur if the pressure decreases slightly due to gas removal or ionization effects.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The dominant effect of the electron beam is likely ionization, which increases the effective collision cross-section (\(d\)), leading to a shorter mean free path (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)).
   - This aligns with **Option C**, as the ionized gas molecules interact more frequently, reducing the mean free path.

ANSWER: C
