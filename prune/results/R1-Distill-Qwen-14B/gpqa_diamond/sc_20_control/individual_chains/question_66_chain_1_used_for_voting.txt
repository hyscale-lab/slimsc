Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

I think SMEFT operators must respect certain symmetries. Let me think about each symmetry in the list.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I believe all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because the Standard Model itself is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and SMEFT is an effective description built from SM fields. So operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). Wait, but effective theories usually don't have Poincare symmetry? Or do they? Because effective theories are constructed in a way that they're valid up to some cutoff scale. Wait, but the SM respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT, which is based on SM fields, would too. Or wait, SMEFT operators are built as local operators, so they must respect Poincare symmetry as well because the theory is local. So 2 is correct.

Wait, is Poincare symmetry the same as Lorentz plus translations? So 2 is a superset of 1. So if 2 is respected, 1 must be as well. But the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So I need to see if all operators must respect both.

Wait, but wait. The SMEFT operators are built from local fields, so they should respect the Poincare symmetry. Because the effective theory is a Lorentz-invariant theory valid below the cutoff. So both 1 and 2 are correct? So the options that include both 1 and 2 are possible.

3. CP symmetry: I'm not sure. I remember that the SMEFT operators can violate CP symmetry because the Standard Model itself doesn't have CP conservation in all processes. For example, the CKM matrix in QCD has CP violation. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. Therefore, the operators don't need to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT is a big one. I think that any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, Lorentz invariance implies CPT conservation. So all operators in SMEFT, being Lorentz-invariant, must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

Wait, putting it together:

Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but earlier I thought Poincare requires Lorentz plus translations. So if Poincare is respected, Lorentz is as well. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So the operators must respect all three of 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but if operators must respect Poincare, then they automatically respect Lorentz. So if 2 is correct, why list 1 separately? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the hierarchy. Wait, Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare. So if operators respect Poincare, they must respect Lorentz. So in that case, which of the two is included in the answer?

Wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected. So the operators respect Poincare (which includes Lorentz), but perhaps the question is considering them separately. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Another angle: in SMEFT, operators are classified by their dimension and their quantum numbers, including symmetries. The effective theory must preserve the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The SM respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But it doesn't respect CP. So in SMEFT, all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3).

Wait, but Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetry. So operators have to respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So if 2 is correct, then 1 is automatically correct. But the question includes 1 and 2 as separate options. Hmm, the options are:

Option A) 1,2
Option C) 1,2,4

If the correct symmetries are 2 (so including 1) and 4, then the correct answer would be 1,2,4. So option C.

But wait, is Poincare symmetry actually a required symmetry for the operators? Or is it only Lorentz?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Poincare group includes translations (momentum conservation) and Lorentz transformations. SMEFT is a local effective theory, so it must respect Poincare symmetry. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, so 2 is correct, and 1 is automatically correct. But the question is asking which of the listed symmetries must be respected. So if 2 is correct, 1 is also correct, but the options have 1 and 2 as two separate points.

Wait, the question is which of the following symmetries must be respected, not which is the minimal set. So if 2 is correct, then 1 is correct as a subset.

But looking at the choices, option C is 1,2,4. So all three are correct, and option C includes them.

Wait, but what about CPT? Oh, right, because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, CPT must be conserved. So 4 is correct regardless of 2.

Wait, but all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT. So since all operators are Lorentz-invariant, they must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: the operators must respect 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Wait, but if 2 is correct, then 1 is correct. So the symmetries 1,2,4 are all correct. So option C) 1,2,4.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but some sources say that the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, and because it's a low-energy theory, it's also Poincare invariant. So yes, both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but wait a moment. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but is it Poincare-invariant? Because in effective theories, sometimes you have operators that can break some symmetries beyond the SM. Wait, no, because the effective theory is an extension of the SM, which is Poincare-invariant. So SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. So the answer is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect certain symmetries, which are determined by the structure of the theory and its connection to the Standard Model.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. Operators are built as Lorentz scalars.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a local effective theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. This symmetry ensures the validity of the theory across different spacetime regions and momentum scales.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all SMEFT operators. The Standard Model already contains sources of CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT operators can explicitly violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry must be respected by all SMEFT operators because Lorentz-invariant theories automatically conserve CPT. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it follows that CPT symmetry is preserved.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination is provided in option **C**.
