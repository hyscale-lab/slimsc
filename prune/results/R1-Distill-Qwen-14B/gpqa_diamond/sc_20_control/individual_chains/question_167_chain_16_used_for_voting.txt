Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh right, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, which are Gaussian states. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, right? So normally, they're Gaussian, but when you superpose them, the resulting state can be non-Gaussian, especially when the superposition has a significant interference term.

The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Wait, when phi is -pi/4, let me plug that in. So sin(2*(-pi/4)) is sin(-pi/2), which is -1. So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1)* exp(-2*(0.5)^2)). Let me compute that. Exp(-2*(0.25)) is exp(-0.5), approximately 0.6065. So N squared is 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935), approximately 0.627.

Wait, but the exact value might not matter for this calculation. The question is about the non-Gaussianity, which is the relative entropy between the state's rho and a reference Gaussian state tau. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So this is the relative entropy between the two states.

Wait, but relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Oh wait, but in this case, it's given as trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau). So that's actually S(rho||tau) + S(tau||rho). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different definition. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the relative entropy is in this context. The standard relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). Alternatively, some people define it as S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But the given formula here is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] which would be S(rho||tau) + trace(tau ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau) ??? Hmm, perhaps the formula is the mutual information or something else. Maybe I should double-check the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says del_b is defined as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). So that's S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. But wait, the von Neumann entropy of a state rho is S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho). So in that case, our del_b is (-S(rho)) - (- S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). Wait, but that would be negative of the relative entropy in some sense. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait, maybe the problem is using del_b as the relative entropy, but perhaps it's defined as S(rho) - S(tau), which is the von Neumann entropy of rho minus that of tau. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] which is (-S(rho)) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho). Wait, but del_b would then be negative of S(rho) relative to S(tau).

But the problem is about non-Gaussianity, which is usually a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states have maximum entropy for their covariance matrix, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if tau is a Gaussian state, like a thermal state or a coherent state, then comparing rho to tau might tell us about non-Gaussianity.

Wait, but wait a second. The state in question is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but a superposition of two distinct coherent states is non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, and tau is a reference Gaussian state. The relative entropy between them could measure how non-Gaussian |psi> is.

But wait, if the state is a Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, then for certain parameters, the state is highly non-Gaussian. For phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, what does the state look like?

Phi is -pi/4, so 2 phi is -pi/2. The coefficients are cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707 and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.707. So the state is (0.707 |alpha> - 0.707 |-alpha> ) / N.

Wait, but the normalization N when phi is -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, as I computed earlier, is about 0.627. So the state is a superposition with equal coefficients (in magnitude) for |alpha> and |-alpha>, but with a phase difference.

Now, to find the non-Gaussianity, which is the relative entropy del_b. So I need to compute del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait, but how is tau defined? The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the density matrix of a coherent state, or a thermal state, or another Gaussian state. But which one? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps in this case, the reference state is a coherent state. Alternatively, maybe it's a maximally mixed Gaussian state.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give more details on what tau is. Hmm. That complicates things. How can we proceed without knowing what tau is?

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that when the state is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity is zero. So when is the state |psi> Gaussian?

Wait, coherent states are Gaussian. What about the state |psi>? If the state is a coherent state, then it's Gaussian. So when would |psi> be a coherent state?

Let me see. The state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. For |psi> to be a coherent state, the superposition must result in another coherent state.

Wait, wait. Let's think: coherent states are overcomplete, and a superposition of two coherent states is another coherent state only under specific conditions. For example, |beta> = cos(theta)|alpha> + e^{i phi} sin(theta)|-alpha>. Or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is zero, the state becomes |alpha> / N, but N would be 1 in that case, so it's just |alpha>, which is Gaussian.

Similarly, if phi is pi/2, then the state is sin(pi/2)|-alpha> = |-alpha>, which is Gaussian.

So for phi =0 or phi=pi/2, the state is Gaussian. So in those cases, the non-Gaussianity would be zero. But in other cases, like phi=-pi/4, it's a superposition of two coherent states and thus non-Gaussian.

Wait, but the problem gives phi as -pi/4 and alpha=0.5. So the state is a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, with coefficients equal in magnitude, but with a phase. So this is a non-Gaussian state.

So the non-Gaussianity is non-zero. But the question is to calculate it using the relative entropy.

But without knowing what the reference Gaussian state tau is, I'm a bit stuck. The problem says tau is a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the density matrix of a thermal Gaussian state, or a coherent state. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the maximally mixed Gaussian state.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the relative entropy is being used to compare the given state to the closest Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the Gaussian state closest to rho. Then the relative entropy would be the difference in entropy, which could be a measure of non-Gaussianity.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a particular state, like a coherent state, which is the most similar to the state in question.

Wait, but the problem states that tau is a reference Gaussian state. So maybe it's the same as the state |alpha> or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a Gaussian state, the relative entropy would be zero, and when it's non-Gaussian, it's positive. So in this case, the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b would be positive.

But the options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

Wait, option D is 0, which would mean the state is Gaussian. But earlier I thought that only when phi is 0 or pi/2, the state is Gaussian. So in this case, phi is -pi/4, which is not 0 or pi/2, so the state is non-Gaussian. So the del_b should not be zero, so D is incorrect.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. So perhaps if the superposition is a coherent state, the state is Gaussian. Alternatively, maybe the state is Gaussian only if the coefficients in the superposition are coherent.

Wait, perhaps when the phase phi is such that the coefficients are arranged to form another coherent state. Let's see. For a state like |beta> = e^{i theta} |alpha> + e^{-i theta} |-alpha>, perhaps this can be a coherent state under certain conditions.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the density matrix of the state |psi> is |psi><psi|.

The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau).

But the problem's del_b is defined as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Hmm, that's the same as S(rho) - S(tau), but with a negative sign, because S(rho) is -trace(rho ln rho). Wait, no.

Wait, S(rho) = -trace(rho ln rho). So trace(rho ln rho) = - S(rho). Similarly, trace(tau ln tau) = - S(tau). So del_b = [ - S(rho) ] - [ - S(tau) ] = S(tau) - S(rho). So del_b = S(tau) - S(rho).

Wait, but that would be positive if S(tau) is larger than S(rho). But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), which would be positive if rho is more mixed than tau.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the definition. Let's think about what the relative entropy represents. The relative entropy S(rho||tau) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is always non-negative. But the problem's del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), which can be written as (- S(rho)) - (- S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). So del_b = S(tau) - S(rho).

Wait, so if the state rho is more non-Gaussian, perhaps it's less mixed, so S(rho) is smaller than S(tau). Therefore, S(tau) - S(rho) would be positive, so del_b is positive. So a positive value indicates higher non-Gaussianity.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should look for another approach.

Wait, wait. Another approach: since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, perhaps the density matrix can be expressed in terms of their overlap. The density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Wigner function and see if it's non-Gaussian, but that's more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity in this context is zero only when the state is Gaussian, which is when phi is zero or pi/2. For other values, it's non-zero.

But the problem asks us to compute del_b for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is actually Gaussian. Because then the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because when phi is -pi/4, the state is a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5> with equal coefficients, which should form a non-Gaussian state.

Wait, but wait, perhaps when alpha=0.5 and phi=-pi/4, the state is a coherent state. Let me think. The state would be (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2). Because cos(-pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4)= -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is [sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha> ] / N.

So N squared is 1 + sin(2*(-pi/4)) exp(-2 alpha²) = 1 + (-1) exp(-0.5). So N is sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

Wait, but is this state a coherent state? Let me think about when a superposition of two coherent states is itself a coherent state.

A general coherent state is |beta> = e^{-|beta|^2/2} sum (beta^n /sqrt(n!}) |n>. A superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> can sometimes be another coherent state. For example, |beta> = (|alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha> ) / N. For certain alpha and theta, this can be a coherent state.

Wait, perhaps when theta=pi, then e^{i theta} = -1. So the state becomes (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N. Let me see if this can be a coherent state.

The state (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N—can that be another coherent state? Let's compute it. Let me think in terms of the displacement operator. The displacement operator D(beta) takes |alpha> to |alpha + beta>.

Wait, perhaps when you have |alpha> - |-alpha>, you can write that as something else. Let me compute it.

Wait, |alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum (alpha^n / sqrt(n!}) |n>, and |-alpha> is similar with (-alpha)^n.

So |alpha> - |-alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum [ (alpha^n - (-alpha)^n ) / sqrt(n!} ) |n> ].

Which is zero for even n, and for odd n, 2 alpha^{n} / sqrt(n!} ), multiplied by e^{-|alpha|^2/2}.

So the state is proportional to sum_{n odd} [ alpha^n / sqrt(n!} ) |n> ].

Which is a superposition of all the odd photon number states. That's definitely a non-Gaussian state, right? Because Gaussian states (like coherent states) have Poissonian statistics, but this state has a different distribution, so it's non-Gaussian.

So the state in question is non-Gaussian, and thus the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so options A, B, or C.

But the problem is to compute del_b, which is S(tau) - S(rho) according to earlier analysis.

Wait, but perhaps I can reason about the entropy. Since the state rho is non-Gaussian, maybe it's more pure than a Gaussian state, so S(rho) < S(tau), making del_b positive.

Wait, S(rho) is the von Neumann entropy of rho. A state with higher purity (closer to a pure state) has lower entropy. So if rho is non-Gaussian, perhaps it's more pure than the reference Gaussian tau, which might be a maximally mixed state.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the thermal state with the same average photon number as rho.

Wait, but this is getting complicated, and perhaps I don't have enough information to calculate this without knowing exactly what tau is.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is a coherent state. Let's say tau is |alpha><alpha|. Then, the entropy S(tau) would be zero because it's a pure state. But rho is a mixed state (since it's a superposition of two coherent states), so S(rho) would be positive. Therefore, del_b would be S(tau) - S(rho) = 0 - S(rho) = - S(rho), which is negative. But the problem might have the relative entropy defined as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), which would be (- S(rho)) - (- S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). So if tau is a pure state (like |alpha>), then S(tau) is zero, so del_b would be negative. But the options are all positive except D, which is zero. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a maximally mixed state, which has maximum entropy. Then, S(tau) would be as large as possible, so S(tau) - S(rho) would be positive, making del_b positive, indicating non-Gaussianity.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the state |psi> is a NOON state or something similar, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: the relative entropy between rho and tau is the same as the mutual information between the state and the reference. But without knowing tau, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Because the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian. But if the phase phi is such that the superposition is another coherent state, then the overall state would be Gaussian, leading to del_b being zero. But for phi=-pi/4, is that the case?

Wait, let me see. Let's check if the state can be written as a single coherent state. For a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, when can this be another coherent state?

Suppose |beta> = e^{i theta} |alpha> + e^{-i theta} |-alpha>. Let's compute this. For |beta> to be a coherent state, it must satisfy the displacement property, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when you have |alpha> and |-alpha> with opposite phases, their sum is another coherent state.

Wait, perhaps let's compute |beta> = |alpha> - |-alpha>.

Expressed as |beta> = (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2). Let's calculate the expansion.

|alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum (alpha^n /sqrt(n!}) |n>, and |-alpha> is e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum ( (-alpha)^n /sqrt(n!}) |n>.

So |alpha> - |-alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum [ (alpha^n - (-alpha)^n ) / sqrt(n!} ) |n> ].

Which for even n, (alpha^n - (-alpha)^n ) is zero, and for odd n, it's 2 alpha^n.

So this state is a superposition of only the odd photon number states. That's a highly non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So del_b is non-zero, so option D is out.

But wait, the problem says calculate the non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Without knowing the exact form of tau, perhaps the problem is designed such that the non-Gaussianity is zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another angle: perhaps the state is a cat state, which is an even or odd state. Wait, even and odd coherent states are Gaussian, right? Because they are superpositions of even or odd photon number states, but they're still Gaussian.

Wait, no. Wait, even and odd coherent states are Gaussian states. For example, the even coherent state is a superposition of even photon numbers, and it's Gaussian. The same for the odd. So if the state in the problem is an odd coherent state, then it's Gaussian. So perhaps when phi is -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is an odd coherent state, which is Gaussian. Thus, the non-Gaussianity would be zero, making option D correct.

Wait, but the state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N. For the case when N=1, that would be the odd coherent state. But in our case, N is sqrt(1 - exp(-alpha²)).

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, and the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N, this is precisely the odd coherent state. But wait, no, the odd coherent state is |beta> = (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/(sqrt(2)) when |beta> is normalized. Wait, no, perhaps it's more involved.

Wait, perhaps the state is an even or odd coherent state, which are Gaussian. So if that's the case, then the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

Wait, but in the problem, the state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. When phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2 and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2 * N^2). Wait, but N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). With phi=-pi/4, sin(2phi)=sin(-pi/2)= -1. So N is sqrt(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Wait, for alpha=0.5, exp(-2*(0.5)^2)=exp(-0.5)=approx 0.6065. So N= sqrt(1-0.6065)=sqrt(0.3935)≈0.6274.

So the state is ( |0.5> - |-0.5> ) / (0.6274 * sqrt(2)).

Wait, but the odd coherent state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2). So our state is (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) divided by 0.6274 * sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.6274 * 1.414 ≈ 0.887. So the state is (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) / 0.887, which is different from the odd coherent state which is normalized to 1.

Wait, but regardless of normalization, the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients of equal magnitude. So it's an odd state, like an odd coherent state. Are odd coherent states considered Gaussian?

Yes, I think they are. Because they can be written as a displaced vacuum state with some parameters. So if the state is an odd coherent state, then it's Gaussian. Thus, the non-Gaussianity would be zero, making option D the correct answer.

Wait a second, but I thought earlier that a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. But perhaps when it's an odd or even coherent state, which are known Gaussian states. I might have been mistaken earlier.

So, if the state is an odd coherent state, then it's a Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity would be zero. Therefore, the correct answer is D) 0.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we analyze the state:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( \alpha \) is the amplitude, \( \phi \) is the phase, and \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} \) is the normalization constant. The relative entropy is defined as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{trace}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{trace}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \( \rho \) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state \( |\psi\rangle \), and \( \tau \) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Observations:
1. **Gaussian vs. Non-Gaussian States**: Coherent states \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( |-\alpha\rangle \) are Gaussian. A superposition of two distinct coherent states is generally non-Gaussian unless it forms another coherent state or an even/odd coherent state, which are still Gaussian.

2. **Case for \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \)**:
   - Substituting \( \phi = -\pi/4 \), we find \( \cos(\phi) = \sin(\phi) = \sqrt{2}/2 \), so the state becomes:
     \[
     |\psi\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{2}/2 \, |\alpha\rangle - \sqrt{2}/2 \, |-\alpha\rangle}{N}.
     \]
   - The normalization constant is \( N = \sqrt{1 - e^{-2\alpha^2}} \). For \( \alpha = 0.5 \), \( e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065 \), so \( N \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} = \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6274 \).

3. **Nature of the State**:
   - The state \( |\psi\rangle \) is a superposition of \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( |-\alpha\rangle \). For \( \phi = -\pi/4 \), the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( |-\alpha\rangle \) are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. This corresponds to an **odd coherent state**, which is a Gaussian state.

4. **Non-Gaussianity**:
   - Since the state \( |\psi\rangle \) is an odd coherent state, it is Gaussian. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity \( \text{nG} \) is zero.

### Conclusion:
The non-Gaussianity of the state for \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \) is zero because the state is Gaussian.
