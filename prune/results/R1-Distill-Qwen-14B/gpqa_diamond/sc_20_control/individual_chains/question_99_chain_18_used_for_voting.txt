Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the other peak is at 1700 cm^-1. That's a strong peak which I think is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, carboxylic acids have both O-H and carbonyl. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. That makes sense because the broad peak is probably the O-H from the carboxylic acid group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The question says none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. That rules out any alkenes or aromatic rings, which is good because that would complicate things.

Now, the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's break it down. Splitting patterns indicate how many neighboring protons each hydrogen is seeing.

In the first case, a doublet of triplets of quartets. So maybe each proton is split by two different sets of neighboring Hs. Wait, quartets happen when a proton has three neighboring Hs. So if a proton is next to a CH2 group, it might split into a quartet. Then the triplet part could be from another neighboring group, and the doublet from another.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the compounds given. Let's look at the options.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure would be like (CH3)(C2H5)C-H-C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, maybe it's more like a branched structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-CO... Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-COOH. No, wait, maybe the structure is a geminal di-substituted group, like two substituents on a central carbon. So maybe the structure is something like (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-COOH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at all four options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So that's two CH2CH3 (ethyl) groups and two CH3 groups attached to the central C? Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central carbon would have two ethyl groups and two CH3 groups? No, wait, maybe it's a four-carbon chain. Wait, maybe it's isopropyl groups attached to a central carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the central carbons has two substituents. Let me think about each option.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So that's a chain where after CH2CH3, there's a C which has two CH3 groups attached. So it's like CH2CH3-C(CH3)2-COOH? Or maybe CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So that would make the central carbons each have two substituents.

Wait, perhaps each of the two central carbons has a CH3 and an ethyl group or something else. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the splitting in the NMR.

So in the NMR, the absence of vinyl protons suggests that all the protons are in CH2, CH3, or other non-vinylic environments. So looking back, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That sounds like a complex splitting pattern. Let's think of how that could happen.

In a splitting pattern, each split is due to coupling with neighboring protons. So a quartet (n=3) comes from coupling with 3 equivalent protons. A triplet (n=2) comes from coupling with 2. A doublet (n=1) comes from coupling with 1.

So if a proton is split first by a group that gives a quartet, then another group introduces a triplet, and another gives a doublet, that would be a quartet of triplets as the first level, then each of those splits into triplets, etc. Wait, no, the order is from the most splitting to least. Or perhaps each coupling is happening with different sets of protons.

Wait, maybe it's a doublet of triplets of quartets. So each peak is first split into a quartet (by a group of 3 Hs), then each of those splits into a triplet (another group of 2 Hs), and then each becomes a doublet (from a group of 1 H). Or maybe it's the other way around in terms of the order.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a more complex splitting due to being adjacent to multiple different sets of protons. For example, if a CH2 group is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, but that might complicate things.

Wait, considering the structure, perhaps in the molecule, there's a central carbon connected to two ethyl groups and two other groups. Let me think about the NMR signals.

In the options, some have ethyl groups and some have methyl groups attached to the central carbons.

Let me think about the substituents. For each CH group, the protons attached would be split by neighboring groups.

Take option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the structure would be CH2CH3-C(CH3)2-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, maybe it's more like (CH3)(CH3)C-C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Hmm, no, perhaps each central C has two substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CH-CH(CH2COOH)-something. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3-C(CH3)-C(CH3)-COOH. Wait, that would make the middle carbons each having a CH3 and another substituent. So perhaps each of these central carbons is connected to CH3 groups and other parts.

So, the H on each of the central carbons would be between two groups. For example, each CH group is between two carbons, each with their own substituents.

In the NMR, each of these Hs would couple with neighboring Hs from adjacent CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the central Hs are each next to two CH3 groups and another CH group. Let me think: if the structure is CH2CH3-C(CH3)CH(CH2COOH)CH3, no, perhaps not.

Alternatively, considering that each of the central carbons is connected to two ethyl or methyl groups. Let's take option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure would have the central carbons each connected to an ethyl group and another group. So, for example, C(H)(C2H5) groups attached to each of two central carbons, which are next to each other.

Now, the H on each of these central carbons would have neighboring Hs from adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the central structure is like:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So each of the two middle Cs has a C2H5 group and a H attached. Then the H on each of these middle Cs would be adjacent to each other.

So the H on each middle C would be next to H on the adjacent C, and perhaps also next to other Hs elsewhere.

Wait, if the structure is like CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH, then the two middle CH groups are adjacent to each other. Each H on the middle C would couple with the H on the adjacent C, and perhaps with some other groups.

In that structure, each H on the middle C would be next to another H on the adjacent C. So each would split into a doublet because each H is adjacent to one H. But that might not explain the complicated splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is adjacent to a CH2 group, which would cause splitting into a quartet. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the FTIR has a carbonyl peak, which could be from a carboxylic acid. So looking at the options, all of them end with COOH, except perhaps I'm reading them wrong. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH â†’ so the COOH is at the end.

Similarly, all options have COOH as the terminal group. So each structure is a substituted carboxylic acid.

So the main part is the substituents before COOH.

Now, each structure has a chain leading to COOH. Let's analyze the NMR.

The NMR shows several peaks; none are vinyl. So all Hs are in CH2, CH3, or CH groups, possibly geminal.

The key is the splitting pattern: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm. Let's think about how each structure would give such splitting.

In option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the two middle carbons each have a CH3 and a H. The CH2CH3 is on the first C, and the last C is COOH.

Now, the Hs on the middle carbons (C2 and C3) would be adjacent to each other. Each of these Hs is next to the H on the adjacent C. So each H on C2 would be next to the H on C3, and perhaps also next to other Hs.

Wait, let me model this. Suppose the structure is:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the C2 (middle left) has H and a CH3, and is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3. The C3 has H, CH3, and is connected to C4 (COOH).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. Each of these Hs would couple with the H on the adjacent C, giving a doublet (n=1). But what else is around?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group from the COOH is also involved. Hmm, no, the COOH is at the end. Wait, in the structure, the COOH is CH2COOH? No, looking at option D, it's CH3CH2C...COOH. So the COOH is attached to the C which is already substituted. Let me clarify:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the COOH is attached to the fourth carbon. So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the chain is like CH2CH3 attached to a C, which has a CH3 and a H. Then another C, which has a CH3 and a H, and then COOH. So the main chain is four carbons: 1 (CH2CH3), 2 (CH(CH3)), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (COOH).

So the H on C2 (the first CH group) is adjacent to C3's H. Each of these Hs would split into a doublet. But also, what about the neighboring groups on each side?

The C2 H is next to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)). Or wait, C1 is CH2CH3, which is a CH2 group. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the CH2 group on C1, which has two Hs. So the H on C2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs of the adjacent CH2.

Additionally, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. So each of the Hs on C2 would be split by the two Hs from C1 and the one H from C3.

Wait, no, the coupling would be between adjacent carbons. So H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 and C3's CH.

Wait, C1 is CH2CH3, which has two Hs on the CH2. The H on C2 is adjacent to the Hs on C1's CH2 (which is a CH2 group, so two Hs). So the H on C2 would split into a triplet (n=2) from the CH2. Additionally, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. So each of the Hs on C2 would have coupling with both the two Hs from C1 and the one H from C3.

So the splitting would be a triplet (from C1's CH2) that is further split by the H on C3 into a doublet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of doublets (each triplet peak splits into two, so 2x3=6 lines? Or maybe a doublet of triplets, depending on the order of splitting).

Wait, but in the question, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps C2 and C3 are each CH groups, and each has a CH3 substituent. So each H on C2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the CH2 on C1) and one H (on C3). So the splitting would be triplet (from C1's CH2) and doublet (from C3's H), making each H on C2 as a triplet of doublets, which would be a doublet of triplets when considering the order? Wait, the order depends on the number of neighboring Hs. Wait, no, the splitting order is determined by the number of neighboring Hs. The larger number comes first. So if a proton is split by 2 Hs (triplet) and 1 H (doublet), the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which would result in six peaks.

But the question says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH groups (C2 and C3) are each adjacent to another group. Let me think of option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

So structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

In this case, each of the middle CH groups (C2 and C3) is next to an ethyl group. So the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H and perhaps to the ethyl groups on C2 and C3.

Wait, but ethyl groups are CH2CH3, so their Hs are in CH2 and CH3. So the H on C2 is next to C3's H, and possibly also next to the ethyl groups on C2 and C3. Hmm, but the ethyl groups are attached to C2 and C3, so their Hs are on the CH2 and CH3. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the H on C3, which is one H, and perhaps the ethyl groups on either side. But the ethyl groups are attached to C2 and C3, so their Hs are not directly adjacent to the H on C2. So the H on C2 would only be adjacent to the H on C3, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but that doesn't explain the complicated splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH group (C2 and C3) is connected to a CH2 group. For example, if the structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH, but I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Wait, looking back, option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. Wait, no, it's CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So each middle C has a C2H5 group and a H. So C2 is connected to CH2CH3, C3 is connected to C2H5 and the next C, which is the COOH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like: CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H, which is one H. So each H on C2 would split into a doublet. But wait, what else is adjacent? Are there any other Hs nearby?

If the C2 H is also adjacent to some other Hs, like from a CH2 group, that would cause more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C2 and C3 are split by each other and by the ethyl groups' Hs.

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1, doublet), and also adjacent to the ethyl groups on C2 and C3, which have CH2 and CH3. But the ethyl groups are attached to the same carbon as the H, so their Hs are not adjacent to the H on C2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about the splitting patterns again.

The NMR shows one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's think about what that would look like.

Quartet (n=3): each peak splits into 4 peaks. Triplet (n=2): splits into 3. Doublet (n=1): splits into 2.

So the overall pattern would be a quartet, each of which splits into triplets, then each of those splits into doublets. That would be a quartet of triplets of doublets, but the order of splitting can affect the appearance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would be a (doublet) of (triplet of quartets). So each peak splits into a doublet, then each doublet splits into a triplet, and each triplet into a quartet.

But how would a proton end up with such a complex splitting? It must be coupled with three different sets of protons, each with a different number.

Let me imagine a proton that is next to three different groups:

1. A group with 3 Hs (quartet splitting)
2. A group with 2 Hs (triplet splitting)
3. A group with 1 H (doublet splitting)

Wait, but that would require the proton to be adjacent to three different groups, each providing a different number of neighboring Hs. That seems a bit unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to two adjacent groups, each causing their own splitting.

Wait, perhaps the proton is part of a CH group that is adjacent to a CH2 group and a CH group. Let's say:

The structure is CH2-CH(A)-CH2-..., so the H on CH(A) would be adjacent to the CH2 group (2 Hs) and possibly another group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule has a branching that leads to a complex coupling.

Looking at option D again: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

In this structure, the C2 and C3 are each CH groups with CH3 substituents.

The H on C2 would be adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), and also adjacent to the CH2 group on C1 (n=2). So the H on C2 would split into a triplet (from C1's CH2) and then each peak in the triplet would split into a doublet (from C3's H). So the overall pattern would be a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the question says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So this might not fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to a CH2 group and a CH group which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 group. Let me think.

Suppose the structure is something like CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is next to a CH2 group (n=2), which is next to a CH group (n=1). So the H on C2 would first split into a triplet (from CH2), then each triplet peak would split into a doublet (from CH adjacent), making it a triplet of doublets.

But the question says a doublet of triplets of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The Hs on the two middle Cs are each adjacent to one H (from the other middle C) and perhaps other groups.

Wait, the CH2 group at the end (CH2COOH) would have two Hs, so the Hs on the middle Cs would be adjacent to each other (n=1) and also to the CH2 group (n=2). So the H on each middle C would split into a triplet (from CH2), and each triplet would split into a doublet (from the adjacent H on the other middle C). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets. But the question says a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, but the CH2 group has two Hs, so each H on the middle C would have coupling with these two Hs, leading to a triplet. Then, the adjacent H on the other middle C would cause a doublet. So each peak in the triplet would split into a doublet, leading to a triplet of doublets, which is six peaks. But the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the middle C is also adjacent to another group with three Hs. For example, if the middle C is next to a CH2CH3 group, which has two Hs on the CH2. But that might not add up.

Wait, maybe another scenario: the H on C2 is adjacent to a CH2 group (n=2), which is adjacent to another CH2 group (n=2), and perhaps a CH group (n=1). So the splitting would be a triplet (from first CH2), then each triplet splits into a triplet (from second CH2), and each of those splits into a doublet (from CH). That would be a triplet of triplets of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Wait, but the question has a doublet of triplets of triplets as one of the signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH (n=1), a CH2 (n=2), and another CH2 (n=2). But that might lead to a more complex pattern than what's described.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A or D.

Let's think about the number of signals. The NMR has several signals, so perhaps there are different types of Hs.

But the question mentions that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So perhaps the molecule has two distinct H environments with such splitting patterns.

In option D: The structure is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

In this case, the two middle Hs (on C2 and C3) are in the same environment, so they would be a singlet? No, because they are adjacent. Wait, if C2 and C3 are both CH groups with CH3 substituents, then their Hs would be equivalent if the molecule is symmetric. So maybe they would be a singlet. But that's not the case here because the substituents on each C are different.

Wait, no, C2 has CH3 and CH2CH3 attached, while C3 has CH3 and COOH. So their environments are different, so their Hs are not equivalent. Thus, each would have their own splitting.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and the CH2 from C1 (n=2). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets.

Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2's H (n=1) and perhaps the CH2 from C4 (but C4 is COOH, which is a CH2 group? No, the COOH is -COOH, which would be a carbonyl group, so the adjacent group would be a CH2 or a CH. Wait, the structure is CH3CH2C...COOH, so the COOH is attached to the last C, which is probably a CH group.

Wait, maybe the H on C3 is adjacent to C4's H (if C4 is CH), but in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the last C is COOH, which is a carbonyl group attached to an -OH. So the structure would have the last C as a CH2-COOH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to a CH2 group, leading to a triplet, and to the H on C2, leading to a doublet.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the actual structure and see what the H NMR would look like.

Let me try to model option D.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So:

C1: CH2CH3
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: COOH (probably a CH2COOH group? Or is it a CH that's attached to COOH?)

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. No, looking at option D, it's CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the COOH is attached directly to C3, which is a CH group.

So the structure would be:

C1: CH2CH3
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: COOH (attached to C3)

Wait, but that would make C3 as CH(CH3)COOH. So the H on C3 would be adjacent to C4's COOH group, which is a carbonyl. But the H on C3 is on a CH group attached to C4, which is a carbonyl (so no Hs there). So the H on C3 is only adjacent to C2's H and perhaps the CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent only to C2's H. So the splitting would be a doublet (n=1). But the question says more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (n=2) and C3's H (n=1), leading to a triplet of doublets.

Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2's H (n=1) and perhaps another group, like C4's CH2?

Wait, if C4 is a CH2COOH, then the H on C3 would be adjacent to the Hs on C4's CH2, which is two Hs, leading to a triplet. So the splitting for H on C3 would be a triplet (from C4's CH2) and a doublet (from C2's H), making a triplet of doublets.

But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (n=2) and C3's H (n=1), leading to a triplet of doublets. Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2's H (n=1) and perhaps C4's CH2 (n=2), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So perhaps in the NMR, the Hs on C2 and C3 would each have their own splitting patterns, one being a triplet of doublets and the other a doublet of triplets.

But the question states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, maybe the quartets come from coupling with a CH2 group elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are also adjacent to a CH2 group with three Hs. Wait, but CH2 has two Hs. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try another approach. Perhaps I should consider the possible structures and their NMR signals.

Looking at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The Hs on the middle carbons (C2 and C3) are each adjacent to a C2H5 group and a H. The CH2 group is at the end.

So the Hs on C2 and C3 would each be adjacent to the H on the other middle C (n=1). Also, perhaps adjacent to the CH2 group at the end.

Wait, but the CH2 group (C4) is at the end, so the Hs on C3 would be adjacent to C4's CH2 (n=2). So the H on C3 would split into a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from C2's H), leading to a triplet of doublets (or vice versa).

Similarly, the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and perhaps the CH2CH3 group on C1. But C1 is CH3, so the adjacent group is CH3 (n=3?), but wait, CH3 groups are attached to C2. So maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 group on C2 (n=3?), leading to a quartet.

Wait, but the CH3 is attached to C2. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the three Hs of the CH3 group on C2. So that would cause a quartet (n=3), and also adjacent to C3's H (n=1), causing a doublet. So the splitting would be a quartet of doublets, which is a doublet of quartets. But the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Hmm, this seems a bit off. Maybe I'm not considering the branching correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to a CH2 group on C1 (n=2) and a CH3 group on C2 (n=3), leading to a quartet of triplets, and another splitting from C3's H. But that would be a quartet of triplets of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets of quartets when considering the order.

Wait, if the H on C2 is coupled with 3 Hs (quartet), 2 Hs (triplet), and 1 H (doublet), that would lead to a quartet of triplets of doublets, but that's more than the question describes. The question has a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests the order is doublet (n=1), then triplet (n=2), then quartet (n=3).

So perhaps the H is first split by a group with 1 H (doublet), then each peak splits into a triplet (n=2), and each of those splits into a quartet (n=3). So the order would be doublet of triplets of quartets.

In which structure would a H be coupled with three different groups, providing 1, 2, and 3 Hs respectively?

Looking at option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H (n=1), and perhaps the ethyl groups on C2 and C3. The ethyl groups are -C2H5, which are attached to C2 and C3. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the ethyl groups' Hs. But the ethyl groups are attached to the same C, so their Hs are not adjacent to the H on C2. So the H on C2 is only adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and perhaps the CH2CH3 group on C1.

Ah, wait, C1 is CH2CH3, which has two Hs on the CH2. So the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (n=2) and C3's H (n=1). So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from C3's H), leading to a triplet of doublets (or a doublet of triplets).

But the question mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps option B isn't the right fit.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to another group with 3 Hs, like a CH3 group. Looking at option B, the substituents are ethyl groups, which are -CH2CH3. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and C1's CH2 (n=2). No CH3 groups nearby, so no quartet splitting.

Hmm. Let me think about option A again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So C1 is CH3, C2 is C(H)(C2H5), C3 is C(H)(C2H5), C4 is CH2, C5 is COOH.

The H on C2 would be adjacent to C1's CH3 (n=3), C3's H (n=1), and the CH2 group on C4 (n=2).

Wait, that would mean the H on C2 is adjacent to three different groups: CH3 (n=3), CH2 (n=2), and H on C3 (n=1). So the splitting would be a quartet (n=3) from the CH3, then each peak in the quartet splits into a triplet (n=2) from the CH2, and each of those splits into a doublet (n=1) from the H on C3.

So the overall splitting would be a quartet of triplets of doublets. But the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, the order is different.

Wait, perhaps the order in which the couplings occur affects the pattern. The stronger coupling (more Hs) would come first. So the quartet (n=3) would come first, then the triplet (n=2), then the doublet (n=1). So the splitting would be quartet of triplets of doublets, which is different from what's described.

But the question says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another option is option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H (n=1), and perhaps the CH3 groups on C2 and C3.

Wait, the H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 groups on C2 and C3, but those are attached to the same C, so their Hs are not adjacent. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and the CH2 group on C4 (n=2). So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from C3's H), leading to a triplet of doublets.

Not matching the question's description.

Hmm. Let me think again. The correct answer must have a H that is coupled to three different groups, providing n=1, n=2, and n=3.

Looking at option A again, the H on C2 is coupled to:

- C1's CH3 (n=3): quartet
- C3's H (n=1): doublet
- C4's CH2 (n=2): triplet

So the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3), each peak in the quartet would split into a triplet (from CH2), and each of those split into a doublet (from C3's H). So the overall pattern would be a quartet of triplets of doublets. But the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a different order.

Wait, perhaps the order is determined by the strength of the coupling. The strongest coupling (largest n) comes first. So quartet comes first, then triplet, then doublet. So the splitting would be quartet of triplets of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets of quartets when considering the order of the question. Wait, no. The question says a doublet of triplets of quartets, which indicates the order: first split into doublet, then each doublet splits into triplet, then each triplet splits into quartet.

So the first split is a doublet (n=1), then each of those splits into triplet (n=2), then each triplet splits into quartet (n=3). That would require the H to be coupled with three different groups, in the order of 1, 2, 3 Hs.

In which structure would a H be coupled with a group with 1 H, then 2 Hs, then 3 Hs?

Looking at option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (n=2), C3's H (n=1), and perhaps another group with n=3. But I don't see a group with n=3 in option B. The substituents are ethyl groups, which are CH2CH3. So no CH3 groups, so no n=3 Hs. So option B can't have a quartet splitting.

Option A has CH3 groups attached to C2 and C3. So the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH3 (n=3), C3's H (n=1), and C4's CH2 (n=2). So the coupling is n=3, n=2, n=1.

So the first splitting would be a quartet (n=3), then each of those splits into a triplet (n=2), then each triplet into a doublet (n=1). So the overall pattern would be a quartet of triplets of doublets.

But the question's pattern is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is the reverse order.

Wait, perhaps the question's description is written in the order of the first split being the lowest n. So the first split is doublet (n=1), then triplet (n=2), then quartet (n=3). So the H is first split by a group with 1 H, then each peak splits into triplet (2 Hs), then each of those splits into quartet (3 Hs).

In which structure does a proton have three different neighboring groups with 1, 2, and 3 Hs, respectively, and the order of splitting is n=1, then n=2, then n=3?

Perhaps option A fits this scenario.

Wait, the H on C2 in option A is adjacent to:

- C3's H (n=1)
- C4's CH2 (n=2)
- C1's CH3 (n=3)

So the coupling would happen in the order of 3 Hs (quartet), then 2 Hs (triplet), then 1 H (doublet). But the question's pattern is doublet of triplet of quartets, which would require the order to be 1, 2, 3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the order of splitting. Maybe the question's description is written in the order of the number of neighboring Hs from each coupling, but the actual splitting order depends on the J values (coupling constants). Larger J values (more distant coupling) might come first, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A because it has CH3 groups attached, which can provide the quartet splitting.

Wait, another thing: the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is the O-H of a carboxylic acid. So the compound is likely a substituted carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, all have COOH except perhaps not, but they all end with COOH.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and $^1$H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm$^{-1}$, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm$^{-1}$, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid. The $^1$H NMR spectrum indicates the absence of vinyl hydrogens, ruling out alkenes or aromatic rings. Two complex splitting patterns are observed: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: CH$_3$C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)CH$_2$COOH**
- The structure is CH$_3$-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-CH$_2$COOH.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to:
  - A CH$_3$ group (n=3), leading to a quartet.
  - A CH$_2$ group (n=2), leading to a triplet.
  - An H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.
- The splitting pattern for the H on C2 would be a quartet of triplets of doublets. However, the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests the splitting order is reversed. This discrepancy makes this option less likely.

#### **Option B: CH$_3$CH$_2$C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)COOH**
- The structure is CH$_3$CH$_2$-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-COOH.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to:
  - A CH$_2$ group (n=2), leading to a triplet.
  - An H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.
- The splitting pattern for the H on C2 would be a triplet of doublets. However, the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which requires coupling with three groups (n=1, n=2, n=3). This option lacks a group with n=3 Hs, making it inconsistent with the NMR data.

#### **Option C: CH$_3$C(H)(CH$_3$)C(H)(CH$_3$)CH$_2$COOH**
- The structure is CH$_3$-C(H)(CH$_3$)-C(H)(CH$_3$)-CH$_2$COOH.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to:
  - A CH$_3$ group (n=3), leading to a quartet.
  - An H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.
- The splitting pattern for the H on C2 would be a quartet of doublets. However, the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which requires coupling with three groups (n=1, n=2, n=3). This option lacks a group with n=2 Hs, making it inconsistent with the NMR data.

#### **Option D: CH$_3$CH$_2$C(H)(CH$_3$)C(H)(CH$_3$)COOH**
- The structure is CH$_3$CH$_2$-C(H)(CH$_3$)-C(H)(CH$_3$)-COOH.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to:
  - A CH$_2$ group (n=2), leading to a triplet.
  - An H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.
- The splitting pattern for the H on C2 would be a triplet of doublets. However, the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which requires coupling with three groups (n=1, n=2, n=3). This option lacks a group with n=3 Hs, making it inconsistent with the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The correct compound must exhibit a splitting pattern consistent with coupling to three groups with n=1, n=2, and n=3 Hs. While none of the options perfectly match the described splitting order (doublet of triplets of quartets vs. quartet of triplets of doublets), **Option A** is the most plausible because it includes a CH$_3$ group (n=3), which could contribute to the quartet splitting. The other options lack the necessary groups to produce the observed splitting patterns.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the other peak is at 1700 cm^-1. That's a strong peak which I think is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, carboxylic acids have both O-H and carbonyl. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. That makes sense because the broad peak is probably the O-H from the carboxylic acid group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The question says none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. That rules out any alkenes or aromatic rings, which is good because that would complicate things.

Now, the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's break it down. Splitting patterns indicate how many neighboring protons each hydrogen is seeing.

In the first case, a doublet of triplets of quartets. So maybe each proton is split by two different sets of neighboring Hs. Wait, quartets happen when a proton has three neighboring Hs. So if a proton is next to a CH2 group, it might split into a quartet. Then the triplet part could be from another neighboring group, and the doublet from another.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the compounds given. Let's look at the options.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure would be like (CH3)(C2H5)C-H-C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, maybe it's more like a branched structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-CO... Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-COOH. No, wait, maybe the structure is a geminal di-substituted group, like two substituents on a central carbon. So maybe the structure is something like (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-COOH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at all four options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So that's two CH2CH3 (ethyl) groups and two CH3 groups attached to the central C? Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central carbon would have two ethyl groups and two CH3 groups? No, wait, maybe it's a four-carbon chain. Wait, maybe it's isopropyl groups attached to a central carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the central carbons has two substituents. Let me think about each option.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So that's a chain where after CH2CH3, there's a C which has two CH3 groups attached. So it's like CH2CH3-C(CH3)2-COOH? Or maybe CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So that would make the central carbons each have two substituents.

Wait, perhaps each of the two central carbons has a CH3 and an ethyl group or something else. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the splitting in the NMR.

So in the NMR, the absence of vinyl protons suggests that all the protons are in CH2, CH3, or other non-vinylic environments. So looking back, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That sounds like a complex splitting pattern. Let's think of how that could happen.

In a splitting pattern, each split is due to coupling with neighboring protons. So a quartet (n=3) comes from coupling with 3 equivalent protons. A triplet (n=2) comes from coupling with 2. A doublet (n=1) comes from coupling with 1.

So if a proton is split first by a group that gives a quartet, then another group introduces a triplet, and another gives a doublet, that would be a quartet of triplets as the first level, then each of those splits into triplets, etc. Wait, no, the order is from the most splitting to least. Or perhaps each coupling is happening with different sets of protons.

Wait, maybe it's a doublet of triplets of quartets. So each peak is first split into a quartet (by a group of 3 Hs), then each of those splits into a triplet (another group of 2 Hs), and then each becomes a doublet (from a group of 1 H). Or maybe it's the other way around in terms of the order.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a more complex splitting due to being adjacent to multiple different sets of protons. For example, if a CH2 group is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, but that might complicate things.

Wait, considering the structure, perhaps in the molecule, there's a central carbon connected to two ethyl groups and two other groups. Let me think about the NMR signals.

In the options, some have ethyl groups and some have methyl groups attached to the central carbons.

Let me think about the substituents. For each CH group, the protons attached would be split by neighboring groups.

Take option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the structure would be CH2CH3-C(CH3)2-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, maybe it's more like (CH3)(CH3)C-C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Hmm, no, perhaps each central C has two substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CH-CH(CH2COOH)-something. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3-C(CH3)-C(CH3)-COOH. Wait, that would make the middle carbons each having a CH3 and another substituent. So perhaps each of these central carbons is connected to CH3 groups and other parts.

So, the H on each of the central carbons would be between two groups. For example, each CH group is between two carbons, each with their own substituents.

In the NMR, each of these Hs would couple with neighboring Hs from adjacent CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the central Hs are each next to two CH3 groups and another CH group. Let me think: if the structure is CH2CH3-C(CH3)CH(CH2COOH)CH3, no, perhaps not.

Alternatively, considering that each of the central carbons is connected to two ethyl or methyl groups. Let's take option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure would have the central carbons each connected to an ethyl group and another group. So, for example, C(H)(C2H5) groups attached to each of two central carbons, which are next to each other.

Now, the H on each of these central carbons would have neighboring Hs from adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the central structure is like:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So each of the two middle Cs has a C2H5 group and a H attached. Then the H on each of these middle Cs would be adjacent to each other.

So the H on each middle C would be next to H on the adjacent C, and perhaps also next to other Hs elsewhere.

Wait, if the structure is like CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH, then the two middle CH groups are adjacent to each other. Each H on the middle C would couple with the H on the adjacent C, and perhaps with some other groups.

In that structure, each H on the middle C would be next to another H on the adjacent C. So each would split into a doublet because each H is adjacent to one H. But that might not explain the complicated splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is adjacent to a CH2 group, which would cause splitting into a quartet. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the FTIR has a carbonyl peak, which could be from a carboxylic acid. So looking at the options, all of them end with COOH, except perhaps I'm reading them wrong. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH â†’ so the COOH is at the end.

Similarly, all options have COOH as the terminal group. So each structure is a substituted carboxylic acid.

So the main part is the substituents before COOH.

Now, each structure has a chain leading to COOH. Let's analyze the NMR.

The NMR shows several peaks; none are vinyl. So all Hs are in CH2, CH3, or CH groups, possibly geminal.

The key is the splitting pattern: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm. Let's think about how each structure would give such splitting.

In option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the two middle carbons each have a CH3 and a H. The CH2CH3 is on the first C, and the last C is COOH.

Now, the Hs on the middle carbons (C2 and C3) would be adjacent to each other. Each of these Hs is next to the H on the adjacent C. So each H on C2 would be next to the H on C3, and perhaps also next to other Hs.

Wait, let me model this. Suppose the structure is:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the C2 (middle left) has H and a CH3, and is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3. The C3 has H, CH3, and is connected to C4 (COOH).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. Each of these Hs would couple with the H on the adjacent C, giving a doublet (n=1). But what else is around?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group from the COOH is also involved. Hmm, no, the COOH is at the end. Wait, in the structure, the COOH is CH2COOH? No, looking at option D, it's CH3CH2C...COOH. So the COOH is attached to the C which is already substituted. Let me clarify:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the COOH is attached to the fourth carbon. So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the chain is like CH2CH3 attached to a C, which has a CH3 and a H. Then another C, which has a CH3 and a H, and then COOH. So the main chain is four carbons: 1 (CH2CH3), 2 (CH(CH3)), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (COOH).

So the H on C2 (the first CH group) is adjacent to C3's H. Each of these Hs would split into a doublet. But also, what about the neighboring groups on each side?

The C2 H is next to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)). Or wait, C1 is CH2CH3, which is a CH2 group. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the CH2 group on C1, which has two Hs. So the H on C2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs of the adjacent CH2.

Additionally, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. So each of the Hs on C2 would be split by the two Hs from C1 and the one H from C3.

Wait, no, the coupling would be between adjacent carbons. So H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 and C3's CH.

Wait, C1 is CH2CH3, which has two Hs on the CH2. The H on C2 is adjacent to the Hs on C1's CH2 (which is a CH2 group, so two Hs). So the H on C2 would split into a triplet (n=2) from the CH2. Additionally, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. So each of the Hs on C2 would have coupling with both the two Hs from C1 and the one H from C3.

So the splitting would be a triplet (from C1's CH2) that is further split by the H on C3 into a doublet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of doublets (each triplet peak splits into two, so 2x3=6 lines? Or maybe a doublet of triplets, depending on the order of splitting).

Wait, but in the question, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps C2 and C3 are each CH groups, and each has a CH3 substituent. So each H on C2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the CH2 on C1) and one H (on C3). So the splitting would be triplet (from C1's CH2) and doublet (from C3's H), making each H on C2 as a triplet of doublets, which would be a doublet of triplets when considering the order? Wait, the order depends on the number of neighboring Hs. Wait, no, the splitting order is determined by the number of neighboring Hs. The larger number comes first. So if a proton is split by 2 Hs (triplet) and 1 H (doublet), the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which would result in six peaks.

But the question says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH groups (C2 and C3) are each adjacent to another group. Let me think of option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

So structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

In this case, each of the middle CH groups (C2 and C3) is next to an ethyl group. So the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H and perhaps to the ethyl groups on C2 and C3.

Wait, but ethyl groups are CH2CH3, so their Hs are in CH2 and CH3. So the H on C2 is next to C3's H, and possibly also next to the ethyl groups on C2 and C3. Hmm, but the ethyl groups are attached to C2 and C3, so their Hs are on the CH2 and CH3. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the H on C3, which is one H, and perhaps the ethyl groups on either side. But the ethyl groups are attached to C2 and C3, so their Hs are not directly adjacent to the H on C2. So the H on C2 would only be adjacent to the H on C3, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but that doesn't explain the complicated splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH group (C2 and C3) is connected to a CH2 group. For example, if the structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH, but I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Wait, looking back, option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. Wait, no, it's CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So each middle C has a C2H5 group and a H. So C2 is connected to CH2CH3, C3 is connected to C2H5 and the next C, which is the COOH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like: CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H, which is one H. So each H on C2 would split into a doublet. But wait, what else is adjacent? Are there any other Hs nearby?

If the C2 H is also adjacent to some other Hs, like from a CH2 group, that would cause more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C2 and C3 are split by each other and by the ethyl groups' Hs.

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1, doublet), and also adjacent to the ethyl groups on C2 and C3, which have CH2 and CH3. But the ethyl groups are attached to the same carbon as the H, so their Hs are not adjacent to the H on C2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about the splitting patterns again.

The NMR shows one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's think about what that would look like.

Quartet (n=3): each peak splits into 4 peaks. Triplet (n=2): splits into 3. Doublet (n=1): splits into 2.

So the overall pattern would be a quartet, each of which splits into triplets, then each of those splits into doublets. That would be a quartet of triplets of doublets, but the order of splitting can affect the appearance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would be a (doublet) of (triplet of quartets). So each peak splits into a doublet, then each doublet splits into a triplet, and each triplet into a quartet.

But how would a proton end up with such a complex splitting? It must be coupled with three different sets of protons, each with a different number.

Let me imagine a proton that is next to three different groups:

1. A group with 3 Hs (quartet splitting)
2. A group with 2 Hs (triplet splitting)
3. A group with 1 H (doublet splitting)

Wait, but that would require the proton to be adjacent to three different groups, each providing a different number of neighboring Hs. That seems a bit unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to two adjacent groups, each causing their own splitting.

Wait, perhaps the proton is part of a CH group that is adjacent to a CH2 group and a CH group. Let's say:

The structure is CH2-CH(A)-CH2-..., so the H on CH(A) would be adjacent to the CH2 group (2 Hs) and possibly another group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule has a branching that leads to a complex coupling.

Looking at option D again: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

In this structure, the C2 and C3 are each CH groups with CH3 substituents.

The H on C2 would be adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), and also adjacent to the CH2 group on C1 (n=2). So the H on C2 would split into a triplet (from C1's CH2) and then each peak in the triplet would split into a doublet (from C3's H). So the overall pattern would be a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the question says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So this might not fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to a CH2 group and a CH group which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 group. Let me think.

Suppose the structure is something like CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is next to a CH2 group (n=2), which is next to a CH group (n=1). So the H on C2 would first split into a triplet (from CH2), then each triplet peak would split into a doublet (from CH adjacent), making it a triplet of doublets.

But the question says a doublet of triplets of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The Hs on the two middle Cs are each adjacent to one H (from the other middle C) and perhaps other groups.

Wait, the CH2 group at the end (CH2COOH) would have two Hs, so the Hs on the middle Cs would be adjacent to each other (n=1) and also to the CH2 group (n=2). So the H on each middle C would split into a triplet (from CH2), and each triplet would split into a doublet (from the adjacent H on the other middle C). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets. But the question says a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, but the CH2 group has two Hs, so each H on the middle C would have coupling with these two Hs, leading to a triplet. Then, the adjacent H on the other middle C would cause a doublet. So each peak in the triplet would split into a doublet, leading to a triplet of doublets, which is six peaks. But the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the middle C is also adjacent to another group with three Hs. For example, if the middle C is next to a CH2CH3 group, which has two Hs on the CH2. But that might not add up.

Wait, maybe another scenario: the H on C2 is adjacent to a CH2 group (n=2), which is adjacent to another CH2 group (n=2), and perhaps a CH group (n=1). So the splitting would be a triplet (from first CH2), then each triplet splits into a triplet (from second CH2), and each of those splits into a doublet (from CH). That would be a triplet of triplets of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Wait, but the question has a doublet of triplets of triplets as one of the signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH (n=1), a CH2 (n=2), and another CH2 (n=2). But that might lead to a more complex pattern than what's described.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A or D.

Let's think about the number of signals. The NMR has several signals, so perhaps there are different types of Hs.

But the question mentions that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So perhaps the molecule has two distinct H environments with such splitting patterns.

In option D: The structure is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

In this case, the two middle Hs (on C2 and C3) are in the same environment, so they would be a singlet? No, because they are adjacent. Wait, if C2 and C3 are both CH groups with CH3 substituents, then their Hs would be equivalent if the molecule is symmetric. So maybe they would be a singlet. But that's not the case here because the substituents on each C are different.

Wait, no, C2 has CH3 and CH2CH3 attached, while C3 has CH3 and COOH. So their environments are different, so their Hs are not equivalent. Thus, each would have their own splitting.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and the CH2 from C1 (n=2). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets.

Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2's H (n=1) and perhaps the CH2 from C4 (but C4 is COOH, which is a CH2 group? No, the COOH is -COOH, which would be a carbonyl group, so the adjacent group would be a CH2 or a CH. Wait, the structure is CH3CH2C...COOH, so the COOH is attached to the last C, which is probably a CH group.

Wait, maybe the H on C3 is adjacent to C4's H (if C4 is CH), but in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the last C is COOH, which is a carbonyl group attached to an -OH. So the structure would have the last C as a CH2-COOH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to a CH2 group, leading to a triplet, and to the H on C2, leading to a doublet.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the actual structure and see what the H NMR would look like.

Let me try to model option D.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So:

C1: CH2CH3
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: COOH (probably a CH2COOH group? Or is it a CH that's attached to COOH?)

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. No, looking at option D, it's CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the COOH is attached directly to C3, which is a CH group.

So the structure would be:

C1: CH2CH3
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: COOH (attached to C3)

Wait, but that would make C3 as CH(CH3)COOH. So the H on C3 would be adjacent to C4's COOH group, which is a carbonyl. But the H on C3 is on a CH group attached to C4, which is a carbonyl (so no Hs there). So the H on C3 is only adjacent to C2's H and perhaps the CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent only to C2's H. So the splitting would be a doublet (n=1). But the question says more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (n=2) and C3's H (n=1), leading to a triplet of doublets.

Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2's H (n=1) and perhaps another group, like C4's CH2?

Wait, if C4 is a CH2COOH, then the H on C3 would be adjacent to the Hs on C4's CH2, which is two Hs, leading to a triplet. So the splitting for H on C3 would be a triplet (from C4's CH2) and a doublet (from C2's H), making a triplet of doublets.

But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (n=2) and C3's H (n=1), leading to a triplet of doublets. Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2's H (n=1) and perhaps C4's CH2 (n=2), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So perhaps in the NMR, the Hs on C2 and C3 would each have their own splitting patterns, one being a triplet of doublets and the other a doublet of triplets.

But the question states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, maybe the quartets come from coupling with a CH2 group elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are also adjacent to a CH2 group with three Hs. Wait, but CH2 has two Hs. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try another approach. Perhaps I should consider the possible structures and their NMR signals.

Looking at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The Hs on the middle carbons (C2 and C3) are each adjacent to a C2H5 group and a H. The CH2 group is at the end.

So the Hs on C2 and C3 would each be adjacent to the H on the other middle C (n=1). Also, perhaps adjacent to the CH2 group at the end.

Wait, but the CH2 group (C4) is at the end, so the Hs on C3 would be adjacent to C4's CH2 (n=2). So the H on C3 would split into a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from C2's H), leading to a triplet of doublets (or vice versa).

Similarly, the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and perhaps the CH2CH3 group on C1. But C1 is CH3, so the adjacent group is CH3 (n=3?), but wait, CH3 groups are attached to C2. So maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 group on C2 (n=3?), leading to a quartet.

Wait, but the CH3 is attached to C2. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the three Hs of the CH3 group on C2. So that would cause a quartet (n=3), and also adjacent to C3's H (n=1), causing a doublet. So the splitting would be a quartet of doublets, which is a doublet of quartets. But the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Hmm, this seems a bit off. Maybe I'm not considering the branching correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to a CH2 group on C1 (n=2) and a CH3 group on C2 (n=3), leading to a quartet of triplets, and another splitting from C3's H. But that would be a quartet of triplets of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets of quartets when considering the order.

Wait, if the H on C2 is coupled with 3 Hs (quartet), 2 Hs (triplet), and 1 H (doublet), that would lead to a quartet of triplets of doublets, but that's more than the question describes. The question has a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests the order is doublet (n=1), then triplet (n=2), then quartet (n=3).

So perhaps the H is first split by a group with 1 H (doublet), then each peak splits into a triplet (n=2), and each of those splits into a quartet (n=3). So the order would be doublet of triplets of quartets.

In which structure would a H be coupled with three different groups, providing 1, 2, and 3 Hs respectively?

Looking at option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H (n=1), and perhaps the ethyl groups on C2 and C3. The ethyl groups are -C2H5, which are attached to C2 and C3. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the ethyl groups' Hs. But the ethyl groups are attached to the same C, so their Hs are not adjacent to the H on C2. So the H on C2 is only adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and perhaps the CH2CH3 group on C1.

Ah, wait, C1 is CH2CH3, which has two Hs on the CH2. So the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (n=2) and C3's H (n=1). So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from C3's H), leading to a triplet of doublets (or a doublet of triplets).

But the question mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. So perhaps option B isn't the right fit.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to another group with 3 Hs, like a CH3 group. Looking at option B, the substituents are ethyl groups, which are -CH2CH3. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and C1's CH2 (n=2). No CH3 groups nearby, so no quartet splitting.

Hmm. Let me think about option A again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So C1 is CH3, C2 is C(H)(C2H5), C3 is C(H)(C2H5), C4 is CH2, C5 is COOH.

The H on C2 would be adjacent to C1's CH3 (n=3), C3's H (n=1), and the CH2 group on C4 (n=2).

Wait, that would mean the H on C2 is adjacent to three different groups: CH3 (n=3), CH2 (n=2), and H on C3 (n=1). So the splitting would be a quartet (n=3) from the CH3, then each peak in the quartet splits into a triplet (n=2) from the CH2, and each of those splits into a doublet (n=1) from the H on C3.

So the overall splitting would be a quartet of triplets of doublets. But the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, the order is different.

Wait, perhaps the order in which the couplings occur affects the pattern. The stronger coupling (more Hs) would come first. So the quartet (n=3) would come first, then the triplet (n=2), then the doublet (n=1). So the splitting would be quartet of triplets of doublets, which is different from what's described.

But the question says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another option is option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to C3's H (n=1), and perhaps the CH3 groups on C2 and C3.

Wait, the H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 groups on C2 and C3, but those are attached to the same C, so their Hs are not adjacent. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to C3's H (n=1) and the CH2 group on C4 (n=2). So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from C3's H), leading to a triplet of doublets.

Not matching the question's description.

Hmm. Let me think again. The correct answer must have a H that is coupled to three different groups, providing n=1, n=2, and n=3.

Looking at option A again, the H on C2 is coupled to:

- C1's CH3 (n=3): quartet
- C3's H (n=1): doublet
- C4's CH2 (n=2): triplet

So the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3), each peak in the quartet would split into a triplet (from CH2), and each of those split into a doublet (from C3's H). So the overall pattern would be a quartet of triplets of doublets. But the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a different order.

Wait, perhaps the order is determined by the strength of the coupling. The strongest coupling (largest n) comes first. So quartet comes first, then triplet, then doublet. So the splitting would be quartet of triplets of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets of quartets when considering the order of the question. Wait, no. The question says a doublet of triplets of quartets, which indicates the order: first split into doublet, then each doublet splits into triplet, then each triplet splits into quartet.

So the first split is a doublet (n=1), then each of those splits into triplet (n=2), then each triplet splits into quartet (n=3). That would require the H to be coupled with three different groups, in the order of 1, 2, 3 Hs.

In which structure would a H be coupled with a group with 1 H, then 2 Hs, then 3 Hs?

Looking at option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (n=2), C3's H (n=1), and perhaps another group with n=3. But I don't see a group with n=3 in option B. The substituents are ethyl groups, which are CH2CH3. So no CH3 groups, so no n=3 Hs. So option B can't have a quartet splitting.

Option A has CH3 groups attached to C2 and C3. So the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH3 (n=3), C3's H (n=1), and C4's CH2 (n=2). So the coupling is n=3, n=2, n=1.

So the first splitting would be a quartet (n=3), then each of those splits into a triplet (n=2), then each triplet into a doublet (n=1). So the overall pattern would be a quartet of triplets of doublets.

But the question's pattern is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is the reverse order.

Wait, perhaps the question's description is written in the order of the first split being the lowest n. So the first split is doublet (n=1), then triplet (n=2), then quartet (n=3). So the H is first split by a group with 1 H, then each peak splits into triplet (2 Hs), then each of those splits into quartet (3 Hs).

In which structure does a proton have three different neighboring groups with 1, 2, and 3 Hs, respectively, and the order of splitting is n=1, then n=2, then n=3?

Perhaps option A fits this scenario.

Wait, the H on C2 in option A is adjacent to:

- C3's H (n=1)
- C4's CH2 (n=2)
- C1's CH3 (n=3)

So the coupling would happen in the order of 3 Hs (quartet), then 2 Hs (triplet), then 1 H (doublet). But the question's pattern is doublet of triplet of quartets, which would require the order to be 1, 2, 3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the order of splitting. Maybe the question's description is written in the order of the number of neighboring Hs from each coupling, but the actual splitting order depends on the J values (coupling constants). Larger J values (more distant coupling) might come first, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A because it has CH3 groups attached, which can provide the quartet splitting.

Wait, another thing: the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is the O-H of a carboxylic acid. So the compound is likely a substituted carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, all have COOH except perhaps not, but they all end with COOH.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and $^1$H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm$^{-1}$, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm$^{-1}$, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid. The $^1$H NMR spectrum indicates the absence of vinyl hydrogens, ruling out alkenes or aromatic rings. Two complex splitting patterns are observed: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: CH$_3$C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)CH$_2$COOH**
- The structure is CH$_3$-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-CH$_2$COOH.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to:
  - A CH$_3$ group (n=3), leading to a quartet.
  - A CH$_2$ group (n=2), leading to a triplet.
  - An H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.
- The splitting pattern for the H on C2 would be a quartet of triplets of doublets. However, the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests the splitting order is reversed. This discrepancy makes this option less likely.

#### **Option B: CH$_3$CH$_2$C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)COOH**
- The structure is CH$_3$CH$_2$-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-COOH.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to:
  - A CH$_2$ group (n=2), leading to a triplet.
  - An H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.
- The splitting pattern for the H on C2 would be a triplet of doublets. However, the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which requires coupling with three groups (n=1, n=2, n=3). This option lacks a group with n=3 Hs, making it inconsistent with the NMR data.

#### **Option C: CH$_3$C(H)(CH$_3$)C(H)(CH$_3$)CH$_2$COOH**
- The structure is CH$_3$-C(H)(CH$_3$)-C(H)(CH$_3$)-CH$_2$COOH.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to:
  - A CH$_3$ group (n=3), leading to a quartet.
  - An H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.
- The splitting pattern for the H on C2 would be a quartet of doublets. However, the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which requires coupling with three groups (n=1, n=2, n=3). This option lacks a group with n=2 Hs, making it inconsistent with the NMR data.

#### **Option D: CH$_3$CH$_2$C(H)(CH$_3$)C(H)(CH$_3$)COOH**
- The structure is CH$_3$CH$_2$-C(H)(CH$_3$)-C(H)(CH$_3$)-COOH.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to:
  - A CH$_2$ group (n=2), leading to a triplet.
  - An H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.
- The splitting pattern for the H on C2 would be a triplet of doublets. However, the question describes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which requires coupling with three groups (n=1, n=2, n=3). This option lacks a group with n=3 Hs, making it inconsistent with the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The correct compound must exhibit a splitting pattern consistent with coupling to three groups with n=1, n=2, and n=3 Hs. While none of the options perfectly match the described splitting order (doublet of triplets of quartets vs. quartet of triplets of doublets), **Option A** is the most plausible because it includes a CH$_3$ group (n=3), which could contribute to the quartet splitting. The other options lack the necessary groups to produce the observed splitting patterns.

Answer: A
