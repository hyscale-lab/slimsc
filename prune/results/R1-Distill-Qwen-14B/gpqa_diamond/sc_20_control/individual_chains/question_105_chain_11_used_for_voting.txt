Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Oh, right, it's about a star with some dark spots and how it compares to an exoplanet in terms of causing brightness variations. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere, so the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots are at 5000K, right? Because 6000 - 1000 is 5000.

The setup is that when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing changes in brightness. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star blocks some light, causing dips in the brightness curve. The question is asking what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do. So, essentially, we're comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit.

Wait, but the star isn't being transited by a planet here; it's just spots. But when the spots rotate into view, the total brightness of the star as seen from Earth changes. So when the spot is on the visible side, the star is a bit dimmer because that area is cooler. The same way a planet blocks some light when it transits.

But how do we model the changes in brightness? I think for a transit, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area blocked. The formula I remember is ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2. So the fractional change in brightness is the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

But in the case of spots, it's a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side, they contribute less light. The total brightness is the sum of the star's and spots' emission. Let me think.

The star's total flux without spots is F0. Then, when spots are present, the flux is F0 minus the flux from the spotted area. The spotted area is a certain fraction (filling factor) of the hemisphere, but wait, half the star is spotted? No, wait, only one hemisphere is covered in spots, but the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So the spots take up 20% of the visible hemisphere when the star is facing us. But because the star is rotating, which hemisphere is visible changes. Hmm, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view. Wait, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. So the other hemisphere is spot-free.

Wait, maybe I should model the variation in brightness as the star rotates. When the spot hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the side we can see, and when it's the other hemisphere, the spots are on the far side, so we don't see them. So the brightness variation would be maximum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and minimum when it's not.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. So the brightness changes in a periodic way. But let's get back to the math.

The key is to calculate the fractional change in brightness for both scenarios (spots and planet transit) and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius.

First, let's compute the fractional change due to the spots. The star's flux without any spots on the hemisphere is F0. The spots lower the flux because they are cooler.

The total flux when the spots are on the hemisphere is F = F0 * (1 - f * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4)), where f is the filling factor. Wait, because each spot contributes less flux. So the area of the spots is f times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4πR^2 * σ * T^4 (using the Stefan-Boltzmann law). But when spots are present, the flux from the spot area is (T_spot^4) instead of (T_star^4). So the total flux when spots are visible would be F_spot = F0 - (f * (T_spot^4) * (Area of hemisphere) / T_star^4) * σ.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fraction of the star's light lost due to the spots. The area of the hemisphere is 2πR². The area of the spots is f times that, so 2πR² * f.

The flux without spots is F0 = σ T_star^4 * (4π R²) / (4π) )? Wait, no. The total flux is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. But wait, no, that's the flux per unit area. The total flux from the star is σ T^4 multiplied by the surface area, which is 4π R².

But when spots are present, the flux is F = σ T_star^4 * (4π R²) - σ T_spot^4 * (2π R² f).

So the fractional change in flux is ΔF/F0 = [σ T_spot^4 * 2π R² f ] / [σ T_star^4 * 4π R² ].

Simplify that: ΔF/F0 = [2π R² f T_spot^4 ] / [4π R² T_star^4 ].

The R² and π cancel out, so 2 f T_spot^4 / (4 T_star^4) ) → (f T_spot^4) / (2 T_star^4).

Wait, but wait. The spots are on a hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum drop in flux is when the spots are on the side facing us. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the spot hemisphere is on the other side, so the spots are not visible. So the brightness variation is periodic, with a maximum dip when the spots are front-facing.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is ΔF_max = (f * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)) / (2 T_star^4) ) * F0.

Wait, no. The flux without spots is F0. When spots are visible, the flux is F_spot = F0 - [ f * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) * (2π R²) / (4π R²) ) ].

Because the spots cover f fraction of the hemisphere, which is half of the star's surface. So the area affected is (f * 2π R²). The difference in flux per unit area is (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) * σ. So the total difference is (f * 2π R²) * σ (T_spot^4 - T_star^4).

But wait, F0 is 4π R² σ T_star^4. So:

ΔF = F0 - F_spot = [4π R² σ T_star^4] - [4π R² σ T_star^4 - (f * 2π R² σ (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)) ) ].

Simplify:

ΔF = f * 2π R² σ (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) ) 

But wait, since T_spot is less than T_star, the term (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) is negative. So ΔF would be negative, meaning a decrease in flux. So the amplitude is the maximum variation, so the fractional change is ΔF / F0.

Let's compute that:

ΔF / F0 = [ f * 2π R² σ (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) ) ] / [4π R² σ T_star^4 ]

Simplify:

= [ f * 2π R² (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) ] / [4π R² T_star^4 ] * (σ cancels)

= (f * 2 (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)) ) / (4 T_star^4 )

= (f (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)) ) / (2 T_star^4 )

But since T_spot < T_star, this is negative. So the fractional change is negative, meaning a dip. The magnitude is |ΔF/F0| = [f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4)] / (2 T_star^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 20% = 0.2

T_star = 6000 K

T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K

So compute:

(0.2) * (6000^4 - 5000^4) / (2 * 6000^4 )

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 6000^4: 6^4 * 1e4^4? Wait, 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = 5^4 *1e12 = 625 *1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So the numerator is 0.2 * 6.71e14 = 1.342e14.

Denominator is 2 * 1.296e15 = 2.592e15.

So the fraction is 1.342e14 / 2.592e15 = 1.342 / 259.2 ≈ 0.005184.

So approximately 0.5184% dip.

Wait, but wait the denominator is 2 * T_star^4, which is 2*(6000^4) = 2*(1.296e15) = 2.592e15.

So the dip is about 0.5184% in brightness when the spots are fully visible.

Now, for the exoplanet transit scenario. The dip is (R_planet/R_star)^2. Because when the planet transits, the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk, which is pi R_planet^2. The star's area is 4 pi R_star^2, but wait, the transit causes the star's flux to drop by the ratio of the areas: (R_planet/R_star)^2.

Wait, no. The transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2. So the fractional change is (Rp/R*)^2.

We want this to be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which we calculated as approximately 0.005184 (about 0.5184%).

So set (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.005184.

Solve for Rp/R* = sqrt(0.005184).

What's sqrt(0.005184)?

Hmm, calculating that.

0.005184 = 5.184e-3.

Find sqrt(5.184e-3).

Let me compute sqrt(5.184) first. 5.184 is close to 5.0625 (2.25^2), since 2.25^2=5.0625. Wait, 2.25 *2.25=5.0625. So 5.184 is a bit larger.

Wait, 2.279^2 = ?

Wait, 2.279 *2.279 ≈ let's compute 2.28^2= 2.28 *2.28:

2.28 *2 =4.56, 2.28 *0.28 = 0.6384. So 4.56 + (2.28*0.28) → Wait, maybe better to compute step by step.

Wait, maybe I should compute 2.27^2= 2.27 *2.27.

2.27 *2.27: 2*2=4, 2*0.27=0.54, 0.27*2=0.54, 0.27*0.27=0.0729.

Wait, no, maybe better to compute 2.27^2:

2.27 * 2.27 = ?

= (2 + 0.27)^2 = 2^2 + 2*2*0.27 + 0.27^2 = 4 + 1.08 + 0.0729 = 5.1529.

Hmm, so 2.27^2 is 5.1529.

Our value is 5.184. So it's a bit larger. How much?

5.184 - 5.1529 = 0.0311.

We can approximate the square root using linear approximation.

Let x=2.27, x²=5.1529.

We need to find delta x such that (x + delta)^2 =5.184.

Approximately, delta x ≈ (5.184 -5.1529)/(2x) )= 0.0311/(2*2.27) = 0.0311/(4.54)≈0.00685.

So x ≈ 2.27 + 0.00685 ≈2.27685.

So sqrt(5.184)≈2.27685.

So sqrt(5.184e-3)=sqrt(5.184)*1e-1.5= approx 2.27685 * 0.03162 (since sqrt(1e-3)=0.031623).

Wait, 1e-3 is 0.001, sqrt(0.001)=0.031623.

So 2.27685 * 0.031623 ≈ let's compute that.

2 * 0.0316 is 0.0632.

0.27685 * 0.0316 ≈ 0.00874.

Adding, 0.0632 +0.00874= 0.07194.

So approximately 0.07194.

So Rp/R* ≈0.07194, which is about 0.072. Looking at the options, option B is 0.07, option C is 0.11, option D is 0.32, and A is 0.39.

So the closest option is B, ~0.07.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternative approach: maybe I should compute the dip due to the spots more accurately.

Wait, the calculation of the dip: when the spots are in view, the flux is lower. The fractional change is (f*(T_spot^4 - T_star^4))/(2*T_star^4), but since T_spot is lower, it's negative. So the dip is the absolute value of that.

So:

ΔF/F0 = (f (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 )) / (2 T_star^4 )

But since T_spot is lower, the numerator is negative, so the dip is (f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (2 T_star^4 )

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (2*6000^4 )

Which we computed as approximately 0.005184, which is 0.5184% dip.

So the transit dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.005184.

Taking square root gives Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.005184) ≈ 0.072, which is 0.072. So option B is ~0.07.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me recompute the dip more precisely.

Compute T_spot = 5000 K, T_star=6000 K.

Compute T_spot^4 / T_star^4:

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (0.833333)^4.

Compute 0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944.

Then, 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈0.48225.

Thus, the term (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/T_star^4 = (0.48225 - 1 )= -0.51775.

Wait, but in the dip calculation, we have (T_star^4 - T_spot^4)/T_star^4 = 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So, dip = f * (T_star^4 - T_spot^4)/(2 T_star^4 )

Which is 0.2 * 0.51775 / 2 = 0.2 * 0.51775 * 0.5.

Wait, 0.51775 * 0.2 =0.10355. Then, divide by 2: 0.051775.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Wait no, let's recalculate.

Wait, the dip is [f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4)] / (2 T_star^4 )

Which is f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )) / 2.

So f=0.2.

(1 - 0.48225 )=0.51775.

So 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355.

Divide by 2: 0.051775.

So dip is 0.051775, which is approximately 5.1775% dip.

Wait, wait, this is conflicting with my previous calculation. So which one is correct?

Wait, when I did the calculation using actual numbers, I got 6000^4=1.296e15, 5000^4=6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4=1.296e15 -6.25e14=6.71e14.

Then, f=0.2. So 0.2 *6.71e14=1.342e14.

Divided by (2*6000^4)=2.592e15.

1.342e14 /2.592e15 = 0.05184. So dip is 5.184%?

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier calculation using (5/6)^4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the dip is (f * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 )) / (2 * T_star^4 )

Which is (0.2 * (5000^4 -6000^4 )) / (2 *6000^4 )

Wait, 5000^4 is less than 6000^4, so (5000^4-6000^4) is negative.

So the dip is (0.2 * ( - (6000^4 - 5000^4 )) )/( 2 *6000^4 )

Which is -0.2 * (6000^4-5000^4 )/(2 *6000^4 )

The magnitude is 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4)/(2 *6000^4 )

Which, in numbers, is 0.2 * (1.296e15 -6.25e14 )/( 2*1.296e15 )

= 0.2 * (6.71e14 ) / (2.592e15 )

= 0.2 * (6.71 / 2592 ) *1e-1 (because 6.71e14 is 6.71 *1e14, denominator is 2.592e15 =2.592 *1e15 )

Wait, 6.71e14 /2.592e15 = (6.71 /25.92 ) *1e-1.

6.71 /25.92 ≈0.2596.

So 0.2596 *0.1= 0.02596.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 *0.02596=0.005192.

Which is approximately 0.5192% dip.

So back to the initial calculation.

So dip is ~0.519% for the spots.

Then, for the exoplanet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.005192.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.005192) ≈0.072.

Which is about 0.07, so option B.

But wait, in the calculation using (5/6)^4=0.48225, I thought the dip would be 0.2 * (1-0.48225)/2 =0.051775, which is about 5.1775% dip. But when I did the exact calculation, I got 0.519% dip.

Ah, wait, there's a mistake in the approach. Because the star's surface area is 4π R², and the hemisphere is 2π R². So when the spots are on a hemisphere, the area with spots is f * 2π R². So the fractional area is (f * 2π R²) / (4π R²) )= f/2.

So the fraction of the star's surface that is spots is f/2. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the area blocked (in terms of flux) is (f/2) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

Wait, no. Because the flux is proportional to T^4 per unit area.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F0 - (f/2) * (T_spot^4) * (4π R²) / (4π R²) ) * σ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the flux change as f/2 multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area.

Wait, alternatively, the total flux from the star without spots is F0 = 4π R² σ T_star^4.

When spots are present on a hemisphere, the flux is F0 - (f * 2π R²) * σ (T_spot^4).

Because the area of the spots is f * 2π R², and each unit area has flux σ T_spot^4.

So the change in flux is ΔF = F0 - [F0 - (f * 2π R² σ T_spot^4) ] = f * 2π R² σ T_spot^4.

The fractional change is ΔF / F0 = [f * 2π R² σ T_spot^4] / [4π R² σ T_star^4 ].

Simplify: (f T_spot^4 )/(2 T_star^4 )

But this is the fractional change when the spots are visible.

Wait, but wait, that's the flux when the spots are on the near side. The maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, so the change is ΔF = F0 - F_spot = F0 - (F0 - ΔF') where ΔF' is the change due to spots.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way.

When the spots are facing us, the flux from those spots is less than the surrounding areas. So the total flux is F0 - (f * 2π R²) * σ (T_spot^4 - T_star^4).

So ΔF = (f * 2π R²) * σ (T_spot^4 - T_star^4).

Then, the fractional change is ΔF / F0.

F0 =4π R² σ T_star^4.

So ΔF/F0 = [f * 2π R² (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) σ ] / [4 π R² σ T_star^4 ].

Simplify: (f (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 )) / (2 T_star^4 )

Since T_spot < T_star, this is negative. So the dip is |ΔF/F0| = [f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (2 T_star^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So plugging in the numbers:

f=0.2, T_star=6000, T_spot=5000.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1.296e15 (as before).

5000^4=6.25e14.

So T_star^4 - T_spot^4 =6.71e14.

So [ f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4) ] = 0.2 *6.71e14=1.342e14.

Divide by 2 T_star^4: 2 *1.296e15=2.592e15.

So 1.342e14 /2.592e15 ≈0.05184.

Wait, that's 5.184% dip.

Oh! Wait, earlier I thought the dip was about 0.5% because I mistakenly used only the star's T^4, but now I realize I'm getting 5.184% because of miscalculating earlier.

Wait, no. Let me recheck:

Wait, 0.2 *6.71e14 is 1.342e14.

Divide by 2.592e15: 1.342e14 /2.592e15= (1.342 / 259.2 ) *1e-1.

Wait, 1.342 /259.2= approx 0.005184.

So 0.005184, which is 0.5184% dip.

Wait a minute, I'm getting conflicting results between two approaches.

Wait, T_spot=5000 K, T_star=6000 K.

Compute (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) = 5000^4 -6000^4= -6.71e14.

But in the dip calculation, we take T_star^4 - T_spot^4=6.71e14.

So [f * (T_star^4 - T_spot^4)] =0.2 *6.71e14=1.342e14.

Divide by (2 T_star^4 )=2*1.296e15=2.592e15.

1.342e14 / 2.592e15= (1.342 /2592 ) *1e-1.

Wait, 1.342 /2592= approx 0.0005184.

Multiply by 1e-1? No, wait, 1e14 /1e15=0.1.

So 0.0005184 *0.1=0.00005184.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 1.342e14 divided by 2.592e15.

Which is (1.342 /2592 ) * (1e14 /1e15 )= (0.0005184) *0.1=0.00005184.

Wait, that's 0.005184%, which is 5.184e-5, which is 0.005184% dip.

Wait, that seems way too small. But that's conflicting with the earlier approach.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

Calculate the dip using (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )= (5/6)^4= (0.8333)^4 ≈0.48225.

So the flux from the spot area is 0.48225 times the flux from the star's surface at T=6000.

So the fractional change when the spots are visible is:

[ (f/2) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) ] / T_star^4.

But wait, (f/2) is 0.1.

So dip = (0.1) * (0.48225 -1 )= 0.1 * (-0.51775 )= -0.051775.

So the dip is 5.1775% approximately.

Wait, that's 5.1775% dip.

But earlier when I did the exact calculation, I got 0.5184% dip. So which is correct?

Maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Wait, let's compute 6000^4: 6000^4 = (6^4) * (1000^4) = 1296 *1e12=1.296e15.

5000^4=5^4 *1e12 = 625 *1e12=6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4=1.296e15−6.25e14=6.71e14.

So [f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4) ] =0.2 *6.71e14=1.342e14.

Divide by 2 * T_star^4 =2 *1.296e15=2.592e15.

So 1.342e14 /2.592e15 = (1.342 /259.2 ) * 1e-1.

1.342 /259.2 = approx 0.005184.

Multiply by 1e-1: 0.0005184.

So 0.0005184, which is 0.05184% dip.

Wait, that's way off from the 5% I thought earlier.

Hmm, but this can't be right because the spot is covering 20% of the hemisphere. So perhaps I messed up the area calculation.

Wait, the area of a hemisphere is 2π R².

When the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, so the area contributing to the dip is f * 2π R².

The total area of the star is 4π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots when the spot hemisphere is facing us is (f * 2π R²) / (4π R² )= f/2.

So f=0.2, so fraction is 0.1.

So the area covered by spots is 10% of the star's surface.

So the dip is the area fraction times (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

Wait, but if the area fraction is 0.1, and each spot is emitting less, the dip is 0.1 * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 -1 ) * (something).

Wait, no. The dip in flux is the area fraction times (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

Wait, the flux from the star is normally F0 =4π R² σ T_star^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (f * 2π R²) σ (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 )

Wait, but that's because the spots are cooler, so their flux is (T_spot^4) per unit area, so the difference is (T_spot^4 -T_star^4) per unit area.

So the change in flux is ΔF = F0 - F = (f * 2π R²) σ (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 )

So fractional change is ΔF/F0 = [f * 2π R² (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) σ ] / [4π R² σ T_star^4 ]

Simplify: [f (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) ]/( 2 T_star^4 )

Which is same as before.

So plugging numbers:

[0.2 * (5000^4 −6000^4 ) ] / (2 *6000^4 )

= [0.2 * (-6.71e14) ] / (2.592e15 )

= [−1.342e14 ] /2.592e15 ≈−0.05184.

So the dip is about −5.184% (since it's negative, but the magnitude is 5.184%).

Wait, wait, no. Wait 1.342e14 /2.592e15 is 0.05184.

Ah, I see where I messed up earlier. Because 1.342e14 divided by 2.592e15 is 0.05184, not 0.005184.

Because 2.592e15 is 2592e12, and 1.342e14 is 134.2e12.

134.2e12 /2592e12 = 134.2 /2592 ≈0.05184.

Yes! So the dip is 5.184% approximately.

So this makes sense. Because 20% of the hemisphere is covered, so 10% of the star's surface, and each spot is cooler by (5000/6000)^4 = ~0.48, so each spot contributes about 48% of the flux. So the overall dip is about 10%*(0.48-1) = 10%*(-0.52) = -5.2% dip. Which matches the 5.184% calculation.

So the dip is ~5.184%.

Wait, but that's the dip. Now, for the exoplanet transit, the dip is (R_planet / R_star )^2.

So we set (R_planet /R_star )^2 = 0.05184.

So R_planet/R_star = sqrt(0.05184) = approx 0.2277.

Wait, because sqrt(0.05184) is around 0.2277.

Wait, 0.2277 is approximately 0.23. But looking at the options, A is 0.39, B is 0.07, C is 0.11, D is 0.32. None of these are ~0.23.

Wait, so this suggests a problem. Because according to this, the exoplanet radius would be 0.23 R_star, but that's not one of the options.

But wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me recompute the dip.

Wait, when the spots are on the hemisphere, the area contributing to the dip is f * 2π R².

But when the star rotates, only the spot hemisphere is visible, so the area of the spots that contribute to the dip is f * 2π R². The total star area is 4π R².

So the area fraction is (f * 2π R² ) / (4 π R² ) )= f/2 =0.1.

So the dip is 0.1 * ( T_spot^4 / T_star^4 −1 )

Which is 0.1 * ( (5000/6000)^4 −1 ) =0.1 * (0.48225 −1 )=0.1 * (-0.51775 )=−0.051775, so 5.1775% dip.

So for the exoplanet, the dip is (R_planet/R_star )^2= 0.051775.

So R_planet/R_star = sqrt(0.051775 )= approx 0.2275.

Which is about 0.23. But the options don't have this.

Wait, but the question says, "the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario.

Wait, the problem says to find the radius of the planet that would produce the same amplitude signal as the spots do. So when the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/R*)^2, which is 5.1775% as per the spot scenario.

So the planet's radius would need to be sqrt(0.051775 ) * R* ≈ 0.2275 R*.

But none of the options are near 0.23. So this suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe the star isn't emitting uniformly. When the spots rotate into view, the brightness changes. The maximum dip is when the spot is fully visible, but perhaps the period is such that the variation is the same as the planet's transit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the dip calculation. Because when only one hemisphere is spotty, the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible, which is when the spot hemisphere is facing us. The dip is 5.18%, and the planet's transit would cause the same dip.

So the planet's radius is sqrt(0.0518) * R*, which is ~0.2277 R*.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation due to the spots isn't a dip, but a variation in the brightness as the spots rotate. But the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, so the dip is 5.18%.

Wait, but the problem says the star's light curve would show periodic variations. Similarly, a planet transiting would cause a dip.

If the dip is 5.18%, then the planet's radius needs to be 0.227 R*.

But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, maybe when the star rotates, the spots are only on the hemisphere, so the maximum area we can see is the hemisphere. So the maximum dip is when the spot hemisphere is facing us, so the flux change is due to the entire spot area.

Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere.

So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R² )=0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R² ) / (4 π R² )=0.1.

So when the spots are on the near side, 10% of the star's surface is spots, each at lower temperature.

So the dip is 10% of the star's area * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

Which is 0.1 * (5000^4 -6000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Wait, that's 0.1 * ( (5/6)^4 −1 )= 0.1*(0.48225 −1 )= 0.1*(-0.51775 )=−0.051775, 5.1775% dip.

Hmm, which brings us back to the same conclusion.

So perhaps the options have a mistake, or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me re-read the question.

The question says, "what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e., Rpl/Rstar) to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve."

So the planet's transit would produce a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So if the dip is 5.18%, then Rpl/Rstar is sqrt(0.0518)=0.2277.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done in terms of the overall brightness variation, not considering the entire surface.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the brightness variation due to the spots is not a dip but a variation in the brightness as the spots rotate in and out of view. The amplitude would be the difference between when the spots are on the near side and when they're on the far side.

So when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F1 = F0 - ΔF.

When they are on the far side, the flux is F0.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F1 ) / 2 = ΔF/2.

Wait, no. Because the brightness curve would go from F0 to F0 -ΔF when the spots come into view, and back to F0 when they go away. So the amplitude is the maximum variation, which is ΔF.

Wait, but the way the star is set up, only one hemisphere has spots. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F0 -ΔF. When the other hemisphere (spot-free) is facing us, the flux is F0.

So the variation is between F0 and F0 -ΔF, so the amplitude is ΔF.

So the dip is ΔF=5.18% F0.

So the planet's transit dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar= ~0.2277.

Again, no option matches.

But the options given are A) 0.39, B)0.07, C)0.11, D)0.32.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the dip calculation because the spots are only on a hemisphere, so the maximum dip is when the spot hemisphere is facing us, but the brightness would vary between when the spot hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

Wait, when the star is rotating, the spot hemisphere is only visible for part of the rotation period. So the brightness variation would be between F0 (when the spot hemisphere is on the far side) and F0 -ΔF (when the spot hemisphere is on the near side).

So the amplitude is ΔF.

Which is 5.18% as we've calculated.

So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is equal to the sun's radius, but the exoplanet's radius is compared to the star's. Let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the area of the spot relative to the star's disk. So the area of the spot is f * (2π R^2). The area of the star is 4π R².

So the area of the spot is (f/2) of the star's area.

So when the spot is on the near side, the flux is F0 - (f/2) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) *F0.

So the dip is (f/2) * ( (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4 )

So again, same as before.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the star isn't being observed in the total flux, but in some other way. Alternatively, perhaps the spots are on only one hemisphere, so the maximum brightness change is when the spots are on the near side, and the brightness returns to normal when the other hemisphere comes into view. So the amplitude is the dip, which is 5.18%.

But again, that leads to a planet radius of 0.227 R*, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation and the dip is 0.5184%, not 5.184%.

Wait, let's double-check the exact calculation.

Compute ΔF/F0:

[f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (2 T_star^4 )

f=0.2, T_star=6e3, T_spot=5e3.

Compute 6e3^4 = 1.296e15.

5e3^4=6.25e14.

So T_star^4 - T_spot^4=6.71e14.

So f*(T_star^4 - T_spot^4 )=0.2 *6.71e14=1.342e14.

Divide by 2 T_star^4: 2 *1.296e15=2.592e15.

So 1.342e14 /2.592e15= (1.342 /2592 ) * 1e-1.

Wait, 1.342/2592= approx 0.0005184.

Multiply by 1e-1: 0.00005184.

Which is 5.184e-5, which is 0.005184% dip.

Wait, that's 0.005184% dip.

But that can't be right because the spot covers 20% of a hemisphere. So I must have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 1.342e14 divided by 2.592e15.

1.342e14 is 1.342 *1e14.

2.592e15 is 2.592 *1e15.

So 1e14 /1e15 = 0.1.

So 1.342 *0.1=0.1342.

0.1342 /2.592 ≈0.05184.

So 0.05184.

Wait, that's 5.184% dip. So that's correct.

So why is the planet radius 0.227 R*, but the options don't have that?

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible variation from spots, which occurs when the spot is on the limb, leading to a larger apparent dip. Or perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that the entire star's surface is covered with spots, but only one hemisphere is observed at a time because of rotation. But no, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered with spots, not the whole star.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would cause a variation, but when viewed face-on, the variation is different. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view, but the brightness variation isn't just a dip, but a variation that depends on the rotational phase.

Wait, perhaps the maximum amplitude is when the spot is on the center of the disk, leading to a larger dip. But I don't think that's the case here; the dip is the same regardless of where the spot is on the disk.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Let me double-check: the flux per unit area is sigma T^4, so for a given area, the total flux is area multiplied by sigma T^4.

So the star's flux is F0=4 pi R^2 sigma T_star^4.

The spot's flux is F_spot= area * sigma T_spot^4.

So when the spot is facing us, the star's flux is F0 - F_spot, so dip is F_spot/F0.

F_spot= f * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4.

So F_spot/F0= [f *2 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4 ] / [4 pi R^2 sigma T_star^4 ] = [f *2 T_spot^4 ] / [4 T_star^4 ]= [f T_spot^4 ] / [2 T_star^4 ].

Ah! So the dip is [f (T_spot^4 ) ] / [2 T_star^4 ].

Wait, but since T_spot is less than T_star, it's a negative dip.

Wait, no, the dip is (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) * (f/2 ).

So dip= (f/2) * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )

Which in numbers:

(f/2)=0.1.

T_spot=5000, T_star=6000.

(T_spot/T_star)^4= (5/6)^4≈0.48225.

So dip=0.1 *0.48225=0.048225, which is 4.8225% dip.

So that's about 4.82% dip.

Wait, now I'm getting a different result. So which approach is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's clarify.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F0 - F_spot, where F_spot is the flux from the spots.

F_spot= area of spots * sigma T_spot^4.

Area of spots is f * 2 pi R^2.

So F_spot= f * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4.

F0=4 pi R^2 sigma T_star^4.

So dip= F_spot / F0 = [f * 2 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4 ] / [4 pi R^2 sigma T_star^4 ]

= [f * 2 T_spot^4 ] / [4 T_star^4 ]

= [f T_spot^4 ] / [2 T_star^4 ]

So dip= [0.2 * (5000^4 ) ] / [2 * 6000^4 ]

= [0.2 * (6.25e14 ) ] / [2 * 1.296e15 ]

= [1.25e14 ] / [2.592e15 ]

= 1.25e14 / 2.592e15 = 0.048225.

So dip is 4.8225% approximately.

Ah, so that's ~4.82% dip.

So for the exoplanet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.048225.

So Rp/Rstar= sqrt(0.048225 )= approx 0.2196, which is ~0.22.

Again, not matching any options.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, and only when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip is when the spot hemisphere is facing us, but perhaps the variation is between when the spot hemisphere is front-facing and back-facing.

Wait, when the spot hemisphere is front-facing, the flux is F0 - F_spot.

When it's back-facing, the flux is F0.

So the amplitude is the difference between F0 and F0 - F_spot, which is F_spot.

So dip is F_spot / F0=4.8225%.

So the planet's transit dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.048225 → Rp=0.2196 Rstar.

Again, not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the dip calculation. Let's re-express the dip.

The dip is (F_spot) / F0.

F_spot = (f * 2 pi R² ) * sigma T_spot^4.

F0=4 pi R² sigma T_star^4.

So F_spot / F0 = [f * 2 pi R² sigma T_spot^4 ] / [4 pi R² sigma T_star^4 ].

The pi R² sigma cancels.

= [f * 2 T_spot^4 ] / [4 T_star^4 ].

= (f T_spot^4 )/( 2 T_star^4 ).

Which is [0.2*(5000^4)]/(2 *6000^4 )

= [0.2 *6.25e14]/(2*1.296e15 )

= (1.25e14 )/(2.592e15 )

= 1.25e14 /2.592e15 = 0.048225.

So dip is 4.8225%.

So planet radius Rp is sqrt(0.048225 )=0.2196 R*.

Again, no option matches.

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.39, B)~0.07, C)~0.11, D)~0.32.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem considers the filling factor as 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Because if that's the case, the dip would be larger.

Wait, if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then f=0.2.

Then dip would be [0.2 * (5000^4 ) ] / [2 *6000^4 ] = (0.2 *6.25e14 )/(2 *1.296e15 )=1.25e14 /2.592e15=0.048225, same as before.

No change.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on both hemispheres, but the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere. But the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is not a dip but a modulation due to spots rotating into view, leading to a sinusoidal variation with an amplitude of (maximum dip - minimum dip)/2.

Wait, in that case, the maximum dip is 4.82%, and the minimum is zero dip (when no spots are visible). So the amplitude would be 4.82% /2=2.41%.

Then, the planet's transit dip would need to be 2.41%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.0241 → Rp/Rstar= ~0.155.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the dip is caused by the spots being cooler, but the star's brightness variation is in the opposite way. Wait, when the spots are visible, the flux is less, so the dip is the decrease. The amplitude is the dip, which is 4.82%.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculations seem correct, but the answer isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: the problem says the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K, so T_spot=5000 K. But perhaps the difference is absolute, making the spots 5000 K.

But what if the spots are hotter? No, the problem says dark spots, which are cooler.

Wait, perhaps the dip calculation should be done in terms of the inverse, because the star's flux is higher when the spots are not visible.

Wait, when the spots are on the far side, the flux is higher than when they're on the near side. So the maximum flux is F0, and the minimum is F0 - F_spot.

So the brightness variation is F0 - (F0 - F_spot )= F_spot.

Which is the dip as calculated.

So I'm confident in the dip calculation.

But the conclusion is that the planet's radius would be ~0.22 R*, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in converting the dip to the planet's radius.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the relative change in flux as a percentage, but the planet's transit is a dip, while the spot-induced dip is a dip as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the area of the spot relative to the star's disk differently.

Wait, perhaps when the star is observed, the spots are on the hemisphere, but the area of the spot is f * (hemisphere area) = f *2 pi R².

So the spot area is 0.2 *2 pi R²=0.4 pi R².

The star's area is 4 pi R².

So the spot area is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² =10%.

So the dip is 10%*( (5000^4)/(6000^4) -1 )=10%*(0.48225-1 )=10%*(-0.51775 )= -5.1775% dip.

So dip is 5.1775%.

So planet's transit dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2=5.1775% =0.051775.

So Rp= sqrt(0.051775 ) * Rstar ≈ 0.2277 Rstar.

But options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects the answer to be approximately 0.23, but it's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is wrong, and the correct answer is option C) ~0.11.

Because 0.11^2=0.0121, which is about 1.21% dip, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the spot's effect differently. Maybe the brightness variation isn't a dip, but a variation in the brightness as the spots rotate. So the amplitude is the difference between when the spot is at the center (maximum dip) and when it's on the edge (less dip).

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip is when the spot is at the center, and the minimum is when it's on the limb, leading to a smaller dip. So the amplitude would be the difference between these two.

But that complicates things, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem expects.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the dip is indeed about 0.518% as I first thought.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute the dip with exponents correctly.

Compute [f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (2 T_star^4 )

f=0.2, T_star=6e3, T_spot=5e3.

6e3^4= (6^4)*(1e3)^4 = 1296 *1e12=1.296e15.

5e3^4= (5^4)*1e12=625e12=6.25e14.

T_star^4 - T_spot^4=1.296e15 -6.25e14=6.71e14.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 *6.71e14=1.342e14.

Divide by 2 T_star^4=2.592e15.

1.342e14 /2.592e15 = (1.342 /2592 ) * (1e14 /1e15 )= (0.0005184) *0.1=0.00005184.

Which is 0.005184% dip.

Wait, that's 0.005% dip, which is way too small.

But that can't be correct because the spots cover 20% of a hemisphere.

I think I'm going in circles here. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the dip calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the maximum dip is when the spot is on the near side, but the minimum is when it's on the far side. So the amplitude is the difference between these two, which is the dip.

But according to the calculations, that's 5.18% dip, which would require the planet's radius to be ~0.227 R*, which isn't an option.

Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

Because sqrt(0.0121)=0.11, which corresponds to a dip of 1.21%, which is much smaller than our calculated dip. So perhaps the intended approach was to compute a smaller dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the spots cause a dip of 1%, leading to a planet radius of ~0.1.

But without further clarity, I'll take a guess that the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same amplitude in brightness variations as the dark spots on the star. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K, giving them a temperature of 5000 K. The periodic brightness variations caused by the spots' rotational modulation are to be compared to the transit-induced dips caused by an exoplanet.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is proportional to its surface area and temperature:  
     \[
     F_0 = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4
     \]
   - When the spots are visible, the flux decreases due to their lower temperature. The flux from the spots is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{spot}} = f \cdot 2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux (dip) is:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{f \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4}{2 \cdot T_{\text{star}}^4}
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     - \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
     - \( \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.2 \cdot (5000/6000)^4}{2} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.48225}{2} \approx 0.048225 \) (or 4.8225% dip).

2. **Comparison to Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The dip caused by an exoplanet during transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_0}
     \]
   - Setting the dip caused by the exoplanet equal to the dip caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.048225
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}}/R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.048225} \approx 0.2196
     \]

3. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated value of \( R_{\text{pl}}/R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.22 \) does not match any of the provided options:
     - A) ~0.39  
     - B) ~0.07  
     - C) ~0.11  
     - D) ~0.32  
   - This suggests either an issue with the problem's setup or the provided options.

4. **Reevaluation of Options**:
   - If the problem intended a smaller dip (e.g., ~1.21%), corresponding to \( R_{\text{pl}}/R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.11 \), the closest match would be option C. However, this does not align with the calculated dip of ~4.82%.

### Conclusion:
The calculations consistently yield \( R_{\text{pl}}/R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.22 \), which does not match any of the provided options. Given the available choices, the closest plausible answer is **C) ~0.11**, though this does not align with the derived results.
