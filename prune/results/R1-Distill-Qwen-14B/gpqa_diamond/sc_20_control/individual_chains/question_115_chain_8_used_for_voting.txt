Okay, let's try to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and since they're matter and antimatter, their energy should be converted into photons. 

So, the setup: the electron is moving left to right (from the left) with a Lorentz factor of 4. Lorentz factor gamma is given, so gamma_e =4. The positron is moving right to left (from the right) with a gamma_p =2. Because a positron is the antimatter counterpart of an electron, their rest masses are the same.

Wait, the problem says both annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So, they're both moving to the right but in opposite vertical directions. The question is the angle between them. 

I think I need to consider conservation of momentum and energy. Since the system is electron and positron, their total momentum before collision must equal the total momentum of the photons after. 

But wait, photons have momentum, but their momentum is E/c, and the direction depends on their movement. Also, photons' momentum is a vector, so direction matters.

First, let's calculate the momenta of the electron and positron. Since they're moving in opposite directions along the same axis (the horizontal), their momenta will be vectors in opposite directions.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * c² / c = gamma_e * m_e * c. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. But for electrons and positrons, their rest mass is m_e, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But velocity v can be expressed in terms of gamma. 

Alternatively, I remember that for a particle, the momentum can also be expressed as p = gamma m_e c * beta, where beta is v/c. So maybe it's better to compute beta for each particle. 

Wait, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

Let me compute beta_e for the electron. Gamma_e is 4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Similarly, gamma_p is 2 for the positron. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Now, momenta. The electron is moving to the right (let's say positive direction), and the positron to the left (negative direction). So their momenta are:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c. Wait, actually, the momentum is p = gamma m v. But v = beta c. So p = gamma m (beta c) = gamma beta m c. So yeah, that's correct. 

So, p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c. Since the electron is moving right, p_e is positive. The positron is moving left, so its momentum is negative. So p_p = - gamma_p * beta_p * m_e c.

So total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p.

Wait, but wait, the positron is moving from the right, which I'm taking as the negative direction. So its velocity is to the left, so beta_p is positive (since beta is v/c, and v is negative), but wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving to the right? No, wait the question says the positron is moving along the horizontal from the right. So that's to the left. So from the right towards the left. So for the positron, the velocity is negative. So beta_p would be negative? Or is beta just the magnitude?

Wait, no. I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: In the lab frame, the electron is moving to the right (positive x-direction) with gamma 4. The positron is moving to the left (negative x-direction) with gamma 2. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

So for the positron, its velocity is negative. So beta_p is negative because v_p is negative. So beta_p = - sqrt(3)/2. 

So when computing p_p, it's gamma_p * m_e * v_p. So v_p is negative. So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = gamma_p * m_e * (beta_p c) = gamma_p * m_e c * beta_p.

Since beta_p is negative, p_p is negative. So the positron's momentum is negative, and electron's is positive.

So p_initial = p_e + p_p = gamma_e * m_e c beta_e + gamma_p * m_e c beta_p.

But beta_p is -sqrt(3)/2, so:

p_initial = (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) m_e c.

Wait, no. Because for the positron moving left, its momentum is negative. So p_p = - gamma_p beta_p m_e c. Wait, no, because beta_p is already negative. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the momentum as:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c  (since moving to the right, beta_e positive)
p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c  (since moving to the left, beta_p negative)

So,

p_initial = p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e c beta_e + gamma_p m_e c beta_p.

Substituting the values:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682
gamma_p=2, beta_p = -sqrt(3)/2 ≈ -0.8660.

So,

p_initial = (4)*(sqrt(15)/4) + (2)*(-sqrt(3)/2) ) * m_e c.

Wait, let me compute each term:

Term 1: 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15) ≈3.87298
Term 2:2 * (-sqrt(3)/2) = -sqrt(3) ≈-1.73205

So sum: 3.87298 -1.73205 ≈2.14093.

So p_initial ≈2.14093 m_e c.

Wait, but I can also compute this exactly:

sqrt(15) is sqrt(15), and sqrt(3) is sqrt(3). So:

p_initial = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c.

So that's the initial momentum.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E, same for both. So E1 = E2 = E.

Photons have energy E = pc, since for photons, E = pc. So p_photon = E/c, but direction matters.

Let me denote the momenta of the photons as vectors. Let me assume that the first photon has direction making an angle theta above the x-axis, and the second photon theta below, but since they are emitted symmetrically in some way, perhaps their angles add up to 180 degrees or something else.

Wait, but the problem states that one is upper-right and another in lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one up and the other down. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

So let's model this. Let's say photon 1 has momentum p1 with direction (theta) from x-axis, and photon 2 has direction (phi) below x-axis. But the problem says they are in upper-right and lower-right, so both have positive x-components. 

Wait, but that's not possible because if the initial momentum is in the positive x-direction, the total momentum after must also be in the same direction. If both photons are moving to the right, their momenta would both have positive x-components. But the sum must equal the initial momentum, which is positive. 

Wait, but what if they have some vertical components? Let me think.

The total momentum after is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta. So:

p1 + p2 = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c.

But since photons are massless, their momentum magnitude is E/c, and their direction is given by their angles.

Let me denote the photons' momenta as p1 and p2. Since E1 = E2 = E, then |p1|=|p2|= E/c.

So, in vector form:

p1 = E/(c) (cos(theta) i + sin(theta) j)
p2 = E/(c) (cos(phi) i + sin(phi) j)

But the problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So, their x-components are positive, and their y-components are opposite in sign. Wait, but if both are moving right, their x-components are positive. But if one is upper-right and the other lower-right, their y-components would be in opposite directions. But in that case, the total y-momentum would sum to zero if they are symmetric. 

Wait, but let's see. The initial system has only x-momentum, because the initial particles are moving along x. So the total initial momentum is along x. Hence, after the collision, the total momentum must be along x. So any y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.

Ah! So the sum of the y-components must be zero. So p1_y + p2_y = 0. 

So, sin(theta) * (E/c) + sin(phi) * (E/c) = 0.

Which implies sin(theta) + sin(phi) = 0.

So, sin(theta) = - sin(phi).

Which implies that phi = -theta, or phi = 180 - theta, but considering the direction. Wait, for example, if theta is positive (say, above x-axis), then phi would have to be -theta (below x-axis). So the photons are symmetric about the x-axis.

So, if one photon is at angle theta above x-axis, the other is at angle theta below x-axis. So theta and -theta. 

But wait, let me think. Suppose photon 1 is at angle theta above x, and photon 2 is at angle theta below x. Then their y-components would be E/(c) sin(theta) and E/(c) sin(-theta) = - E/(c) sin(theta). So adding them gives zero, which is correct. 

Now, the x-components: each photon's x-component is E/(c) cos(theta). Since both are moving to the right, cos(theta) is positive. So sum of x-components is 2*(E/(c)) cos(theta). 

But the initial momentum is [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c. So:

sum of x-components of photons = (p1_x + p2_x) = [2 E/(c) ] cos(theta) = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] m_e c.

But E is the energy of each photon. Also, the energy of each photon is E = |p| c. So E = |p| c, which for each photon, since |p1|=|p2|=E/c. So this makes sense.

But also, the total energy after collision must equal the total energy before collision. Let's check that.

Total initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Each has rest mass energy m_e c^2. So total rest energy is 2 m_e c^2.

But their kinetic energies plus rest energy contribute to the total energy.

Wait, the total energy of each particle is gamma * m_e c^2. So total initial energy is gamma_e m_e c^2 + gamma_p m_e c^2.

So, gamma_e=4, gamma_p=2. So total initial energy = (4 + 2) m_e c^2=6 m_e c^2.

After collision, the two photons have energies E each, so total energy is 2E. 

So 2E =6 m_e c^2 → E=3 m_e c^2.

Wait, each photon has energy E=3 m_e c^2. So that's a key point.

So, each photon has E=3 m_e c^2.

Now, going back to the x-momentum equation:

2*(E/c) cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c.

Substituting E=3 m_e c^2,

2*(3 m_e c^2)/(c) cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c.

Simplify left side: 2 *3 m_e c cos(theta) = 6 m_e c cos(theta).

Right side: [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c.

So,

6 m_e c cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Compute this value numerically to find theta.

Compute sqrt(15) ≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So numerator: 3.87298 -1.73205 ≈2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093/6≈0.35682.

So,

cos(theta) ≈0.35682.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.35682). Let's find this angle.

Using a calculator: arccos(0.3568) is around 69 degrees, since cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 69 and 68. Let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute cos(69°)=approx 0.3584. So 0.3568 is just a bit less than that. So the angle is about 69.5 degrees. Wait, perhaps a bit lower. Let me think:

cos(69) ≈0.3584.

cos(70)≈0.3420.

So 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let me compute using linear approximation.

The value 0.3568 is 0.3584 -0.0016. So delta is -0.0016.

The derivative of cos(theta) is -sin(theta). At theta=69 degrees, sin(theta)=approx 0.9336.

So delta theta ≈ delta cos(theta) / (-sin(theta)) = (-0.0016)/( -0.9336) ≈ 0.001715 radians. 0.001715 * (180/pi) ≈ 0.0986 degrees. So theta ≈69 -0.0986= approx 68.9 degrees. So about 68.9 degrees.

Wait, actually, since the change in cos is negative, and we're moving from 69 to a lower angle. Wait, no. Because theta increases as cos(theta) decreases. So, since cos(theta) is decreasing, theta increases. But in our case, the calculated cos(theta) is 0.3568, which is a bit less than 0.3584 (theta=69), so theta is a bit higher than 69, say around 69.1 degrees.

Wait maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can just calculate it numerically.

But perhaps I can compute it using exact values.

Wait, maybe I can compute it exactly.

But perhaps there's a better way. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, the two photons are moving in opposite vertical directions. So their angles with the x-axis are theta and -theta. The angle between them would be theta - (-theta)= 2 theta. So the angle between is 2 theta.

Wait, but wait, the question says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So the angle between them is the sum of their angles from the x-axis.

So if one is theta above x, and the other is theta below x, the angle between them is theta + theta= 2 theta.

So the angle between the photons is 2 theta.

So if theta is approximately 69 degrees, then the angle between is about 138 degrees. 

Wait, the options include a 138 option (option C). So that might be the answer.

But let me double-check.

Wait, let me compute [sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)]/6 exactly.

sqrt(15) = 3.872983346
sqrt(3) = 1.732050808
So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)=2.140932538
Divide by 6: 0.3568220897.

So cos(theta)=0.3568220897. Let me find theta.

Using calculator: arccos(0.356822) ≈69 degrees. Let me compute precisely.

Using a calculator, arccos(0.356822)= approximately 69.09 degrees.

So 2 theta is approx 138.18 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is about 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons of equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Momentum Conservation**:  
   The electron and positron move along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors $\gamma_e = 4$ and $\gamma_p = 2$, respectively. Their velocities are calculated using $\beta = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2}$:
   - For the electron: $\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - 1/4^2} = \sqrt{15}/4 \approx 0.9682$.
   - For the positron: $\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - 1/2^2} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660$.

   The relativistic momentum of each particle is $p = \gamma m \beta c$. Since the electron moves to the right (positive $x$-direction) and the positron moves to the left (negative $x$-direction), their momenta are:
   - $p_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c = 4 m_e c (\sqrt{15}/4) = m_e c \sqrt{15}$.
   - $p_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c = 2 m_e c (\sqrt{3}/2) = m_e c \sqrt{3}$.

   The total initial momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
   \]

2. **Photon Momentum and Energy**:  
   After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies $E$. Since photons are massless, their momentum magnitude is $p = E/c$. The photons move in opposite vertical directions, meaning their angles $\theta$ and $-\theta$ are symmetric about the $x$-axis. The total momentum of the photons must equal the initial momentum:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = p_1 + p_2 = \frac{E}{c} (\cos\theta + \cos(-\theta)) \hat{x} + \frac{E}{c} (\sin\theta + \sin(-\theta)) \hat{y}.
   \]
   The $y$-components cancel due to symmetry ($\sin\theta + \sin(-\theta) = 0$), leaving:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2E}{c} \cos\theta \hat{x}.
   \]

3. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
   \]
   After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = 2E.
   \]
   Equating initial and final energies:
   \[
   2E = 6 m_e c^2 \implies E = 3 m_e c^2.
   \]

4. **Solving for $\theta$**:  
   Substituting $E = 3 m_e c^2$ into the momentum equation:
   \[
   \frac{2E}{c} \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
   \]
   \[
   \cos\theta = \frac{m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})}{2E/c} = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
   \]
   Numerically:
   \[
   \sqrt{15} \approx 3.87298, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205, \quad \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.14093,
   \]
   \[
   \cos\theta = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682.
   \]
   Using $\arccos(0.35682)$, we find:
   \[
   \theta \approx 69^\circ.
   \]

5. **Angle Between Photons**:  
   Since the photons are symmetric about the $x$-axis, one is at $+\theta$ and the other at $-\theta$. The angle between them is:
   \[
   2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The angle between the directions of the photons is approximately **138 degrees**.
