Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that when something emits light, it's usually after absorbing some other wavelength. Oh right, that's the whole photoelectric effect thing, but I think this is more about visible light and color.

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. Wait, but the question is about what color it absorbs. So, I guess I need to figure out the absorbed energy and relate that to the color it would appear.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths, it doesn't emit those; instead, it reflects or emits other wavelengths. Oh wait, no, wait. When something emits light, that's usually because it's in an excited state after absorbing energy, then it drops back down and emits the photon. So the emitted light is the one with lower energy than the absorbed? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no. The energy levels: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon would be the difference between the higher and lower states. But in this case, the question says the dye emits 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy of the emitted photon.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. The energy emitted (2.3393 eV) would be the energy difference between the two states. So the energy that was absorbed must have been higher than that. Because the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, and then emits a photon with lower energy as it relaxes.

Wait, but how does that relate to the color absorbed? Oh, right, because the absorbed light is the one that excited it. So the emitted light is the one we see, but the absorbed light is the complementary color.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. I need to find the wavelength it corresponds to because that would tell me the color. Then, since the dye emits that color, it must have absorbed the complementary color.

Wait, wait, no. Because if a material emits green light, it's because it absorbed higher energy (like blue or violet) and then reemits green. Or is it the opposite? Hmm, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the wavelength of the emitted photon and figure out its color. Then, the absorbed color would be the one that's the complement.

Wait, let me get this straight. The energy E is given as 2.3393 eV. The formula to convert energy to wavelength is E = hc/λ. So λ = hc/E.

Where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J*s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and E is in J. But since E is given in eV, I might need to convert eV to J first.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J.

Calculating that: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.746e-19 J.

So E = 3.746e-19 J.

Now, λ = (6.626e-34 J*s * 3e8 m/s) / (3.746e-19 J) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.746e-19) = approximately 5.306e-7 meters. Which is 530.6 nanometers.

Hmm, 530 nm is in the green region of the spectrum. Wait, because red is around 650-700, orange ~590-620, yellow ~570-590, green ~495-570, blue ~450-495, violet ~400-450. Wait, wait, so 530 is near the middle of green, right?

Wait, but wait, no, 530 is actually in the green but closer to the blue end of green. Like, blue-green. Wait, maybe more like cyan? Or maybe it's considered green. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact boundaries.

But regardless, the emitted light is green. So the color that's emitted is green, which implies that the dye absorbs the complementary color. What's the complementary color of green? It's magenta, right? Or maybe purple. But the options given are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, the complementary of green is magenta, but that's not an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, 2.3393 eV. Let me calculate the wavelength again.

E = 2.3393 eV
λ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV) ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 529.6 nm.

Yes, about 530 nm. Which is green, as before.

So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed green. But wait, that can't be right because if it absorbed green, it wouldn't emit green. Wait, no, no. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the molecule emits light when it drops from an excited state to a lower state. The energy of that emitted photon is the difference between the two states. So the energy absorbed would typically be higher than the emitted energy. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state. Then when it relaxes, it emits a photon with lower energy.

Wait, so the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon. So the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that.

Wait, but how does that relate to the colors? Let's think about the energy of the absorbed photon. Since the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher in energy.

Wait, but if the molecule emits green (530 nm), then the absorbed light must be higher energy, which is shorter wavelength. So higher energy than green. So blue or violet.

Wait, but how do the colors correspond to energy? Let me think about the electromagnetic spectrum. Higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. So violet is around 400 nm, blue around 450, green 500, yellow 570, orange 600, red 700.

So if the emitted photon is 530 nm (green), the absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, so when the dye absorbs a photon, it gets excited. Then emits a photon when it relaxes. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon's energy.

So E_absorbed > E_emitted.

So E_absorbed would be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength of absorbed photon is shorter than 530 nm. So it's blue or violet.

So the absorbed color is blue or violet. So the compound would appear as the complementary color. Wait, no, wait. Because the color we see is the color that isn't absorbed. So if a compound absorbs violet, it reflects the complementary color, which is yellow.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let's think about what color we see. The dye emits light of a certain color. So the emitted color is what we see, but that's when it's in an excited state. But wait, normally, the color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths and reflects others, the reflected one is the color we see.

But in this case, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the dye must have absorbed some light, and then emits this 2.3393 eV photon. So the emitted light is 530 nm which is green. But wait, wait, no. Because when the dye is excited, it emits that photon. So the color we see would be that emitted color, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is: what color is absorbed? Oh, wait. Oh no, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits 2.3393 eV (green), then the absorbed color must have higher energy (shorter wavelength) than that.

So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV, so the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. So it's in the blue or violet region.

So the options are A) Red (long wavelength), B) Violet (short), C) Blue (shorter than green), D) Yellow.

So the absorbed color is either violet or blue. Let's see what the options are. The options are violet (B) or blue (C).

Which one is it? The calculation of the emitted light is 530 nm, which is green. So the absorbed light must be higher energy, which is blue or violet.

Wait, so the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm. So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy, meaning the wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is λ = hc/E_absorbed.

But since E_absorbed is higher than 2.3393 eV, the λ is shorter than 530 nm. So the absorbed photon is either blue (~450-495 nm), or violet (~400-450 nm).

So the question is, what color is absorbed? So the options are B (violet) and C (blue). So which is it?

Let me think again. Maybe there's another approach. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons is the energy difference between the two energy states. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted color is the complementary of the absorbed color. So if the dye emits green, it absorbs magenta. But magenta isn't an option. Alternatively, if the dye emits green, the complementary color is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But none of the options match that.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the dye's color. The dye emits green, so the color we see is green. But the color it absorbs would be the complementary. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the dye emits green when it's excited. But normally, the color you see is the color that's not absorbed, i.e., the reflected color. But in this case, the dye is emitting light. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking what color the dye emits, but no, the question says the dye emits light of that energy, and asks what color is absorbed. So the absorbed color must be higher in energy than the emitted.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV. So, the wavelength is less than 530 nm, which is blue or violet.

Now, 2.3393 eV is approximately 530 nm. Let me check the energy levels for some colors.

Energy of violet light is about 3 eV (since 400 nm is about 3 eV: E=1240/400 ≈3.1 eV). Blue is around 450 nm, which is about 2.76 eV. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher, so in the blue or violet range.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so 450 nm (blue, 2.76 eV) or 400 nm (violet, 3.1 eV).

Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

Which one is correct? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy difference. The molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, then emits a photon with lower energy. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

That is, E_abs = E_emit + energy gap. So E_abs is higher.

So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, which would be in the blue or violet range.

But is there a way to compute the exact wavelength of the absorbed photon? Well, without more information, perhaps not. Because the question doesn't give the energy of the absorbed photon, only the emitted.

Wait, but the question is: what color is absorbed by the organic compound? So it's asking what color of light is absorbed. So the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

But wait, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green). So the absorbed light is higher energy than that, which is blue or violet.

So the options are B and C. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the answer is violet. Because blue is about 450 nm (2.76 eV), which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, so the color is either blue or violet.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy, how can I decide between blue and violet?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick. Because if the dye emits green light, it must have absorbed light of higher energy than green, which is blue or violet. So the absorbed color is blue or violet.

Wait, but looking at the options, the only blue-related option is C (Blue) and B (Violet). So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the possible absorbed photon's energy. Let me think. Since the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher.

But without knowing the energy gap, it's difficult. Maybe, but perhaps the question is implying that the absorbed photon is in the visible range, so the absorption is in the blue or violet.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the color that's emitted is the color of the light that the molecule doesn't absorb. So if the molecule emits green, then it must have absorbed other colors, and the green is what's left. But that doesn't fit because the molecule is emitting, not reflecting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too stuck. Let me think of the options. The possible colors for absorption are violet or blue. So the options are B and C.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's compare that to some known colors.

Violet: ~400 nm → E=1240/400 ≈3.1 eV.

Blue: ~450 nm → E=1240/450≈2.76 eV.

So 2.3393 is lower than blue's energy. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV, so it's either blue (2.76 eV) or violet (3.1 eV). 

So between B and C, which one is higher than 2.3393 eV. Both are, but which one is the correct absorbed color.

Wait, but the question is, which color is absorbed. So if the absorbed photon is higher in energy than emitted, the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

So the options are B and C. How to choose between them?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is violet. Because the emitted photon is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. The absorbed photon must be higher energy, which would be at the blue or violet end.

But I'm not sure. I think the answer is violet. So the correct option is B.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So for the absorbed photon, the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. So blue is 450 nm (2.76 eV), which is higher than 2.3393 eV. Violet is 400 nm (3.1 eV), which is even higher.

So the absorbed color could be either, but the question is what color is absorbed. The options are B (violet) and C (blue).

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the correct way is to select the color with higher energy than the emitted. Both B and C are higher, so how to choose.

Wait, perhaps the question is based on the fact that the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon is at a higher energy.

But how does that translate to color.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the complementary color. The color that's not emitted would be the one absorbed. But that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the color wheel. Green's complementary color is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But in the options, the closest would be red or blue.

But the options don't include magenta, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the emitted light is the same as the absorbed light's complementary. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is magenta. But since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the question is referring to the actual wavelength absorbed.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

The emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm, green.

The absorbed light is higher in energy, so shorter wavelength: blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

Which of these is higher than 2.3393 eV? Both, but the question is asking what color is absorbed.

So the absorbed color could be either B or C.

Wait, but perhaps I have to think about the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted. If the molecule absorbed blue (2.76 eV) and emitted green (2.3393 eV), the energy difference would be 2.76 - 2.3393 ≈ 0.42 eV, which is in the infrared, so not visible. But that's okay because the energy difference is not necessarily visible; it's the absorbed photon that's in the visible range.

But I'm not sure if that matters.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to know that the emitted light's wavelength is 530 nm (green), so the absorbed is the complementary, which is in the magenta region. Since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the question is designed so that the absorbed is blue.

Wait, but blue is 450 nm, which is higher energy than green. So the absorbed color is blue. So option C.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me think: higher energy than green is blue or violet. So the absorbed color is either B or C.

But which one is correct?

I think I'm overcomplicating. The question simply asks what color is absorbed. So the emitted color is green, so the absorbed must be a color with higher energy (shorter wavelength). So either B or C. Since the options don't have both, I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the energy of 2.3393 eV (emitted) corresponds to green. The absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So let's calculate the colors with energy higher than 2.3393 eV.

Violet: 3.1 eV (400 nm)
Blue: 2.76 eV (450 nm)
Green: 2.3393 eV (530 nm)
Yellow: around 2.14 eV (570 nm)
Red: ~1.9 eV (650 nm)

So the absorbed color must be either violet or blue.

So the options are B and C. So which one is it?

Hmm, but the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye emits green light when it relaxes. So the dye must have absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet) to get excited.

So the question is, which color is absorbed? The options are B and C.

I think the correct answer is B) Violet, because violet is higher in energy than blue.

Wait, no, wait. Violet is higher energy than blue. So if the emitted energy is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed must be higher. So the absorbed color could be violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.76 eV).

Wait, but 2.76 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV, so blue is also an option.

So both B and C are possible. But the question expects a single answer.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is to find the absorbed wavelength.

Wait, no, the question says the dye emits 2.3393 eV. So the dye absorbed a higher energy photon.

But without knowing the energy of the absorbed photon, perhaps we can only say it's either blue or violet.

But the options are B and C. So which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color that's not emitted. So if the dye emits green, the color it doesn't emit is the one it absorbed. But that doesn't make sense because the dye could absorb multiple wavelengths.

Wait, perhaps the question is mistakenly phrased. Maybe it's asking what color is emitted, but no, the question says what color is absorbed.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher. So the wavelength is shorter. Among the options, violet (B) is the shortest, then blue (C).

So the absorbed color is violet, so the answer is option B.

Wait, but wait: the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the color absorbed is either blue or violet. So which one is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, blue is about 2.76 eV, which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed color could be blue.

But violet is even higher. So the correct answer is B, violet.

Wait, but wait. Because 2.3393 eV is less than 2.76 eV (blue) and less than 3.1 eV (violet). So the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet.

But since the options don't have both, perhaps the question is designed to choose the one that's more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is such that the absorbed photon is blue.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, let me think again. Since the emitted light is 530 nm, which is green, the absorbed light must be a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than that. The next higher colors are blue and then violet.

So the color absorbed would be either blue or violet. But given the options, which one is it?

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, I'm going to have to make a decision here. I'll go with B) Violet as the absorbed color.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light. The energy of the emitted photon is given as **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength calculated using the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), and \( E \) is the energy in joules. Converting \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \) to joules:

\[
E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} \approx 3.746 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{3.746 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.306 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 530.6 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This wavelength corresponds to green light. Since the compound emits green light, it must have absorbed light of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to excite the molecule to a higher energy state. The absorbed photon's energy is therefore greater than \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \), meaning its wavelength is shorter than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \).

The visible spectrum ranges from approximately \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) (violet) to \( 700 \, \text{nm} \) (red). Wavelengths shorter than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \) correspond to blue (\( \sim 450 \, \text{nm} \)) or violet (\( \sim 400 \, \text{nm} \)) light. Among the given options:

- **Red (A):** Wavelengths longer than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \), so it cannot be the absorbed color.
- **Violet (B):** Wavelengths shorter than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \), corresponding to higher energy than green.
- **Blue (C):** Wavelengths shorter than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \), corresponding to higher energy than green.
- **Yellow (D):** Wavelengths longer than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \), so it cannot be the absorbed color.

Both violet and blue are possible candidates for the absorbed color, as they have higher energy than green. However, violet light has a shorter wavelength and higher energy than blue light. Since the question asks for the absorbed color, and violet is the higher energy option, the most likely answer is **violet**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that when something emits light, it's usually after absorbing some other wavelength. Oh right, that's the whole photoelectric effect thing, but I think this is more about visible light and color.

So the emitted light is the one with lower energy than the absorbed? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no. The energy levels: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon would be the difference between the higher and lower states. But in this case, the question says the dye emits 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy of the emitted photon.

Wait, let me get this straight. The energy E is given as 2.3393 eV. The formula to convert energy to wavelength is E = hc/λ. So λ = hc/E.

Where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J*s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and E is in J. But since E is given in eV, I might need to convert eV to J first.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J.

Calculating that: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.746e-19 J.

So E = 3.746e-19 J.

Now, λ = (6.626e-34 J*s * 3e8 m/s) / (3.746e-19 J) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.746e-19) = approximately 5.306e-7 meters. Which is 530.6 nanometers.

Hmm, 530 nm is in the green region of the spectrum. Wait, because red is around 650-700, orange ~590-620, yellow ~570-590, green ~495-570, blue ~450-495, violet ~400-450. Wait, wait, so 530 is near the middle of green, right?

Wait, but wait, no, 530 is actually in the green but closer to the blue end of green. Like, blue-green. Wait, maybe more like cyan? Or maybe it's considered green. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact boundaries.

But regardless, the emitted light is green. So the color that's emitted is green, which implies that the dye absorbs the complementary color. What's the complementary color of green? It's magenta, right? Or maybe purple. But the options given are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, the complementary of green is magenta, but that's not an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, 2.3393 eV. Let me calculate the wavelength again.

E = 2.3393 eV
λ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV) ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 529.6 nm.

Yes, about 530 nm. Which is green, as before.

So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed green. But wait, that can't be right because if it absorbed green, it wouldn't emit green. Wait, no, no. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the molecule emits light when it drops from an excited state to a lower state. The energy of that emitted photon is the difference between the two states. So the energy absorbed would typically be higher than the emitted energy. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state. Then when it relaxes, it emits a photon with lower energy.

Wait, so the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon. So the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that.

Wait, but how does that relate to the colors? Let's think about the energy of the absorbed photon. Since the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher in energy.

Wait, but if the molecule emits green (530 nm), then the absorbed light must be higher energy, which is shorter wavelength. So higher energy than green. So blue or violet.

Wait, but how do the colors correspond to energy? Let me think about the electromagnetic spectrum. Higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. So violet is around 400 nm, blue around 450, green 500, yellow 570, orange 600, red 700.

So if the emitted photon is 530 nm (green), the absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, so when the dye absorbs a photon, it gets excited. Then emits a photon when it relaxes. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon's energy.

So E_absorbed > E_emitted.

So E_absorbed would be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength of absorbed photon is shorter than 530 nm. So it's blue or violet.

So the absorbed color is blue or violet. So the compound would appear as the complementary color. Wait, no, wait. Because the color we see is the color that isn't absorbed. So if a compound absorbs violet, it reflects the complementary color, which is yellow.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let's think about what color we see. The dye emits light of a certain color. So the emitted color is what we see, but that's when it's in an excited state. But wait, normally, the color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths and reflects others, the reflected one is the color we see.

But in this case, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the dye must have absorbed some light, and then emits this 2.3393 eV photon. So the emitted light is 530 nm which is green. But wait, wait, no. Because when the dye is excited, it emits that photon. So the color we see would be that emitted color, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is: what color is absorbed? Oh, wait. Oh no, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits 2.3393 eV (green), then the absorbed color must have higher energy (shorter wavelength) than that.

So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV, so the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. So it's in the blue or violet region.

So the options are A) Red (long wavelength), B) Violet (short), C) Blue (shorter than green), D) Yellow.

So the absorbed color is either violet or blue. Let's see what the options are. The options are violet (B) or blue (C).

Which one is it? The calculation of the emitted light is 530 nm, which is green. So the absorbed light must be higher energy, which is blue or violet.

Wait, so the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm. So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy, meaning the wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is λ = hc/E_absorbed.

But since E_absorbed is higher than 2.3393 eV, the λ is shorter than 530 nm. So the absorbed photon is either blue (~450-495 nm), or violet (~400-450 nm).

So the question is, what color is absorbed? So the options are B (violet) and C (blue). So which is it?

Let me think again. Maybe there's another approach. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons is the energy difference between the two energy states. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted color is the complementary of the absorbed color. So if the dye emits green, it absorbs magenta. But magenta isn't an option. Alternatively, if the dye emits green, the complementary color is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But none of the options match that.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the dye's color. The dye emits green, so the color we see is green. But the color it absorbs would be the complementary. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the dye emits green when it's excited. But normally, the color you see is the color that's not absorbed, i.e., the reflected color. But in this case, the dye is emitting light. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking what color the dye emits, but no, the question says the dye emits light of that energy, and asks what color is absorbed. So the absorbed color must be higher in energy than the emitted.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV. So, the wavelength is less than 530 nm, which is blue or violet.

Now, 2.3393 eV is approximately 530 nm. Let me check the energy levels for some colors.

Energy of violet light is about 3 eV (since 400 nm is about 3 eV: E=1240/400 ≈3.1 eV). Blue is around 450 nm, which is about 2.76 eV. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher, so in the blue or violet range.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so 450 nm (blue, 2.76 eV) or 400 nm (violet, 3.1 eV).

Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

Which one is correct? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy difference. The molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, then emits a photon with lower energy. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

That is, E_abs = E_emit + energy gap. So E_abs is higher.

So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, which would be in the blue or violet range.

But is there a way to compute the exact wavelength of the absorbed photon? Well, without more information, perhaps not. Because the question doesn't give the energy of the absorbed photon, only the emitted.

Wait, but the question is: what color is absorbed by the organic compound? So it's asking what color of light is absorbed. So the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

But wait, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green). So the absorbed light is higher energy than that, which is blue or violet.

So the options are B and C. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the answer is violet. Because blue is about 450 nm (2.76 eV), which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, so the color is either blue or violet.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy, how can I decide between blue and violet?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick. Because if the dye emits green light, it must have absorbed light of higher energy than green, which is blue or violet. So the absorbed color is blue or violet.

Wait, but looking at the options, the only blue-related option is C (Blue) and B (Violet). So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the possible absorbed photon's energy. Let me think. Since the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher.

But without knowing the energy gap, it's difficult. Maybe, but perhaps the question is implying that the absorbed photon is in the visible range, so the absorption is in the blue or violet.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the color that's emitted is the color of the light that the molecule doesn't absorb. So if the molecule emits green, then it must have absorbed other colors, and the green is what's left. But that doesn't fit because the molecule is emitting, not reflecting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too stuck. Let me think of the options. The possible colors for absorption are violet or blue. So the options are B and C.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's compare that to some known colors.

Violet: ~400 nm → E=1240/400 ≈3.1 eV.

Blue: ~450 nm → E=1240/450≈2.76 eV.

So 2.3393 is lower than blue's energy. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV, so it's either blue (2.76 eV) or violet (3.1 eV). 

So between B and C, which one is higher than 2.3393 eV. Both are, but which one is the correct absorbed color.

Wait, but the question is, which color is absorbed. So if the absorbed photon is higher in energy than emitted, the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

So the options are B and C. How to choose between them?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is violet. Because the emitted photon is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. The absorbed photon must be higher energy, which would be at the blue or violet end.

But I'm not sure. I think the answer is violet. So the correct option is B.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So for the absorbed photon, the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. So blue is 450 nm (2.76 eV), which is higher than 2.3393 eV. Violet is 400 nm (3.1 eV), which is even higher.

So the absorbed color could be either, but the question is what color is absorbed. The options are B (violet) and C (blue).

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the correct way is to select the color with higher energy than the emitted. Both B and C are higher, so how to choose.

Wait, perhaps the question is based on the fact that the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon is at a higher energy.

But how does that translate to color.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the complementary color. The color that's not emitted would be the one absorbed. But that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the color wheel. Green's complementary color is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But in the options, the closest would be red or blue.

But the options don't include magenta, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the emitted light is the same as the absorbed light's complementary. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is magenta. But since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the question is referring to the actual wavelength absorbed.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

The emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm, green.

The absorbed light is higher in energy, so shorter wavelength: blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

Which of these is higher than 2.3393 eV? Both, but the question is asking what color is absorbed.

So the absorbed color could be either B or C.

Wait, but perhaps I have to think about the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted. If the molecule absorbed blue (2.76 eV) and emitted green (2.3393 eV), the energy difference would be 2.76 - 2.3393 ≈ 0.42 eV, which is in the infrared, so not visible. But that's okay because the energy difference is not necessarily visible; it's the absorbed photon that's in the visible range.

But I'm not sure if that matters.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to know that the emitted light's wavelength is 530 nm (green), so the absorbed is the complementary, which is in the magenta region. Since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the question is designed so that the absorbed is blue.

Wait, but blue is 450 nm, which is higher energy than green. So the absorbed color is blue. So option C.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me think: higher energy than green is blue or violet. So the absorbed color is either B or C.

But which one is correct?

I think I'm overcomplicating. The question simply asks what color is absorbed. So the emitted color is green, so the absorbed must be a color with higher energy (shorter wavelength). So either B or C. Since the options don't have both, I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the energy of 2.3393 eV (emitted) corresponds to green. The absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So let's calculate the colors with energy higher than 2.3393 eV.

Violet: 3.1 eV (400 nm)
Blue: 2.76 eV (450 nm)
Green: 2.3393 eV (530 nm)
Yellow: around 2.14 eV (570 nm)
Red: ~1.9 eV (650 nm)

So the absorbed color must be either violet or blue.

So the options are B and C. So which one is it?

Hmm, but the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye emits green light when it relaxes. So the dye must have absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet) to get excited.

So the question is, which color is absorbed? The options are B and C.

I think the correct answer is B) Violet, because violet is higher in energy than blue.

Wait, no, wait. Violet is higher energy than blue. So if the emitted energy is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed must be higher. So the absorbed color could be violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.76 eV).

Wait, but 2.76 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV, so blue is also an option.

So both B and C are possible. But the question expects a single answer.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is to find the absorbed wavelength.

Wait, no, the question says the dye emits 2.3393 eV. So the dye absorbed a higher energy photon.

But without knowing the energy of the absorbed photon, perhaps we can only say it's either blue or violet.

But the options are B and C. So which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color that's not emitted. So if the dye emits green, the color it doesn't emit is the one it absorbed. But that doesn't make sense because the dye could absorb multiple wavelengths.

Wait, perhaps the question is mistakenly phrased. Maybe it's asking what color is emitted, but no, the question says what color is absorbed.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher. So the wavelength is shorter. Among the options, violet (B) is the shortest, then blue (C).

So the absorbed color is violet, so the answer is option B.

Wait, but wait: the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the color absorbed is either blue or violet. So which one is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, blue is about 2.76 eV, which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed color could be blue.

But violet is even higher. So the correct answer is B, violet.

Wait, but wait. Because 2.3393 eV is less than 2.76 eV (blue) and less than 3.1 eV (violet). So the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet.

But since the options don't have both, perhaps the question is designed to choose the one that's more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is such that the absorbed photon is blue.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, let me think again. Since the emitted light is 530 nm, which is green, the absorbed light must be a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than that. The next higher colors are blue and then violet.

So the color absorbed would be either blue or violet. But given the options, which one is it?

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, I'm going to have to make a decision here. I'll go with B) Violet as the absorbed color.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light. The energy of the emitted photon is given as **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength calculated using the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), and \( E \) is the energy in joules. Converting \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \) to joules:

\[
E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} \approx 3.746 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{3.746 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.306 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 530.6 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This wavelength corresponds to green light. Since the compound emits green light, it must have absorbed light of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to excite the molecule to a higher energy state. The absorbed photon's energy is therefore greater than \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \), meaning its wavelength is shorter than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \).

The visible spectrum ranges from approximately \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) (violet) to \( 700 \, \text{nm} \) (red). Wavelengths shorter than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \) correspond to blue (\( \sim 450 \, \text{nm} \)) or violet (\( \sim 400 \, \text{nm} \)) light. Among the given options:

- **Red (A):** Wavelengths longer than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \), so it cannot be the absorbed color.
- **Violet (B):** Wavelengths shorter than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \), corresponding to higher energy than green.
- **Blue (C):** Wavelengths shorter than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \), corresponding to higher energy than green.
- **Yellow (D):** Wavelengths longer than \( 530 \, \text{nm} \), so it cannot be the absorbed color.

Both violet and blue are possible candidates for the absorbed color, as they have higher energy than green. However, violet light has a shorter wavelength and higher energy than blue light. Since the question asks for the absorbed color, and violet is the higher energy option, the most likely answer is **violet**.

Answer: B
