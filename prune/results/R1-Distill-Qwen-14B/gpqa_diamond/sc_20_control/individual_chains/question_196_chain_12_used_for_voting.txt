Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. But wait, this is relativistic, so I need to consider how relativity affects the motion.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're asked to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic problem. So relativistic effects probably change things.

Relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I should think about using relativistic equations instead of the classical ones. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In this case, the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium position, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

So the potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA², same as before. The total energy E is then (1/2)kA². At maximum speed, all of this energy is kinetic, so:

E = (gamma - 1) mc² = 1/2 k A²

Wait, but if E is relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy? Or is it just the kinetic energy? Hmm. Let me think again. The rest mass energy is mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So the total energy is gamma mc².

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The total mechanical energy in the classical case is E = (1/2)kA². In the relativistic scenario, the total energy would be E = (gamma) mc², because the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy.

So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero. So the total energy at that point is purely potential. But wait, in the classical oscillator, potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, maybe the potential energy expression changes? Or is it still the same?

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator comes from the elastic potential, which is (1/2)kx², which I think doesn't change because it's Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So the potential energy is the same. So at position x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that point, kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA².

But wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. So E = mc². Wait, that can't be right because (1/2)kA² must equal E.

Wait, maybe that's where I'm getting confused. In the classical case, E = (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total mechanical energy is (gamma) mc². So at maximum displacement, velocity v=0, so gamma=1, so E = mc². That implies (1/2)kA² = mc². But that seems unlikely because usually, A is not that large.

Wait, perhaps this approach is incorrect. Maybe I need to consider the relativistic dynamics more carefully. Let me think about energy conservation.

At maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So the total energy is gamma mc², where gamma is evaluated at v_max.

Wait, no. No, wait. The total energy should be the same in both cases. So:

At x = A: E = (1/2)kA² + 0 (kinetic) = (1/2)kA².

At x=0: E = 0 (potential) + (gamma - 1) mc² (kinetic) = (gamma - 1) mc².

So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So (gamma -1 ) = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, but that can't be right because gamma is greater than 1, and (k A²)/(2 m c² ) might not be positive. But k, A, m, c² are positive, so yes.

So gamma = [ (k A²) / (2 m c² ) ] + 1.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, but let me compute that correctly. From (gamma - 1) = (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But then, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me write that as:

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, maybe I should rearrange this equation to solve for v.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as alpha for simplicity. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then, gamma = 1 + alpha.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Thus,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ] )

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have here. So option D is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think is to consider conservation of energy.

Another approach: in the relativistic case, the total energy is E = (gamma) mc².

At x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. So E = mc². But in the classical oscillator, E is (1/2) k A². So in this case, (1/2) k A² = mc²? That can't be right because then A would be enormous, but that's only if the potential energy equals the rest energy. But that's not necessarily the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine this.

In the relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is E = (gamma) mc² + (1/2) k x²? No, no, that's not correct. The potential energy is (1/2)k x², same as before, but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So the total energy is (gamma) mc² + (1/2)k x²? No, wait, no, because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v_max² + (1/2) k A²? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to write the total mechanical energy as the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. So when x is maximum (x = A), velocity is zero. So, at that point, the total energy is mc² (rest energy) plus potential energy (1/2)k A².

Wait, that can't be. Because in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2) k A², and the kinetic energy is zero, so total energy is just (1/2)k A². But in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So perhaps when x = A, the total energy is (gamma) mc², but gamma is 1 because velocity is zero. So E = mc², but that's supposed to equal the potential energy (1/2 k A²). That would only be possible if (1/2)k A² = mc², which would mean A is sqrt(2 m c^2 / k). That's a very specific condition. But the problem doesn't state that, so perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should think about it as the potential energy being (1/2) k x², and the kinetic energy being (gamma - 1) mc². So total energy E is:

E = (gamma - 1) mc² + (1/2) k x².

At x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, so E = 0 + (1/2)k A².

At x = 0, velocity is maximum, so E = (gamma -1) mc² + 0. So:

(1/2) k A^2 = (gamma -1) mc².

So gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Which brings me back to the same equation as before. So I think that approach is correct.

So, solving for v_max, I get the expression in option D.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is what I derived.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Total Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is conserved. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential energy:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is relativistic kinetic energy:
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Equating Energies**:  
   At \( x = A \), the total energy is purely potential:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   At \( x = 0 \), the total energy is purely kinetic:
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]
   Setting these equal gives:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]

3. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Rearranging for \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) into this equation and solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \), we find:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression does not match the derived result.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The denominator inside the square root is inconsistent with the derived result.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This is the classical expression for maximum speed and does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct. This matches the derived relativistic expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
