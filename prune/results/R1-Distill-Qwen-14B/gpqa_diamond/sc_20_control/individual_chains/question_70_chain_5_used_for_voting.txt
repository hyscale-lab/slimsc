Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the molecular symmetry of product E. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The first part says that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents is a lot. I remember that sometimes in reactions, the number of equivalents can give a clue about the stoichiometry. Like, maybe A is something that reacts in an 8:1 ratio with B.

Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Okay, so C is reacting further. And when C reacts with water, it reforms A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acid might be something like H2SO4, and weak like CH3COOH, but I'm not sure yet.

D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Hmm, B and D making H, a solvent. So what solvents are made from reactions of gases? Maybe something like H2O, but that's a liquid. Or maybe something like ethanol or something else. Wait, but B and D are gases reacting to make a solvent.

Let me try to think of possible reactions. Maybe A is a metal oxide or something, and B is a halogen or another gas. Let's think about the first reaction: A + 8B → C (bright red). Bright red product—could that be something like silver chloride? No, but silver chloride is white. Wait, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, reacting with something to form a red product. Or perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, copper(II) oxide is black, not red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is sodium oxide. If B is chlorine gas, 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of Cl2. Wait, sodium oxide (Na2O) reacting with Cl2? Let's think: Na2O + Cl2 → NaCl. But that's 1 equivalent, because Na2O has two Na. Wait, if it's 8 equivalents of Cl2, that would be 4 moles of Na2O reacting with 8 moles of Cl2?

Wait, maybe A is something else. Let me think about the product when C reacts with water. It forms A plus two acids, F and G. So, C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives back A and two acids. That suggests that C is perhaps a salt of the conjugate base of F and G. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, then their conjugate bases would be weak and strong, respectively. So, for example, if F is H2SO4 (strong), its conjugate base is SO4^2- (which is a weak base). G, a weak acid, would have a stronger conjugate base, like CH3COO^-.

Wait, but when C reacts with water, it gives A plus F and G. So C is likely a salt: maybe a metal sulfate and another salt. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride, and when it reacts with water, it gives a metal hydroxide and HCl (a strong acid) and another acid.

Wait, but the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So after hydrolysis, you get A, which is solid, and two acids. Maybe C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, if C is NaNO3, but that's just a thought.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate compound. Wait, but then how does it form with A and 8 B? Let me think again about the first reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Could A be a metal, and B be something like O2? No, O2 is a diatomic gas. Wait, maybe B is another gas, like Cl2.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about product E. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. And D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, a solvent.

Let me consider what E could be. Extremely hazardous—maybe something like sarin gas, but that's more of an organophosphate. Or perhaps something like phosgene, but I'm not certain. Or maybe something like hydrogen cyanide, but that's a gas itself.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine, but the reaction with C would have to produce it. Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve agent, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps D is a gas like CO2. Then, when D reacts with B, which is another gas, say, maybe something like NaOH? No, wait, H is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is CO2, then H would be something like HCl, but that's a gas. Not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is Na and D is something else. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D to form E. C is bright red. Let me think about compounds that are bright red. Maybe it's a transition metal complex. For example, CoCl2 is blue, but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe C is AgBr, but that's pale yellow. Wait, maybe it's a nitrate? Not sure.

Wait, if C is a nitrate salt, then reacting with another gas could produce something like NO or NO2, which are poisonous. For example, if C is NaNO3 and D is CO (carbon monoxide), but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide and D is a halogen. Let's say C is FeO and D is Cl2. Then, FeO + Cl2 → FeCl3? But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction C + water → A + F + G. Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze into those. For example, if C is sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, then hydrolysis would give NaOH (a strong base, but F is an acid. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if C is ammonium carbonate, (NH4)2CO3, then hydrolysis gives NH4OH (a weak acid, F) and H2CO3 (which is a weak acid, G). But then F would be NH4OH (which is weak), and G is H2CO3 (also weak). But the question says F is strong and G is weak. So that doesn't fit.

Another thought: Suppose C is a sulfide salt. For example, if C is FeS, then hydrolysis would give Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid, and Fe(OH)2 is a base. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, what if C is a nitride? For instance, Na3N. Hydrolysis would give NaOH and NH3. But again, both are bases. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, if C is Al2(SO4)3, then hydrolysis would give Al(OH)3 and H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid, which would be F, and Al(OH)3 is a weak base, but the problem states that it produces two acids. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. Hydrolysis in water would give Ca(OH)2 and CO2. But CO2 is a weak acid (carb acid), and Ca(OH)2 is a base. But again, we need two acids.

Another angle: Maybe C is a metal nitrate. For instance, if C is Cu(NO3)2, hydrolysis would produce Cu(OH)2 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid, which would be F, and Cu(OH)2 is a base. But again, only one acid product.

Hmm, maybe C is a salt that hydrolyzes into two different acids. That would mean that the anion is a conjugate base of a weak acid, and the cation is a conjugate base of another weak acid. Wait, but that seems unlikely because cations are usually from strong bases.

Wait a second, perhaps the salt C is something like ammonium carbonate, which when dissolved in water, would produce ammonium bicarbonate and water, but that's not two acids. Alternatively, maybe it's something like potassium hydrogen sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid (sulfurous acid), and NaOH is a strong base. But that doesn't help because we need two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. Let's say C is something like sodium dihydrogen phosphate, NaH2PO4. Hydrolysis would produce H3PO4 (a weak acid) and NaOH. But again, only one acid.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the first reaction again. A and B reacting in an 8:1 ratio to form C. Maybe A is an oxide and B is a halogen. For example, if A is FeO, and B is Cl2. The reaction would be FeO + 2 Cl2 → FeCl3 + ClO? No, that doesn't balance. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is Cl2, and they form a chloride. For example, Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. But the stoichiometry would be 1 Fe to 3 Cl2, not 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe A is Na and B is Cl2. The reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. That's 1 equivalent of Cl2 per 2 Na. But the question says 8 equivalents, so perhaps A is something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal oxide with a high valency. For example, if A is PbO2, which is a dark brown solid. But reacting with Cl2, how? PbO2 + Cl2 → PbCl2 + O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is Cl2, and the reaction produces a high chlorination product. For instance, maybe A is magnesium, and B is Cl2, forming MgCl2. But MgCl2 is white, not bright red.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal, and B is Cl2. Let's say A is Fe. Fe reacts with Cl2 in a combustion reaction: Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. But the stoichiometry is 1 Fe : 3 Cl2. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would imply (8/3) moles of Fe. But that doesn't fit neatly.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is O2. Reaction would produce a metal oxide. For example, 4Al + 3O2 → 2Al2O3. So 3 equivalents of O2 for 4 Al. But the question has 8 equivalents, so that's 8 O2 per  something of A. Not sure.

Wait, maybe A is a metal oxide, and B is CO2. For example, if A is Na2O, reacting with CO2: Na2O + CO2 → Na2CO3. But that's 1 equivalent. So 8 equivalents would imply 8 CO2 for 1 Na2O, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe A is a non-metal. For example, S reacting with something. S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But I'm not sure how that ties into the other parts.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like O2. For example, 2A + B → product. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, let's think about the color of product C. Bright red. That's a distinctive color. Maybe it's a nitro compound or something with a strong chromophore. Let me think—could it be something like Fe(SCN)_n^3-n, which is red? But that's a coordination compound. If so, maybe C is a complex like that. Then, when C reacts with D, which is another gas, perhaps it breaks down into something toxic.

Wait, if C is Fe(SCN)_n^3-n, then reacting with Cl2 (if D is Cl2) might lead to a reaction, but I'm not sure what product that would give. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like HCN or another highly toxic gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide with a red color. For example, CuS is black, but perhaps another sulfide. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a transition metal chloride. For example, CoCl2 is blue, but maybe another. Alternatively, perhaps C is AgBr, but that's pale yellow. I'm not getting it.

Let me go back to the reaction of C with water. So, it's C + H2O → A + F + G. So, A is a solid, and F and G are acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is something like acetic acid. But that would require C being a salt containing both sulfate and acetate ions. That seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a metal bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it's already in solution, but perhaps not. Alternatively, if C is sodium carbonate, then hydrolysis gives NaOH and CO2. But both are bases and a weak acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sodium salt of a diprotic acid. For example, Na2HPO4. Hydrolysis would give NaOH and H2PO4^- which can further dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+. But I'm not sure how that fits with two acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about E, which is the product of C reacting with D. E is extremely hazardous. Let me think about what reactions produce very dangerous substances.

One possibility is that E is a nerve agent, but perhaps more likely, E is something like chlorine gas or phosgene (which is highly toxic). If D is COCl2, for example, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvent could be something like ethanol, but that's produced from something else. Alternatively, H could be H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Wait, but D and B are gases. So their reaction produces H as a solvent, which is liquid. For example, if B is H2 and D is CO2, that would make H2O? But 1:1 ratio would be H2 + CO2 → H2O + something else? No, that's not balanced.

Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is NaOH (but NaOH is a solid, not a gas). Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. They react in 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is methanol. Then, what reaction of gases would produce methanol? Maybe CO and H2 reacting in a certain condition. Oh, like in the Fischer-Tropsch process, but that's more for longer hydrocarbons.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diethyl ether, but I'm not sure how that would form from gases.

Wait, maybe B is H2 and D is CO. Then, H could be CH3OH (methanol), a solvent. The reaction would be H2 + CO → CH3OH. But that's a synthesis reaction, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry or the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2O (a gas under certain conditions) and D is something else. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2. Their reaction would produce H2O, but that's not a solvent in the sense of being a product here.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is CH4. They react to form CO and H2O, but again, not helpful.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about E again. If E is a highly toxic gas, what are the possibilities? Chlorine gas is toxic, but I'm not sure how it would be formed from C and D. Another possibility is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. How would that form?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a base, but that's not involving gases. Alternatively, maybe it's formed from carbon dioxide and chlorine in the presence of a catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is hydrogen cyanide (HCN). How would that form? If C is a cyanide salt and D is an acid. But D is a gas, so maybe D is HCl. Then, C (a cyanide salt) reacts with HCl to produce HCN and the corresponding chloride.

For example, C could be NaCN. Then, NaCN + 2 HCl → NaCl + H2O + HCN↑. But in that case, D would be HCl. Then, D (HCl) reacts with B (maybe NaOH, but B is a gas). Wait, B is a gas, so if B is another gas, perhaps Cl2. Then, D is HCl, and B is Cl2.

Wait, D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, if D is HCl and B is Cl2, then H could be something like HClO (but that's a gas), or maybe HCl reacts with Cl2 in some way. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then, H could be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to piece this together. Let me try to find A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

1. A +8 B → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent)

Looking at point 4: D and B are gases, H is a solvent. So, H could be something like ethanol (but that's a liquid, not a gas) or maybe methanol. How can two gases react to form a liquid? For example, if D is CO and B is H2, they can react to form methanol (CH3OH), which is a liquid. So D is CO, B is H2, H is CH3OH.

So, D is CO, B is H2.

Then, in reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What could A be that reacts with H2 in such a way? Well, H2 is a reducing agent. Maybe A is a metal oxide. Let's say A is CuO. Then, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But the stoichiometry here is 1 mole CuO + 1 mole H2 → 1 mole Cu + 1 mole H2O. But the question says 8 equivalents of H2, implying 8 H2 per 1 A. So perhaps A is something else.

Wait, maybe A is Fe3O4. Then, Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. That's 4 H2 per 1 Fe3O4. But the question uses 8 H2, so maybe 2 Fe3O4 + 8 H2 → 6 Fe + 8 H2O. But then, product C would be Fe, which is not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide that reduces to a different oxide which is bright red. For example, if A is PbO2 (which is dark brown), and upon reaction with H2, it reduces to PbO (yellow) or Pb (bright silver). But that doesn't fit the bright red.

Wait, another angle: Maybe A is a metal oxide that upon reaction with H2 forms a metal and water, and the product C is something else. Or perhaps A is a non-metal oxide.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 + H2 → CaO + CO2 + H2O. But I don't think that's a reaction that occurs without high temperatures, and the product wouldn't be bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2 + H2 → Mg + NH3. But again, the product isn't red.

Wait, maybe A is a non-metal. For example, sulfur (S). S + H2 → under certain conditions, forms H2S. But S is a solid, and H2S is a gas. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal, and B is H2. Then, A is oxidized by H2 in some way. But I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal in a higher oxidation state. For example, KMnO4, but that's a strong oxidizing agent and would react with H2 to form MnO2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a combustion reaction. For example, if A is a metal, and B is O2. Then, 8 equivalents of O2 would be involved. But the product would be a metal oxide, not bright red.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS reacts with H2 to form Fe and H2S. But FeS is a solid, H2S is a gas, and the product Fe is a solid, not bright red.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the reactions in a different way.

Looking at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Let's think of two strong and weak acids. For example, if F is H2SO4 and G is CH3COOH. Then, C would be a salt that when hydrolyzed produces both. But that's not a common salt formula. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite carbonate, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, if C is Fe2(SO4)3, then hydrolysis would give Fe(OH)3 and H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid (F), and Fe(OH)3 is a base. But the problem says two acids, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, then hydrolysis gives NaOH (base) and H2CO3 (weak acid). Again, only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a strong base and weak acid. For example, if C is NH4Cl, which when dissolved in water would produce NH4OH (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid). But NH4OH is a weak base, not an acid. Wait, no. NH4Cl in water dissociates into NH4+ and Cl^-; NH4+ reacts with water to produce NH3 and H3O+. So, in that case, F would be H3O+ (from the strong acid HCl), and G would be NH4OH? Not exactly, because NH4OH is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a more complex salt. Suppose C is something like NaHSO4. Then, NaHSO4 is a strong acid (since it's a salt of a strong acid and a weak base). When dissolved in water, it would give Na+ and HSO4^- which can dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-. But that would produce H+ (from HSO4^-), which is a strong acid, and perhaps some other species. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate salt, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a salt that contains both sulfates and another acid's salt. For example, if C is NaHSO4·NaHCO3, but that seems complicated. When it reacts with water, it might give NaOH, H2SO4, and H2CO3. Wait, H2CO3 is a weak acid. So F could be H2SO4 (strong) and G could be H2CO3 (weak). But would such a salt exist? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of salts, but that's unlikely given the way the problem is structured.

Hmm, maybe I should think about E. If E is a highly toxic gas, and D is CO, then E could be carbon monoxide, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Or perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. How would that form?

If D is CO and B is Cl2, then perhaps C reacts with Cl2 to produce COCl2. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, if D is Cl2 and B is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If B is H2 and D is CO, then H is CH3OH (methanol), which is a solvent. So D is CO, B is H2. That seems plausible.

So, D is CO, B is H2.

Then, reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What could A be that reacts with H2 to form a bright red product?

Wait, maybe A is a metal oxide that when reduced with H2 forms a metal and water. For example, Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe + H2O. But Fe is silver, not red. Alternatively, maybe A is a nitride. For example, Si3N4 + H2 → Si + NH3. But Si is a metalloid, not bright red.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal in a +3 oxidation state, and upon reduction, forms a +2 oxidation state, which is red. For example, V2O5 is orange, but not bright red. Alternatively, MnO2 is dark brown, but maybe a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal carbonate. For example, PbCO3 + H2 → Pb + CO2 + H2O. But again, the product is a metal, not red.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me consider another approach: the molecular symmetry of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are symmetry groups. C2 is a 2-fold rotation axis. D4h is a dihedral group with a 4-fold rotation and horizontal mirrors. D∞h is an infinite dihedral group, like in a linear molecule with certain symmetries. C2v has a 2-fold rotation and two vertical mirrors.

E is extremely hazardous, likely a gas. So, perhaps E is a linear molecule. For example, phosgene (O=C=O) is linear and has a symmetry group of D∞h. Alternatively, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But CO2 is not that hazardous, though.

Wait, another possibility: If E is HCN, which is a linear molecule with a triple bond. HCN has a point group of D∞h. But HCN is a gas, but is it considered extremely hazardous? I think it's toxic but maybe not as extremely hazardous as others.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which has a diatomic structure, so its point group is D∞h. But Cl2 is a gas and is toxic, but perhaps not the 'extremely hazardous' as the question states.

Wait, sarin gas is a nerve agent, but its structure is more complex, perhaps with a trigonal symmetry.

Alternatively, another possibility: Maybe E is a molecule with a C2v symmetry. For example, molecules like H2O (bent) have C2v symmetry, but H2O is a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, but E is a product of C and D, which are gases. So E is probably a gas, so a diatomic or linear molecule.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's probably a linear molecule with a center of symmetry. Like O=C=O (phosgene), CO2, HCN, etc.

If E is phosgene, then D would be CO, and C would be something else.

Wait, let me try to put it all together.

Assuming B is H2, D is CO.

Reaction 4: D (CO) + B (H2) → H (CH3OH, a solvent). So, CO + H2 → CH3OH (with appropriate conditions, like a catalyst).

Reaction 1: A +8 H2 → C (bright red). What could A be? Maybe A is a metal oxide that when reduced by H2 gives a red product. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal in a higher oxidation state.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal oxide, and upon reaction with H2, it forms a metal and water. For example, Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. But 4 H2 per Fe3O4 would give 4 equivalents. The question says 8 equivalents, so perhaps 2 Fe3O4 + 8 H2 → 6 Fe + 8 H2O. Then, product C would be Fe, which is not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal in a +5 oxidation state. For example, V2O5 reacts with H2 to form Vanadium metal and water. Vanadium metal is silver, not red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS + H2 → Fe + H2S. But Fe is not red.

Wait, maybe A is a non-metal. If A is sulfur (S), then S + H2 → H2S. But H2S is a gas, not solid.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal carbonate. Na2CO3 + H2 → Na2O + H2O + CO2. But Na2O is a solid, not red.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about E again.

If E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, like CO2 or HCN, then the answer would be D) D∞h. But if E is something else, like a trigonal molecule, maybe with C3v symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a center of inversion and a 2-fold rotation axis, perhaps D∞h is the symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with a center of inversion, so D∞h is correct. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry.

But O2 isn't extremely hazardous in normal concentrations. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent and has a C2v symmetry. That would correspond to option D: C2v.

Wait, SO2 is a gas, and it's toxic, so that could fit. SO2 has a bent structure with a bond angle around 120 degrees. Its point group is C2v because it has a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes.

So if E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, the answer would be D) C2v.

But how does that fit into the rest of the reactions?

Let me try to see:

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (SO2). D is CO. So, C + 2 CO → SO2. What is C?

Wait, maybe C is SO3. Then, SO3 + 2 CO → SO2 + 2 CO2? Not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. Let's say C is Na2SO3. Then, reacting with CO (D) would produce what? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide that upon reaction with CO produces SO2. For example, if C is FeS, then FeS + 2 CO → Fe + SO2 + ... Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfur compound. For example, if C is S, then S + 2 CO → SO2 + 2 C. But that would require specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to reassemble:

From reaction 4: B is H2, D is CO → H is CH3OH (solvent).

Reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What is C?

If C is Fe, which is not red. Maybe C is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal oxide that when reduced with H2 produces a metal that is bright red. For example, if A is PbO2 (which is dark brown), upon reduction, it forms Pb (bright silvery) and water. Not red. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal in a higher oxidation state that upon reduction forms a red oxide. For example, if A is V2O5, which is orange, upon reduction with H2, it forms V metal, which is silver. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal carbonate that when heated with H2 gives a red oxide. For example, heating PbCO3 with H2 might produce PbO, which is yellow, not red.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a metal nitrate. For example, Cu(NO3)2 reacts with H2 to form Cu and HNO3. But Cu is silver, not red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the bright red color comes from a different source, like a ligand or a complex. For example, if C is a coordination compound with a red color. For example, [Fe(SCN)]n complexes are red. But how would that form from A + 8 H2?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but perhaps another chromium compound is red.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me think about the possible symmetry groups again.

If E is SO2, then it's C2v symmetry.

If E is CO2, then it's D∞h.

If E is O2, then D∞h.

If E is HCN, D∞h.

Which of these are extremely hazardous?

SO2 is toxic, but perhaps not extremely so. CO is toxic, but in the reaction, D is CO. Wait, but in reaction 2, C + 2 D → E. So if D is CO, then E would be a product formed from C and CO. If E is SO2, then C might be a sulfite or sulfide.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2S, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts, and it's a gas. But H2S has a bond angle around 93 degrees, which is close to linear, so its point group is D∞h.

Wait, but H2S is a gas, and when it comes from C reacting with D, which is CO (if D is CO). So C + 2 CO → H2S + ...? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a more dangerous gas like HCN. So, C + 2 CO → HCN + ...? Maybe that's possible if C is a cyanide salt.

Wait, let me try to imagine C as KCN. Then, KCN + 2 CO → HCN + K2CO3? But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal cyanide, and D is CO. So, when they react, they produce HCN and the metal carbonate.

For example: FeCN6^4- + CO → FeCO3 + HCN. Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Hmm, but HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, if E is HCN, then the answer is D∞h (option C).

But earlier, I thought E might be SO2 with C2v symmetry. I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

If E is HCN (linear), it's D∞h. If E is CO2 (linear), also D∞h. If E is SO2 (bent), C2v. O2 is diatomic, D∞h.

So, if E is SO2, option D. If E is CO2 or HCN, option C.

Now, to determine which is more likely.

E is produced from C and D, which is CO. So, if D is CO, and E is HCN, then C would have to be a cyanide. But then, how does C form from A and H2?

Alternatively, perhaps E is CO2. Then, C would have to be something that when reacted with CO produces CO2.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. Then, Na2CO3 + 2 CO → 2 Na + 3 CO2. But I don't think that's a standard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is CuO, then CuO + 2 CO → Cu + CO2. That's a standard reaction in the reduction of metals. So, if E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry (option C), that would fit.

Wait, but then reaction 3: C (CuO) + H2O → A + F + G. So, CuO + H2O → Cu + H2O? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think.

If C is CuO, and reaction 3 is CuO + H2O → Cu(OH)2, which decomposes into CuO and H2O again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Let's say C is CuSO4. Then, CuSO4 + H2O → CuSO4·5H2O, which is blue, not matching the bright red.

Hmm, I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to tie everything together.

Assuming that E has D∞h symmetry, which would make it a linear molecule like CO2, O2, HCN, etc.

If E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D) C2v.

But without knowing exactly what E is, it's hard to decide. However, the question gives options. Let's think about the most common extremely hazardous gas with a linear structure.

HCN is a highly toxic gas, and it's linear with D∞h symmetry. So if E is HCN, the answer is C) D∞h.

Alternatively, phosgene (COCl2) is a highly toxic gas, but its structure is planar, not linear. Wait, no, phosgene is O=C=O with two Cl atoms attached. So its structure is O=C(Cl)Cl, which is planar with a center of symmetry, having D∞h symmetry. So if E is phosgene, D∞h.

Wait, but that would require C to be something else.

Another angle: What about sarin gas? Sarin has a more complex structure, perhaps with a trigonal planar or other symmetry. But I'm not sure about its point group.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like CH3Cl, but that's not extremely hazardous. Or maybe something like Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, Cl2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, and it's a toxic gas, but perhaps not the 'extremely hazardous' one the question refers to.

But considering all possibilities, the most likely answer is D∞h, so option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E, which is described as extremely hazardous. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests a specific reaction pathway, and the bright red color of C hints at a compound with distinctive electronic transitions, possibly a coordination complex or a transition metal compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This reaction suggests that E is likely a gas or volatile compound with high toxicity.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates that C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to yield these acids, such as a carbonate, sulfate, or cyanide salt.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that D and B are gases that combine to form a liquid solvent, such as methanol (CH₃OH), which is consistent with D being CO and B being H₂.

### Key Analysis of E:
- E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to highly toxic gases. Potential candidates include phosgene (COCl₂), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), or sulfur dioxide (SO₂).
- The molecular symmetry of E depends on its structure:
  - **Phosgene (COCl₂)**: A planar molecule with D∞h symmetry.
  - **HCN**: A linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.
  - **SO₂**: A bent molecule with C₂v symmetry.
  - **CO₂**: A linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.
- Among these, HCN and phosgene are highly toxic and have D∞h symmetry. SO₂, while toxic, has C₂v symmetry. CO₂ is not extremely hazardous in small amounts but has D∞h symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Given the options provided (C₂, D₄h, D∞h, C₂v), the most likely symmetry group of E is D∞h, consistent with E being a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene. These compounds are highly hazardous and align with the reaction conditions described.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the molecular symmetry of product E. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The first part says that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents is a lot. I remember that sometimes in reactions, the number of equivalents can give a clue about the stoichiometry. Like, maybe A is something that reacts in an 8:1 ratio with B.

Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Okay, so C is reacting further. And when C reacts with water, it reforms A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acid might be something like H2SO4, and weak like CH3COOH, but I'm not sure yet.

D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Hmm, B and D making H, a solvent. So what solvents are made from reactions of gases? Maybe something like H2O, but that's a liquid. Or maybe something like ethanol or something else. Wait, but B and D are gases reacting to make a solvent.

Let me try to think of possible reactions. Maybe A is a metal oxide or something, and B is a halogen or another gas. Let's think about the first reaction: A + 8B → C (bright red). Bright red product—could that be something like silver chloride? No, but silver chloride is white. Wait, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, reacting with something to form a red product. Or perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, copper(II) oxide is black, not red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is sodium oxide. If B is chlorine gas, 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of Cl2. Wait, sodium oxide (Na2O) reacting with Cl2? Let's think: Na2O + Cl2 → NaCl. But that's 1 equivalent, because Na2O has two Na. Wait, if it's 8 equivalents of Cl2, that would be 4 moles of Na2O reacting with 8 moles of Cl2?

Wait, maybe A is something else. Let me think about the product when C reacts with water. It forms A plus two acids, F and G. So, C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives back A and two acids. That suggests that C is perhaps a salt of the conjugate base of F and G. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, then their conjugate bases would be weak and strong, respectively. So, for example, if F is H2SO4 (strong), its conjugate base is SO4^2- (which is a weak base). G, a weak acid, would have a stronger conjugate base, like CH3COO^-.

Wait, but when C reacts with water, it gives A plus F and G. So C is likely a salt: maybe a metal sulfate and another salt. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride, and when it reacts with water, it gives a metal hydroxide and HCl (a strong acid) and another acid.

Wait, but the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So after hydrolysis, you get A, which is solid, and two acids. Maybe C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, if C is NaNO3, but that's just a thought.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate compound. Wait, but then how does it form with A and 8 B? Let me think again about the first reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Could A be a metal, and B be something like O2? No, O2 is a diatomic gas. Wait, maybe B is another gas, like Cl2.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about product E. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. And D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, a solvent.

Let me consider what E could be. Extremely hazardous—maybe something like sarin gas, but that's more of an organophosphate. Or perhaps something like phosgene, but I'm not certain. Or maybe something like hydrogen cyanide, but that's a gas itself.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine, but the reaction with C would have to produce it. Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve agent, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps D is a gas like CO2. Then, when D reacts with B, which is another gas, say, maybe something like NaOH? No, wait, H is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is CO2, then H would be something like HCl, but that's a gas. Not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is Na and D is something else. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D to form E. C is bright red. Let me think about compounds that are bright red. Maybe it's a transition metal complex. For example, CoCl2 is blue, but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe C is AgBr, but that's pale yellow. Wait, maybe it's a nitrate? Not sure.

Wait, if C is a nitrate salt, then reacting with another gas could produce something like NO or NO2, which are poisonous. For example, if C is NaNO3 and D is CO (carbon monoxide), but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide and D is a halogen. Let's say C is FeO and D is Cl2. Then, FeO + Cl2 → FeCl3? But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction C + water → A + F + G. Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze into those. For example, if C is sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, then hydrolysis would give NaOH (a strong base, but F is an acid. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if C is ammonium carbonate, (NH4)2CO3, then hydrolysis gives NH4OH (a weak acid, F) and H2CO3 (which is a weak acid, G). But then F would be NH4OH (which is weak), and G is H2CO3 (also weak). But the question says F is strong and G is weak. So that doesn't fit.

Another thought: Suppose C is a sulfide salt. For example, if C is FeS, then hydrolysis would give Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid, and Fe(OH)2 is a base. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, what if C is a nitride? For instance, Na3N. Hydrolysis would give NaOH and NH3. But again, both are bases. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, if C is Al2(SO4)3, then hydrolysis would give Al(OH)3 and H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid, which would be F, and Al(OH)3 is a weak base, but the problem states that it produces two acids. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. Hydrolysis in water would give Ca(OH)2 and CO2. But CO2 is a weak acid (carb acid), and Ca(OH)2 is a base. But again, we need two acids.

Another angle: Maybe C is a metal nitrate. For instance, if C is Cu(NO3)2, hydrolysis would produce Cu(OH)2 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid, which would be F, and Cu(OH)2 is a base. But again, only one acid product.

Hmm, maybe C is a salt that hydrolyzes into two different acids. That would mean that the anion is a conjugate base of a weak acid, and the cation is a conjugate base of another weak acid. Wait, but that seems unlikely because cations are usually from strong bases.

Wait a second, perhaps the salt C is something like ammonium carbonate, which when dissolved in water, would produce ammonium bicarbonate and water, but that's not two acids. Alternatively, maybe it's something like potassium hydrogen sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid (sulfurous acid), and NaOH is a strong base. But that doesn't help because we need two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. Let's say C is something like sodium dihydrogen phosphate, NaH2PO4. Hydrolysis would produce H3PO4 (a weak acid) and NaOH. But again, only one acid.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the first reaction again. A and B reacting in an 8:1 ratio to form C. Maybe A is an oxide and B is a halogen. For example, if A is FeO, and B is Cl2. The reaction would be FeO + 2 Cl2 → FeCl3 + ClO? No, that doesn't balance. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is Cl2, and they form a chloride. For example, Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. But the stoichiometry would be 1 Fe to 3 Cl2, not 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe A is Na and B is Cl2. The reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. That's 1 equivalent of Cl2 per 2 Na. But the question says 8 equivalents, so perhaps A is something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal oxide with a high valency. For example, if A is PbO2, which is a dark brown solid. But reacting with Cl2, how? PbO2 + Cl2 → PbCl2 + O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is Cl2, and the reaction produces a high chlorination product. For instance, maybe A is magnesium, and B is Cl2, forming MgCl2. But MgCl2 is white, not bright red.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal, and B is Cl2. Let's say A is Fe. Fe reacts with Cl2 in a combustion reaction: Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. But the stoichiometry is 1 Fe : 3 Cl2. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would imply (8/3) moles of Fe. But that doesn't fit neatly.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is O2. Reaction would produce a metal oxide. For example, 4Al + 3O2 → 2Al2O3. So 3 equivalents of O2 for 4 Al. But the question has 8 equivalents, so that's 8 O2 per  something of A. Not sure.

Wait, maybe A is a metal oxide, and B is CO2. For example, if A is Na2O, reacting with CO2: Na2O + CO2 → Na2CO3. But that's 1 equivalent. So 8 equivalents would imply 8 CO2 for 1 Na2O, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe A is a non-metal. For example, S reacting with something. S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But I'm not sure how that ties into the other parts.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like O2. For example, 2A + B → product. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, let's think about the color of product C. Bright red. That's a distinctive color. Maybe it's a nitro compound or something with a strong chromophore. Let me think—could it be something like Fe(SCN)_n^3-n, which is red? But that's a coordination compound. If so, maybe C is a complex like that. Then, when C reacts with D, which is another gas, perhaps it breaks down into something toxic.

Wait, if C is Fe(SCN)_n^3-n, then reacting with Cl2 (if D is Cl2) might lead to a reaction, but I'm not sure what product that would give. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like HCN or another highly toxic gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide with a red color. For example, CuS is black, but perhaps another sulfide. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a transition metal chloride. For example, CoCl2 is blue, but maybe another. Alternatively, perhaps C is AgBr, but that's pale yellow. I'm not getting it.

Let me go back to the reaction of C with water. So, it's C + H2O → A + F + G. So, A is a solid, and F and G are acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is something like acetic acid. But that would require C being a salt containing both sulfate and acetate ions. That seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a metal bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it's already in solution, but perhaps not. Alternatively, if C is sodium carbonate, then hydrolysis gives NaOH and CO2. But both are bases and a weak acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sodium salt of a diprotic acid. For example, Na2HPO4. Hydrolysis would give NaOH and H2PO4^- which can further dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+. But I'm not sure how that fits with two acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about E, which is the product of C reacting with D. E is extremely hazardous. Let me think about what reactions produce very dangerous substances.

One possibility is that E is a nerve agent, but perhaps more likely, E is something like chlorine gas or phosgene (which is highly toxic). If D is COCl2, for example, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvent could be something like ethanol, but that's produced from something else. Alternatively, H could be H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Wait, but D and B are gases. So their reaction produces H as a solvent, which is liquid. For example, if B is H2 and D is CO2, that would make H2O? But 1:1 ratio would be H2 + CO2 → H2O + something else? No, that's not balanced.

Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is NaOH (but NaOH is a solid, not a gas). Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. They react in 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is methanol. Then, what reaction of gases would produce methanol? Maybe CO and H2 reacting in a certain condition. Oh, like in the Fischer-Tropsch process, but that's more for longer hydrocarbons.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diethyl ether, but I'm not sure how that would form from gases.

Wait, maybe B is H2 and D is CO. Then, H could be CH3OH (methanol), a solvent. The reaction would be H2 + CO → CH3OH. But that's a synthesis reaction, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry or the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2O (a gas under certain conditions) and D is something else. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2. Their reaction would produce H2O, but that's not a solvent in the sense of being a product here.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is CH4. They react to form CO and H2O, but again, not helpful.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about E again. If E is a highly toxic gas, what are the possibilities? Chlorine gas is toxic, but I'm not sure how it would be formed from C and D. Another possibility is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. How would that form?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a base, but that's not involving gases. Alternatively, maybe it's formed from carbon dioxide and chlorine in the presence of a catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is hydrogen cyanide (HCN). How would that form? If C is a cyanide salt and D is an acid. But D is a gas, so maybe D is HCl. Then, C (a cyanide salt) reacts with HCl to produce HCN and the corresponding chloride.

For example, C could be NaCN. Then, NaCN + 2 HCl → NaCl + H2O + HCN↑. But in that case, D would be HCl. Then, D (HCl) reacts with B (maybe NaOH, but B is a gas). Wait, B is a gas, so if B is another gas, perhaps Cl2. Then, D is HCl, and B is Cl2.

Wait, D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, if D is HCl and B is Cl2, then H could be something like HClO (but that's a gas), or maybe HCl reacts with Cl2 in some way. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then, H could be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to piece this together. Let me try to find A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

1. A +8 B → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent)

Looking at point 4: D and B are gases, H is a solvent. So, H could be something like ethanol (but that's a liquid, not a gas) or maybe methanol. How can two gases react to form a liquid? For example, if D is CO and B is H2, they can react to form methanol (CH3OH), which is a liquid. So D is CO, B is H2, H is CH3OH.

So, D is CO, B is H2.

Then, in reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What could A be that reacts with H2 in such a way? Well, H2 is a reducing agent. Maybe A is a metal oxide. Let's say A is CuO. Then, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But the stoichiometry here is 1 mole CuO + 1 mole H2 → 1 mole Cu + 1 mole H2O. But the question says 8 equivalents of H2, implying 8 H2 per 1 A. So perhaps A is something else.

Wait, maybe A is Fe3O4. Then, Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. That's 4 H2 per 1 Fe3O4. But the question uses 8 H2, so maybe 2 Fe3O4 + 8 H2 → 6 Fe + 8 H2O. But then, product C would be Fe, which is not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide that reduces to a different oxide which is bright red. For example, if A is PbO2 (which is dark brown), and upon reaction with H2, it reduces to PbO (yellow) or Pb (bright silver). But that doesn't fit the bright red.

Wait, another angle: Maybe A is a metal oxide that upon reaction with H2 forms a metal and water, and the product C is something else. Or perhaps A is a non-metal oxide.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 + H2 → CaO + CO2 + H2O. But I don't think that's a reaction that occurs without high temperatures, and the product wouldn't be bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2 + H2 → Mg + NH3. But again, the product isn't red.

Wait, maybe A is a non-metal. For example, sulfur (S). S + H2 → under certain conditions, forms H2S. But S is a solid, and H2S is a gas. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal, and B is H2. Then, A is oxidized by H2 in some way. But I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal in a higher oxidation state. For example, KMnO4, but that's a strong oxidizing agent and would react with H2 to form MnO2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a combustion reaction. For example, if A is a metal, and B is O2. Then, 8 equivalents of O2 would be involved. But the product would be a metal oxide, not bright red.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS reacts with H2 to form Fe and H2S. But FeS is a solid, H2S is a gas, and the product Fe is a solid, not bright red.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the reactions in a different way.

Looking at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Let's think of two strong and weak acids. For example, if F is H2SO4 and G is CH3COOH. Then, C would be a salt that when hydrolyzed produces both. But that's not a common salt formula. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite carbonate, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, if C is Fe2(SO4)3, then hydrolysis would give Fe(OH)3 and H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid (F), and Fe(OH)3 is a base. But the problem says two acids, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, then hydrolysis gives NaOH (base) and H2CO3 (weak acid). Again, only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a strong base and weak acid. For example, if C is NH4Cl, which when dissolved in water would produce NH4OH (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid). But NH4OH is a weak base, not an acid. Wait, no. NH4Cl in water dissociates into NH4+ and Cl^-; NH4+ reacts with water to produce NH3 and H3O+. So, in that case, F would be H3O+ (from the strong acid HCl), and G would be NH4OH? Not exactly, because NH4OH is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a more complex salt. Suppose C is something like NaHSO4. Then, NaHSO4 is a strong acid (since it's a salt of a strong acid and a weak base). When dissolved in water, it would give Na+ and HSO4^- which can dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-. But that would produce H+ (from HSO4^-), which is a strong acid, and perhaps some other species. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate salt, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a salt that contains both sulfates and another acid's salt. For example, if C is NaHSO4·NaHCO3, but that seems complicated. When it reacts with water, it might give NaOH, H2SO4, and H2CO3. Wait, H2CO3 is a weak acid. So F could be H2SO4 (strong) and G could be H2CO3 (weak). But would such a salt exist? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of salts, but that's unlikely given the way the problem is structured.

Hmm, maybe I should think about E. If E is a highly toxic gas, and D is CO, then E could be carbon monoxide, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Or perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. How would that form?

If D is CO and B is Cl2, then perhaps C reacts with Cl2 to produce COCl2. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, if D is Cl2 and B is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If B is H2 and D is CO, then H is CH3OH (methanol), which is a solvent. So D is CO, B is H2. That seems plausible.

So, D is CO, B is H2.

Then, reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What could A be that reacts with H2 to form a bright red product?

Wait, maybe A is a metal oxide that when reduced with H2 forms a metal and water. For example, Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe + H2O. But Fe is silver, not red. Alternatively, maybe A is a nitride. For example, Si3N4 + H2 → Si + NH3. But Si is a metalloid, not bright red.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal in a +3 oxidation state, and upon reduction, forms a +2 oxidation state, which is red. For example, V2O5 is orange, but not bright red. Alternatively, MnO2 is dark brown, but maybe a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal carbonate. For example, PbCO3 + H2 → Pb + CO2 + H2O. But again, the product is a metal, not red.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me consider another approach: the molecular symmetry of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are symmetry groups. C2 is a 2-fold rotation axis. D4h is a dihedral group with a 4-fold rotation and horizontal mirrors. D∞h is an infinite dihedral group, like in a linear molecule with certain symmetries. C2v has a 2-fold rotation and two vertical mirrors.

E is extremely hazardous, likely a gas. So, perhaps E is a linear molecule. For example, phosgene (O=C=O) is linear and has a symmetry group of D∞h. Alternatively, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But CO2 is not that hazardous, though.

Wait, another possibility: If E is HCN, which is a linear molecule with a triple bond. HCN has a point group of D∞h. But HCN is a gas, but is it considered extremely hazardous? I think it's toxic but maybe not as extremely hazardous as others.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which has a diatomic structure, so its point group is D∞h. But Cl2 is a gas and is toxic, but perhaps not the 'extremely hazardous' as the question states.

Wait, sarin gas is a nerve agent, but its structure is more complex, perhaps with a trigonal symmetry.

Alternatively, another possibility: Maybe E is a molecule with a C2v symmetry. For example, molecules like H2O (bent) have C2v symmetry, but H2O is a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, but E is a product of C and D, which are gases. So E is probably a gas, so a diatomic or linear molecule.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's probably a linear molecule with a center of symmetry. Like O=C=O (phosgene), CO2, HCN, etc.

If E is phosgene, then D would be CO, and C would be something else.

Wait, let me try to put it all together.

Assuming B is H2, D is CO.

Reaction 4: D (CO) + B (H2) → H (CH3OH, a solvent). So, CO + H2 → CH3OH (with appropriate conditions, like a catalyst).

Reaction 1: A +8 H2 → C (bright red). What could A be? Maybe A is a metal oxide that when reduced by H2 gives a red product. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal in a higher oxidation state.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal oxide, and upon reaction with H2, it forms a metal and water. For example, Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. But 4 H2 per Fe3O4 would give 4 equivalents. The question says 8 equivalents, so perhaps 2 Fe3O4 + 8 H2 → 6 Fe + 8 H2O. Then, product C would be Fe, which is not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal in a +5 oxidation state. For example, V2O5 reacts with H2 to form Vanadium metal and water. Vanadium metal is silver, not red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS + H2 → Fe + H2S. But Fe is not red.

Wait, maybe A is a non-metal. If A is sulfur (S), then S + H2 → H2S. But H2S is a gas, not solid.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal carbonate. Na2CO3 + H2 → Na2O + H2O + CO2. But Na2O is a solid, not red.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about E again.

If E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, like CO2 or HCN, then the answer would be D) D∞h. But if E is something else, like a trigonal molecule, maybe with C3v symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a center of inversion and a 2-fold rotation axis, perhaps D∞h is the symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with a center of inversion, so D∞h is correct. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry.

But O2 isn't extremely hazardous in normal concentrations. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent and has a C2v symmetry. That would correspond to option D: C2v.

Wait, SO2 is a gas, and it's toxic, so that could fit. SO2 has a bent structure with a bond angle around 120 degrees. Its point group is C2v because it has a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes.

So if E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, the answer would be D) C2v.

But how does that fit into the rest of the reactions?

Let me try to see:

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (SO2). D is CO. So, C + 2 CO → SO2. What is C?

Wait, maybe C is SO3. Then, SO3 + 2 CO → SO2 + 2 CO2? Not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. Let's say C is Na2SO3. Then, reacting with CO (D) would produce what? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide that upon reaction with CO produces SO2. For example, if C is FeS, then FeS + 2 CO → Fe + SO2 + ... Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfur compound. For example, if C is S, then S + 2 CO → SO2 + 2 C. But that would require specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to reassemble:

From reaction 4: B is H2, D is CO → H is CH3OH (solvent).

Reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What is C?

If C is Fe, which is not red. Maybe C is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal oxide that when reduced with H2 produces a metal that is bright red. For example, if A is PbO2 (which is dark brown), upon reduction, it forms Pb (bright silvery) and water. Not red. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal in a higher oxidation state that upon reduction forms a red oxide. For example, if A is V2O5, which is orange, upon reduction with H2, it forms V metal, which is silver. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal carbonate that when heated with H2 gives a red oxide. For example, heating PbCO3 with H2 might produce PbO, which is yellow, not red.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a metal nitrate. For example, Cu(NO3)2 reacts with H2 to form Cu and HNO3. But Cu is silver, not red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the bright red color comes from a different source, like a ligand or a complex. For example, if C is a coordination compound with a red color. For example, [Fe(SCN)]n complexes are red. But how would that form from A + 8 H2?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but perhaps another chromium compound is red.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me think about the possible symmetry groups again.

If E is SO2, then it's C2v symmetry.

If E is CO2, then it's D∞h.

If E is O2, then D∞h.

If E is HCN, D∞h.

Which of these are extremely hazardous?

SO2 is toxic, but perhaps not extremely so. CO is toxic, but in the reaction, D is CO. Wait, but in reaction 2, C + 2 D → E. So if D is CO, then E would be a product formed from C and CO. If E is SO2, then C might be a sulfite or sulfide.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2S, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts, and it's a gas. But H2S has a bond angle around 93 degrees, which is close to linear, so its point group is D∞h.

Wait, but H2S is a gas, and when it comes from C reacting with D, which is CO (if D is CO). So C + 2 CO → H2S + ...? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a more dangerous gas like HCN. So, C + 2 CO → HCN + ...? Maybe that's possible if C is a cyanide salt.

Wait, let me try to imagine C as KCN. Then, KCN + 2 CO → HCN + K2CO3? But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal cyanide, and D is CO. So, when they react, they produce HCN and the metal carbonate.

For example: FeCN6^4- + CO → FeCO3 + HCN. Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Hmm, but HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, if E is HCN, then the answer is D∞h (option C).

But earlier, I thought E might be SO2 with C2v symmetry. I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

If E is HCN (linear), it's D∞h. If E is CO2 (linear), also D∞h. If E is SO2 (bent), C2v. O2 is diatomic, D∞h.

So, if E is SO2, option D. If E is CO2 or HCN, option C.

Now, to determine which is more likely.

E is produced from C and D, which is CO. So, if D is CO, and E is HCN, then C would have to be a cyanide. But then, how does C form from A and H2?

Alternatively, perhaps E is CO2. Then, C would have to be something that when reacted with CO produces CO2.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. Then, Na2CO3 + 2 CO → 2 Na + 3 CO2. But I don't think that's a standard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is CuO, then CuO + 2 CO → Cu + CO2. That's a standard reaction in the reduction of metals. So, if E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry (option C), that would fit.

Wait, but then reaction 3: C (CuO) + H2O → A + F + G. So, CuO + H2O → Cu + H2O? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think.

If C is CuO, and reaction 3 is CuO + H2O → Cu(OH)2, which decomposes into CuO and H2O again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Let's say C is CuSO4. Then, CuSO4 + H2O → CuSO4·5H2O, which is blue, not matching the bright red.

Hmm, I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to tie everything together.

Assuming that E has D∞h symmetry, which would make it a linear molecule like CO2, O2, HCN, etc.

If E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D) C2v.

But without knowing exactly what E is, it's hard to decide. However, the question gives options. Let's think about the most common extremely hazardous gas with a linear structure.

HCN is a highly toxic gas, and it's linear with D∞h symmetry. So if E is HCN, the answer is C) D∞h.

Alternatively, phosgene (COCl2) is a highly toxic gas, but its structure is planar, not linear. Wait, no, phosgene is O=C=O with two Cl atoms attached. So its structure is O=C(Cl)Cl, which is planar with a center of symmetry, having D∞h symmetry. So if E is phosgene, D∞h.

Wait, but that would require C to be something else.

Another angle: What about sarin gas? Sarin has a more complex structure, perhaps with a trigonal planar or other symmetry. But I'm not sure about its point group.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like CH3Cl, but that's not extremely hazardous. Or maybe something like Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, Cl2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, and it's a toxic gas, but perhaps not the 'extremely hazardous' one the question refers to.

But considering all possibilities, the most likely answer is D∞h, so option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E, which is described as extremely hazardous. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests a specific reaction pathway, and the bright red color of C hints at a compound with distinctive electronic transitions, possibly a coordination complex or a transition metal compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This reaction suggests that E is likely a gas or volatile compound with high toxicity.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates that C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to yield these acids, such as a carbonate, sulfate, or cyanide salt.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that D and B are gases that combine to form a liquid solvent, such as methanol (CH₃OH), which is consistent with D being CO and B being H₂.

### Key Analysis of E:
- E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to highly toxic gases. Potential candidates include phosgene (COCl₂), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), or sulfur dioxide (SO₂).
- The molecular symmetry of E depends on its structure:
  - **Phosgene (COCl₂)**: A planar molecule with D∞h symmetry.
  - **HCN**: A linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.
  - **SO₂**: A bent molecule with C₂v symmetry.
  - **CO₂**: A linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.
- Among these, HCN and phosgene are highly toxic and have D∞h symmetry. SO₂, while toxic, has C₂v symmetry. CO₂ is not extremely hazardous in small amounts but has D∞h symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Given the options provided (C₂, D₄h, D∞h, C₂v), the most likely symmetry group of E is D∞h, consistent with E being a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene. These compounds are highly hazardous and align with the reaction conditions described.
