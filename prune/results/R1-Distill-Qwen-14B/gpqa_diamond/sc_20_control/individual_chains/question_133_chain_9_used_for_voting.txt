Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of calculations. But I'll give it a shot. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think I need to adjust for temperature effects.

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4. But wait, no, wait. I remember that the phosphate ion can have different forms depending on the pH. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it can dissociate into H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So the question is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm, maybe it's referring to HPO4^2- here because that's the form that comes from Na2HPO4.

Wait, let me think again. Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- and the conjugate acid of PO4^3-. So when Na2HPO4 dissolves in water, it dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2-.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, since these are a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), they can form a buffer solution. The buffer will help resist changes in pH, but I need to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Oh wait, no! Orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form. But in solution, especially when we have K and Na salts, the predominant forms would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

H3PO4 is orthophosphoric acid, which can lose three protons to become PO4^3-.

In the solution, we have KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-). So these two would form a buffer solution. The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm... Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Orthophosphate could refer to the HPO4^2- ion, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of all phosphate species? But the question says "orthophosphate ions," which makes me think it's specifically the HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of their molarities and then consider the dissociation.

So first, I need to find the moles of both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Starting with KH2PO4: Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 moles.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g divided by 177.99 g/mol is approximately 0.005608 moles.

So, in the solution, the moles of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) are 0.00734, and the moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4) are 0.005608.

The total volume is 0.2 liters, so the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 ≈ 0.0367 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005608 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02804 M

Now, since these two are a conjugate acid-base pair (H2PO4^- is the acid, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base), they form a buffer. The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, but the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Or perhaps HPO4^2- is the orthophosphate here. Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4. But in this solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So perhaps the question is actually about the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is the form from Na2HPO4. Or maybe it's about the sum of all phosphate species, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is asking about the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- together, but that would make the orthophosphate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the dissociation steps. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates stepwise:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-     (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-   (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-     (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the problem is about orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to H3PO4. But wait, if that's the case, then H3PO4 would be a very small concentration because it's a weak acid, and the other forms are more prevalent. Alternatively, perhaps the term is used here to refer to the HPO4^2- ion, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution.

But in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. Now, these two will react with each other, as per the second dissociation step.

Wait, but since we have a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will stay relatively constant, governed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me try to think again.

Orthophosphate is H3PO4, the free acid. But in the solution, H3PO4 would dissociate into H2PO4^- and H+. So in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but we have added both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- salts. So the solution is a buffer solution between the first and second dissociation steps. So, the pH will be determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4, since H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, the pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x10^-8, log(6.2) is ~0.79, so log(6.2e-8)= 7.21, but wait, wait: wait, log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → 0.79 + (-8) → -7.21 ? No, wait: 6.2e-8 is 6.2 ×10^-8, so the log is log(6.2) + log(10^-8) → 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, what's the pH here? Well, the solution is made from mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH should be around pKa2. So let's compute [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but the problem isn't giving pH, it's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, let me re-examine the question: "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?" I think in this context, orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is the initial concentration from Na2HPO4·2H2O, but considering any dissociation or reaction with H2PO4^-.

Alternatively, perhaps because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to form HPO4^2-, the actual concentration might be affected.

Wait, but considering the buffer solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will adjust according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So let me compute the pH first.

The ratio of [base]/[acid] is moles of HPO4^2- to moles of H2PO4^-.

Moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005608 mol

Moles of H2PO4^- = 0.00734 mol

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.005608 / 0.00734 ≈ 0.764.

Taking the log: log(0.764) ≈ -0.115.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.115) ≈ 7.0926.

Wait, so pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, knowing the pH, perhaps I can find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, in the solution, the concentration of HPO4^2- is already known, but considering any other equilibria. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the initial concentration, but that doesn't make sense because the two salts would dissociate completely, contributing their ions. But the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would cause some of each to convert into the other, but in reality, because it's a buffer, their concentrations don't change much beyond what's provided by the salts.

Wait, but wait, in reality, when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, their concentrations don't change because the solution acts as a buffer. So the initial concentrations from the salts are the concentrations in solution.

Wait, no. Because the salts completely dissociate, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are fixed. So their concentrations are as calculated before.

Wait, but earlier I computed [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.0367 M, and [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02804 M.

But the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-.

So the concentration would be approximately 0.02804 M, but that's 2.804e-2 M, which is nowhere near the options provided, which are all on the order of 1e-7 M.

Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the question.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial steps. Let's re-read the problem.

Wait, the problem is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but it's a weak acid. So in solution, it would mostly dissociate into H2PO4^- and H+. But in this solution, we have added H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- via the salts, so perhaps the actual concentration of H3PO4 is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, the most deprotonated form.

But the options are all around 1e-7 M, which is much lower than the concentrations I calculated earlier. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of free orthophosphate ions, i.e., H3PO4, which is the species that doesn't come from the salts. So in that case, H3PO4 would be present in solution, but since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, perhaps some of them can convert back to H3PO4.

But that seems unlikely because H3PO4 is a weak acid and would tend to donate protons. Alternatively, maybe the solution is actually a buffer where the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are present, and the concentration of H3PO4 is negligible.

Wait, another approach: the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The total phosphate comes from both. So the total concentration of phosphate (including all forms) would be (moles H2PO4^- + moles HPO4^2-) / volume.

Wait, but the question is specifically about orthophosphate ions, which I'm getting confused about.

Wait, perhaps the term 'orthophosphate' here refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the concentrations I calculated are 0.0367 M H2PO4^- and 0.02804 M HPO4^2-.

But the options are all much lower, like 1e-7 M. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the buffer solution but about the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-.

Wait, because HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+.

The third dissociation has a Ka3 of 1.8e-12.

So for the HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- reaction, the concentration of PO4^3- would be governed by Ka3 and the pH.

But wait, to find [PO4^3-], which is the most deprotonated form, I'd need to know [HPO4^2-] and the pH.

We can calculate [PO4^3-] using the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

So rearranging, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But wait, we need to know [H+]. Earlier, I found the pH to be approximately 7.09. So [H+] is 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.26e-8 M.

So let's plug in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02804 M

[H+] = 8.26e-8 M

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.26e-8) 

Let me compute that:

1.8e-12 * 0.02804 ≈ 5.047e-14

Divide by 8.26e-8: 5.047e-14 / 8.26e-8 ≈ 6.11e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.11e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the concentration of orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the solution's pH affects the distribution of phosphate species. Let me think again.

Wait, but the problem is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is the protonated form. But in solution, under these conditions, H3PO4 would be very little because it's a weak acid and the solution is likely on the basic side (since pH ~7).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the term is used differently here.

Wait, let me think again. The problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12).

So, the third dissociation is the one that gives PO4^3-.

So, to find the concentration of PO4^3-, I can use the Ka3 expression.

But [HPO4^2-] in solution is 0.02804 M, as calculated earlier.

But wait, isn't [HPO4^2-] in solution affected by the buffer? Because the buffer consists of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the actual [HPO4^2-] is as we calculated.

But perhaps when we calculate [PO4^3-], we need to consider that HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3-.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know [H+] is 8.26e-8 M.

So let me compute that again:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02804 M

[H+] = 8.26e-8 M

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.26e-8)

= (5.0472e-14) / (8.26e-8)

= approximately 6.098e-7 M.

Which is about 6.10e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. Close enough, considering possible rounding errors.

So, the answer would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me recheck the math.

Compute (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) = 1.8 * 0.02804 = 0.050472 → 0.050472e-12 = 5.0472e-14.

Divide by 8.26e-8: 5.0472e-14 / 8.26e-8 = (5.0472 / 8.26) * 1e-6.

5.0472 /8.26 ≈ 0.6098 → 0.6098e-6 = 6.098e-7 M.

So about 6.10e-7 M, which is 6.10 ×10^-7.

Option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my initial calculation of [H+] was off. Let me recalculate the pH.

The ratio of [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.005608 / 0.00734 = 0.764.

Take the log: log(0.764) = approximately -0.115.

So pH = pKa2 + (-0.115) = 7.2076 -0.115 ≈ 7.0926.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0926) ≈ 8.22e-8 M.

Wait, using a calculator, 10^(-7.0926) is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926) → 1e-7 * 0.835 ≈ 8.35e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, 10^(-7.0926) = 10^( -7 - 0.0926 ) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.0926.

10^-0.0926 = 10^(-0.09) is approximately 0.812, but let me be more precise.

Using logarithm tables or a calculator:

ln(10^0.0926) = 0.0926 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0926 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.2131.

So 10^0.0926 = e^0.2131 ≈ 1.238.

Wait, but 10^(-0.0926) = 1 / 1.238 ≈ 0.807.

So [H+] ≈ 1.0e-7 * 0.807 = 8.07e-8 M.

So [H+] = 8.07e-8 M.

Now, computing [PO4^3-] again:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.07e-8) = (5.0472e-14) / (8.07e-8) = 5.0472e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0472 /8.07) * 1e-6.

5.0472 /8.07 ≈ 0.6258 → 0.6258e-6 = 6.258e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is very close to option A: 6.24e-7 M.

So that must be the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (specifically PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the given buffer system. The solution contains 1.00 g each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, which dissociate to provide H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, respectively. These ions form a buffer solution, and the concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation step of phosphate:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]

The dissociation constant for this step is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the pH of the buffer is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]

The moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are calculated from their respective masses and molar masses:

\[
\text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}, \quad [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.00734}{0.2} \approx 0.0367 \, \text{M}
\]

\[
\text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005608 \, \text{mol}, \quad [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005608}{0.2} \approx 0.02804 \, \text{M}
\]

The ratio \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}]/[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = 0.02804 / 0.0367 \approx 0.764\). Taking the logarithm:

\[
\log(0.764) \approx -0.115
\]

The second dissociation constant of H₃PO₄ is \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so:

\[
\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + (-0.115) \approx 7.095
\]

From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.095} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).

Using the expression for \( K_a3 \):

\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02804)}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0472 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.258 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This value is closest to option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)), considering rounding errors.

**Answer: A**
