Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as in star_2. Oh right, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. 

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh, right! That's the value of the Boltzmann constant k multiplied by temperature T when k*T equals that. Because k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So if k*T is approximately the energy difference, maybe T is around 1 K? But wait, stars are way hotter than that. So perhaps I'm mixing something up.

Wait, the energy levels' excitation depends on temperature via the Boltzmann factor. The probability of a higher energy state is lower if the temperature is lower. So, the excitation level (the number of atoms in a certain energy state) is proportional to (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, g is the statistical weight, but if it's same for both stars, then the ratio of the populations would depend on the exponential term.

In this problem, star_1 has twice as many excited iron atoms as star_2 for the same energy level. So, the ratio N1/N2 is 2. So, 2 = exp( -(E_2 - E_1)/(k T) )? Wait, E is the energy level. Let me think again. Suppose in star_1, the excited level is higher, so E is higher than ground. But wait, no, maybe I should model the ratio of the excited state to the ground state.

Wait, no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, let's say for a specific energy level E, the number in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, N1/N2 = 2. The Boltzmann distribution says N_i / N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Assuming that the ground state is j, and E_i is the excited state, which is higher. So E_i > E_j, so (E_i - E_j) is positive.

So, for both stars, the same E_i and E_j are considered. So, for star_1, N1 = 2 N2. Or wait, wait. No. The question says the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So N1/N2 = 2. Let's model this.

So, N1/N2 = [g_i/g_j] * [exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T2) ) ) ]

Assuming that the ground state is j and the excited state is i, and the same for both stars.

So, N1/N2 = [ (g_i/g_j) / (g_i/g_j) ) ] * exp( (E_i - E_j) (1/(k T2) - 1/(k T1)) )

Wait, no, let me correct that. Because for each star, the ratio is N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), so for star 1, N1_i/N1_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, N2_i/N2_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But the question says N1_i = 2 N2_i. But wait, no, the question says the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So N1_i = 2 N2_i.

Wait, but each star's N_i depends on their own T. So, perhaps the ratio N1_i / N2_i = 2. So,

N1_i / N2_i = ( (g_i/g_j exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )) / (g_i/g_j exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )) ) 

The g_i/g_j terms cancel because they are the same for both stars. So,

N1_i / N2_i = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But wait, wait, the exponents would be:

N1_i/N2_i = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 
= exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract: exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b). So a is -ΔE/(k T1), b is -ΔE/(k T2), so a-b = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ].

So, N1_i/N2_i = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

And we know this equals 2. So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, because ln(2) = ln( N1/N2 ) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's compute [ΔE/(k)].

k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23) / (1.38e-23) = 1 K.

So, substituting, ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, that's (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)/1 K. Wait, but that would make (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2). But that's (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2), so rearranged, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Wait, but that would mean (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2). Hmm, but the options involve expressions involving T1 and T2 in various ways. Let's write that equation:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Wait, let's rearrange that:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

Alternatively,

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

But this seems a bit odd because usually, higher temperatures would lead to more excitation. So if star 1 has more excited atoms, it must be hotter than star 2. So T1 > T2. So, 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1, which makes the left side positive, which matches because ln(2) is positive.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that directly matches this. Let's think about the options again.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = T2/T1

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but our equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). Let's manipulate this equation.

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) --> (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but the left would have to be equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ). So, the equation becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, the options are:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

But let me check the equation again. Because the equation I have is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) → (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) → ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which would match option D.

Wait, but let me confirm. Let me rederive.

We have N1_i/N2_i = 2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking ln:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is k*T where k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k*T, so ΔE/(k) = T.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) = 1 K.

So substituting, we have ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But that equation is:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be written as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T1 - T2 = ln(2) * T1 T2

Wait, wait, no, let me do it correctly.

Let me write 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T1 (1/T2) * T1 T2 - T2 (1/T1) * T1 T2 = ln(2) * T1 T2 

Wait, no, that's not the way. Let me factor it as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Which gives:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, but option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So that's correct.

The other options:

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1 → that would suggest a different relationship.

Option B: (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → that's 1/T1 + 1/T2, which wasn't our case.

Option C: (T1 - T2) over (T1 T2 )^2 → no, our denominator was just T1T2.

So the correct option is D.

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The problem assumes the stellar photospheres are in local thermal equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) are the populations of the excited states in star_1 and star_2, respectively, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are the effective temperatures of the two stars. Since \(N_1/N_2 = 2\), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which matches the value of \(k\) (\(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

To match this with the given options, we rewrite the equation as:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options can be ruled out as follows:

- **Option A**: \(\ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1}\) does not match the derived relationship.
- **Option B**: \(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2}\) incorrectly introduces \(T_1 + T_2\), which is not part of the derived equation.
- **Option C**: \(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2}\) incorrectly includes \((T_1 T_2)^2\) in the denominator, which is not consistent with the derivation.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
