Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm... I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution. Oh wait, and condensed ammonia is a solvent that's good for such deprotonations because it's aprotic and can stabilize the transition states or intermediates.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, I think the 'd' stands for deuterium. So maybe it's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Or is it 1-bromo and 2-d something else? Oh, wait, I think the structure is benzene where position 1 has a bromine and position 2 has a deuterium substituent. So, it's para positions? No, because 1 and 2 are adjacent. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering 1 and 2 would make them meta? No, no, the positions are next to each other, so ortho.

Wait, the structure is bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. So, the benzene ring has Br at one carbon and D (deuterium) at the adjacent carbon.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in NH3 (l). I think this is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's a deprotonation followed by elimination, but wait, in aromatic substitution?

Wait, another possibility: when a benzene ring has a leaving group, like Br, and adjacent groups, under strong base conditions, what happens? I remember that in some cases, especially with activating groups, the base can deprotonate the ring, leading to formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge (like a benzyne intermediate) or perhaps a dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of elimination leading to formation of a triple bond or something else. Wait, but bromobenzene isn't that reactive. Oh, but if there's a neighboring substituent that can be deprotonated, maybe an ortho elimination occurs.

Wait, wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, bromine is at position 1, deuterium at 2. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. Now, when NaNH2 is added, it's a strong base. So it can deprotonate the ring. But which protons?

In the benzene ring, the positions ortho, meta, para to substituents have different acidity. For example, in bromobenzene, the ortho and para positions are activated for electrophilic substitution because the ring is electron-rich there, but wait, bromine is a deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but in this case, the ring already has Br and D. So, the ring has Br in position 1, D in 2. The other positions (3,4,5,6) have H, unless substituted. So, the base will deprotonate the most acidic H. Which would be where?

Deprotonation occurs where the ring is most activated. Since Br is a deactivating group, it directs meta. But in this case, maybe the deuterium is replacing a hydrogen, but since D is a heavier isotope, it's less acidic than H. So, in the ring, the most acidic protons are in positions where the ring is most activated.

Wait, but wait, the ring has Br in position 1, which is an electron-withdrawing group. So, the ring is electron-poor, making the protons less acidic. Wait, no, wait. Electrophilic substitution is harder in deactivated rings, but deprotonation is about the acidity of the protons. Electron-withdrawing groups would decrease acidity because they stabilize the negative charge less. Or wait, no, if the ring is electron-deficient, the conjugate base (with negative charge) would be stabilized by resonance. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the acidity of aromatic protons is influenced by the substituents. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity because they stabilize the negative charge after deprotonation. So, in a ring with EWG, the adjacent (ortho) and para positions have more acidic H.

But in this case, Br is in position 1. The ring is at positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D). So, which H's are acidic?

Wait, the ring has Br at position 1. So, the para position is position 4, and the ortho positions are 2 and 6. Oh, but position 2 already has D, so the ortho H would be at position 6. Hmm. Wait, benzene is a hexagon. Let me number it: 1 is Br, 2 is D, so 3 is next to 2, 4 is across from 1, 5 is next to 4, and 6 is next to 1 and 5.

So, the positions adjacent (ortho) to Br (position 1) are 2 and 6. But position 2 has D, so perhaps the position 6 H is the ortho H next to Br. But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br). So, the H at position 6 is ortho to Br.

So, considering that, the H at position 6 is ortho to Br. Since Br is EWG, the H at 6 is more acidic. So, NaNH2, a strong base, would deprotonate position 6.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: sometimes when you have a substituent that's ortho to another substituent, the ring can undergo elimination. But in this case, the substituent is deuterium. Hmm. Or maybe it's a case of forming a benzynelike structure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. Because Br is at C1 and D is at C2. If the base abstracts a proton from C2, but wait, C2 has D, not H. So that can't happen. Or wait, is the D adjacent to the Br, which is at C1?

Wait, let me think again. The structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the ring is:

Positions:
1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

So, the most acidic H would be in the position ortho to Br. So, position 6 (ortho to Br) has H, which is more acidic because of the EWG effect.

So, NaNH2 will deprotonate this H, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6. But wait, benzene is aromatic, so can it have a negative charge? Oh, wait, in the ring, the deprotonation leads to an arenide ion, which is a resonance-stabilized structure with negative charge at positions 6 and 2 (maybe, but position 2 is D, so perhaps not). Hmm, perhaps the negative charge is delocalized.

Wait, but after deprotonation, the ring has a negative charge, which can lead to elimination. In this scenario, perhaps the Br and D are adjacent, so when the base deprotonates position 6 (ortho to Br), elimination could occur, removing Br and D, and forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but the D is at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br). So, if the base abstracts the H at position 6, which is adjacent to position 1, then positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. Wait, that's not correct, because position 6 is adjacent to position 1, and position 1 is Br.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it out mentally.

Benzene ring: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1: Br.

2: D.

So, moving around the ring: 1 (Br) → 2 (D) → 3 →4 →5 →6 →1.

So, the positions adjacent to Br (1) are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, so the only H that's ortho to Br is position 6.

Wait, but if position 6 is adjacent to Br, and is H, then that's the site of deprotonation.

Deprotonation at position 6 would give a benzene ring with a negative charge at 6, but perhaps the ring would adjust resonance.

Wait, but when the base abstracts the H at position 6, the ring becomes deprotonated there. Then, perhaps the Br in position 1 can leave, as it's adjacent to the negative charge.

Alternatively, maybe the Br is at position 1, and the deprotonation creates a negative charge at position 6, which is adjacent to position 1. So, this could lead to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2 (since positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, but position 2 is D—wait, no, position 2 is D, so maybe elimination would form a bond between C1 and position 6?

Wait, maybe the structure after deprotonation is something like a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6, Br at 1. Then, perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring forms a triple bond between 1 and 6, but that doesn't make sense because 1 and 6 are adjacent, so that would be a triple bond between adjacent positions, which doesn't happen in benzene.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, when the base deprotonates position 6, creating a negative charge, the Br in position 1 leaves as Br⁻, and the ring becomes a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But wait, 1 and 6 are adjacent, so that would mean a triple bond between 1 and 6, which would require four bonds, which isn't possible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I should think about this in another way. Another possibility is that the reaction is a type of elimination, leading to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.

But position 2 is D, so that can't be because D is a substituent. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the D is a deuterium, which can act as a hydrogen in elimination.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is ortho to Br, then the Br can leave, and a triple bond forms between positions 1 and 2. But position 2 is D, so maybe that's possible. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzynelike diradical or a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But benzynes are usually formed by the elimination of two substituents adjacent to each other, each with a leaving group or a good leaving group. But in this case, position 1 has Br and position 2 has D. So, D is not a leaving group. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this as a dehydrohalogenation. So, the base (NaNH2) deprotonates a β hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br and the formation of a triple bond.

But in this case, the Br is at position 1, and the β hydrogen would be at position 2 or 6. Wait, position 2 has D, so it can't be abstracted. So the base would abstract a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to Br (position 1). So, if the base abstracts H from position 6, and Br leaves, then a triple bond would form between positions 1 and 6. But that's adjacent, so the triple bond would be between two adjacent carbons. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. So, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6 would mean a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, which is possible in some cases, like in a triple bond within the ring, leading to a cumulene structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 2. But in this case, position 2 is D, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but an aromatic substitution. Wait, but bromobenzene isn't very reactive towards substitution under these conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a strongly activating group, which Br isn't. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about this differently. NaNH2 in NH3 is often used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in allylic or benzylic positions, leading to elimination. So, perhaps in this case, the H adjacent to Br is abstracted, leading to the loss of H and Br, forming a triple bond between the two carbons.

In the molecule, position 1 has Br and position 6 has H. If the base abstracts H from position 6, then elimination occurs, removing Br and H, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6 (but since it's a ring, that's a six-membered ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6, making it a triple bond adjacent to the other positions. Wait, but benzene can't have a triple bond in the ring, because that would disrupt the aromaticity.

Wait, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But position 2 is D. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of forming a benzynelike intermediate. Benzynes are formed when two substituents (like Br and another leaving group) are on adjacent carbons and are eliminated, forming a triple bond. So, if the molecule had Br at position 1 and another leaving group at position 2, elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 2, creating a benzene ring with a triple bond (a type of yne).

But in this problem, position 2 is deuterium, not Br. So, can D act as a leaving group? I don't think so, because D is a heavy isotope of H and generally doesn't leave easily. So, perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple deprotonation without elimination. If the base deprotonates position 6, forming a benzyne-like ion, but then what happens? The negative charge would be on position 6, and Br is on 1. Since Br is a good leaving group, maybe it leaves, and the ring would form a triple bond. But position 1 is Br, and position 6 is the site of the negative charge.

So, elimination would involve losing Br⁻ and forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But in the benzene ring, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, so that would form a triple bond between two adjacent carbons. But benzene rings don't typically form such structures because it's not aromatic anymore. Wait, but maybe it's a triple bond, making a triple bond structure, perhaps a diradical, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination and instead leads to a substitution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the deuterium is a deuterium substituent, and when the base abstracts H from position 6, the ring becomes deprotonated, and then the Br leaves as Br⁻, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then perhaps form a new substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, but I'm not certain about the structure.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. If the reaction forms a triple bond between 1 and 2, the product would be 1,2-dideutero-benzenyne? Or wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but regardless of the structure, the key is to determine how many distinct products are formed. Let me consider the possible structures.

Another approach: the reaction conditions (NaNH2 in NH3) are often used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in the presence of adjacent substituents. So, perhaps the product is a benzyne intermediate, which can undergo various reactions, but in this case, perhaps it just forms the triple bond.

Wait, but Benzyne is a cyclic diradical, right? So, when two adjacent substituents are eliminated, the ring becomes a triple bond. But in our case, only Br is present as a leaving group. So perhaps we can't form benzyne because only one substituent is leaving.

Wait, no, if H is abstracted from position 6, and Br is eliminated, then the ring would lose two substituents (H and Br), forming a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, so the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But that's a six-membered ring with a triple bond between adjacent carbons. But that would make the ring have five single bonds and one triple bond, which is possible, but I'm not sure if that's a stable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but that would require the elimination of H from position 2, which is deuterium, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but instead forms a substituted benzene. Let me think again.

After deprotonation at position 6, the ring is negatively charged at 6 and has Br at 1. Then, perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring becomes a benzene with a negative charge, but that's not possible in a stable structure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring undergoes a rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to a substitution reaction. But bromobenzene isn't very reactive towards substitution under these conditions without a strong activating group, so that's less likely.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The question is how many organic products are formed.

Wait, another possibility: when the base abstracts a proton, it could lead to the formation of two different products depending on where the proton is abstracted. But in this case, the only acidic H is at position 6, so the base would abstract that, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps there are two possible deprotonation sites because of the structure. No, I don't think so. Because the Br is at 1, and the only H adjacent to Br is at position 6. So, only one site for deprotonation.

Wait, but what about the possibility of forming different products based on resonance or tautomerism? I don't think so in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but as a substitution, but I don't think so.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are 4, 1, 2, 3.

If the reaction forms a single product (only one elimination), then the answer could be B) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms more than one product. For example, if the deprotonation can occur in different positions, leading to different structures.

Wait, but in this molecule, the only H that's acidic enough is at position 6. So, only one site for deprotonation.

Wait, but wait, what about the possibility of the D in position 2 acting as a leaving group? No, because D is a deuterium, which is not a good leaving group. It doesn't leave easily under these conditions.

So, the only possibility is deprotonation at position 6, leading to elimination of Br and forming a triple bond between 1 and 6 (but 1 and 6 are adjacent, so perhaps the product is a triple bond there), making a single product.

But wait, benzene rings can't have triple bonds in the ring because that would disrupt aromaticity. So, perhaps the product is a substituted benzene without a triple bond but with a deuterium and a ring contraction or expansion. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination and instead leads to a substitution, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a simple deprotonation without elimination, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge, but that would be a resonance-stabilized arenide ion, which would then perhaps react further. But in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is aprotic and can stabilize such ions, but without any further reagents, perhaps it just remains as the deprotonated form.

But that would give only one product. So, the number of products is 1, which would make the answer B) 1.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the base can abstract a proton from a different position if there's another acidic H. For example, maybe position 4 (para to Br) has a more acidic H. Wait, Br is at 1; para is position 4. The acidity of H at position 4 would be influenced by the Br in position 1. Since Br is EWG, it would increase the acidity of the H at position 4. So position 4's H is more acidic than other positions.

Wait, so if the base can abstract H from either position 6 (ortho to Br) or position 4 (para to Br), then two possible sites of deprotonation. So, that would lead to two different products.

Wait, but which is more acidic? Ortho and para positions.

In bromobenzene, the H's in the ortho and para positions are more acidic than the meta. So, the H at position 6 (ortho) is more acidic than position 4 (para). So, the base would deprotonate the most acidic H first, which is at position 6. But if the reaction conditions allow for multiple deprotonations, perhaps both positions could be deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts H from both positions 4 and 6, leading to different intermediates and different products.

Wait, but in reality, would the H at position 4 be more acidic than H at position 6? Or is position 6 (ortho) more acidic than para?

Wait, the acidity order in toluene derivatives: the ortho H is more acidic than the para H. Because the resonance effects are stronger in the ortho position. So, in bromobenzene, the H at ortho (position 6) is more acidic than the para (position 4). So, the base would primarily deprotonate position 6.

But if the reaction doesn't proceed to completion, perhaps some of the H at position 4 is deprotonated, leading to a different product. But in a strong base like NaNH2, I think the most acidic H will be abstracted preferentially, leading to a single product.

Wait, but in this case, the ring also has a deuterium at position 2. So, perhaps the presence of D affects the acidity of adjacent H's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product because of the possibility of different structures upon elimination.

Wait, if the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to the elimination of Br and the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6, but the ring could form different structures based on the position of the triple bond. But in a six-membered ring, a triple bond between 1 and 6 would be the same as between 1 and 2, because of the ring's symmetry. Wait, no, because the numbering is different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring with a triple bond between 1 and 2, but in that case, the elimination would require H from position 2, which is D, so that can't happen. So, the only possibility is elimination from position 6, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6. But that's the same as between 1 and 2 in a different numbering, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6, but due to the ring's symmetry, this would be the same as a triple bond between 2 and 3 in another numbering. But in this case, since the substituents are fixed (Br at 1 and D at 2), the product would be a specific structure, leading to only one product.

So, in this case, the reaction would produce only one product, so the answer would be B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the base can abstract a proton from either position 6 or position 4, leading to two different intermediates, each of which could eliminate Br to form different products. So, if two different elimination products are possible, the number of products would be two, making the answer C) 2.

But then, how would that work? Let me think.

If the base abstracts H from position 6 (ortho to Br), elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts H from position 4 (para to Br), then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 4.

Wait, but can that happen? Because position 4 is across from Br, so elimination would require H from position 4, which is para, and Br from position 1. Would that lead to a triple bond between 1 and 4?

Wait, but triple bonds in a benzene ring are usually formed between adjacent carbons, not across the ring. So, a triple bond between 1 and 4 would be three positions apart, which doesn't make sense. So, probably, elimination can only occur between adjacent positions.

So, in that case, the base can abstract only the H at position 6, leading to elimination and forming a triple bond between 1 and 6, which is adjacent. So, only one product.

Wait, but if the reaction can proceed via different pathways, perhaps leading to more than one product. For example, if the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6, but perhaps the ring can re-aromatize in different ways, leading to different products. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract H from position 6, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6, but this could result in two different structures depending on the arrangement of the triple bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when the H is abstracted and Br leaves, the ring can form a triple bond, but the position of the triple bond could lead to different stereoisomers. But in benzene, the ring is symmetric, so a triple bond between 1 and 6 would be the same as between 1 and 2, depending on the numbering.

Wait, perhaps the product is actually benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 2. So, after elimination of Br from position 1 and H from position 2, but position 2 has D, not H. So, that can't happen.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. But I think the correct approach is to consider that the base abstracts the H at position 6 (ortho to Br), leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6. Since this is the only possible elimination, only one product is formed.

So, the number of products is 1, which would make the answer B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that typically deprotonates the most acidic hydrogen in the molecule. The structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d consists of a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. 

In this molecule, the most acidic hydrogen is at position 6 (ortho to the bromine), as bromine is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) that increases the acidity of the ortho and para hydrogens. However, the para hydrogen at position 4 is less acidic than the ortho hydrogen at position 6. Therefore, the base preferentially abstracts the hydrogen at position 6.

After deprotonation, the bromine at position 1 can leave as Br⁻, leading to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This elimination reaction results in a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. Due to the symmetry of the benzene ring, this product is unique and does not lead to multiple distinct products.

Given that the reaction proceeds via a single pathway (deprotonation at position 6 and elimination of bromine), only one organic product is formed.

Answer: B
