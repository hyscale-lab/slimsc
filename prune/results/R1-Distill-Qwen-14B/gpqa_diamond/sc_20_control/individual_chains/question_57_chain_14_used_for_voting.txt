Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the scattering amplitude of electrons. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says that we have phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The electrons are at 50 MeV energy, and we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. We need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, with some numbers in fm.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (exp(iδₗ) sin(δₗ + θ)) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, I think the general form is a sum over l of [ ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) * ( exp(i δₗ) sin(δₗ + θ) ) ].

But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, along the beam direction would mean θ=0°, because the beam is coming in along, say, the z-axis, so θ=0 is the direction of the beam.

So, for θ=0°, sin(δₗ + θ) becomes sin(δₗ). Because when θ is 0, we have sin(δₗ + 0) = sin δₗ. So the terms for each l would be (2l+1)/(2k) * exp(i δₗ) sin δₗ.

Wait, but the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term. The exp(i δₗ) is cos δₗ + i sin δₗ, so multiplying by sin δₗ gives cos δₗ sin δₗ + i sin² δₗ. So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin² δₗ.

So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is (1/(2k)) * sum over l of (2l+1) sin² δₗ, right?

Wait, let me make sure. The amplitude f is given by f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) exp(i δₗ) sin(δₗ + θ) ] for l=0 to L. So when θ=0, sin(δₗ) is the term. Then, f(θ=0) is (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) exp(i δₗ) sin δₗ ].

Expanding exp(i δₗ) as cos δₗ + i sin δₗ, then each term becomes (2l+1) (cos δₗ sin δₗ + i sin² δₗ). So the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) sin² δₗ ].

Wait, but wait. Wait, the general formula I remember is that the total cross-section is 4π |f|², but that's when integrated over all angles, but here we're looking at a specific direction. So for the imaginary part, I think the approach is correct.

So the next step is to calculate the sum over l of (2l+1) sin² δₗ, then multiply by 1/(2k), and then that's the imaginary part of f(0).

But wait, what is k? k is the wave number. The electrons have energy 50 MeV. So we need to compute k. The formula for k in terms of energy is k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Wait, but perhaps more correctly, since E is the kinetic energy, the total energy is E = (p²)/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mE). Then, k = p/ħ.

Wait, but I should be careful with units. Let me see. The energy E is given in MeV, and we need to compute k in appropriate units.

Electron mass m is about 0.511 MeV/c². So E = 50 MeV, much larger than m, but perhaps we can use E ≈ 50 MeV for high-energy approximation, but wait, wait: for non-relativistic speeds, we have E = p²/(2m), but at 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects us to use the relativistic expression for k.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The momentum p in terms of E is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So for E = 50 MeV, mc² is 0.511 MeV, so E is much larger, so p ≈ E/c. So p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Wait, but how do we compute k? Well, k is p/ħ. Let's compute p first.

Wait, let me think in terms of units. Let's convert E to Joules. 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. 50 MeV is 50 million eV, which is 5e7 eV. So 5e7 * 1.6e-19 J = 8e-12 J. Then, using E² = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. But since E is much larger than mc² (~0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV, which is 5.11e5 *1.6e-19 J ≈ 8.18e-14 J), so E² ≈ (pc)^2. So p ≈ E / c.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but perhaps that's complicating.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation for high-energy electrons where the momentum p is approximately E/(c), but perhaps it's better to compute it correctly.

Wait, let's compute p in kg·m/s.

E = 50 MeV = 50 × 1e6 eV = 5e7 eV.

Convert to Joules: 5e7 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV = 8e-12 J.

Electron rest mass energy mc² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 * 1.6e-19 J = approx 8.176e-14 J.

So E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.

Assuming E is 8e-12 J, mc² is 8.176e-14 J. So (pc)^2 ≈ E^2 - (mc^2)^2 ≈ (8e-12)^2 = 6.4e-23 J². (mc²)^2 is (8.176e-14)^2 ≈ 6.68e-27 J², which is negligible compared to 6.4e-23, so p ≈ E/(c).

But perhaps I should do the exact calculation:

p = sqrt( (E^2 c^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / c².

Wait, more accurately, E is the total energy, so E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / c.

Wait, let's compute E^2 and (m c^2)^2 in J^2.

E = 50 MeV = 5e7 eV = 5e7 * 1.6e-19 J = 8e-12 J.

E² = (8e-12)^2 = 6.4e-23 J².

m c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 * 1.6e-19 J = approx 8.176e-14 J.

(m c^2)^2 = (8.176e-14)^2 ≈ 6.685e-27 J².

So (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) = 6.4e-23 - 6.685e-27 ≈ 6.4e-23 J².

So p = sqrt(6.4e-23) / c.

sqrt(6.4e-23) ≈ 8e-12 kg·m/s? Wait, no, because units for p are kg m/s.

Wait, sqrt(6.4e-23 J²) is sqrt(6.4e-23 (kg² m^4/s^2)) ) → 8e-12 kg m/s.

Wait, because J = kg m²/s², so sqrt(J^2) is J, which is kg m²/s². Hmm, but when you take the square root of (E^2 c^2 - m^2 c^4), you get (pc)^2 = E² c² - m² c^4, so p = [sqrt(E² c² - m² c^4)] / c² → no, wait, perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute p in terms of MeV/c.

Because in particle physics, momentum is often expressed as E/c for high-energy particles where E >> mc².

So E = 50 MeV, so p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Thus, p = 50 MeV/c → in units where ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, perhaps. Because ħ is Planck's constant over 2pi, and c is speed of light. So 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

Wait, I remember that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, to find k, which is p/ħ, let me compute it.

k = p / ħ.

But p is in units of MeV/c. Hmm, perhaps I should express everything in terms of ħ c.

Wait, so p = 50 MeV/c → so p c = 50 MeV.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So p = (50 MeV/c) → p c = 50 MeV.

We can write p = (50 MeV) / c.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as p/(ħ). So p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV fm / c.

So:

k = p / ħ = [50 MeV/c] / [ (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ] → the c's cancel, so 50 / 197.33 MeV/(MeV fm) → which gives 50/(197.33) 1/fm → approximately 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, let me do the calculation: 50 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.253. So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's about right? Because for high-energy electrons, the wavelength is small, so k is large (but in this case, k is 0.253 fm⁻¹, which is a small k, which would imply a long wavelength. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me compute k again.

We have p in MeV/c, and ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So k = p / ħ → (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) → the c's cancel, and MeV cancels in numerator and denominator.

So k = 50 / 197.33 (1/fm) ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Yes, that's correct. So k is approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) * sum over l of (2l+1) sin² δₗ.

Wait, but which l's are present? The given phases are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. So l goes from 0 to 4.

So for each l from 0 to 4, we have (2l+1) multiplied by sin² δₗ.

Let me compute each term:

l=0: 2*0+1=1. δ₀=90°. sin(90)=1. So 1 * 1² =1.

l=1: 2*1+1=3. δ₁=67°. sin(67) ≈ 0.9205. So sin² ≈ 0.847. 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2: 2*2+1=5. δ₂=55°. sin(55)≈0.8192. sin²≈0.671. 5 * 0.671≈3.355.

l=3: 2*3+1=7. δ=30°. sin(30)=0.5. sin²=0.25. 7 * 0.25=1.75.

l=4: 2*4+1=9. δ=13°. sin(13)≈0.22495. sin²≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.455.

Now sum all these:

1 + 2.541 = 3.541

+3.355 → 6.896

+1.75 → 8.646

+0.455 → 9.101.

So the sum is approximately 9.101.

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) * 9.101.

We have k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.253) ≈ 1/0.506 ≈ 1.976 fm.

Multiply by 9.101: 1.976 *9.101 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

1.976 * 9 = 17.784

1.976 * 0.101 ≈ 0.199.

So total ≈ 17.784 + 0.199 ≈ 17.983 fm.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about ten times larger than my estimate. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the units in calculating k. Let me go back.

Wait, I have p = 50 MeV/c. And ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c. Then, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) → 50 / 197.33 (1/fm) ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute 50 / 197.33 to more decimal places. 197.33 is approximately 197.33. 50 / 197.33 is about 0.25337.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.25337) ≈ 1/0.50674 ≈ 1.973 fm.

Multiply by the sum (9.101), 1.973 *9.101 ≈ ?

Let me compute that accurately. 1.973 *9 = 17.757, 1.973 *0.101 ≈ 0.199273. Total ≈ 17.757 + 0.199273 ≈ 17.956 fm.

So the imaginary part is approximately 17.956 fm. But none of the options match that. The options are in the hundreds or 87k.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula I used was Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin² δₗ.

But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me double-check the expression for f(θ).

The general expression is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) exp(iδₗ) sin(δₗ + θ) ) ].

Wait, when θ=0, this becomes (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) exp(i δₗ) sin δₗ ].

Expanding exp(i δₗ) as cos δₗ + i sin δₗ, then each term becomes (2l+1) [ cos δₗ sin δₗ + i sin² δₗ ].

So the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) sin² δₗ ].

Wait, but I think I remember that for the scattering amplitude, the imaginary part is (1/(2ik)) times something, but perhaps I'm not remembering correctly.

Wait, another approach: f(θ) can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ sin(δₗ + θ) exp(i δₗ) ].

So for θ=0, f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δₗ exp(i δₗ).

Expanding exp(i δₗ) as cos δₗ + i sin δₗ, f(0) becomes (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ cos δₗ sin δₗ + i sin² δₗ ].

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δₗ.

Ah, so wait, I think I forgot the 1/k factor. Earlier, I had (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum, but perhaps it's just (1/k) multiplied by the sum.

Wait, according to this, yes. So in my earlier calculation, I used (1/(2k)) * sum, but perhaps it's (1/k) * sum.

That would change the result.

So in my earlier calculations, I used 1/(2k) * sum=9.101 → 17.956 fm. But if it's 1/k * sum, then 9.101/(0.253) ≈ 35.99 fm.

Wait, let me compute 9.101 / 0.25337.

9.101 / 0.25337 ≈ about 35.93 fm.

But looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm. Hmm, that's about ten times higher.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me re-calculate k more accurately.

Wait, let's compute p accurately.

E =50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (p c) = sqrt(E² - (m c^2)^2) → so p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c.

Since 50^2 =2500, (0.511)^2 is about 0.261. So p c = sqrt(2500 - 0.261) → sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV.

So p c ≈49.997 MeV ≈50 MeV, so p ≈50 MeV/c.

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) → 50/(197.33) ≈0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So in the formula, Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin² δₗ → sum is 9.101.

Wait, 9.101 / 0.2533 ≈35.93 fm.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option B: 355.351 fm. Oh, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum.

Wait, let me re-calculate the sum.

List of l and their (2l+1) sin^2 δₗ:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)^2 =1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)^2. sin(67 degrees) is about 0.9205. square is 0.847. 3 * 0.847=2.541.

l=2:5 * sin(55)^2. sin(55)= ~0.8192. square is 0.671. 5*0.671=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin(30)^2. sin(30)=0.5. square=0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin(13)^2. sin(13)=~0.22495. square ~0.0506. 9*0.0506=0.4554.

Summing: 1 +2.541=3.541 +3.355=6.896 +1.75=8.646 +0.4554=9.1014.

So the sum is approximately 9.1014.

So, with k≈0.2533 fm⁻¹, 9.1014/0.2533 ≈35.93 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

In that case, 9.1014/(2*0.2533) =9.1014/0.5066≈17.93 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l, but perhaps I forgot a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin delta_l.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because in the expansion, the imaginary part comes from sin² delta_l terms.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for the scattering amplitude.

Wait, according to scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(theta) is given by:

f(theta) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^{L} (2l+1) [ exp(i delta_l) sin( delta_l + theta ) ]

So when theta=0, f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l).

Which can be written as (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l) + i sin^2(delta_l) ]

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l).

Wait, so I think I was correct earlier. So according to that, my calculation was 35.93 fm.

But the options don't show this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute k using the relativistic energy correctly.

p = sqrt( (E^2) - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but E here is given in MeV, but what are the units for p? Let me compute p in units of MeV/c.

Because E is 50 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So p = 50 MeV/c.

Then, k is p/(ħ), but ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) = 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is about the imaginary part being Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l. So if I get 35.93 fm, but none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should include more precise sine values.

Let me re-calculate each term with more precise sine values.

Compute sin²(delta_l) for each l:

l=0: delta=90° → sin(90)=1 → sin²=1.

l=1: delta=67° → sin(67)=0.9205048534526782 → sin²≈0.847322.

So 3 * 0.847322 = 2.541966.

l=2: delta=55° → sin(55)=0.8191520442809371 → sin²≈0.671027.

5 * 0.671027=3.355135.

l=3: delta=30° → sin(30)=0.5 → sin²=0.25.

7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4: delta=13° → sin(13)=0.2249510543538656 → sin²≈0.050612.

9 *0.050612=0.455508.

Adding all:

1 → 1

+2.541966 →3.541966

+3.355135 →6.897101

+1.75 →8.647101

+0.455508 →9.102609.

So sum is approximately 9.102609.

So 9.102609 / 0.2533 ≈35.93 fm.

Hmm, but the closest option is B) 355.351 fm. That's about ten times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for k. Let me re-express everything in terms of natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, but perhaps I should compute k in terms of 1/fm correctly.

Wait, 50 MeV/c divided by ħ c (197.33 MeV fm) → (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) * c → because 1/(MeV/c * MeV fm) = (c)/(MeV^2 fm). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express k in terms of 1 fm.

But perhaps the correct calculation is that k = p/(ħ) → since ħ is in units of J s, and p is in kg m/s.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute k in SI units.

Let me try that.

Electron mass m = 9.109e-31 kg.

Energy E =50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 * 1.6e-19 J =8e-12 J.

So, using E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Compute p c = sqrt( E^2 c^2 - m^2 c^4 ) → but perhaps I should compute p c in J s^-1.

Wait, let me compute E in Joules: 8e-12 J.

m c^2 =0.511 MeV =0.511e6 eV =0.511e6 *1.6e-19 J =8.176e-14 J.

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

So (p c)^2 = (8e-12)^2 - (8.176e-14)^2 ≈ 6.4e-23 - 6.68e-27 → approx 6.4e-23.

So p c = sqrt(6.4e-23) ≈ 8e-12 kg m/s² * s → (since c is in m/s, but perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps p c =8e-12 J → p = (8e-12 J ) / (c^2) → because E = pc → p = E/(c^2) ?

Wait, no, because E = pc → p = E/(c). So p = (8e-12 J) / (3e8 m/s) → 8e-12 /3e8 = 8/(3e20) = 2.666e-20 kg m/s.

Then, ħ is Planck's constant: ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p / ħ = (2.666e-20 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J s) → kg m/s divided by J s → J is kg m²/s², so kg m/s / (kg m²/s² · s) )= kg m/s / (kg m²/s) ) → (m/s) * (s)/(m²) ) → (s m)/(s m²) ) → 1/m.

Wait, but let me compute the numerical value.

2.666e-20 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈2.53e14 m⁻¹.

Wait, because 2.666e-20 / 1.0545e-34 ≈ (2.666 / 1.0545) ) * 1e14 → ~2.53e14 m⁻¹.

But 1/fm is 1e15 m⁻¹, so 2.53e14 m⁻¹ = 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Which brings me back to the earlier calculation.

So k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So the imaginary part is Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum → 9.1026 / 0.253 ≈35.93 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f(theta). Let me think again.

Another source says that the scattering amplitude f(theta) is given by (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l + theta) ].

Wait, if that's the case, then the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin² delta_l.

In that case, the Im f(0) would be (1/(2k)) * sum=9.1026/(2*0.253) ≈9.1026/0.506≈17.93 fm.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the scattering amplitude is f(theta) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin(delta_l + theta) sin(delta_l) ].

Wait, that can't be right, because I remember it's involving exponential terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consult the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, another approach: in the partial wave expansion, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at theta=0 is given by Im f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

Which brings me back to the earlier calculation of ~35.93 fm.

But with the options given, the closest is 355.351 fm, which is option B. That's about ten times larger than my result.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me check the units again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting MeV to Joules.

Wait, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1 MeV is 1.6e-13 J. So 50 MeV is 50 * 1.6e-13 J =8e-12 J. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe the momentum p was calculated incorrectly.

Wait, p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c^2 → No, that's not correct. Let me compute p correctly.

E = total energy = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) → (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 → p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) → p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

So with E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV → approx 50 MeV.

So p = 50 MeV / c.

But when I compute k, it's p / ħ → which, using ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) → 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ → ~0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, my calculation was 35.93 fm, but none of the options are that. So perhaps I forgot something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the scattering amplitude is given as f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l + theta) ].

But perhaps for theta=0, the expression is (1/k) sum (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l).

Which would have the real part as sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l), and the imaginary part as sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l).

So the Im(f) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) → which gives 35.93 fm.

But perhaps the actual formula includes a factor of 2.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l + theta) ].

In that case, the imaginary part would be [1/(2k)] * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

In that case, 9.1026/(2 * 0.2533) ≈17.93 fm.

But that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. The question says ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ_4. So perhaps the sum is only up to l=4, which is what I did.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use only the leading term, but that's unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps the imaginary part is Im f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l).

Wait, let me try that. Sum would be:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.0246.

Sum is 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0246≈13.3821.

Then, Im f= (1/k) * sum →13.3821 / 0.2533 ≈52.83 fm. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the formula uses the real part instead, but that would give a different result.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(theta) = sum (2l+1) [ exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l + theta) ] / (k) → but maybe the correct formula is f(theta) = sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l + theta) ] → which would change the factor.

In that case, the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

Which is what I did earlier, giving 17.93 fm.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 2 somewhere else, or perhaps the units are different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is presented in the lab frame where the target is stationary, and electrons are moving with energy, but I don't think that affects the formula for f(theta).

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between the scattering amplitude and the cross-section, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the amplitude, not the cross-section.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and should instead think about the relation between the scattering amplitude and the optical theorem, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum more accurately with more precise sine values.

Let me compute each term again with more precise sin values.

l=0: delta=90°, sin(90)=1 → 1^2=1. So term 1.

l=1:67 degrees.

sin(67) = sin(60+7) ≈ sin60 cos7 + cos60 sin7 ≈ (0.8660 * 0.99255) + (0.5 * 0.12187) ≈ 0.8607 + 0.0609 ≈0.9216.

So sin^2=0.9216^2≈0.8493.

3 *0.8493=2.5479.

l=2:55 degrees.

sin(55)=0.81915.

sin^2=0.6710.

5 *0.6710=3.355.

l=3:30 degrees.

sin=0.5 → sin^2=0.25 →7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:13 degrees.

sin(13)= approx 0.22495.

sin^2=0.050612.

9 *0.050612=0.4555.

Now, sum:1 +2.5479=3.5479 +3.355=6.9029 +1.75=8.6529 +0.4555=9.1084.

So sum=9.1084.

k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So Im f=9.1084 / 0.2533 ≈35.94 fm.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ħ c, such as 197.33 MeV·fm or 197.33 MeV·m. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k as p/(ħ) → but perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for the wave number.

Wait, another approach: the wave number k is given by k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ, but that's the non-relativistic formula.

Wait, since E is much larger than m c², the non-relativistic formula might not be accurate. Let me compute it correctly.

E = kinetic energy + rest mass energy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for k in relativistic terms is k = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / (ħ c).

Wait, yes, because in natural units where c=1, k = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 ) / ħ.

But how does that translate into units?

Let me compute it in SI units.

E =50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV =8e-12 J.

m c² =0.511 MeV =0.511e6 eV *1.6e-19 J/eV =8.176e-14 J.

So, E^2 = (8e-12)^2 =6.4e-23 J².

m^2 c^4 = (8.176e-14)^2 =6.685e-27 J².

E^2 - m^2 c^4 =6.4e-23 -6.685e-27 ≈6.399e-23 J².

So, sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) = ~8e-12 kg m²/s².

Wait, no, sqrt(J²) is J, which is kg m²/s².

So, sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) = ~8e-12 J.

Then, k = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / (ħ c).

Compute ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → but in J·m, 1 fm=1e-15 m.

Wait, 197.33 MeV fm → convert MeV to J:197.33e6 eV *1.6e-19 J/eV=3.157e-11 J.

Then, 197.33 MeV fm =3.157e-11 J *1e-15 m =3.157e-26 J m.

So, k = (8e-12 J ) / (3.157e-26 J m) ) → 8e-12 /3.157e-26 → approx 2.53e14 m⁻¹.

Which is 2.53e14 m⁻¹ = 0.253 fm⁻¹, as before.

So, same result as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part includes an additional factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

In that case, 9.1084/(2*0.2533) → 9.1084/(0.5066) ≈17.93 fm.

Still not matching any options.

At this point, perhaps I should look for any alternative approach or consider that I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but the given values are in degrees. No, the problem states they're in degrees, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using exact values without approximations, but I think I already did.

Another angle: perhaps the problem expects the answer in different units, such as meters instead of fm, but the options are in fm.

Wait, option B is 355.351 fm. If my calculation is 35.93, perhaps I missed a factor of 10. Where could that factor come from?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me re-calculate p again.

E =50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) →50 MeV/c divided by (197.33 MeV fm/c) → because ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, MeV/c in numerator, and MeV fm/c in denominator.

So, units: (MeV/c) / (MeV fm / c) ) = (MeV/c) * (c/(MeV fm)) ) → c cancels, MeV cancels. → 1/fm.

So, 50/(197.33) =0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, which is the non-relativistic formula. Let's compute that and see.

E is kinetic energy, so for non-relativistic, E = p²/(2m) → p = sqrt(2mE).

But in this case, E is 50 MeV, much larger than m c², so non-relativistic might not apply, but let's try.

Compute m=9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV=8e-12 J.

p = sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg *8e-12 J) → sqrt(1.457e-41) = ~1.207e-20 kg m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ = (1.207e-20) / (1.05457e-34) ≈1.145e14 m⁻¹ → which is 0.1145 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but earlier calculation with relativistic approach gave k=0.2533 fm⁻¹. So using non-relativistic gives a lower k, which would lead to a higher Im f(0).

Wait, with non-relativistic k=0.1145 fm⁻¹, sum=9.1084.

Im f=9.1084 / 0.1145 ≈79.55 fm. Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

At this point, maybe I should consider that perhaps the correct answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times my calculation. Perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the sum.

But where could that factor come from? I don't see any mistake in the sum calculation.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts were provided in degrees, but were they supposed to be in radians? No, the problem says degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula requires the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l) instead of sin^2(delta_l). Let me try that.

Sum would be:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.0246.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0246≈13.3821.

Im f =13.3821/(0.2533) ≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2. But why?

If I multiply by 2, 52.83 *2=105.66 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 4, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * 2.

But I don't see any reason for that.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l).

Which would give 13.3821/(2*0.2533) →13.3821/0.5066≈26.42 fm.

Still not matching.

Given that I'm not making progress, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option B, 355.351 fm. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the value of ħ c is different. Let me check: ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm. Correct.

Another idea: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the problem states degrees, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different unit, like a.u. (atomic units), but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * (something else). Alternatively, perhaps it's (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l + theta).

Wait, for theta=0, f= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l).

Expanding exp(i delta_l) as cos(d) + i sin(d), then f= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos(d) sin(d) + i sin^2(d) ].

The imaginary part of f is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2(d).

Wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is B) 355.351 fm.

But I can't reconcile my calculation with any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each term again with exact values.

Compute each term:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1 → 1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67) → sin(67)=0.9205048534526782 → sin²=0.847322 → 3*0.847322=2.541966.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55) → sin(55)=0.8191520442809371 → sin²=0.671027 →5 *0.671027=3.355135.

l=3:7 * sin²(30)=7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13) → sin(13)=0.2249510543538656 → sin²=0.050612 →9*0.050612=0.455508.

Sum: 1 + 2.541966 =3.541966 +3.355135=6.897101 +1.75=8.647101 +0.455508=9.102609.

So sum is 9.102609.

k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Im f(0)=9.102609/0.2533=35.93 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the phase shifts are given for l=0 to l=4, but the sum includes only l=0 to l=4, which I did.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l), which would give 9.102609/(2*0.2533)=17.93 fm.

Still not matching any options.

At this point, I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and can't resolve the discrepancy. Perhaps I should select the closest option, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the formula.

Wait, I think I'll go with the calculation I did, which is approximately 35.93 fm. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm. But I don't see how that would come about.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the sum of all (2l+1) sin(delta_l) as the numerator, which would give sum=13.3821, and then 13.3821/0.2533=52.83 fm, which is still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula requires a factor of 2 multiplied by the sum, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * (1 + cos(theta)), but at theta=0, cos(0)=1, so it would be 2 sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) → which would give 2*13.3821=26.7642, then 26.7642/0.2533=105.6 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times my result. But I can't see where I missed the factor of 10.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{L} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l),
\]

where \(k\) is the wave number, and \(\delta_l\) are the phase shifts. The imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is given by the same expression.

### Step 1: Compute \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the momentum \(p\) by \(k = p / \hbar\). For high-energy electrons, the momentum \(p\) can be approximated as:

\[
p \approx \frac{E}{c},
\]

where \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\) is the energy of the electrons, and \(c\) is the speed of light. Using the relation \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), we find:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{\frac{50 \, \text{MeV}}{c}}{\frac{197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}}{c}} = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \(\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l)\)
The given phase shifts are \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). For each \(l\), we calculate \((2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l)\):

- \(l = 0\): \((2(0)+1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\),
- \(l = 1\): \((2(1)+1) \sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.847 = 2.541\),
- \(l = 2\): \((2(2)+1) \sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.671 = 3.355\),
- \(l = 3\): \((2(3)+1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\),
- \(l = 4\): \((2(4)+1) \sin^2(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.455\).

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.455 = 9.101.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the imaginary part of \(f(0)\)
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l),
\]

we substitute \(k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}\) and \(\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l) \approx 9.101\):

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{9.101}{0.253} \approx 35.93 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \(35.93 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is \(355.351 \, \text{fm}\) (Option B), which is approximately 10 times larger than the computed result. Despite extensive checks, the discrepancy remains unexplained. Given the available options, the most plausible answer is:

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the scattering amplitude of electrons. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says that we have phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The electrons are at 50 MeV energy, and we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. We need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, with some numbers in fm.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (exp(iδₗ) sin(δₗ + θ)) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, I think the general form is a sum over l of [ ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) * ( exp(i δₗ) sin(δₗ + θ) ) ].

But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, along the beam direction would mean θ=0°, because the beam is coming in along, say, the z-axis, so θ=0 is the direction of the beam.

So, for θ=0°, sin(δₗ + θ) becomes sin(δₗ). Because when θ is 0, we have sin(δₗ + 0) = sin δₗ. So the terms for each l would be (2l+1)/(2k) * exp(i δₗ) sin δₗ.

Wait, but the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term. The exp(i δₗ) is cos δₗ + i sin δₗ, so multiplying by sin δₗ gives cos δₗ sin δₗ + i sin² δₗ. So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin² δₗ.

So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is (1/(2k)) * sum over l of (2l+1) sin² δₗ, right?

Wait, let me make sure. The amplitude f is given by f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) exp(i δₗ) sin(δₗ + θ) ] for l=0 to L. So when θ=0, sin(δₗ) is the term. Then, f(θ=0) is (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) exp(i δₗ) sin δₗ ].

Expanding exp(i δₗ) as cos δₗ + i sin δₗ, then each term becomes (2l+1) (cos δₗ sin δₗ + i sin² δₗ). So the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) sin² δₗ ].

Wait, but wait. Wait, the general formula I remember is that the total cross-section is 4π |f|², but that's when integrated over all angles, but here we're looking at a specific direction. So for the imaginary part, I think the approach is correct.

So the next step is to calculate the sum over l of (2l+1) sin² δₗ, then multiply by 1/(2k), and then that's the imaginary part of f(0).

But wait, what is k? k is the wave number. The electrons have energy 50 MeV. So we need to compute k. The formula for k in terms of energy is k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Wait, but perhaps more correctly, since E is the kinetic energy, the total energy is E = (p²)/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mE). Then, k = p/ħ.

Wait, but I should be careful with units. Let me see. The energy E is given in MeV, and we need to compute k in appropriate units.

Electron mass m is about 0.511 MeV/c². So E = 50 MeV, much larger than m, but perhaps we can use E ≈ 50 MeV for high-energy approximation, but wait, wait: for non-relativistic speeds, we have E = p²/(2m), but at 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects us to use the relativistic expression for k.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The momentum p in terms of E is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So for E = 50 MeV, mc² is 0.511 MeV, so E is much larger, so p ≈ E/c. So p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Wait, but how do we compute k? Well, k is p/ħ. Let's compute p first.

Wait, let me think in terms of units. Let's convert E to Joules. 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. 50 MeV is 50 million eV, which is 5e7 eV. So 5e7 * 1.6e-19 J = 8e-12 J. Then, using E² = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. But since E is much larger than mc² (~0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV, which is 5.11e5 *1.6e-19 J ≈ 8.18e-14 J), so E² ≈ (pc)^2. So p ≈ E / c.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but perhaps that's complicating.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation for high-energy electrons where the momentum p is approximately E/(c), but perhaps it's better to compute it correctly.

Wait, let's compute p in kg·m/s.

E = 50 MeV = 50 × 1e6 eV = 5e7 eV.

Convert to Joules: 5e7 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV = 8e-12 J.

Electron rest mass energy mc² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 * 1.6e-19 J = approx 8.176e-14 J.

So E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.

Assuming E is 8e-12 J, mc² is 8.176e-14 J. So (pc)^2 ≈ E^2 - (mc^2)^2 ≈ (8e-12)^2 = 6.4e-23 J². (mc²)^2 is (8.176e-14)^2 ≈ 6.68e-27 J², which is negligible compared to 6.4e-23, so p ≈ E/(c).

But perhaps I should do the exact calculation:

p = sqrt( (E^2 c^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / c².

Wait, more accurately, E is the total energy, so E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / c.

Wait, let's compute E^2 and (m c^2)^2 in J^2.

E = 50 MeV = 5e7 eV = 5e7 * 1.6e-19 J = 8e-12 J.

E² = (8e-12)^2 = 6.4e-23 J².

m c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 * 1.6e-19 J = approx 8.176e-14 J.

(m c^2)^2 = (8.176e-14)^2 ≈ 6.685e-27 J².

So (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) = 6.4e-23 - 6.685e-27 ≈ 6.4e-23 J².

So p = sqrt(6.4e-23) / c.

sqrt(6.4e-23) ≈ 8e-12 kg·m/s? Wait, no, because units for p are kg m/s.

Wait, sqrt(6.4e-23 J²) is sqrt(6.4e-23 (kg² m^4/s^2)) ) → 8e-12 kg m/s.

Wait, because J = kg m²/s², so sqrt(J^2) is J, which is kg m²/s². Hmm, but when you take the square root of (E^2 c^2 - m^2 c^4), you get (pc)^2 = E² c² - m² c^4, so p = [sqrt(E² c² - m² c^4)] / c² → no, wait, perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute p in terms of MeV/c.

Because in particle physics, momentum is often expressed as E/c for high-energy particles where E >> mc².

So E = 50 MeV, so p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Thus, p = 50 MeV/c → in units where ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, perhaps. Because ħ is Planck's constant over 2pi, and c is speed of light. So 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

Wait, I remember that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, to find k, which is p/ħ, let me compute it.

k = p / ħ.

But p is in units of MeV/c. Hmm, perhaps I should express everything in terms of ħ c.

Wait, so p = 50 MeV/c → so p c = 50 MeV.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So p = (50 MeV/c) → p c = 50 MeV.

We can write p = (50 MeV) / c.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as p/(ħ). So p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV fm / c.

So:

k = p / ħ = [50 MeV/c] / [ (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ] → the c's cancel, so 50 / 197.33 MeV/(MeV fm) → which gives 50/(197.33) 1/fm → approximately 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, let me do the calculation: 50 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.253. So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's about right? Because for high-energy electrons, the wavelength is small, so k is large (but in this case, k is 0.253 fm⁻¹, which is a small k, which would imply a long wavelength. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me compute k again.

We have p in MeV/c, and ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So k = p / ħ → (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) → the c's cancel, and MeV cancels in numerator and denominator.

So k = 50 / 197.33 (1/fm) ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Yes, that's correct. So k is approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) * sum over l of (2l+1) sin² δₗ.

Wait, but which l's are present? The given phases are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. So l goes from 0 to 4.

So for each l from 0 to 4, we have (2l+1) multiplied by sin² δₗ.

Let me compute each term:

l=0: 2*0+1=1. δ₀=90°. sin(90)=1. So 1 * 1² =1.

l=1: 2*1+1=3. δ₁=67°. sin(67) ≈ 0.9205. So sin² ≈ 0.847. 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2: 2*2+1=5. δ₂=55°. sin(55)≈0.8192. sin²≈0.671. 5 * 0.671≈3.355.

l=3: 2*3+1=7. δ=30°. sin(30)=0.5. sin²=0.25. 7 * 0.25=1.75.

l=4: 2*4+1=9. δ=13°. sin(13)≈0.22495. sin²≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.455.

Now sum all these:

1 + 2.541 = 3.541

+3.355 → 6.896

+1.75 → 8.646

+0.455 → 9.101.

So the sum is approximately 9.101.

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) * 9.101.

We have k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.253) ≈ 1/0.506 ≈ 1.976 fm.

Multiply by 9.101: 1.976 *9.101 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

1.976 * 9 = 17.784

1.976 * 0.101 ≈ 0.199.

So total ≈ 17.784 + 0.199 ≈ 17.983 fm.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about ten times larger than my estimate. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the units in calculating k. Let me go back.

Wait, I have p = 50 MeV/c. And ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c. Then, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) → 50 / 197.33 (1/fm) ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute 50 / 197.33 to more decimal places. 197.33 is approximately 197.33. 50 / 197.33 is about 0.25337.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.25337) ≈ 1/0.50674 ≈ 1.973 fm.

Multiply by the sum (9.101), 1.973 *9.101 ≈ ?

Let me compute that accurately. 1.973 *9 = 17.757, 1.973 *0.101 ≈ 0.199273. Total ≈ 17.757 + 0.199273 ≈ 17.956 fm.

So the imaginary part is approximately 17.956 fm. But none of the options match that. The options are in the hundreds or 87k.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula I used was Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin² δₗ.

But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me double-check the expression for f(θ).

The general expression is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) exp(iδₗ) sin(δₗ + θ) ) ].

Wait, when θ=0, this becomes (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) exp(i δₗ) sin δₗ ].

Expanding exp(i δₗ) as cos δₗ + i sin δₗ, then each term becomes (2l+1) [ cos δₗ sin δₗ + i sin² δₗ ].

So the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) sin² δₗ ].

Wait, but I think I remember that for the scattering amplitude, the imaginary part is (1/(2ik)) times something, but perhaps I'm not remembering correctly.

Wait, another approach: f(θ) can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ sin(δₗ + θ) exp(i δₗ) ].

So for θ=0, f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δₗ exp(i δₗ).

Expanding exp(i δₗ) as cos δₗ + i sin δₗ, f(0) becomes (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ cos δₗ sin δₗ + i sin² δₗ ].

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δₗ.

Ah, so wait, I think I forgot the 1/k factor. Earlier, I had (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum, but perhaps it's just (1/k) multiplied by the sum.

Wait, according to this, yes. So in my earlier calculation, I used (1/(2k)) * sum, but perhaps it's (1/k) * sum.

That would change the result.

So in my earlier calculations, I used 1/(2k) * sum=9.101 → 17.956 fm. But if it's 1/k * sum, then 9.101/(0.253) ≈ 35.99 fm.

Wait, let me compute 9.101 / 0.25337.

9.101 / 0.25337 ≈ about 35.93 fm.

But looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm. Hmm, that's about ten times higher.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me re-calculate k more accurately.

Wait, let's compute p accurately.

E =50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (p c) = sqrt(E² - (m c^2)^2) → so p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c.

Since 50^2 =2500, (0.511)^2 is about 0.261. So p c = sqrt(2500 - 0.261) → sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV.

So p c ≈49.997 MeV ≈50 MeV, so p ≈50 MeV/c.

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) → 50/(197.33) ≈0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So in the formula, Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin² δₗ → sum is 9.101.

Wait, 9.101 / 0.2533 ≈35.93 fm.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option B: 355.351 fm. Oh, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum.

Wait, let me re-calculate the sum.

List of l and their (2l+1) sin^2 δₗ:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)^2 =1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)^2. sin(67 degrees) is about 0.9205. square is 0.847. 3 * 0.847=2.541.

l=2:5 * sin(55)^2. sin(55)= ~0.8192. square is 0.671. 5*0.671=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin(30)^2. sin(30)=0.5. square=0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin(13)^2. sin(13)=~0.22495. square ~0.0506. 9*0.0506=0.4554.

Summing: 1 +2.541=3.541 +3.355=6.896 +1.75=8.646 +0.4554=9.1014.

So the sum is approximately 9.1014.

So, with k≈0.2533 fm⁻¹, 9.1014/0.2533 ≈35.93 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

In that case, 9.1014/(2*0.2533) =9.1014/0.5066≈17.93 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l, but perhaps I forgot a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin delta_l.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because in the expansion, the imaginary part comes from sin² delta_l terms.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for the scattering amplitude.

Wait, according to scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(theta) is given by:

f(theta) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^{L} (2l+1) [ exp(i delta_l) sin( delta_l + theta ) ]

So when theta=0, f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l).

Which can be written as (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l) + i sin^2(delta_l) ]

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l).

Wait, so I think I was correct earlier. So according to that, my calculation was 35.93 fm.

But the options don't show this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute k using the relativistic energy correctly.

p = sqrt( (E^2) - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but E here is given in MeV, but what are the units for p? Let me compute p in units of MeV/c.

Because E is 50 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So p = 50 MeV/c.

Then, k is p/(ħ), but ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) = 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is about the imaginary part being Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l. So if I get 35.93 fm, but none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should include more precise sine values.

Let me re-calculate each term with more precise sine values.

Compute sin²(delta_l) for each l:

l=0: delta=90° → sin(90)=1 → sin²=1.

l=1: delta=67° → sin(67)=0.9205048534526782 → sin²≈0.847322.

So 3 * 0.847322 = 2.541966.

l=2: delta=55° → sin(55)=0.8191520442809371 → sin²≈0.671027.

5 * 0.671027=3.355135.

l=3: delta=30° → sin(30)=0.5 → sin²=0.25.

7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4: delta=13° → sin(13)=0.2249510543538656 → sin²≈0.050612.

9 *0.050612=0.455508.

Adding all:

1 → 1

+2.541966 →3.541966

+3.355135 →6.897101

+1.75 →8.647101

+0.455508 →9.102609.

So sum is approximately 9.102609.

So 9.102609 / 0.2533 ≈35.93 fm.

Hmm, but the closest option is B) 355.351 fm. That's about ten times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for k. Let me re-express everything in terms of natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, but perhaps I should compute k in terms of 1/fm correctly.

Wait, 50 MeV/c divided by ħ c (197.33 MeV fm) → (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) * c → because 1/(MeV/c * MeV fm) = (c)/(MeV^2 fm). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express k in terms of 1 fm.

But perhaps the correct calculation is that k = p/(ħ) → since ħ is in units of J s, and p is in kg m/s.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute k in SI units.

Let me try that.

Electron mass m = 9.109e-31 kg.

Energy E =50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 * 1.6e-19 J =8e-12 J.

So, using E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Compute p c = sqrt( E^2 c^2 - m^2 c^4 ) → but perhaps I should compute p c in J s^-1.

Wait, let me compute E in Joules: 8e-12 J.

m c^2 =0.511 MeV =0.511e6 eV =0.511e6 *1.6e-19 J =8.176e-14 J.

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

So (p c)^2 = (8e-12)^2 - (8.176e-14)^2 ≈ 6.4e-23 - 6.68e-27 → approx 6.4e-23.

So p c = sqrt(6.4e-23) ≈ 8e-12 kg m/s² * s → (since c is in m/s, but perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps p c =8e-12 J → p = (8e-12 J ) / (c^2) → because E = pc → p = E/(c^2) ?

Wait, no, because E = pc → p = E/(c). So p = (8e-12 J) / (3e8 m/s) → 8e-12 /3e8 = 8/(3e20) = 2.666e-20 kg m/s.

Then, ħ is Planck's constant: ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p / ħ = (2.666e-20 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J s) → kg m/s divided by J s → J is kg m²/s², so kg m/s / (kg m²/s² · s) )= kg m/s / (kg m²/s) ) → (m/s) * (s)/(m²) ) → (s m)/(s m²) ) → 1/m.

Wait, but let me compute the numerical value.

2.666e-20 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈2.53e14 m⁻¹.

Wait, because 2.666e-20 / 1.0545e-34 ≈ (2.666 / 1.0545) ) * 1e14 → ~2.53e14 m⁻¹.

But 1/fm is 1e15 m⁻¹, so 2.53e14 m⁻¹ = 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Which brings me back to the earlier calculation.

So k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So the imaginary part is Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum → 9.1026 / 0.253 ≈35.93 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f(theta). Let me think again.

Another source says that the scattering amplitude f(theta) is given by (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l + theta) ].

Wait, if that's the case, then the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin² delta_l.

In that case, the Im f(0) would be (1/(2k)) * sum=9.1026/(2*0.253) ≈9.1026/0.506≈17.93 fm.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the scattering amplitude is f(theta) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin(delta_l + theta) sin(delta_l) ].

Wait, that can't be right, because I remember it's involving exponential terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consult the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, another approach: in the partial wave expansion, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at theta=0 is given by Im f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

Which brings me back to the earlier calculation of ~35.93 fm.

But with the options given, the closest is 355.351 fm, which is option B. That's about ten times larger than my result.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me check the units again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting MeV to Joules.

Wait, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1 MeV is 1.6e-13 J. So 50 MeV is 50 * 1.6e-13 J =8e-12 J. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe the momentum p was calculated incorrectly.

Wait, p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c^2 → No, that's not correct. Let me compute p correctly.

E = total energy = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) → (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 → p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) → p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

So with E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV → approx 50 MeV.

So p = 50 MeV / c.

But when I compute k, it's p / ħ → which, using ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) → 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ → ~0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, my calculation was 35.93 fm, but none of the options are that. So perhaps I forgot something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the scattering amplitude is given as f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l + theta) ].

But perhaps for theta=0, the expression is (1/k) sum (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l).

Which would have the real part as sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l), and the imaginary part as sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l).

So the Im(f) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) → which gives 35.93 fm.

But perhaps the actual formula includes a factor of 2.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l + theta) ].

In that case, the imaginary part would be [1/(2k)] * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

In that case, 9.1026/(2 * 0.2533) ≈17.93 fm.

But that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. The question says ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ_4. So perhaps the sum is only up to l=4, which is what I did.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use only the leading term, but that's unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps the imaginary part is Im f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l).

Wait, let me try that. Sum would be:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.0246.

Sum is 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0246≈13.3821.

Then, Im f= (1/k) * sum →13.3821 / 0.2533 ≈52.83 fm. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the formula uses the real part instead, but that would give a different result.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(theta) = sum (2l+1) [ exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l + theta) ] / (k) → but maybe the correct formula is f(theta) = sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l + theta) ] → which would change the factor.

In that case, the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

Which is what I did earlier, giving 17.93 fm.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 2 somewhere else, or perhaps the units are different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is presented in the lab frame where the target is stationary, and electrons are moving with energy, but I don't think that affects the formula for f(theta).

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between the scattering amplitude and the cross-section, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the amplitude, not the cross-section.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and should instead think about the relation between the scattering amplitude and the optical theorem, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum more accurately with more precise sine values.

Let me compute each term again with more precise sin values.

l=0: delta=90°, sin(90)=1 → 1^2=1. So term 1.

l=1:67 degrees.

sin(67) = sin(60+7) ≈ sin60 cos7 + cos60 sin7 ≈ (0.8660 * 0.99255) + (0.5 * 0.12187) ≈ 0.8607 + 0.0609 ≈0.9216.

So sin^2=0.9216^2≈0.8493.

3 *0.8493=2.5479.

l=2:55 degrees.

sin(55)=0.81915.

sin^2=0.6710.

5 *0.6710=3.355.

l=3:30 degrees.

sin=0.5 → sin^2=0.25 →7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:13 degrees.

sin(13)= approx 0.22495.

sin^2=0.050612.

9 *0.050612=0.4555.

Now, sum:1 +2.5479=3.5479 +3.355=6.9029 +1.75=8.6529 +0.4555=9.1084.

So sum=9.1084.

k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So Im f=9.1084 / 0.2533 ≈35.94 fm.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ħ c, such as 197.33 MeV·fm or 197.33 MeV·m. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k as p/(ħ) → but perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for the wave number.

Wait, another approach: the wave number k is given by k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ, but that's the non-relativistic formula.

Wait, since E is much larger than m c², the non-relativistic formula might not be accurate. Let me compute it correctly.

E = kinetic energy + rest mass energy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for k in relativistic terms is k = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / (ħ c).

Wait, yes, because in natural units where c=1, k = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 ) / ħ.

But how does that translate into units?

Let me compute it in SI units.

E =50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV =8e-12 J.

m c² =0.511 MeV =0.511e6 eV *1.6e-19 J/eV =8.176e-14 J.

So, E^2 = (8e-12)^2 =6.4e-23 J².

m^2 c^4 = (8.176e-14)^2 =6.685e-27 J².

E^2 - m^2 c^4 =6.4e-23 -6.685e-27 ≈6.399e-23 J².

So, sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) = ~8e-12 kg m²/s².

Wait, no, sqrt(J²) is J, which is kg m²/s².

So, sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) = ~8e-12 J.

Then, k = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / (ħ c).

Compute ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → but in J·m, 1 fm=1e-15 m.

Wait, 197.33 MeV fm → convert MeV to J:197.33e6 eV *1.6e-19 J/eV=3.157e-11 J.

Then, 197.33 MeV fm =3.157e-11 J *1e-15 m =3.157e-26 J m.

So, k = (8e-12 J ) / (3.157e-26 J m) ) → 8e-12 /3.157e-26 → approx 2.53e14 m⁻¹.

Which is 2.53e14 m⁻¹ = 0.253 fm⁻¹, as before.

So, same result as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part includes an additional factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

In that case, 9.1084/(2*0.2533) → 9.1084/(0.5066) ≈17.93 fm.

Still not matching any options.

At this point, perhaps I should look for any alternative approach or consider that I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but the given values are in degrees. No, the problem states they're in degrees, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using exact values without approximations, but I think I already did.

Another angle: perhaps the problem expects the answer in different units, such as meters instead of fm, but the options are in fm.

Wait, option B is 355.351 fm. If my calculation is 35.93, perhaps I missed a factor of 10. Where could that factor come from?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me re-calculate p again.

E =50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) →50 MeV/c divided by (197.33 MeV fm/c) → because ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, MeV/c in numerator, and MeV fm/c in denominator.

So, units: (MeV/c) / (MeV fm / c) ) = (MeV/c) * (c/(MeV fm)) ) → c cancels, MeV cancels. → 1/fm.

So, 50/(197.33) =0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, which is the non-relativistic formula. Let's compute that and see.

E is kinetic energy, so for non-relativistic, E = p²/(2m) → p = sqrt(2mE).

But in this case, E is 50 MeV, much larger than m c², so non-relativistic might not apply, but let's try.

Compute m=9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV=8e-12 J.

p = sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg *8e-12 J) → sqrt(1.457e-41) = ~1.207e-20 kg m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ = (1.207e-20) / (1.05457e-34) ≈1.145e14 m⁻¹ → which is 0.1145 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but earlier calculation with relativistic approach gave k=0.2533 fm⁻¹. So using non-relativistic gives a lower k, which would lead to a higher Im f(0).

Wait, with non-relativistic k=0.1145 fm⁻¹, sum=9.1084.

Im f=9.1084 / 0.1145 ≈79.55 fm. Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

At this point, maybe I should consider that perhaps the correct answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times my calculation. Perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the sum.

But where could that factor come from? I don't see any mistake in the sum calculation.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts were provided in degrees, but were they supposed to be in radians? No, the problem says degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula requires the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l) instead of sin^2(delta_l). Let me try that.

Sum would be:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.0246.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0246≈13.3821.

Im f =13.3821/(0.2533) ≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2. But why?

If I multiply by 2, 52.83 *2=105.66 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 4, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * 2.

But I don't see any reason for that.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l).

Which would give 13.3821/(2*0.2533) →13.3821/0.5066≈26.42 fm.

Still not matching.

Given that I'm not making progress, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option B, 355.351 fm. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the value of ħ c is different. Let me check: ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm. Correct.

Another idea: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the problem states degrees, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different unit, like a.u. (atomic units), but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * (something else). Alternatively, perhaps it's (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l + theta).

Wait, for theta=0, f= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l).

Expanding exp(i delta_l) as cos(d) + i sin(d), then f= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos(d) sin(d) + i sin^2(d) ].

The imaginary part of f is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2(d).

Wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is B) 355.351 fm.

But I can't reconcile my calculation with any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each term again with exact values.

Compute each term:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1 → 1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67) → sin(67)=0.9205048534526782 → sin²=0.847322 → 3*0.847322=2.541966.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55) → sin(55)=0.8191520442809371 → sin²=0.671027 →5 *0.671027=3.355135.

l=3:7 * sin²(30)=7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13) → sin(13)=0.2249510543538656 → sin²=0.050612 →9*0.050612=0.455508.

Sum: 1 + 2.541966 =3.541966 +3.355135=6.897101 +1.75=8.647101 +0.455508=9.102609.

So sum is 9.102609.

k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Im f(0)=9.102609/0.2533=35.93 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the phase shifts are given for l=0 to l=4, but the sum includes only l=0 to l=4, which I did.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l), which would give 9.102609/(2*0.2533)=17.93 fm.

Still not matching any options.

At this point, I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and can't resolve the discrepancy. Perhaps I should select the closest option, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the formula.

Wait, I think I'll go with the calculation I did, which is approximately 35.93 fm. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm. But I don't see how that would come about.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the sum of all (2l+1) sin(delta_l) as the numerator, which would give sum=13.3821, and then 13.3821/0.2533=52.83 fm, which is still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula requires a factor of 2 multiplied by the sum, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * (1 + cos(theta)), but at theta=0, cos(0)=1, so it would be 2 sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) → which would give 2*13.3821=26.7642, then 26.7642/0.2533=105.6 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times my result. But I can't see where I missed the factor of 10.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{L} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l),
\]

where \(k\) is the wave number, and \(\delta_l\) are the phase shifts. The imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is given by the same expression.

### Step 1: Compute \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the momentum \(p\) by \(k = p / \hbar\). For high-energy electrons, the momentum \(p\) can be approximated as:

\[
p \approx \frac{E}{c},
\]

where \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\) is the energy of the electrons, and \(c\) is the speed of light. Using the relation \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), we find:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{\frac{50 \, \text{MeV}}{c}}{\frac{197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}}{c}} = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \(\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l)\)
The given phase shifts are \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). For each \(l\), we calculate \((2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l)\):

- \(l = 0\): \((2(0)+1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\),
- \(l = 1\): \((2(1)+1) \sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.847 = 2.541\),
- \(l = 2\): \((2(2)+1) \sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.671 = 3.355\),
- \(l = 3\): \((2(3)+1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\),
- \(l = 4\): \((2(4)+1) \sin^2(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.455\).

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.455 = 9.101.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the imaginary part of \(f(0)\)
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l),
\]

we substitute \(k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}\) and \(\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l) \approx 9.101\):

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{9.101}{0.253} \approx 35.93 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \(35.93 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is \(355.351 \, \text{fm}\) (Option B), which is approximately 10 times larger than the computed result. Despite extensive checks, the discrepancy remains unexplained. Given the available options, the most plausible answer is:

**Answer: B**
