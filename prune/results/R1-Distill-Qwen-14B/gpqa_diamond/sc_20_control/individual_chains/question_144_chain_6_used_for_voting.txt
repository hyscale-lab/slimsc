Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 to 10^-16 meters. 

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, because the distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime. So, the formula should be something like distance = c * τ * β, where β is the velocity in units of the speed of light. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the mean decay length is c * τ, but considering that the particle is moving. Oh, wait, no, because the lifetime τ is the proper time, so when you're in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the mean decay length would be L = v * γ * τ. But wait, another approach I've heard about is using the relation involving the particle's energy, its mass, and the decay width.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this using the concept of the particle's lifetime. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy width of the resonance. So Γ = ħ c τ, no, wait, perhaps it's Γ = ħ / τ. Let me get that right. The natural linewidth is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Yes, that's correct.

But wait, the units of Γ are in energy (MeV), and τ should have units of seconds. So we can calculate τ as ħ divided by Γ. But Γ is in MeV, so let's convert everything to SI units.

So first, let me write down the known constants.

ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ in eV·s is about 6.582e-25, so in GeV·s, that's 6.582e-25 / 1e9 = 6.582e-16 GeV·s? Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Let me think: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. But ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert to GeV·s, since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. So ħ in GeV·s would be ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602e-10) GeV·s. Let me compute that. 

Calculating: 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-10 = approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Oh right, so ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. That's a value I remember is often used in particle physics for this kind of calculation.

So, Γ_X is given as 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV is 0.320 GeV. 

So τ = ħ / Γ. Substituting the numbers: τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.320 GeV = (6.582e-25) / 0.320 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is the same as 6.582 / 0.32 times 1e-25. 6.582 ÷ 0.32 = approx 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the lifetime τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds. But that's the proper time (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). But in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime is γ multiplied by τ. But wait, wait, no. The time we calculated is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So when the particle is moving at a high speed, the lab frame will see a longer lifetime. But wait, wait. The mean decay distance is calculated as the velocity multiplied by the lifetime in the lab frame. Or is it the velocity multiplied by the proper lifetime, adjusted by gamma? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. The mean decay length L is given by L = c * τ_lab, where τ_lab is the lifetime in the lab frame. But τ_lab is related to the proper time τ by τ_lab = γ τ. Because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated. So L = c * γ τ. But wait, alternatively, the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is γ τ, so the distance is c multiplied by γ τ. But how to find γ?

Alternatively, another approach: the mean decay length can also be calculated using the particle's velocity and lifetime. So L = v * τ_lab, where τ_lab is γ τ. But to find v, we can use the relativistic relation between energy, mass, and velocity.

Wait, but the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E_k = E_X - m_X c². Wait, but E_X is the total energy, not the kinetic energy. So E_X = γ m_X c². So γ is E_X / (m_X c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², right? Because the mass is given in GeV, which implies GeV/c². So E_X is 8 GeV, m_X c² is 1.2 GeV. So γ = E_X / (m_X c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ is approximately 6.6667.

So, the lab frame lifetime is τ_lab = γ τ ≈ 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

Wait, then the mean decay length L is c multiplied by τ_lab. Let me compute that. c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = c * τ_lab = 3e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = 4.113e-15 meters. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. My calculation gives approximately 4.1e-15 m, which is close to option B. But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the steps.

Wait, let's go through the steps again more accurately.

First, compute τ in the rest frame.

Γ is 0.320 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.320 = let's compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Then, compute γ as E_X / (m_X c²). E_X =8 GeV, m_X c²=1.2 GeV. γ = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.666666667.

So τ_lab = γ τ = 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24 s. Let's compute that: 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24.

6.666666667 * 2.056875 is approximately (since 6.6667 is 20/3). Let's compute 20/3 * 2.056875.

20/3 * 2.056875 = (20 * 2.056875)/3 = (41.1375)/3 ≈13.7125. So 13.7125e-24 s → 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, no. Wait, 6.66667 * 2.056875e-24 is 6.66667 * 2.056875 = let's compute that.

6 *2.056875 = 12.34125.

0.66667 *2.056875 ≈ 1.37125.

Total is 12.34125 +1.37125 =13.7125. So 13.7125e-24 seconds = 1.37125e-23 s.

So c is 3e8 m/s. So L = c * τ_lab = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 4.11375e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. My calculation is giving approximately 4.11e-15 m. But none of the options exactly match.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma or in the width.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the velocity beta instead of gamma. Because sometimes the mean lifetime is calculated using beta*gamma*tau, but I'm not sure. Let me think: the mean decay length is L = v * gamma * tau, but v is beta c. So, L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, but beta is v/c, so v = beta c. Then, L = beta c gamma tau. But gamma beta is sqrt(1 - (1/ gamma^2)) )? Or perhaps I can find beta from gamma.

We have gamma = 8/(1.2) = 6.6667.

Beta can be calculated as beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is 44.4444. 1/gamma^2 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887. So L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, but earlier I calculated L as c gamma tau, which would be beta times that. So perhaps I should have included beta.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the proper lifetime is tau, the lab lifetime is gamma tau. The distance is v * tau_lab, which is beta c * gamma tau. So L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, that's a different approach. Hmm.

Wait, so the mean decay length would be L = beta c gamma tau.

In that case, let me recalculate.

We have beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) )

Wait, let me compute gamma^2: gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6667. So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, as before. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So L = beta c gamma tau.

We have gamma=6.6667, beta=0.9887.

So, L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me structure it properly.

L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

We have:

beta ≈ 0.9887.

c = 3e8 m/s.

gamma = 6.6667.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, but wait, no. Because gamma is 6.6667, and tau is 2.056875e-24 s. So:

gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = beta * c * (gamma tau) = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute this:

0.9887 * 3e8 = approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 1.37125e-23 s: 2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = let's compute.

2.966e8 is 2.966 * 1e8.

1.37125e-23 is 1.37125 * 1e-23.

Multiply 2.966 * 1.37125 ≈ 4.07.

Multiply the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-23 = 1e-15.

So 4.07e-15 meters. That's approximately 4.07e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me check if I did all the steps correctly.

1. Compute tau: tau = ħ / Γ.

   ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

   Γ = 0.320 GeV.

   So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.320 = 2.056875e-24 s.

2. Compute gamma: gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

3. Compute beta: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ 0.9887.

4. Compute L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

   So:

   L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the order. Let me compute gamma * tau first:

gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, multiply by beta * c:

beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by (gamma tau): 2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.966 * 1.37125) * 1e-15.

Compute 2.966 * 1.37125.

2.966 * 1 = 2.966

2.966 * 0.37125 ≈ 1.0999.

So total is approximately 4.0659.

So L ≈4.0659e-15 m, which matches option B exactly.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship \( L = \beta \gamma c \tau \), where \( \beta \) is the velocity in units of the speed of light, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The given parameters are:

- Production energy: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Mass: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Decay width: \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.320 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.320 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}.
\]
Substituting \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):
\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.9775.
\]
Thus:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
\]
Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]
First, calculate \( \gamma \tau \):
\[
\gamma \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]
Then, calculate \( \beta c \):
\[
\beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]
Finally, calculate \( L \):
\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) = 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
