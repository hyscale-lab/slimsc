Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with statistical mechanics, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a system of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z of the system. The options are labeled A to D, each with different expressions involving exponential terms.

Hmm, okay. Partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT), and E is the energy of each state. So my goal is to calculate Z by considering all possible spin configurations.

Wait, but each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I should list them all, compute their energies, and then sum the exponentials.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think if I can group states by their energies. Because many states might have the same energy, so that would save time.

The energy E is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each possible combination.

Wait, S1S2 is the product of S1 and S2. So each term is either +1 or -1. Let me see possible values.

Each pair S_i S_j can be +1 if the spins are the same, and -1 if different. So S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 each can be ±1.

But the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be evaluated for each state.

Alternatively, maybe I can find how many states have a certain value of this sum, and then calculate E for each possible sum.

Let me think about the possible values of the sum.

Each term in the sum is ±1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Let's see.

Wait, for three terms each being ±1, the sum can range from 3 (all +1) down to -3 (all -1). However, what are the possible sums?

Wait, let me think: If all three terms are +1, sum is 3.

If two terms are +1 and one -1, sum is 1.

If one term is +1 and two are -1, sum is -1.

If all three are -1, sum is -3.

So possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.

But wait, wait a second. For three terms, each ±1, the sum is an odd number between -3 and 3. So yes, 3,1,-1,-3.

But wait, is each of these sums possible?

Let me check.

If all three pairs are same (all +1), which would require S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1. In that case, S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So sum is 3.

If two pairs are +1 and one is -1, what does that imply about the spins?

Wait, let me take specific cases.

Case 1: All three spins are the same. S1 = S2 = S3 = +1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3.

Similarly, all three spins = -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So in this case, two states have sum 3.

Wait no, each spin is either +1 or -1. So for the all same case, S1, S2, S3 can be all +1 or all -1. That's two states. So each gives sum 3.

Case 2: Two spins same, one different.

Let's say S1 = S2, but different from S3.

For example, S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1.

Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

Similarly, another configuration: S1 = S3, S2 different. Or S2 = S3, S1 different. Each of these might contribute to sums.

Wait, how many such states have sum -1?

Alternatively, perhaps I should list all possibilities with sum 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, perhaps I can find the number of states for each sum.

Let me think of it as a graph. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3) where each S is ±1.

Compute the sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

I can compute H for each of the 8 states.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find how many states have H=3, H=1, H=-1, H=-3.

Let me try that.

Total states:8.

H=3 occurs when all S_i S_j are 1.

Which corresponds to all S_i being the same.

So how many such states are there? Two: all +1 or all -1.

So H=3 occurs in two states.

H=-3 occurs when all S_i S_j are -1.

Wait, but that's impossible.

Wait, because S_i S_j is -1 only when spins are opposite.

If S1 S2 = -1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 = -1.

Then, S1 S2 = -1 implies S2 = -S1.

S1 S3 = -1 implies S3 = -S1.

So S2 = -S1, S3 = -S1.

So S2 = S3, because both are -S1.

So S2 = S3.

So S2 and S3 are same, but S2 = -S1.

So S1 can be +1 or -1.

If S1 is +1, then S2 and S3 are -1.

So triplet is (+1, -1, -1).

Similarly, if S1 is -1, S2 and S3 are +1: (-1, +1, +1).

So two states have H = -3.

Wait, let me compute H for these two cases.

For (+1, -1, -1):

S1 S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S1 S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S2 S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.

So sum H = (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.

Wait, that's -1, not -3.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps my assumption that all S_i S_j = -1 is wrong.

Wait a moment, maybe I made a mistake here. So let me compute H for (+1, -1, -1):

Compute each product:

S1 S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S1 S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S2 S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.

So H = (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.

Okay, so that gives H=-1.

So that's for the case of two spins the same, one different.

Wait, but I was initially thinking that when all S_i S_j = -1, H would be -3. But in reality, that's not possible.

So perhaps H can't be -3. Let me think again.

Wait, for H to be 3, all three terms have to be +1.

So that requires all S_i S_j = +1, which means all S_i are the same.

So that's two states: all +1, all -1, so H=3 for these two.

What about H=-3?

Is there any configuration where all S_i S_j =-1? Let's see.

If S1 S2 = -1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 =-1.

Then:

S1 S2 = -1 → S2 = -S1.

S1 S3 = -1 → S3 = -S1.

So S2 = -S1, S3 = -S1.

So S2 = S3 (since both are -S1).

So then S2 S3 = (+1) → because S2 = S3.

So S2 S3 = +1, which contradicts our assumption that it's -1.

Therefore, it's impossible for all three terms to be -1. So H can't be -3.

So the possible H values are 3, 1, -1.

Wait, what about H=1 and H=-1?

Let me see.

Take another state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then,

S1 S2 = +1,

S1 S3 = -1,

S2 S3 = -1.

So H = +1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, sum is -1.

So that's one state with H=-1.

How about another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

Wait, same as before, H=-1.

Wait, how many states have H=1?

Let me think of a different configuration.

S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

So,

S1 S2 = -1,

S1 S3 = +1,

S2 S3 = -1.

H = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = (-1).

Hmm, that's H=-1 again. So how do I get H=+1?

Wait, let me take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Then H=3.

Another possibility: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. H=-1.

Wait, maybe H=1 occurs in another situation.

Wait, another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

Wait, we did this and H was -1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think of another approach.

Each H can be either 3, 1, -1, or -3. But earlier, I saw that H can't be -3. So possible H values are 3, 1, -1.

Wait, but that leaves H=1 and H=-1. How many states have H=1 and how many have H=-1?

I have two states with H=3.

Let me count how many states have H=1 and H=-1.

Total states:8.

States with H=3: 2.

So remaining states:6.

These 6 states have H=1 or H=-1.

I need to find how many have H=1 and how many H=-1.

Let me consider a state where exactly two of the three terms are +1 and one is -1, which would sum to 1.

Wait, for H=1, the sum would be +1, which is when two terms are +1 and one is -1.

Similarly, for H=-1, two terms are -1 and one +1.

So how many such states are there for each?

Let me think for H=1.

How many triplets have exactly two terms +1 and one term -1.

Each term corresponds to a pair (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3).

Wait, but each term is a product of two spins.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of spin configurations that lead to a particular H.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The possible values of H are 3, 1, -1.

Wait, let's think in terms of the number of +1's in the three terms.

H=3: all three +1 → two states.

H=1: two +1's and one -1 → ?

H=-1: two -1's and one +1 → ?

Wait, perhaps for H=1, the number of such spin configurations is equal to the number of ways to have exactly two +1's and one -1 in the three terms.

But each term is S_i S_j, which is +1 if the two spins are the same, -1 otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of states with H=1 is four, and H=-1 is four as well, but that can't be because 2 (H=3) +4 +4=10>8.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list all 8 spin states and compute H for each.

Let me do that.

Each spin can be +1 or -1.

List all 8 possible (S1, S2, S3) and compute H for each:

1. (1,1,1)
H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1+1+1=3.

2. (1,1,-1)
H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1.

3. (1,-1,1)
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

4. (1,-1,-1)
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

5. (-1,1,1)
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

6. (-1,1,-1)
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

7. (-1,-1,1)
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

8. (-1,-1,-1)
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Wait a minute, looking at this list, only two states have H=3, and the remaining six all have H=-1.

Wait, this can't be right, because earlier I thought H could be 1 or -1. But according to this, only H=3 and H=-1 are present.

Wait, but in the cases I looked at earlier, some states had H=-1, but none had H=1. So where are the states with H=1?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H calculation for some states. Let me double-check each case.

Let me re-examine state 3: (1,-1,1).

Compute H: S1S2 = (1)(-1)=-1,

S1S3= (1)(1)=1,

S2S3= (-1)(1)=-1.

So H = (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

So that's correct.

State 2: (1,1,-1).

H= 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

Same goes for all others except 1 and 8, which have H=3.

Wait, so according to this, all 8 states have either H=3 or H=-1.

So H can be 3 or -1 only.

But that seems contradictory to my initial thought that H could be 3,1,-1,-3. But according to this, H can't be 1 or -3.

Wait, why is that? Because when I tried to make all three terms be -1, it's impossible because the spins would have to satisfy conflicting conditions. So, no state has H=-3. And for H=1, the only way is to have two terms +1 and one -1, but according to the above analysis, none of the 8 states have H=1. That's confusing.

Wait, but looking at the list, all states except the two all-same have H=-1.

So, let me count:

- States with H=3: 2.

- States with H=-1: 6.

Because all other 6 states have H=-1.

So, that's an important finding. So the possible energies are E = -J * H.

So, for H=3: E = -J*(3) = -3J.

For H=-1: E = -J*(-1) = +J.

So, each state contributes a term exp(-β E) to the partition function.

So, for each state with E = -3J, the term is exp( β*3J ), because -β*(-3J) = 3Jβ.

Similarly, for states with E=J, the term is exp(-β J).

So, the partition function Z is sum over all states of exp(-β E) = sum of exp( β J H ), because E = -J H.

Wait, because E = -J H, so -β E = β J H.

So for each state:

- If H=3 → term is e^{ β J *3 }.

- If H=-1 → term is e^{ β J * (-1) } = e^{- β J }.

So, how many terms of each?

Number of states with H=3: 2 → each contributes e^{3β J}.

Number of states with H=-1: 6 → each contributes e^{-β J}.

So Z = 2 * e^{3β J} + 6 * e^{-β J}.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{Jβ} → No, because it's e^{ -3Jβ } for H=3, which would be e^{3β J} in our case, so that's incorrect.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, because that's 2 e^{3β J} (H=3) and 6 e^{-β J} (H=-1).

So option B is:

Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}

Which matches our calculation.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since \( E \) depends on the spin configuration, we first determine the possible values of the sum \( H = S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \) for all \( 2^3 = 8 \) spin states. Each spin configuration is a triplet \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) \), and we compute \( H \) for each:

1. \( (1, 1, 1) \): \( H = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \)
2. \( (1, 1, -1) \): \( H = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \)
3. \( (1, -1, 1) \): \( H = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \)
4. \( (1, -1, -1) \): \( H = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \)
5. \( (-1, 1, 1) \): \( H = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \)
6. \( (-1, 1, -1) \): \( H = -1 + 1 + 1 = 1 \)
7. \( (-1, -1, 1) \): \( H = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \)
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \): \( H = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \)

From this, we find that \( H \) can take two values: \( H = 3 \) (appearing in 2 states) and \( H = -1 \) (appearing in 6 states). 

The energy for each \( H \) is:

- For \( H = 3 \): \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \), so the contribution to \( Z \) is \( 2 \cdot e^{\beta J \cdot 3} = 2e^{3J\beta} \).
- For \( H = -1 \): \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \), so the contribution to \( Z \) is \( 6 \cdot e^{\beta J \cdot (-1)} = 6e^{-J\beta} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived result).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong coefficients and exponents).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
