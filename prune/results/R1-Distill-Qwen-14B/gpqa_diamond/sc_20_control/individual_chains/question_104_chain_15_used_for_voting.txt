Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect shifts in the spectral lines.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. So the key here is the Doppler shift measurements. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for #2, it's 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, but how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the RV method gives us the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and orbit. The formula I think involves the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us.

The formula for K is something like K = (v) where v = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ) * (1/(P))^(1/3) ) ), but since both planets are Neptune mass and stars are sun-like, M_p << M_star, so I can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the relation between the Doppler shift and the velocity. The Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to velocity by the formula Δλ/λ₀ = v/c. But since we're given the shifts in the same spectral line, the rest wavelength λ₀ is the same for both. So the ratio of velocities would be the same as the ratio of the shifts.

So for planet #1, v1 = (Δλ1 / λ₀) * c. For planet #2, v2 = (Δλ2 / λ₀) * c. So the ratio v2/v1 is (Δλ2)/(Δλ1) = 7/5 = 1.4. So v2 is 1.4 times v1.

But wait, what determines the velocity semi-amplitude K? From the RV method, K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination. But since both planets are around identical stars and have same mass, and same detection method, the only varying factors here would be period and inclination. But since we're given the RV shifts, which are proportional to K, perhaps we can relate K to the orbital period.

Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) )

But wait, that's probably not the exact formula. Let me think again. The correct formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1/(1 + (M_p/M_star))^(2/3)) ) ) / (1 AU) ) ... No, perhaps it's better to recall that K depends on (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3) ). Or wait, the formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * P ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / c ), but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, from what I remember, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ). Or, more accurately, K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2) ) )^(1/3) ) / (P)^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) / c. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Doppler shift being proportional to the velocity of the star, which in turn depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, and assuming the same inclination (since they're both detected, sin i is same for both perhaps), then the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period? Or wait, maybe it's proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π/(P c))^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the formula as:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P c)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, let me look for a more precise formula. The correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / (c * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps more accurately, the formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / (c * P^(1/3) ) ) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the proportionality. Since both stars are the same mass, and both planets have the same mass, and assuming the same inclination (so sin i is same), then K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), because K scales with ( (M_p) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) ) ).

Alternatively, since M_p and M_star are the same for both systems, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, but in the problem, the Doppler shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So the velocities are proportional to the Doppler shift (since the same spectral line is used), so v1 is 5 and v2 is 7. So v2 = (7/5) v1.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But K1 is 5, K2 is7.

Wait, no, K is the velocity semi-amplitude. So K1 = 5, K2 =7. So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) ?

Wait, because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Wait, but we're asked how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 = x * P1. We need to find x.

So, 7/5 = (P1/(x P1) )^(1/3) = (1/x)^(1/3).

So (7/5) = (1/x)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (7/5)^3 = 1/x → x = (5/7)^3.

Wait, let me compute that. 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So x = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but wait. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) * K1.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me write the relation:

K = ( ( (G * M_p) / (c * (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) / (P^(1/3) )

Since G, c, M_p, M_star are same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, that makes sense because if P is larger, the velocity semi-amplitude is smaller (since the star moves more slowly in its orbit, taking longer to complete a cycle). So K is larger when P is smaller.

So K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K2/K1 =7/5 = (P1/(P2))^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let's correct the proportionality. Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3.

Compute (5/7)^3: 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Which means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the ratio is less than 1. But the options are A: ~0.36, which would be the case if P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. If P2 is shorter, then the answer would be less than 1, like 0.36 times. So the correct ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the ratio. Let me go through the steps again.

Given that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/(K)^(3).

So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 must be smaller than P1.

So when K increases, P decreases. Since K2 > K1, then P2 < P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times, so P2 is shorter. So the ratio is 0.36. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but the options are about how many times longer. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, it's actually shorter, so 0.36 times, meaning it's not longer but shorter. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the periods: the planet with larger Doppler shift (K) has a shorter period.

So K2 is higher, so P2 is smaller. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, meaning P2 is 0.36 times P1. So the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1? It's 0.36 times, so planet #2's period is shorter. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

Given:
- The Doppler shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, corresponding to \( K_1 \propto 5 \).
- The Doppler shift for planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms, corresponding to \( K_2 \propto 7 \).

The ratio of the velocities (and thus the Doppler shifts) is:
\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}.
\]

Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), we have:
\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} \):
\[
\frac{7}{5} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}^{1/3}.
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):
\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

But since we're given the shifts in the same spectral line, the rest wavelength λ₀ is the same for both. So the ratio of velocities would be the same as the ratio of the shifts.

So for planet #1, v1 = (Δλ1 / λ₀) * c. For planet #2, v2 = (Δλ2 / λ₀) * c. So the ratio v2/v1 is (Δλ2)/(Δλ1) = 7/5 = 1.4. So v2 is 1.4 times v1.

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) )

But wait, that's probably not the exact formula. Let me think again. The correct formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1/(1 + (M_p/M_star))^(2/3)) ) ) / (1 AU) ) ... No, perhaps it's better to recall that K depends on (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3) ). Or wait, the formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * P ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / c ), but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, from what I remember, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ). Or, more accurately, K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2) ) )^(1/3) ) / (P)^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) / c. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the formula as:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P c)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, let me look for a more precise formula. The correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / (c * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps more accurately, the formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / (c * P^(1/3) ) ) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the proportionality. Since both stars are the same mass, and both planets have the same mass, and assuming the same inclination (so sin i is same), then K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), because K scales with ( (M_p) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) ) ).

Alternatively, since M_p and M_star are the same for both systems, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, but in the problem, the Doppler shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So the velocities are proportional to the Doppler shift (since the same spectral line is used), so v1 is 5 and v2 is 7. So v2 = (7/5) v1.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But K1 is 5, K2 is7.

Wait, no, K is the velocity semi-amplitude. So K1 = 5, K2 =7. So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) ?

Wait, because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Wait, but we're asked how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 = x * P1. We need to find x.

So, 7/5 = (P1/(x P1) )^(1/3) = (1/x)^(1/3).

So (7/5) = (1/x)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (7/5)^3 = 1/x → x = (5/7)^3.

Wait, let me compute that. 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So x = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but wait. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) * K1.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me write the relation:

K = ( ( (G * M_p) / (c * (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) / (P^(1/3) )

Since G, c, M_p, M_star are same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, that makes sense because if P is larger, the velocity semi-amplitude is smaller (since the star moves more slowly in its orbit, taking longer to complete a cycle). So K is larger when P is smaller.

So K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K2/K1 =7/5 = (P1/(P2))^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let's correct the proportionality. Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3.

Compute (5/7)^3: 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Which means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the ratio is less than 1. But the options are A: ~0.36, which would be the case if P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. If P2 is shorter, then the answer would be less than 1, like 0.36 times. So the correct ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the ratio. Let me go through the steps again.

Given that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/(K)^(3).

So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 must be smaller than P1.

So when K increases, P decreases. Since K2 > K1, then P2 < P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times, so P2 is shorter. So the ratio is 0.36. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but the options are about how many times longer. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, it's actually shorter, so 0.36 times, meaning it's not longer but shorter. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the periods: the planet with larger Doppler shift (K) has a shorter period.

So K2 is higher, so P2 is smaller. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, meaning P2 is 0.36 times P1. So the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1? It's 0.36 times, so planet #2's period is shorter. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

Given:
- The Doppler shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, corresponding to \( K_1 \propto 5 \).
- The Doppler shift for planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms, corresponding to \( K_2 \propto 7 \).

The ratio of the velocities (and thus the Doppler shifts) is:
\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}.
\]

Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), we have:
\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} \):
\[
\frac{7}{5} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}^{1/3}.
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):
\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
