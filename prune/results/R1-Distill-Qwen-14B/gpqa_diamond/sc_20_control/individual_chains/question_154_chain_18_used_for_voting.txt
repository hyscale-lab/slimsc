Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what the substance is. Let me start by going through each piece of information step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, that makes me think of something with a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has two main isotopes, about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So if the molecular ion is M at 156, then M+2 would be 158, which is what's seen here. So that suggests the molecule has one chlorine atom. So molecular weight is 156, with Cl present.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. 1720 is a typical region for a carbonyl, maybe ester, acid, or aldehyde. For carboxylic acids, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 3000-2500, but the strong peak at 1720 could also be an ester or maybe an acid chloride, but that's less likely. Wait, aldehyde's carbonyl is around 2800-2700 too, but the peak here is at 1720. So perhaps it's a ketone? No, because of the broad peak. Maybe it's an acid. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3300, and a strong carbonyl around 1700.

Looking at the 1H NMR: 11.0 ppm is a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because in the NMR, the -COOH proton appears as a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet at 11.0. Wait, but wait, sometimes in more deshielded environments or if it's exchange broadened, it might appear as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? No, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but this is 11. So more likely a carboxylic acid.

Then, the other signals: 8.02 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H, and 7.72 ppm, another doublet for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para-substitution, the two protons on each side are equivalent and show as doublets. So for example, in para-substituted benzene rings, you get two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H.

Putting that together, the molecule is probably a chlorobenzoic acid. Because the molecular weight is 156, let's calculate the molecular formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If we have Cl substituting, then the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's check the molecular weight: (12*7) + (5*1) + (35.5) + (16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate:

C7: 7 *12=84
H5:5 *1=5
Cl:35.5
O2:32
Total is 84 +5 =89, +35.5 =124.5, +32=156.5. So the molecular weight would be approximately 156.5, which would give a molecular ion at m/z 156 or 157, but the options may have different structures.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the COOH group. So that makes sense with the NMR.

Option D: 2-chloro, so the Cl and COOH are adjacent. In that case, the NMR would show more splitting. For ortho substitution, the aromatic protons would show more complex splitting. But in the given NMR, it's two doublets each integrating to 2H, which is more like para. So option B seems more likely.

But wait, let's check the other data. The molecular ion is at 156. If the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, the molecular weight is 156.5, so the molecular ion could be at 156 (M) and 158 (M+Cl: since Cl has 35.5, but wait, the M peak is at 156, which is 156.5 rounded down. But the M+2 peak is at 158, which would come from the Cl-37 isotope. So that makes sense. So the molecular ion is 156, and M+2 is 158, 32% abundance, which fits with Cl being present.

Now the NMR. 11.0 ppm is the COOH proton. Then, the aromatic region: two doublets, each 2H. So the aromatic ring has two substituents: COOH and Cl, in para positions. So the protons adjacent to COOH would be as a doublet, and the ones adjacent to Cl would be another doublet. Wait, but for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. So the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, and 3 and 5 adjacent to Cl.

In such a case, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. The protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and show up around 8.0 ppm, and the para positions would be less deshielded, maybe 7.72. So the NMR matches this.

Looking back at the other options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have a structure where the ring has OH, Cl, and CHO groups. But wait, the aldehyde group would have a proton around 9-10 ppm, but our NMR has 11 ppm, which is more like a COOH proton. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Which is OClCOPh? Wait, no, phenyl chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, no, wait, chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-R. So the structure would be ClCOOPh. But then, the IR would show a strong carbonyl, but what about the O-H? Chloroformate doesn't have an O-H group. So the IR would have a peak at 1720 (which matches the carbonyl), but no broad peak from O-H. So the IR data shows a broad peak (probably O-H), which would not fit phenyl chloroformate. So option C is less likely.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So the Cl is adjacent to the COOH group. In that case, the aromatic protons would be different. The ortho protons (positions 3 and 6) would be deshielded and maybe show up as a triplet or something more complex. Whereas the para position (position 4, but wait, in benzoic acid, COOH is at position 1, Cl at 2. So the other positions are 3,4,5,6. Positions 3 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl and COOH, perhaps leading to more coupling. The NMR would show more splitting than just two doublets. So the NMR data doesn't match option D, which suggests para substitution (option B) is correct.

Another thought: the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700-1725. So that fits. Also, the broad peak in IR suggests O-H, which aligns with a carboxylic acid.

So putting it all together: molecular formula suggests a chlorobenzoic acid with molecular weight 156.5, which when considering isotopes, gives the M and M+2 peaks as observed. The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm (COOH), and two doublets in the aromatic region, which points to a para-substituted benzene. Therefore, the correct structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is option B.

The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Here's the analysis:

### Mass Spectrometry
- The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156.
- The peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) suggests the presence of a chlorine atom, as it corresponds to the **Cl-37 isotope**.

### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy
- A **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an **O-H group**, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** suggests a **carbonyl group**, consistent with a carboxylic acid or similar structure.

### Proton NMR
- A **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)** is characteristic of the **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**.
- Two **doublets** at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)** indicate a **para-substituted aromatic ring**. This pattern is typical for a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

### Molecular Formula and Structure
- The molecular weight of 156 corresponds to the formula **C₇H₅ClO₂**, which matches a chlorobenzoic acid.
- The NMR data supports a **para-substitution pattern**, where the carboxylic acid (-COOH) and chlorine (Cl) are attached to the benzene ring in the para positions. This structure is consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde):** This structure includes an aldehyde group, which would show a proton around 9-10 ppm in the NMR, not the observed singlet at 11.0 ppm. Additionally, it lacks the para-substitution pattern seen in the NMR. **Eliminated.**
2. **Option B (4-Chlorobenzoic acid):** This structure matches all the spectral data:
   - The molecular weight is 156.
   - The IR shows the O-H and carbonyl peaks of a carboxylic acid.
   - The NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm for the carboxylic acid proton and two doublets for the para-substituted aromatic protons. **Matches.**
3. **Option C (Phenyl chloroformate):** This structure lacks an O-H group, so it cannot explain the broad IR peak. **Eliminated.**
4. **Option D (2-Chlorobenzoic acid):** In this structure, the chlorine and carboxylic acid are in the ortho positions. This would result in more complex splitting in the aromatic region, inconsistent with the observed two doublets. **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion
The spectral data is most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.

**Answer: B**
