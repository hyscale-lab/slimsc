Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopy data. Let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR and IR, but I'll think it through.

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents attached. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns—ortho, meta, para. But I'm not sure if the substitution pattern matters here yet.

The FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so the strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1. There's also usually an absorption for the O-C-O stretching around 1250 cm^-1. So the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's break those down.

1. Two aromatic signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. If it's para substitution, there would be two sets of aromatic protons—probably two doublets, because each H is adjacent to two different substituents. The splitting would depend on coupling. Alternatively, ortho substitution would have more complex splitting. But wait, the problem says two signals, so maybe the substitution is symmetric in a way that only two types of aromatic H are present. Like para substitution, perhaps with identical substituents, meaning each H is equivalent.

2. Two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are adjacent to double bonds. So maybe there's a substituted ethylene group attached to the ring. For example, an ester group with an ethylene chain, like maybe a vinyl ester. Or perhaps it's part of a substituent like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester?

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. These are probably methyl groups. Since there's no –CH2 signals, it means any CH2 groups in the structure must be split in a way that their signals are not observed or are integrated into other signals. Alternatively, perhaps any CH2 groups are part of a larger structure where their protons are not giving a distinct peak. Wait, but the question says no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups, so the compound has no CH2 groups. So all the methyl groups are either isolated or part of a larger group without CH2 in between.

Hmm. So the substituents on the benzene are probably an ester group and something else. But wait, wait—the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene. Let me think about the possible substituents.

If the ester is one substituent, what's the other? Let me think about the NMR signals. The vinyl protons and the methyl groups. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like maybe a methacrylate?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Or perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent, such as an acetyl group or something else.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If the aromatic ring has two substituents, and one is an ester group, the other could be another group like a methyl group. But wait, the NMR shows two methyl signals. Wait, maybe the ester is part of a larger substituent. For example, if the ester is O-CO-O-R, where R is a group with methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetylated vinyl group. Let me sketch this out.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2-CH2-CO-O-R? No, that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R attached to the benzene. But wait, let me think about the NMR signals.

In the NMR, there are two vinyl protons. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each vinyl H is coupled with another H. The doublet could be from a trans coupling, or perhaps from a H that's adjacent to another group. The doublet of quartets (doublet of quartets) is a bit tricky; perhaps each H is coupled with two different sets of H, leading to splitting. Alternatively, maybe each H is adjacent to two different coupling partners. For example, in a trans configuration across a double bond, each H would couple with one H on the adjacent carbon, but if there's more splitting, perhaps from another adjacent group.

Wait, another thought. If the substituent is an ethenyl (vinyl) group attached to an ester, like O-CO-O-R where R is an ethenyl group. But that may not fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, where the ester is attached to a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like O-CO-O-CH2-C=CH2. No, that might not give the right NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl vinyl group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a structure like this:

The benzene ring has two substituents. One is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R. The other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. For example, perhaps it's a styrene group (vinyl benzene), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and an ester. But then, the two methyl groups would come from where? Unless the ester has a methyl group. Let me clarify: the ester group is O-CO-O-R. R could be a methyl group (making it methyl ester). But then, the other substituent would be something else.

Wait, if the benzene is di-substituted with an ester and a methyl group, but then how do we get two methyl groups in the NMR signals?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group that's connected to a methyl. For example, let's imagine the structure is:

Ph-O-CO-O-(CH2) groups. Wait, but that may not explain the vinyl H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene where one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2-CH2-CO-O-R. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CO-O-R. Hmm, but then the NMR would have more signals.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again.

Aromatic: two signals. So maybe the two substituents on benzene are in para positions. So the aromatic Hs are in two equivalent positions, each giving a doublet because of coupling with adjacent Hs.

Vinyl-H: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That makes me think of a trans double bond, where each H is coupled with the other, giving a doublet. But why a doublet of quartets? Maybe each H is coupled with two different groups, such as another H on the same carbon and another from adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a substituent where the Hs are in a more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's count the total number of H signals. 6 signals, which seems manageable. Let's think about the possible structure.

If the benzene has two substituents—let's say one is an ester group (which would be O-CO-O-R), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. Wait, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and an allyl group. Wait, an allyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that's a single substituent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. Like, the benzene ring has an ester group where the R group is an allyl group. So, the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-C-O-... Wait, maybe it's a propenoate ester, where the ester is attached to a CH2=CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, and the ester is part of another substituent.

Wait, maybe the compound is a di-substituted benzene where one substituent is an ester group and the other is a methyl group. But then, the NMR shows two methyl signals, so perhaps there are two methyl groups somewhere else.

Wait, but the ester group itself could have a methyl group. For example, methyl propionate would have a methyl group in the ester. So, if the substituent is a methyl ester, that would give a methyl group in the NMR. But then, where is the other methyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group and the other is an ester group that has another methyl.

Wait, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The benzene ring has three degrees of unsaturation. The ester group has a double bond (C=O), contributing one degree. Any double bonds in substituents would add more.

The ester structure is O-CO-O-R. If R is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), that adds another degree. So, if the substituent R is a vinyl group, then another degree. So, total degrees of unsaturation for the molecule: benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5.

Wait, but the formula would be CnHmO2. Let's see the options.

The options are: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Each of these has a certain number of degrees of unsaturation. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2C + 2 - H)/2.

Let me compute for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees.

Option B: C12H14O2. (2*12 +2 -14)/2=(26-14)/2=12/2=6.

Option C: C12H12O2. (26 -12)/2=14/2=7.

Option D: C11H12O2. (24 -12)/2=12/2=6.

So the correct compound likely has 5 degrees of unsaturation because the benzene (3) plus ester (1) plus vinyl (1) would total 5. So the correct option would be option A (C11H14O2) which has 5 degrees, or option D (C11H12O2) which has 6.

Wait, but wait. Let's recount. Benzene ring (3), ester (1), and any other double bonds. If the substituent has a vinyl group (another double bond), that's a total of 5. So the correct degrees of unsaturation would be 5, so the formula must have 5 degrees. So looking at the options:

Option A: 5 degrees. Option D: 6 degrees.

So the formula should be C11H14O2, which is option A. But wait, let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't a vinyl group but a methyl group attached to an ester. Let me think.

Wait, if the substituents are an ester and a methyl group, the benzene has two substituents. The ester group would have O-CO-O-R. Let's say R is methyl, so the ester is methyl something. Then, the other substituent is a methyl group. So the structure would be di-substituted benzene with a methyl group and a methyl ester group.

But in that case, the NMR would show aromatic Hs (two signals if para), the methyl groups from ester and substituent. But the NMR shows two methyl signals. So perhaps the ester is ethyl, but then where are the two methyls?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group that is part of an ester. Like, the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another angle. The 1H NMR has two CH3 groups. So maybe the molecule has two separate methyl groups. For example, one methyl from an ester (like O-CO-O-Me) and another methyl attached elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group that includes a vinyl group. For instance, the substituent could be CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is a methyl group. So the substituent would be CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, that's a possibility. So benzene di-substituted with a methyl group and a vinyl ester group. Let me think about the structure: Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not a vinyl. Or maybe Ph-CH2-COO-R, but that's a single substituent.

Wait, perhaps the benzene has two substituents: one is a methyl group, and the other is an ester group with a vinyl substituent. For example, one substituent is a methyl group attached directly to the ring, and the other substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group, like Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that doesn't include a double bond. Alternatively, R could be CH2=CH-, making the substituent Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. So, the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-C=CH2.

In that case, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the vinyl protons would be on the CH2-C=CH2 part. Let's think about their NMR signals.

The vinyl Hs would be on the CH2 group next to the double bond. So for CH2-C=CH2, the two Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond. Each of those Hs would couple with the Hs on the double bond. Let me think: the Hs on the CH2 would be split into a quartet because each H is adjacent to two Hs on the double bond. Wait, no. The coupling across the double bond would be trans, so each H on the CH2 would couple with the Hs on the double bond. If the double bond is between the two CH groups, perhaps each CH2 H is coupled with both Hs on the adjacent double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that doesn't fit. Maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single substituent.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single substituent and doesn't explain the vinyl Hs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this differently. Let's consider the options and see which formula fits with the NMR.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2: molecular formula.

So degree of unsaturation is 5. Which would correspond to benzene (3), ester (1), and a double bond in substituent (1).

So the structure has a benzene ring, an ester group, and a substituent with a double bond.

Now, considering the NMR data:

Aromatic H: 2 signals. So para substitution, giving two equivalent H environments.

Vinyl H: 2 signals. So perhaps the substituent has two Hs, each in a different environment.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2.

No, that's not right. Alternatively, substituent is CH2-CH2 attached to ester, but that would not have a double bond.

Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- attached to the ester. So the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2, but that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-Ph. No, that's a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. So the ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, the other is a vinyl group.

So the structure is something like Ph-O-CO-O-R and Ph-CH2-CH2-. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester oxygen. Like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but again, not a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about how the substituents contribute to the NMR signals.

The aromatic Hs: para substitution gives two doublets. Each aromatic H would be next to two substituents, but if the substituents are symmetric, the Hs would be equivalent. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, making the Hs in two different environments.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group. So the benzene ring has a methyl group and an ester group attached. Then, the ester group would have an O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. So the formula would be Ph-O-CO-OCH3 and a methyl group. But that would give two methyl groups in the structure: one from the ester and one as a substituent. But wait, the NMR shows two methyl signals.

Wait, but in that case, the two methyl groups might be equivalent, giving only one signal. Unless they are in different environments. For example, if the substituents are para, then the methyl from the ester and the methyl substituent could be in different environments. But in that case, maybe they'd give two separate signals.

Wait, if the substituents are para, then each methyl would be in a different environment, giving two separate methyl signals. But wait, the ester methyl is part of the ester group, which is attached to the ring. So the ester methyl would be attached to an oxygen, whereas the other methyl is attached directly to the ring. Would their chemical shifts be different? Probably, yes. So that could explain two methyl signals.

So the structure would be a para-substituted benzene with a methyl group and a methyl ester group. So the substituents are CH3 and O-CO-O-CH3.

Wait, but then the substituents are CH3 and O-CO-OCH3. So the benzene ring is di-substituted with a methyl group and a methyl ester group.

But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. Oh, wait, in this case, the substituent is the ester, which is O-CO-OCH3. So where's the vinyl Hs coming from?

Ah, this is where I'm getting stuck. If the substituents are methyl and ester, then the NMR shouldn't have vinyl H signals. So perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

So perhaps the substituent isn't a methyl group but something else that has a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOCH3. So the ester is attached to a vinyl group. So the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a double bond. Alternatively, the substituent is CH2=CH-COOCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the substituent would be an allyl group attached to the ester. So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-OCH3), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-).

Wait, but that would be two substituents on the benzene: an ester and a vinyl group, making the structure di-substituted. Then, the ester group's R would be a methyl group.

So the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-.

But then, the NMR would show the aromatic Hs, the vinyl Hs, and the methyls.

But wait, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but again, no double bond. Alternatively, substituent is Ph-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester, making the structure O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but again, no double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I'm not getting the right structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to the ester. Like, the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the NMR signals.

The aromatic Hs are two signals, so likely para substitution. Then, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, where R is a group with a vinyl group and two methyl groups.

Wait, the NMR has two methyl signals. So perhaps the R group in the ester is CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Then, the substituent would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the structure would be di-substituted benzene, with substituents being O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, that can't be because that would be a mono-substituted ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, perhaps it's Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I'm not seeing the double bond.

Alternatively, the substituent is a prop-1-enyl group attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I'm not getting the right structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the NMR shows two vinyl signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent.

Wait, for a vinyl group, the protons are typically split as a doublet because they're trans to each other. So one H is coupled with the other, giving a doublet. But in this case, one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests more coupling. Maybe each H is coupling with two different Hs, leading to quartet splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group, where the Hs are split by adjacent groups. But then, the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2, which doesn't involve a double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CH-CH2) attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but again, not seeing the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group attached to the ester oxygen. So the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. So the substituent is a vinyl ketone ester? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, and the other is a methyl group. But that would complicate the NMR.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C11H14O2 and others.

Assuming the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group attached to something else.

If R is a methyl group, then the ester would contribute O-CO-OCH3. The other substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps CH2=CH2, but that's a single substituent.

But let's count the carbons.

Benzene is six C. Let's say one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (which is 3 O and 3 C: O, C, O, CH3). Wait, O-CO-OCH3 is (COOCH3) which is 3 C (the COO has two C, and the CH3 is one C). So from the ester group, that's 3 C.

The other substituent is a vinyl group, which is 2 C (CH2=CH-). So benzene (6) + ester (3) + vinyl (2) = 11 C. Oh, wait, but wait. Wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene, so the entire substituent would be, say, O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, that's not a double bond.

Wait, if the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, that's an ethyl ester, but that doesn't include any double bonds. So the vinyl must come from another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's an ethyl group and not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2. No, that’s not a double bond.

Alternatively, substituent is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere. Maybe Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 includes a double bond. Not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to try to determine the formula based on the data.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2: 5 degrees of unsaturation.

B) C12H14O2: 6.

C) C12H12O2:7.

D) C11H12O2:6.

The NMR shows two vinyl Hs, which is a double bond. So the structure must have a benzene ring (3), ester (1), and a double bond (1), totaling 5. So the formula must have 5 degrees, which is option A.

So the correct formula would be C11H14O2, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A is C11H14O2.

Yes, that would fit with 5 degrees of unsaturation, which matches the benzene, ester, and vinyl group.

So the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum showing absorption for a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals suggest a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, resulting in two distinct environments for the aromatic protons.
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, indicate the presence of a vinyl group (C=C bond) with two protons in different environments.
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals for –CH3 groups, with no signals for –CH2 groups, suggesting the absence of methylene groups in the structure.

The molecular formula must account for the degrees of unsaturation. A benzene ring contributes 3 degrees of unsaturation, the ester group contributes 1, and the vinyl group contributes another, totaling 5 degrees. This matches the molecular formula **C11H14O2**, which has 5 degrees of unsaturation.

Analyzing the options:
- **C11H12O2 (Option D)** and **C12H12O2 (Option C)** have 6 and 7 degrees of unsaturation, respectively, which are inconsistent with the data.
- **C12H14O2 (Option B)** has 6 degrees of unsaturation, which also does not match.
- **C11H14O2 (Option A)** has 5 degrees of unsaturation, aligning with the benzene ring, ester group, and vinyl group.

Thus, the correct molecular formula is **C11H14O2**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopy data. Let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR and IR, but I'll think it through.

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents attached. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns—ortho, meta, para. But I'm not sure if the substitution pattern matters here yet.

The FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so the strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1. There's also usually an absorption for the O-C-O stretching around 1250 cm^-1. So the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's break those down.

1. Two aromatic signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. If it's para substitution, there would be two sets of aromatic protons—probably two doublets, because each H is adjacent to two different substituents. The splitting would depend on coupling. Alternatively, ortho substitution would have more complex splitting. But wait, the problem says two signals, so maybe the substitution is symmetric in a way that only two types of aromatic H are present. Like para substitution, perhaps with identical substituents, meaning each H is equivalent.

2. Two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are adjacent to double bonds. So maybe there's a substituted ethylene group attached to the ring. For example, an ester group with an ethylene chain, like maybe a vinyl ester. Or perhaps it's part of a substituent like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester?

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. These are probably methyl groups. Since there's no –CH2 signals, it means any CH2 groups in the structure must be split in a way that their signals are not observed or are integrated into other signals. Alternatively, perhaps any CH2 groups are part of a larger structure where their protons are not giving a distinct peak. Wait, but the question says no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups, so the compound has no CH2 groups. So all the methyl groups are either isolated or part of a larger group without CH2 in between.

Hmm. So the substituents on the benzene are probably an ester group and something else. But wait, wait—the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene. Let me think about the possible substituents.

If the ester is one substituent, what's the other? Let me think about the NMR signals. The vinyl protons and the methyl groups. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like maybe a methacrylate?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Or perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent, such as an acetyl group or something else.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If the aromatic ring has two substituents, and one is an ester group, the other could be another group like a methyl group. But wait, the NMR shows two methyl signals. Wait, maybe the ester is part of a larger substituent. For example, if the ester is O-CO-O-R, where R is a group with methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetylated vinyl group. Let me sketch this out.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2-CH2-CO-O-R? No, that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R attached to the benzene. But wait, let me think about the NMR signals.

In the NMR, there are two vinyl protons. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each vinyl H is coupled with another H. The doublet could be from a trans coupling, or perhaps from a H that's adjacent to another group. The doublet of quartets (doublet of quartets) is a bit tricky; perhaps each H is coupled with two different sets of H, leading to splitting. Alternatively, maybe each H is adjacent to two different coupling partners. For example, in a trans configuration across a double bond, each H would couple with one H on the adjacent carbon, but if there's more splitting, perhaps from another adjacent group.

Wait, another thought. If the substituent is an ethenyl (vinyl) group attached to an ester, like O-CO-O-R where R is an ethenyl group. But that may not fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, where the ester is attached to a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like O-CO-O-CH2-C=CH2. No, that might not give the right NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl vinyl group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a structure like this:

The benzene ring has two substituents. One is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R. The other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. For example, perhaps it's a styrene group (vinyl benzene), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and an ester. But then, the two methyl groups would come from where? Unless the ester has a methyl group. Let me clarify: the ester group is O-CO-O-R. R could be a methyl group (making it methyl ester). But then, the other substituent would be something else.

Wait, if the benzene is di-substituted with an ester and a methyl group, but then how do we get two methyl groups in the NMR signals?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group that's connected to a methyl. For example, let's imagine the structure is:

Ph-O-CO-O-(CH2) groups. Wait, but that may not explain the vinyl H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene where one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2-CH2-CO-O-R. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CO-O-R. Hmm, but then the NMR would have more signals.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again.

Aromatic: two signals. So maybe the two substituents on benzene are in para positions. So the aromatic Hs are in two equivalent positions, each giving a doublet because of coupling with adjacent Hs.

Vinyl-H: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That makes me think of a trans double bond, where each H is coupled with the other, giving a doublet. But why a doublet of quartets? Maybe each H is coupled with two different groups, such as another H on the same carbon and another from adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a substituent where the Hs are in a more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's count the total number of H signals. 6 signals, which seems manageable. Let's think about the possible structure.

If the benzene has two substituents—let's say one is an ester group (which would be O-CO-O-R), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. Wait, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and an allyl group. Wait, an allyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that's a single substituent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. Like, the benzene ring has an ester group where the R group is an allyl group. So, the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-C-O-... Wait, maybe it's a propenoate ester, where the ester is attached to a CH2=CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, and the ester is part of another substituent.

Wait, maybe the compound is a di-substituted benzene where one substituent is an ester group and the other is a methyl group. But then, the NMR shows two methyl signals, so perhaps there are two methyl groups somewhere else.

Wait, but the ester group itself could have a methyl group. For example, methyl propionate would have a methyl group in the ester. So, if the substituent is a methyl ester, that would give a methyl group in the NMR. But then, where is the other methyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group and the other is an ester group that has another methyl.

Wait, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The benzene ring has three degrees of unsaturation. The ester group has a double bond (C=O), contributing one degree. Any double bonds in substituents would add more.

The ester structure is O-CO-O-R. If R is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), that adds another degree. So, if the substituent R is a vinyl group, then another degree. So, total degrees of unsaturation for the molecule: benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5.

Wait, but the formula would be CnHmO2. Let's see the options.

The options are: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Each of these has a certain number of degrees of unsaturation. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2C + 2 - H)/2.

Let me compute for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees.

Option B: C12H14O2. (2*12 +2 -14)/2=(26-14)/2=12/2=6.

Option C: C12H12O2. (26 -12)/2=14/2=7.

Option D: C11H12O2. (24 -12)/2=12/2=6.

So the correct compound likely has 5 degrees of unsaturation because the benzene (3) plus ester (1) plus vinyl (1) would total 5. So the correct option would be option A (C11H14O2) which has 5 degrees, or option D (C11H12O2) which has 6.

Wait, but wait. Let's recount. Benzene ring (3), ester (1), and any other double bonds. If the substituent has a vinyl group (another double bond), that's a total of 5. So the correct degrees of unsaturation would be 5, so the formula must have 5 degrees. So looking at the options:

Option A: 5 degrees. Option D: 6 degrees.

So the formula should be C11H14O2, which is option A. But wait, let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't a vinyl group but a methyl group attached to an ester. Let me think.

Wait, if the substituents are an ester and a methyl group, the benzene has two substituents. The ester group would have O-CO-O-R. Let's say R is methyl, so the ester is methyl something. Then, the other substituent is a methyl group. So the structure would be di-substituted benzene with a methyl group and a methyl ester group.

But in that case, the NMR would show aromatic Hs (two signals if para), the methyl groups from ester and substituent. But the NMR shows two methyl signals. So perhaps the ester is ethyl, but then where are the two methyls?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group that is part of an ester. Like, the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another angle. The 1H NMR has two CH3 groups. So maybe the molecule has two separate methyl groups. For example, one methyl from an ester (like O-CO-O-Me) and another methyl attached elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group that includes a vinyl group. For instance, the substituent could be CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is a methyl group. So the substituent would be CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, that's a possibility. So benzene di-substituted with a methyl group and a vinyl ester group. Let me think about the structure: Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not a vinyl. Or maybe Ph-CH2-COO-R, but that's a single substituent.

Wait, perhaps the benzene has two substituents: one is a methyl group, and the other is an ester group with a vinyl substituent. For example, one substituent is a methyl group attached directly to the ring, and the other substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group, like Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that doesn't include a double bond. Alternatively, R could be CH2=CH-, making the substituent Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. So, the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-C=CH2.

In that case, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the vinyl protons would be on the CH2-C=CH2 part. Let's think about their NMR signals.

The vinyl Hs would be on the CH2 group next to the double bond. So for CH2-C=CH2, the two Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond. Each of those Hs would couple with the Hs on the double bond. Let me think: the Hs on the CH2 would be split into a quartet because each H is adjacent to two Hs on the double bond. Wait, no. The coupling across the double bond would be trans, so each H on the CH2 would couple with the Hs on the double bond. If the double bond is between the two CH groups, perhaps each CH2 H is coupled with both Hs on the adjacent double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that doesn't fit. Maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single substituent.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single substituent and doesn't explain the vinyl Hs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this differently. Let's consider the options and see which formula fits with the NMR.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2: molecular formula.

So degree of unsaturation is 5. Which would correspond to benzene (3), ester (1), and a double bond in substituent (1).

So the structure has a benzene ring, an ester group, and a substituent with a double bond.

Now, considering the NMR data:

Aromatic H: 2 signals. So para substitution, giving two equivalent H environments.

Vinyl H: 2 signals. So perhaps the substituent has two Hs, each in a different environment.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2.

No, that's not right. Alternatively, substituent is CH2-CH2 attached to ester, but that would not have a double bond.

Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- attached to the ester. So the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2, but that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-Ph. No, that's a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. So the ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, the other is a vinyl group.

So the structure is something like Ph-O-CO-O-R and Ph-CH2-CH2-. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester oxygen. Like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but again, not a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about how the substituents contribute to the NMR signals.

The aromatic Hs: para substitution gives two doublets. Each aromatic H would be next to two substituents, but if the substituents are symmetric, the Hs would be equivalent. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, making the Hs in two different environments.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group. So the benzene ring has a methyl group and an ester group attached. Then, the ester group would have an O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. So the formula would be Ph-O-CO-OCH3 and a methyl group. But that would give two methyl groups in the structure: one from the ester and one as a substituent. But wait, the NMR shows two methyl signals.

Wait, but in that case, the two methyl groups might be equivalent, giving only one signal. Unless they are in different environments. For example, if the substituents are para, then the methyl from the ester and the methyl substituent could be in different environments. But in that case, maybe they'd give two separate signals.

Wait, if the substituents are para, then each methyl would be in a different environment, giving two separate methyl signals. But wait, the ester methyl is part of the ester group, which is attached to the ring. So the ester methyl would be attached to an oxygen, whereas the other methyl is attached directly to the ring. Would their chemical shifts be different? Probably, yes. So that could explain two methyl signals.

So the structure would be a para-substituted benzene with a methyl group and a methyl ester group. So the substituents are CH3 and O-CO-O-CH3.

Wait, but then the substituents are CH3 and O-CO-OCH3. So the benzene ring is di-substituted with a methyl group and a methyl ester group.

But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. Oh, wait, in this case, the substituent is the ester, which is O-CO-OCH3. So where's the vinyl Hs coming from?

Ah, this is where I'm getting stuck. If the substituents are methyl and ester, then the NMR shouldn't have vinyl H signals. So perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

So perhaps the substituent isn't a methyl group but something else that has a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOCH3. So the ester is attached to a vinyl group. So the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not a double bond. Alternatively, the substituent is CH2=CH-COOCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the substituent would be an allyl group attached to the ester. So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-OCH3), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-).

Wait, but that would be two substituents on the benzene: an ester and a vinyl group, making the structure di-substituted. Then, the ester group's R would be a methyl group.

So the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-.

But then, the NMR would show the aromatic Hs, the vinyl Hs, and the methyls.

But wait, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but again, no double bond. Alternatively, substituent is Ph-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester, making the structure O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but again, no double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I'm not getting the right structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to the ester. Like, the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the NMR signals.

The aromatic Hs are two signals, so likely para substitution. Then, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, where R is a group with a vinyl group and two methyl groups.

Wait, the NMR has two methyl signals. So perhaps the R group in the ester is CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Then, the substituent would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the structure would be di-substituted benzene, with substituents being O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, that can't be because that would be a mono-substituted ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, perhaps it's Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I'm not seeing the double bond.

Alternatively, the substituent is a prop-1-enyl group attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I'm not getting the right structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the NMR shows two vinyl signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent.

Wait, for a vinyl group, the protons are typically split as a doublet because they're trans to each other. So one H is coupled with the other, giving a doublet. But in this case, one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests more coupling. Maybe each H is coupling with two different Hs, leading to quartet splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group, where the Hs are split by adjacent groups. But then, the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2, which doesn't involve a double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CH-CH2) attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but again, not seeing the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group attached to the ester oxygen. So the structure would be Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. So the substituent is a vinyl ketone ester? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, and the other is a methyl group. But that would complicate the NMR.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C11H14O2 and others.

Assuming the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group attached to something else.

If R is a methyl group, then the ester would contribute O-CO-OCH3. The other substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps CH2=CH2, but that's a single substituent.

But let's count the carbons.

Benzene is six C. Let's say one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (which is 3 O and 3 C: O, C, O, CH3). Wait, O-CO-OCH3 is (COOCH3) which is 3 C (the COO has two C, and the CH3 is one C). So from the ester group, that's 3 C.

The other substituent is a vinyl group, which is 2 C (CH2=CH-). So benzene (6) + ester (3) + vinyl (2) = 11 C. Oh, wait, but wait. Wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene, so the entire substituent would be, say, O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, that's not a double bond.

Wait, if the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, that's an ethyl ester, but that doesn't include any double bonds. So the vinyl must come from another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's an ethyl group and not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2. No, that’s not a double bond.

Alternatively, substituent is Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere. Maybe Ph-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 includes a double bond. Not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to try to determine the formula based on the data.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2: 5 degrees of unsaturation.

B) C12H14O2: 6.

C) C12H12O2:7.

D) C11H12O2:6.

The NMR shows two vinyl Hs, which is a double bond. So the structure must have a benzene ring (3), ester (1), and a double bond (1), totaling 5. So the formula must have 5 degrees, which is option A.

So the correct formula would be C11H14O2, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A is C11H14O2.

Yes, that would fit with 5 degrees of unsaturation, which matches the benzene, ester, and vinyl group.

So the answer should be option A.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum showing absorption for a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals suggest a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, resulting in two distinct environments for the aromatic protons.
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, indicate the presence of a vinyl group (C=C bond) with two protons in different environments.
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals for –CH3 groups, with no signals for –CH2 groups, suggesting the absence of methylene groups in the structure.

The molecular formula must account for the degrees of unsaturation. A benzene ring contributes 3 degrees of unsaturation, the ester group contributes 1, and the vinyl group contributes another, totaling 5 degrees. This matches the molecular formula **C11H14O2**, which has 5 degrees of unsaturation.

Analyzing the options:
- **C11H12O2 (Option D)** and **C12H12O2 (Option C)** have 6 and 7 degrees of unsaturation, respectively, which are inconsistent with the data.
- **C12H14O2 (Option B)** has 6 degrees of unsaturation, which also does not match.
- **C11H14O2 (Option A)** has 5 degrees of unsaturation, aligning with the benzene ring, ester group, and vinyl group.

Thus, the correct molecular formula is **C11H14O2**.

Answer: A
