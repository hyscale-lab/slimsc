Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and IR can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, aromatic ring is 6-membered, so adding two substituents. The total carbons are 8. Hmm, that's interesting because a benzene ring has 6 carbons. So adding two substituents, each must contribute some carbons. Let me think: 6 (ring) + substituents = 8. So substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. Oh wait, because it's di-substituted. So each substituent could be one carbon, but maybe one is more than that. Wait, maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? No, wait, di-substituted means two substituents, but each substituent could be adding more carbons.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is six carbons, so substituent carbons are 8-6=2. So each substituent must contribute 1 carbon each? No, because 2 substituents would add 2 carbons. So each substituent is a single carbon. Hmm, but what kind of substituents add a single carbon? Like a methyl group? But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group. Oh, right, carbonyl is like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, the FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group (like C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

So the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl, Br) and the other is a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or something else.

Wait, but substituent carbons: if one substituent is a carbonyl group, which is a single carbon (like a ketone would be a R-CO-R), but wait, if the substituent is a carbonyl, like a carbonyl group attached to the ring, that's one substituent. The other substituent is a halogen, which is one atom but doesn't add carbon. Wait, but the substituents contribute 2 carbons. Oh wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, which in itself is part of a larger group. Like maybe the carbonyl is part of a larger substituent.

Wait, let's think again. The aromatic ring is 6 carbons. The substituents add two more. So possible substituents are two groups, each adding one carbon. So for example, one substituent could be a -CH2-CO- group? No, that's more than one carbon. Hmm, maybe each substituent is a single carbon.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl, like a ketone, which would be a substituent like -CO-R, but R would be something. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring, like a -COCH3, but that would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3). Wait, so if the substituent is -COCH3, that's two carbons (the C from CO and the CH3). So if the molecule has a -COCH3 and a -X (halogen) substituent, that would add 2 + 0 = 2 carbons, bringing the total to 6 + 2 = 8.

Ah, that makes sense. So substituents are a -COCH3 (which is 2 carbons: the carbonyl and the methyl) and a -X (like Cl or Br, which doesn't add any carbons). Wait, but wait, the question says substituents are two. So the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is -COCH3, and the other is -X.

So the structure is a benzene ring with a -COCH3 group and a halogen (like Cl) attached. So that's di-substituted. Now, looking into the NMR spectrum.

The NMR options are A, B, C, D.

First, let's think about the aromatic region. The ring has two substituents. If the substituents are meta to each other, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. If they are para, it's different.

Wait, but wait: the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen. Let me think about the possible substitution patterns. Since we have two substituents, they could be para, meta, or ortho.

But wait, carbonyl groups (like ketones) are deactivating and meta-directing. Halogens are deactivating but ortho/para-directing. Hmm, but when two substituents are present, their directing effects can influence the substitution pattern. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, the exact positions aren't crucial, but the NMR splitting and integration is.

Let me think about the possible NMR signals.

The carbonyl group would be a ketone, perhaps as an acetyl group (-COCH3). The -COCH3 would have a methyl group attached to the carbonyl. The methyl protons would be a singlet, probably around 2.3 ppm as in option C, or maybe higher. Wait, in an acetyl group (like acetophenone), the CH3 is usually around 2.6 ppm. But let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The singlet at 2.3 ppm with 3H suggests a methyl group, like CH3CO-. So that aligns with the acetyl group.

The aromatic protons: in acetophenone, the aromatic protons are typically split into a doublet of doublets or something, but in di-substituted rings, the splitting depends on the substitution. Wait, in para-acetophenone with another substituent, perhaps the aromatic protons would be as two doublets.

Wait, let's think: if the substituents are para, then the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. For example, if one substituent is -COCH3 at position 1 and -X at position 4. Then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Let's say in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COCH3) and positions 3 and 5 (meta to COCH3). But wait, if the other substituent is a halogen in para position, maybe the protons are arranged as two doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are meta. Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, maybe looking at the NMR data would help.

In option C, the aromatic protons are at 7.8 and 7.6, each integrating to 2H, each a doublet. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two pairs of equivalent protons, each as a doublet. This could happen in a para-substituted ring with two substituents. For example, substituents in para positions, causing the neighboring protons to have specific coupling.

Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Each set is two protons, as a doublet. So the aromatic region would likely show two doublets each integrating to 2H. That matches option C, which has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d).

So the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each 2H, which is consistent with a para-substituted ring. So that fits.

Then the 2.3 ppm singlet is the methyl group from the acetyl.

But wait, another point: the IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituent is an aryl halide. So the substituent is, for example, -Cl or -Br attached to the ring.

So the molecule is para-haloacetophenone, perhaps. So, structure would be benzene ring with -COCH3 in position 1 and -X in position 4. Then the aromatic protons in positions 2, 6, 3, and 5 would be equivalent in pairs.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para position, then the ring protons would be in two sets, each a pair, each showing as a doublet.

So the NMR would show 2H as a doublet at around 7.6 ppm and another 2H as a doublet at 7.8 ppm. That's what option C shows. Also, the 2.3 ppm singlet is the methyl group.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: 9.9 ppm is a singlet, probably an aldehyde proton. But the IR has a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or aldehyde. If it's an aldehyde, then the substituent would be -CHO. But then the substituent -CHO would contribute one carbon. But earlier, we thought substituents contribute two carbons in total (COCH3 is two carbons, but CHO is one). Hmm, but if substituents are CHO and X, that would add one carbon (from CHO) and zero from X, total 1. So the molecule would have 6 + 1 =7 carbons, but the question says 8. So A can't be correct because it would only have 7 carbons. So A's aldehyde would imply 7 carbons, but the question says 8.

Option B: This option has a singlet at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, with 2H each. That looks like perhaps a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester group. For example, maybe a -OCH2CH2O- group, but that might not fit with the substituents. But considering that we need a carbonyl, perhaps an ester. But then the substituent would be an ester group, but that might add more carbons. Let me count: if substituents are -COOR and -X, then each substituent would contribute more than one carbon. For example, ethyl ester would add two carbons. So perhaps substituents would add more than two carbons. But the molecule only has 8 total carbons, so substituents add two. So if one substituent is -COOCH2CH3, that's four carbons (COO plus ethyl), which would make total 6 +4 + (X) = more than 8. So that's not possible. So option B might not fit. Also, the peaks in B are around 4.8 and 4.6, probably for a group like -OCH2CH2O-. But I don't see any protons that would match the aromatic signals in this option. So probably B is not the correct NMR.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 singlet suggests perhaps a proton in a symmetrical position, maybe a para-substituted ring. But the 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are similar to option B, so perhaps a di-substituted group with oxygen. The 1.3 ppm singlet suggests maybe a methyl group attached to something else, like an oxygen. But again, this doesn't seem to fit with the carbonyl and halogen substituents. Also, the aromatic region only has a singlet at 6.9, which would imply maybe only one proton. But the ring has two substituents, so that seems less likely unless the substituents are in positions that cause only one unique proton. But I'm not sure. Anyway, the aromatic region in D doesn't have four protons, which it should because it's a di-substituted ring, which would have four aromatic protons (if para) or maybe three (if meta or ortho). Wait, benzene has six protons. If di-substituted, the number of unique protons depends on the substitution. For para substitution, there are two sets of two equivalent protons each, so two doublets each integrating to 2H. So in the NMR, you'd see four aromatic protons, not one. So option D has a single peak at 6.9 ppm integrating to 1H, which doesn't fit. So D is probably not correct.

So back to option C. The aromatic protons are at 7.8 and 7.6, each 2H as doublets. That fits a para-substituted ring. The 2.3 ppm singlet is the methyl from the acetyl group. So the substituents are -COCH3 and -X (like Cl).

Wait, but wait, the FTIR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond. Halogens like Cl, Br have strong absorption in IR, but in aromatic compounds, the C-X stretch is around 600 cm^-1. So our substituents must include a Cl or Br.

So putting it all together, the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: -COCH3 and -Cl or -Br in para positions.

So the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, the methyl as a singlet, and no other protons unless the substituents have more.

Looking at option C, it has exactly that: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). So that seems to fit.

Wait, but let me confirm the number of carbons. The benzene is 6, substituents are -COCH3 (2 carbons) and -X (0 carbons), so 6 + 2 =8. So that matches the question.

So the correct NMR is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (C=O), and the other is a halogen (X). The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The total number of carbons in the molecule is 8, which means the substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. This suggests that the carbonyl group is part of an acetyl group (-COCH3), which contributes 2 carbons, while the halogen does not add any carbons.

The NMR spectrum must reflect the aromatic protons, the methyl group from the acetyl substituent, and no other protons. The aromatic region should show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The methyl group from the acetyl substituent should appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Contains a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which suggests an aldehyde proton. However, an aldehyde substituent would only contribute 1 carbon, resulting in a total of 7 carbons in the molecule, which contradicts the given total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are characteristic of a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen atom (e.g., -OCH2CH2O-). However, this does not align with the presence of a carbonyl group and a halogen substituent. Additionally, the aromatic protons are not accounted for properly. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Displays two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. This option matches the expected NMR pattern for the compound.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which suggests only one aromatic proton, inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring. Additionally, the peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest a methylene group, which does not fit the substituents described. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with a -COCH3 group and a halogen substituent.
