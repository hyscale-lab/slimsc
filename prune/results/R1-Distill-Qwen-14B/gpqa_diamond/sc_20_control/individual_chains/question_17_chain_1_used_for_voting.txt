Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Let me try to break this down.

Alright, the problem says that the solution has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex properly. The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, which I think is standard for such problems. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. 

So, what am I being asked here? The concentration of calcium ions. Right, because EDTA is a chelating agent, it binds with Ca²+ ions to form a complex. The complex is CaEDTA²−, I think. The thing is, the problem gives me the concentration of the complex, and I need to find the free Ca²+ concentration.

Wait, but wait. I remember that when a strong complex is formed, like with EDTA, the free ion concentration is really low. So the K is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K is given as 5e10, which is a large number, indicating that the complex is stable and most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. 

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. 

I think the dissociation of the complex would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this dissociation is 1/(K_caEDTA). Because K for formation is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So the dissociation K, Kd, would be 1/Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-].

Wait, but in this case, the problem gives KCa-EDTA as 5e10. I think that's the formation constant. So Kd, the dissociation constant, is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

But wait, the solution is at pH where EDTA is in the Y^4- form, right? Because EDTA has multiple protonated forms, but at the given pH, it's fully deprotonated. So [EDTA^4-] is present and in excess? Or is it that the EDTA is in solution in such a way that its concentration is known? Hmm, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So does that mean that [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M? Because I think the EDTA is in the complex form here.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

The dissociation of this complex would release some Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then the EDTA^4− concentration would also be x, assuming that each dissociation gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−. Because for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced. 

So the expression for Kd is [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA^2−] = x*x/(0.02 - x) = (x²)/(0.02 - x) = Kd = 2e-11.

Since Kd is very small (2e-11), x will be much smaller than 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the equation simplifies to x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait: 4e-13 is 4*10^-13. The square root of that is 2*10^-6.5? Wait, because sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. So x is about 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, let me recalculate. 

So x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 → 2e-11 * 2e-2 → multiply 2 and 2 gives 4, and 10^-11 *10^-2 is 10^-13. So x²=4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5. What's 2e-6.5? Let's compute that. 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-6.5 is sqrt(1e-6 * 1e-7) = sqrt(1e-13) = 1e-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is ~6.32e-7. 

Wait, but wait: 2e-6.5 is 2 multiplied by 10^(-6.5). Let me compute 10^(-6.5): that's 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-7. So 2 * 3.162e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7. So x ≈6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the Kd is 2e-11. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, x is small so the denominator is approximated as 0.02. Therefore, Kd ≈ (x^2)/0.02 = 2e-11 → x^2=4e-13 → x=2e-6.5= ~6.3e-7. That matches option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}}
\]

Given \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M, so:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions be \( x \). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x \), \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \), and \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since \( x \) is small compared to 0.02 M):

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Approximating \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \):

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Wait, let me recalculate. 

So x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 → 2e-11 * 2e-2 → multiply 2 and 2 gives 4, and 10^-11 *10^-2 is 10^-13. So x²=4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5. What's 2e-6.5? Let's compute that. 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-6.5 is sqrt(1e-6 * 1e-7) = sqrt(1e-13) = 1e-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is ~6.32e-7.

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}}
\]

Given \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M, so:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions be \( x \). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x \), \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \), and \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since \( x \) is small compared to 0.02 M):

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Approximating \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \):

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
