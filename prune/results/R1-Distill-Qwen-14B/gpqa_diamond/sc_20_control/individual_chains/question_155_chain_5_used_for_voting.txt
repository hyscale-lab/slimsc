Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of the operator Px, with an eigenvalue of -ħ. The given state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And I need to find the uncertainty ΔPz, which is the standard deviation of Pz for this state.

Wait, the uncertainty formula is the square root of <Pz²> minus <Pz> squared. Right, so I need to compute the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared.

But wait, since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, the state given is expressed in the Pz basis. Oh, that's important. Because the state is already in the eigenbasis of Pz, the expectation value of Pz should just be the eigenvalue corresponding to that state in the basis.

Wait, let me think again. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which means each basis vector |n> is an eigenstate of Pz with eigenvalue, say, p_n. So, if the state is expressed as a linear combination of these |n>, then the expectation value <Pz> is the weighted sum of their eigenvalues, weighted by the square of the coefficients.

Wait, no, more accurately, the state is written as a column vector in the Pz basis. So each component of the vector corresponds to the amplitude of each Pz eigenstate in that basis.

So the state is |ψ> = a|1> + b|2> + c|3>, where |1>, |2>, |3> are the eigenvectors of Pz, each with eigenvalues P_z^{(1)}, P_z^{(2)}, P_z^{(3)}.

Wait, looking at the matrix for Pz: It's a diagonal matrix with elements (ħ, 0, -ħ) on the diagonal. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the basis vectors are |1> (eigenvalue ħ), |2> (eigenvalue 0), |3> (eigenvalue -ħ).

The given state is the column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So the state is (-1/2)|1> + (1/√2)|2> + (-1/2)|3>.

So the expectation value <Pz> would be sum over each component: |a|^2 * pz1 + |b|^2 * pz2 + |c|^2 * pz3.

Let's compute that. The coefficients are a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c= -1/2.

So |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly |b|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. |c|² is also 1/4.

So, <Pz> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 ħ) - (1/4 ħ) ) = 0. Oh, interesting.

Wait, but I'm not done yet. I need to find ΔPz, which is the square root of <Pz²> - (<Pz>)^2. Since <Pz> is zero, this simplifies to sqrt(<Pz²>).

So what's <Pz²>? Well, since Pz is diagonal in this basis, Pz^2 is the square of each eigenvalue. So for each basis vector, the square of their eigenvalue is (ħ)^2, 0^2, and (-ħ)^2. So each is ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation <Pz²> is |a|^2*(ħ²) + |b|^2*(0) + |c|^2*(ħ²) = (1/4)ħ² + 0 + (1/4)ħ² = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So <Pz²> is (ħ²)/2. Then ΔPz is sqrt( (ħ²/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2). Wait, but let me think again. Because Pz in this basis is diagonal, so its square is also diagonal with each entry squared. So yeah, that looks right.

Alternatively, I could compute <Pz²> directly using the matrix. But since Pz is diagonal, it's easier. So yeah, the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. The state is given as being an eigenstate of Px, but for the uncertainty calculation, since the basis is Pz's eigenbasis, everything is straightforward. Yeah, I think that's right.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with the given column vector $| \psi \rangle = (-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$ in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the basis states $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state is expressed as:
\[
| \psi \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} |1\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |2\rangle - \frac{1}{2} |3\rangle.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]
where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. The probabilities are:
\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Substituting these values:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Thus:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
