Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

So, the compound X has some IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I should probably figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectroscopic data.

The IR data is given as: 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch (like in carboxylic acids or alcohols) or maybe a C-H stretch, like in alkenes or maybe an amine. But 3400-2500 is a broad range, so maybe an O-H group. Or perhaps it's a C-H stretch from an alkyne or something else. Wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. So maybe a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H around 2500-3300. So with the 1720, maybe it's a ketone. Hmm, but there's also a 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which could be C=C stretching, like in an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data: The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is a broad singlet. That's probably an O-H proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols O-H protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, but in more acidic conditions like a carboxylic acid, they are around 10-12. So that peak at 10.5 is likely a carboxylic acid proton.

Then, there's a 8.0 ppm doublet integrating to 2H. The aromatic region. So perhaps two protons adjacent to substituents. Similarly, 7.2 ppm doublet for 2H. That rings a bell. It looks like a para-substituted benzene ring, maybe. Because in para substitution, the protons are split into two doublets. For example, in p-xylene, the protons are two doublets each integrating to 2H, at around 7.2 and 8 ppm. Wait, but here the downfield is 8, and the upfield is 7.2. Wait, that's a bit unusual. Usually, the more substituted (more deshielded) protons are downfield, so maybe the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, which would cause the ring protons to be downfield.

Wait, but if the substituent is a carboxylic acid group, which is electron-withdrawing, then the adjacent protons would be more deshielded. So for benzene with a substituent in the para position, the substituent could be a COOH group. But let me think: if the ring is para-substituted with a COOH group, then the protons ortho and para to it would be in a certain environment.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have two doublets: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That's typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents, but wait, wait. Wait, if the substituent is in the para position, then the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in p-methylbenzaldehyde, you would have two doublets. So for a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that causes the adjacent protons to be split into two doublets, maybe it's a substituent that's electron-withdrawing. So with the 10.5 ppm peak, which is a carboxylic acid, the substituent is a COOH group. So the structure is probably para-substituted benzoic acid.

But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1. So that fits. Also, the broad O-H stretch in IR around 3400–2500 cm-1 would correspond to the carboxylic acid.

So if the substituent is a COOH group, then the ring should have that. So the structure is something like 4-carboxyphenyl, but wait, maybe it's attached to a longer chain.

Looking at the other NMR data:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – a multiplet, perhaps from a CH that's next to an electronegative group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – maybe a CH2 group next to a CH or another group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a triplet of protons, perhaps a CH(CH3) group, like a branch.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal CH3, probably from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: Let's imagine the structure. There's a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position, which is a carboxylic acid group. But then, perhaps attached to the ring is another chain. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone, but the NMR doesn't show a carbonyl proton.

Wait, the IR has 1720, which is a carbonyl. The NMR doesn’t have a carbonyl proton because it's a ketone or ester or acid. But the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is more like a carboxylic acid than a ketone.

So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent that's an alkyl chain attached. So the benzene has a COOH in the para position and another group, perhaps an ethyl or isobutyl group.

Wait, the NMR has an ethyl group: the 0.9 ppm triplet (probably a CH2CH3), the 1.7 ppm multiplet (maybe a CH2), and the 2.9 ppm multiplet (maybe a CH connected to something else).

So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a COOH group and another group that's an isobutyl or similar.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is a COOR group, but the IR doesn't show a strong O-H stretch for an alcohol like that. Wait, but the IR shows a very broad peak around 3400-2500, which could be from an -OH, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that's consistent.

Let me try to sketch this.

Benzene ring: para substituents. One substituent is a COOH group. The other is perhaps an isobutyl group? Wait, but then how would the substituents be arranged in para.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl chain with a branch.

Looking at the H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: COOH proton.

- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: aromatic protons, para substitution.

The other peaks: 2.9 (m,1H) could be a CH group attached to something else, like a CH2 or another CH.

1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 connected to another CH.

1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group, because the triplet or doublet is from a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, putting that together: The substituent on the benzene could be a propyl group with branching. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. If the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 or similar.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3 group. Then the 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be a CH2 connected to the CH, and the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) is the CH between the two CH2 groups.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, another approach: the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is attached to another CH2 group.

Hmm. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the NMR peak at 2.9 is a multiplet integrating to 1H, which would be a CH group. The 1.7 is a multiplet of 2H, perhaps a CH2 next to the CH. The 1.4 is a doublet of 3H, which is a CH3 attached to a CH. And the 0.9 is a triplet of 3H, maybe a CH2CH3.

So putting that together, perhaps it's a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. But how is this connected to the benzene?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a triplet that would correspond to the branching.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a secondary carbon. Let's think: the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)- group, but perhaps with more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. But that would make the structure more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, let me think about the integration. The 1H NMR:

- 10.5: 1H (COOH)

- 8.0: 2H (aromatic)

- 7.2: 2H (aromatic)

- 2.9: 1H (CH)

- 1.7: 2H (CH2)

- 1.4: 3H (CH3)

- 0.9: 3H (CH2CH3)

Wait, that adds up to 1+2+2+1+2+3+3=12, but the molecular formula isn't given. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Another approach: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene. So the benzene has a substituent like CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, because the COOH is also a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2 group with a branch.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the benzene has a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH. Doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Like, a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring.

So the substituent would be -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but perhaps the substituent is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, but then the NMR would show a triplet for the CH3 groups, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, considering the substituent as an isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, structure would be something like:

Benzene ring with a substituent in the para position: one substituent is COOH, the other is isobutyl.

But wait, the IR and NMR data would then have a benzene ring with a COOH group and an isobutyl group. Let me try to look at the possible options.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, what's sec-butyl? That's (CH2)2CHCH3 attached to the benzene. Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- ? Wait, no, butyl groups can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait. Let me think: Butyl is four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to benzene? No, wait, perhaps it's:

The structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that can't be. Wait, let me think again. The butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (but that's 2-methylpropyl, which is the same as iso-butyl)

- sec-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2- ? Wait, no. Wait, butyl groups are named based on the position of the substituent. The 'sec' means the substituent is on the second carbon. So, for a butyl group, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the substitution is on the second carbon. So, the substituent is a four-carbon chain attached to the benzene, with the point of attachment on the second carbon.

So, the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but attached via the second carbon. So perhaps it's more accurately:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR shows:

Protons at 2.9 (CH), 1.7 (CH2), 1.4 (CH3), 0.9 (CH2CH3).

So, maybe the substituent is a propyl chain with a branch. Perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, but that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. So when you have the substituent on benzene as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But wait, where would the methyl group (1.4 ppm, d) come from? If it's a CH(CH3), then the adjacent CH would split into a doublet.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a pentyl group, but with branching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So the substituent on the benzene is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But how does that fit the NMR?

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) would be the terminal CH3 of a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps a structure like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be a pentyl group, but perhaps attached as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. So that's a butyl group with a branch. Wait, that would be a tertiary butyl group? No, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. Compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. That's a typical reaction for the substitution of a hydroxyl group. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, in the presence of a carboxylic acid, that might not work because the acid would be deprotonated. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI could be used to do a substitution reaction, like removing a leaving group.

Wait, but in this case, the initial structure has a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but another kind of substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a Barton reaction, but that's more for ketones.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is used for the substitution of an alcohol to an alkyl iodide. For example, an alcohol (R-OH) reacts with P and HI to form R-I. But in this case, the starting material has a carboxylic acid, so maybe it's an ester or something else.

Wait, but if the starting material is a benzoic acid, then perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction could be a reduction. Wait, if the starting material has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester), the Clemmensen reduction would reduce it to an alkane.

Wait, but in the IR, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, which could be a ketone, but the NMR doesn't show a carbonyl proton. So perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR does have a broad peak at 10.5, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps it's a benzoyl group with another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a substituted benzaldehyde with a methyl or ethyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let me consider the NMR peaks again.

The 10.5 ppm (1H, broad) is the COOH proton.

The aromatic protons are two doublets, 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests a para-substituted benzene.

The other peaks: 2.9 (m, 1H) – perhaps a CH group attached to something else.

1.7 (m, 2H) – a CH2 group.

1.4 (d, 3H) – a CH3 attached to a CH.

0.9 (t, 3H) – a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the benzene. So the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So the structure would be benzene with a COOH group and a -(CH(CH3)CH2CH2)- group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it a iso-butyl group.

Wait, iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)2. Then, the NMR would show the following:

The iso-butyl group has a CH(CH3)2 group. So the protons on the CH2 groups would show up as a triplet and a septet, but in this data, I don't see that. Wait, but in the given NMR data, the peaks are 0.9 (t), 1.4 (d), 1.7 (m), and 2.9 (m). Hmm.

Wait, in an iso-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the protons on the CH2 would be next to the branching. The CH2 group would split into a triplet because of the neighboring CH(CH3)2. The CH(CH3)2 would have a septet for the CH2 protons, but in the data, I don't see that.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 2-propyl group, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, let's look at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me think about that structure.

sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, no. sec-butyl is the substituent on the second carbon of a butyl chain. So the structure would be CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- ?

No, wait, butyl groups: the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain.

So, the substituent would be: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, that's not correct. The correct structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no. Let me think of the butyl groups.

1. n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH2-

2. iso-butyl: -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-

3. sec-butyl: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again.

Butyl groups:

- The four carbons are in a chain.

- For sec-butyl, the point of attachment is on the second carbon.

So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no. Wait, let me imagine butane: CH3CH2CH2CH2-. For the sec-butyl group, the substituent is on the second carbon.

So, it would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene.

But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a three-carbon chain with the substituent on the middle carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, for 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the para position of the benzoic acid.

So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid (COOH) in position 4, and a sec-butyl group (which is a four-carbon chain attached via the second carbon) in position 1. So the benzene has two substituents: COOH and sec-butyl, para to each other.

Looking at the NMR, the sec-butyl group would have specific peaks.

The substituent would be: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene.

So the protons in this substituent would be:

- The terminal CH3 (from the CH(CH3)) would give a triplet, because it's attached to a CH group which is next to another CH2.

Wait, no. Let me break it down:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

So, the structure is:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, that's three carbons attached. So:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would make it a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as having a branching point. The substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look at the options and see which structure matches the NMR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring at position 4. The benzoic acid is at position 1.

The structure of sec-butyl is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The substituent is a four-carbon chain attached to the benzene via the second carbon.

So, it would be:

Benzene - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2.

Wait, but that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it isobutyl. Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this, but perhaps I should proceed.

So, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the NMR would show peaks for the CH2 groups and the CH group.

The substituent would be:

Benzene ring - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2.

So the protons in the substituent would be:

- The CH2 group next to the benzene: let's say these are a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH(CH3) group.

- The CH(CH3) group: the CH would split into a multiplet, perhaps a septet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which is a CH2CH3 group.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, -(CH2)2CH(CH3).

So the substituent would be:

Benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3).

In this case, the CH(CH3) would have a CH3 group attached, causing the 1.4 ppm doublet.

The terminal CH3 would be a triplet (due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group), which is the 0.9 ppm peak.

The CH2 groups would be split into different multiplicities. For example, the CH2 next to the benzene (CH2-CH2-) would be a quartet, and the CH2 next to the CH(CH3) would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the given data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could be the CH group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group, and the 0.9 ppm (3H) a CH2CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. But I'm not sure.

Another possibility is that the substituent is a 3-pentyl group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2CH3 group (the terminal CH3), and a multiplet for the CH(CH3)2 group.

But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would correspond to the CH3 attached to the CH group in isobutyl. The 0.9 ppm (t) would be the CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2, so the CH(CH3)2 would have three equivalent CH3 groups. So, the protons on the CH2 next to the benzene would be a quartet (coupled with the CH(CH3)2), and the CH(CH3)2 would show as a septet (because each H on CH2 is coupled with six H on the adjacent CH(CH3)2).

But in the given data, the peaks don't show a septet. So perhaps this is not the correct substituent.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. What kind of reaction is that?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the substitution reaction where an -OH group is replaced by an -I. For example, in the case of an alcohol, it would convert R-OH to R-I. But if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's not applicable unless the acid is in a specific form.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is an ester, then it could undergo some kind of substitution. But in that case, the IR would show an ester carbonyl, which is around 1730-1750 cm-1. Our IR is 1720, which is a bit lower, more like a carboxylic acid or a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another reaction: the acid could undergo some kind of elimination or substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. If the starting material has a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then red phosphorus and HI might not reduce it. But the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, not HI. Another possibility is the use of LiAlH4, but that's a stronger reducing agent.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution, converting a leaving group into an iodide. For example, if the starting material has a good leaving group like a tosylate or mesylate, it would substitute with HI. But without knowing the starting structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a hydroxyl group that's a good leaving group, like in a tosylate, which would react with HI to form an iodide.

But I'm not sure. Let me get back to the structure of Compound X.

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm: COOH.

- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: aromatic, para substitution.

- 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H): suggests a chain of CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, that would be a structure like CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. So, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3) attached to the benzene.

But how does that fit into the given options?

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

sec-butyl is a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure would be:

CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3).

So, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch at the end.

In this case, the substituent would be -(CH2)2CH(CH3).

So, the protons would be:

- The CH(CH3) would have a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d).

- The adjacent CH2 would be next to the benzene, perhaps as a triplet (0.9 ppm, t) due to the CH2CH3.

Wait, but the substituent would be -(CH2)2CH(CH3), so the substituent has three carbons, making it a propyl group with a branch.

Putting it all together, the structure would be:

Benzoic acid (COOH) in the para position, and a substituent -(CH2)2CH(CH3) in the para position.

Wait, but then the substituent would have a total of four carbons, making it a butyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2CH3 group (0.9 ppm, t), and the CH(CH3)2 would have a septet, but I don't see a septet in the data.

Wait, perhaps the NMR peaks correspond to a iso-butyl group. Let me think:

In iso-butyl, the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2.

The protons on the CH2 group would be a triplet, because they are next to a CH(CH3)2 group with two protons (but wait, no, the CH(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups, so 6 protons). So the CH2 group would be split into a septet (n+1, where n=6). But in the given data, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which would fit the CH2CH3 group. However, I don't see a septet in the data, so perhaps this isn't the case.

This is getting quite complicated. Let me summarize what I have:

- Benzene ring with a COOH group (para substitution).

- Another substituent that has a chain of some sort, with a branch.

- The substituent's protons are split into 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H).

Putting all together, the substituent is probably a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-.

But that would make the substituent a four-carbon chain, which would be a butyl group.

Hmm. Another way: perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a iso-pentyl group or something similar.

But given the options, perhaps the correct structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, considering the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to replace an -OH group with an -I. So, if the starting material is a hydroxyl group, it would form an iodide. But if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, which is -COOH, perhaps it's not directly applicable.

Wait, another possibility: the carboxylic acid could be converted into an acid chloride, which then could undergo substitution with HI to form an iodide. But the reaction conditions don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but another kind of reaction. Maybe the acid is decarboxylated or something else.

Wait, another thought: if the substituent on the benzene has a good leaving group, perhaps a tosyl group, then HI could substitute it. But I don't have evidence of that in the given data.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is causing the elimination of the COOH group. But in that case, what would be formed?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on an adjacent group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting a carbonyl group into something else. For example, a ketone could be reduced to a CH2 group. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, the initial structure has a carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and a COOH group. So perhaps the reaction would reduce the carbonyl group to a CH2 group, turning the ketone into an alkane.

But then, if the starting material is a benzoyl group with a substituent that's a ketone, the reaction would reduce it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a ketone or something else.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

If the reaction replaces the COOH group's -OH with -I, but COOH isn't a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the substituent.

Wait, another angle: the reaction is a substitution on the substituent group. If the substituent has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, then HI would substitute it to form an iodide.

But in this case, the substituent is an alkyl chain without a leaving group. So perhaps the reaction isn't about substitution on the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group. The 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl, which could be a ketone. So, if the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction, the ketone would be reduced to an alkane.

But the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, not red phosphorus and HI. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a hydrolysis or something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a leaving group. But I don't see a leaving group in the initial structure.

Another possibility: the starting material is an ester, which would have a carbonyl group. The ester could undergo hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions, but with red phosphorus and HI, that's more of a substitution.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction is a substitution of the COOH group's -OH, perhaps converting it to a carboxylic iodide. But carboxylic acids aren't typically substituted with HI under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I don't know.

Wait, another thought: the reaction might be a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's typically under strong conditions and requires a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the aromatic ring, but that's unlikely with red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction isn't directly about the substituent but about another group in the molecule.

Wait, maybe the substituent has a good leaving group, like a bromide or something else. But in the given data, the substituent is an alkyl group without any halide.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COOCH2CH3 group, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COOH group, but that would change the aromatic substitution pattern.

I think I'm stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would probably substitute the -OH of the COOH group with -I, forming a benzoic acid iodide. But I'm not sure if that's a common reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is causing the elimination of CO2, but that's more about decarboxylation, which usually requires heat or other conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into benzyl iodide via some mechanism, but that would require a benzyl position.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a benzyl group, and the reaction is converting the hydroxyl to iodide. But in this case, the substituent is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent's end. So, if the substituent has a good leaving group like a tosylate, the HI would substitute it to form an iodide.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)COOH, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, I'm going to try to think about the possible product.

If the reaction is substituting an -OH with -I, then the product would have an -I group. But the options don't show an iodide; they're all hydrocarbons.

Wait, no, the options are A) propanoic acid, B) isobutylbenzene, C) benzoic acid with a substituent, D) another isobutylbenzene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is removing the COOH group and adding an iodide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, converting the benzoic acid into benzyl iodide.

Wait, but that would require a different starting material.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent's end. For example, if the substituent is an ethyl group, the reaction could convert the OH (if present) into iodide. But in this case, the substituent is an alkyl chain without any OH group.

Hmm. I'm stuck, so perhaps I should look for other clues.

The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So the starting material has a carbonyl group. The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which is a COOH group. So the starting material is a benzoic acid with a substituent.

After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the carbonyl group is reduced to CH2 group. For example, a ketone would be reduced to CH2 group. But if the starting material is a benzoic acid (which has a COOH group), another carbonyl might be a ketone substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a ketone group. For example, the substituent is a propyl group with a ketone.

If the substituent is a ketone, like -(CH2)2CO, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group.

So, for example, if the substituent is a -(CH2)2CO group, the reduction would convert it to -(CH2)3 group.

But the NMR doesn't show a carbonyl proton, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a benzophenone derivative with a substituent. The reaction reduces the ketone to an alkane.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, where a leaving group is replaced by iodide. But without knowing the leaving group, it's difficult.

In the end, perhaps the correct structure is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction replaces the COOH group's -OH with iodide, but the options don't show that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, converting the COOH group into CH2OH, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't affecting the COOH group but the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a ketone, the reaction would reduce it to a CH2 group.

But looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. So after the reaction, perhaps the substituent is converted into something else.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) attached to the benzene, and the reaction reduces it to a CH2 group, making the substituent a methyl group.

Wait, but the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is typically used for the substitution of alcohols to iodides. If the starting material has an alcohol group, it would become an iodide. But the starting material has a carboxylic acid, so unless there's another alcohol, perhaps the substituent has an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl alcohol group, which would react with HI and P to form a benzyl iodide.

But the NMR data doesn't show a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, which would be for an alcohol; instead, the broad peak is at 10.5, which suggests a COOH.

Hmm.

Another angle: perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with an internal hydroxyl group, which would then react to form an iodide. But the NMR doesn't show a peak in the range of an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(OH)CH2 group. But again, without evidence in the NMR, it's hard to say.

In the end, without a clear picture of the reaction, perhaps the best approach is to identify the starting material and then see what the reaction would do.

The starting material is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that has a chain with a methyl branch and an ethyl group. The substituent is likely an iso-butyl group.

After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the substituent's alcohol group (if any) is substituted with iodide. But the starting material doesn't seem to have an alcohol.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a tosyl group, which would react with HI to form an iodide. But the starting material's NMR doesn't show a tosyl group.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the NMR data, the substituent likely has a branching with a CH(CH3) group, an ethyl group, and a propyl chain.

Given the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When reacted with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction isn't affecting the substituent but the COOH group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group (if it's a ketone) to an alkane, but the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the substituent, converting a leaving group to iodide.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction involving Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data:

- **IR Data**: 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely O-H stretch), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl stretch), 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (C=C aromatic stretching).
- **NMR Data**:
  - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet, consistent with a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
  - 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
  - 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Multiplet, likely from a CH group.
  - 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group.
  - 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): Doublet, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
  - 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): Triplet, likely from a terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

### Analysis of Compound X
1. **IR Data**: The broad O-H stretch at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of an aromatic ring.
2. **NMR Data**:
   - The aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - The 10.5 ppm peak confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid proton.
   - The peaks at 2.9 ppm (1H), 1.7 ppm (2H), 1.4 ppm (3H), and 0.9 ppm (3H) suggest a branched alkyl chain attached to the benzene ring. Specifically, the 1.4 ppm doublet and 0.9 ppm triplet indicate a CH₃ group attached to a CH, which is part of a larger chain.

From the data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure consists of a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-) attached to the ring.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are typically used for nucleophilic substitution, where a hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by an iodide (-I). However, in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid, which does not directly participate in such a reaction. Instead, the reaction likely targets the substituent on the benzene ring. If the substituent contains a good leaving group or undergoes a substitution reaction, it would form an iodide. However, the options provided do not include an iodinated product, suggesting the reaction may not proceed as expected or may involve a different mechanism.

### Evaluation of Options
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the sec-butyl group indicated by the branching in the NMR signals.
   
2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure is inconsistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the IR and NMR data.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This matches the NMR and IR data. The para-substituted benzene ring, the carboxylic acid group, and the sec-butyl substituent are all consistent with the spectroscopic data.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure is inconsistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion
Based on the spectroscopic data and the reaction conditions, the most likely structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not alter the structure significantly, as the options do not include an iodinated product. Therefore, the correct answer remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
