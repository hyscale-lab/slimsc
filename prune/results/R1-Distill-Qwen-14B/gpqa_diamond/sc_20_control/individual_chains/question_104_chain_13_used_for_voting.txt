Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, right? So the star moves a little bit back and forth as the planet orbits it.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, each hosting a planet with similar mass to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data here are the periodic shifts in their spectral lines: planet 1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet 2 causes 7. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, right? The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude (K) relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P) * (2π) )^(1/3) ) )

But wait, since the planet masses are similar to Neptune and the stars are sun-like, M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So maybe we can ignore the planet's mass in comparison. So K is approximately proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but the question gives the same M_star for both stars. So for each star, M_star is the same, and M_planet is similar for both. So, since K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 and K2 are the velocities of the two stars. The problem gives the shifts in wavelength, which are proportional to velocity, right? Because the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to velocity (since v ≈ c * (Δλ/λ) when v is small compared to c).

Wait, but wait. The Doppler shift depends on the velocity and the wavelength. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) is given by Δλ = (v / c) * λ, so the velocity is proportional to Δλ. So if planet 1 gives a shift of 5 milliangstroms and planet 2 gives 7, then their velocities (K) are 5 and 7 respectively.

But wait, perhaps the shift is given as 5 and 7 in the same units, so the velocities are in the same ratio. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because K = ( (G M_p )/( (M_* )^(1/3) P^(1/3) )) )^(1/3) ) / something, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think more carefully.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3)

Wait, no, maybe I should recall the correct formula. Oh right, the correct formula is K = ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the formula simplifies.

But regardless, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^(2/3)) ) / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²)) )

Since the eccentricity e is probably small (since the orbits are circular), we can ignore that term. So, K ∝ M_p / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, both planets have similar M_p (Neptune mass), and the stars have same M_*, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K = constant / P^(1/3)

So if K1 is the velocity for planet 1, and K2 is for planet 2.

Given that, K1 = 5 (say in some unit), K2 =7.

So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Then, cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Calculate 5/7 is approximately 0.7143. Cube that: 0.7143^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1. So the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.364 times that of planet 1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than that of planet 1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So that would be (P2)/(P1) = 0.364 times. So it's about 0.36 times longer, but wait, no. Wait, 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet 2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so the orbital period of planet 2 is 0.36 times that of planet 1. So it's shorter.

Wait no, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So it's shorter. So planet 2's orbital period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = 5, K2 =7. So K1 < K2. Since K is higher when the star moves more, that implies the period is shorter. Because a higher K would mean a more massive planet, but in this case, planet masses are same, so higher K implies shorter period.

Wait, another approach. The RV velocity semi-amplitude K depends on (M_p / (M_*)) * (1/P)^(1/3), roughly. Wait, I might be getting mixed up here.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the orbital period. The RV method relates the velocity of the star to the planet's orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e^2)) )

But again, since M_p is much less than M_*, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_*^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e^2) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to recall that the RV velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 = approx 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but another thought: the problem states that the spectral line shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Does that imply that K1 is 5 and K2 is 7? Because the shift is proportional to velocity. So yes, their K values are in the ratio 5:7.

So the calculation is correct, the answer should be option A, approximately 0.36.

The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for a given planet-star system. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

In this problem, two planets with similar masses (Neptune-like) orbit stars of the same mass. The RV shifts for the two planets are given as 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 \)) and 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 \)). Since the RV shift is proportional to the velocity semi-amplitude, the ratio of the velocities is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Using the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the orbital periods can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1.

But wait, since the planet masses are similar to Neptune and the stars are sun-like, M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So maybe we can ignore the planet's mass in comparison. So K is approximately proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but the question gives the same M_star for both stars. So for each star, M_star is the same, and M_planet is similar for both. So, since K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 and K2 are the velocities of the two stars. The problem gives the shifts in wavelength, which are proportional to velocity, right? Because the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to velocity (since v ≈ c * (Δλ/λ) when v is small compared to c).

But wait, perhaps the shift is given as 5 and 7 in the same units, so the velocities are in the same ratio. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3)

Wait, no, maybe I should recall the correct formula. Oh right, the correct formula is K = ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the formula simplifies.

But regardless, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^(2/3)) ) / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²)) )

Since the eccentricity e is probably small (since the orbits are circular), we can ignore that term. So, K ∝ M_p / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, both planets have similar M_p (Neptune mass), and the stars have same M_*, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K = constant / P^(1/3)

So if K1 is the velocity for planet 1, and K2 is for planet 2.

Given that, K1 = 5 (say in some unit), K2 =7.

So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Then, cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Calculate 5/7 is approximately 0.7143. Cube that: 0.7143^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1. So the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.364 times that of planet 1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than that of planet 1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So that would be (P2)/(P1) = 0.364 times. So it's about 0.36 times longer, but wait, no. Wait, 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet 2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so the orbital period of planet 2 is 0.36 times that of planet 1. So it's shorter.

Wait no, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So it's shorter. So planet 2's orbital period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = 5, K2 =7. So K1 < K2. Since K is higher when the star moves more, that implies the period is shorter. Because a higher K would mean a more massive planet, but in this case, planet masses are same, so higher K implies shorter period.

Wait, another approach. The RV velocity semi-amplitude K depends on (M_p / (M_*)) * (1/P)^(1/3), roughly. Wait, I might be getting mixed up here.

But again, since M_p is much less than M_*, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_*^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e^2) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to recall that the RV velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 = approx 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but another thought: the problem states that the spectral line shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Does that imply that K1 is 5 and K2 is 7? Because the shift is proportional to velocity. So yes, their K values are in the ratio 5:7.

So the calculation is correct, the answer should be option A, approximately 0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for a given planet-star system. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

In this problem, two planets with similar masses (Neptune-like) orbit stars of the same mass. The RV shifts for the two planets are given as 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 \)) and 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 \)). Since the RV shift is proportional to the velocity semi-amplitude, the ratio of the velocities is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Using the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the orbital periods can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1.
