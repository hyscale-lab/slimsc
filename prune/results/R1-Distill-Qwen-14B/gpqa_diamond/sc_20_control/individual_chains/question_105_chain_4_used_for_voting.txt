Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The astronomers are observing it, and due to these spots, the star's brightness varies periodically as it rotates. The problem says this star's situation can look similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing dips in brightness. But the question is asking: what would be the radius of an exoplanet (Rpl) relative to the star's radius (Rstar) to cause the same brightness variation amplitude? So they want Rpl/Rstar.

Alright, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is given by the formula (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So if the planet's radius is a certain fraction of the star's, that's the factor you square to get the depth of the dip.

But wait, in this case, the star isn't just a single spot but has a hemisphere covered with dark spots. Hmm, so what's the effect of that on the observed brightness?

The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I think, because they are dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots have a temperature of 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K, or maybe 6000 + 1000? Wait, no, dark spots usually are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So spot temperature is 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere is spots. Wait, the star's hemisphere is the area we're looking at. So the total area covered by spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. Let's denote Rstar = R_sun, so Rpl is what we're solving for.

So the star's brightness variation would come from two things: the spots being cooler, and the fact that when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into and out of view. Wait, but in this case, the star is observed with one hemisphere spotty and the other not. So when the star rotates, the spots would come into the observed hemisphere and then go back. So the brightness variation would be due to these spots changing the overall flux received.

But how does this translate into a brightness variation? Hmm. Let me think. The star's total flux without any spots would be based on its entire surface. But when spots are present, the flux is lower because the spots emit less.

In the case of a planet transiting, the dip is straightforward: the planet blocks a part of the star's light, so the observed flux drops by (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But for the star with spots, the brightness variation is a bit different. Since the star is rotating, the spots come into view over time. The maximum brightness is when the unspotted part is fully visible, and the minimum when the spotty part is facing us.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is observed from Earth, and only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star is in a position where the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux would be lower because the spots are cooler. So the brightness variation would be the difference between when the spot side is visible and when it's not.

But how much does each contribute? Let's consider the star's total flux.

The star emits flux F0 when all its surface is at Teff. But with spots, part of the surface is cooler.

The total flux from the star when the spot hemisphere is facing us is F = F0 * (1 - f_spot * (F_spot / F0)), where f_spot is the filling factor, and (F_spot / F0) is the ratio of flux from the spots to the normal flux.

Wait, more accurately, each part of the star's surface emits flux according to its area and temperature. The total flux when the spot hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the spot regions and the rest of the hemisphere and the other hemisphere.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so the total flux when the spot hemisphere is facing us is:

F = (Area of non-spotty part of the hemisphere * flux per unit area) + (Area of spotty part of the hemisphere * their flux) + (Entire other hemisphere's flux).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the star as having two hemispheres: the spot hemisphere and the non-spot hemisphere.

The non-spot hemisphere has a flux of F0 = 4πR² * σ T_eff^4, but wait, actually, the flux from a star is usually modeled as F = σ T^4 * (R^2 / d^2), where d is distance. But since we are comparing brightness changes, perhaps the absolute distance isn't important. Let's think in terms of relative flux.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the relative change in flux caused by the spots.

The star's normal (unspotted) flux is F0. When the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux from that hemisphere is:

F_spot_hemi = area_fraction * F0_hemi_per_area * T_spot^4 + (1 - area_fraction) * F0_hemi_per_area.

Wait, the hemisphere's total area is 2πR², because the surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20% (0.2), so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². The rest is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

Each part's flux is proportional to its area multiplied by the temperature^4 of that region.

So the flux from the spot hemisphere when it's facing us is:

F_spotty_hemi = (0.4π R²) * σ T_spot^4 + (1.6 π R²) * σ T_eff^4.

The flux from the non-spotty hemisphere is:

F_clean_hemi = 2 π R² * σ T_eff^4.

So the total flux when the spot hemisphere is visible is F_spotty_hemi + F_clean_hemi.

When the star rotates so that the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 2 * F_clean_hemi (since both hemispheres are clean).

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere. When one hemisphere is spotty and the other is not, then when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is (0.4π R² σ T_spot^4 + 1.6 π R² σ T_eff^4) + (2 π R² σ T_eff^4). Because the other hemisphere is entirely normal.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the star is a sphere with two hemispheres. If one hemisphere is spotty (covering 20% of its area), the other is spotless. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux from the spotty hemisphere is as calculated, and the flux from the other hemisphere (spotless) is 2 π R² σ Teff^4. So the total flux when spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty_hemi (only the spotty hemisphere) plus F_clean_hemi (the other hemisphere), right?

Wait, no. Because each hemisphere is 2π R². So the total star's surface is 4π R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is the opposite side, which is clean. So the flux is: spotty hemisphere's flux + clean hemisphere's flux.

Wait, but the clean hemisphere is normal, so its flux is 2π R² σ Teff^4.

The spotty hemisphere's flux is: area of spots (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ T_spot^4 + area of non-spots (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ Teff^4.

So:

F_spotty_hemi = (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

And the clean hemisphere contributes F_clean = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the total when the star shows the spotty hemisphere is F_spotty_hemi + F_clean.

Wait, but the other hemisphere is clean? Or does the star have only one hemisphere (the near side) spotty, and the far side is clean? Hmm, the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. So the other hemisphere is entirely clean.

So F_total when spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotty_hemi + F_clean_hemi.

When the star rotates 180 degrees, the clean hemisphere is facing us, so F_total is 2 * F_clean_hemi.

Wait, no. Because if one hemisphere is spotty and the other is clean, then when the spotty side is facing us, the flux is F_spotty_hemi + F_clean_hemi?

Wait, no, because the clean hemisphere is the far side. So perhaps the flux would be F_spotty_hemi (the near side) + F_clean_hemi (the far side). But when the star rotates, the far side (clean) becomes the near side, so F_clean_hemi (near) + F_spotty_hemi (far), which is same as the other case.

Wait, perhaps I need to reorient. Let me think of it this way: when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, then the flux is (flux from spotty hemisphere) + (flux from clean hemisphere). But when the star rotates so that the clean hemisphere is on the near side, the flux is (flux from clean hemisphere) + (flux from spotty hemisphere). Wait, but that can't be right because the clean hemisphere's flux is higher.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. The star is a sphere, so when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, the far side is the clean hemisphere. So the total flux is the sum of the near and far hemispheres. But when you rotate the star so that the other hemisphere is near, the near's flux is from the clean hemisphere, and the far is spotty.

Wait, but in reality, regardless of rotation, the total flux would be the same because the star is a sphere, right? Because the total flux from the entire star is the same. Wait, but no, because when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, more of the spot area is visible. Wait, I'm confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's surface is made up of two hemispheres: one with spots (covering 20% of that hemisphere) and the other without any spots. So the star's total flux when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side is the sum of the flux from the spotty hemisphere and the clean hemisphere. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (clean) is on the near side, so the flux is the sum of the clean hemisphere and the spotty hemisphere. Wait, that can't be right because the spotty hemisphere is on the far side in that case. So the flux would be the same as when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Perhaps when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, the flux is the sum of the spotty hemisphere and the clean far side. And when the star rotates, the clean hemisphere is on the near side, and the spotty hemisphere is on the far. So the flux is the same in both orientations. That can't be right because the problem states that the brightness varies due to rotation. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm modeling the star.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the star's surface is only the near hemisphere that's spotty, and the far hemisphere is clean. So when the star rotates, the spotty area comes into view and then moves away. But that would imply that the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view, but the spot coverage is only on the near side. Hmm, perhaps that's not the correct model.

Wait, perhaps the star's surface is such that one hemisphere is completely spotty, the other is completely clean. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is (flux from spotty hemisphere) + (flux from clean hemisphere). When the star rotates 180 degrees, the clean hemisphere is facing us, so the flux is same as before. Wait, but that would mean no change in flux. So that can't be right, because the problem states that the brightness varies.

Ah, I must be misunderstanding the setup. Let me read the question again.

"Only one hemisphere is spotty." So perhaps the star's surface is such that only one side (hemisphere) is spotty, and the other is not. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, then goes away.

Wait, but the star is a sphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is that hemisphere's flux plus the flux from the opposite hemisphere (which is clean). So F = F_spotty_hemi + F_clean_hemi.

When the star is rotated 180 degrees, the clean hemisphere is facing us, so F = F_clean_hemi + F_spotty_hemi. Which is the same as before. That would mean no change in flux. So the brightness wouldn't vary, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, perhaps the model is that only the near side (the hemisphere visible to us) has spots, and the far side is spotless. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out. But that would mean that the spots are always on the near side, and when the star rotates, different parts of the near side come into view. So perhaps the spots are fixed on the near side, and as the star rotates, the spots rotate into and out of view. So the brightness variation is due to the spots' changing visibility as the star rotates.

Wait, but that's not possible because from our perspective, any spots on the near side would rotate in and out of view, causing brightness changes. That makes sense.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem as the star having spots on one hemisphere, which is the side facing us. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. So the brightness variation is due to the spots' area blocking more or less of the star's flux.

Wait, no. No, because the spots are cooler, not blocking. So when the spots are in view, the total flux is lower than when the spots are on the far side. So the brightness dip would be when the spots are in front, causing the flux to decrease.

Wait, but the star isn't being transited by a planet; it's the star's own spots that cause the dip. So the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side, and the minimum when they're on the near side.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the opposite. Because when the spots are on the near side, we see their cooler areas, so the flux is less than when the spots are on the far side, where we see the hotter areas. So maximum brightness occurs when the spots are on the far side, and minimum when they're on the near side.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference between these two fluxes.

But to find the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same dip, I need to compute the dip caused by the spots and then set that equal to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So let's compute the flux change delta F when the star shows the spotty hemisphere versus when it shows the clean hemisphere.

Compute F_max and F_min.

F_max is when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, so we see the clean hemisphere plus the spotty hemisphere on the far side. Wait, no. No, when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, the near side is clean. So the flux is F_clean_hemi (near) + F_spotty_hemi (far). But when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, the flux is F_spotty_hemi (near) + F_clean_hemi (far).

Wait, but perhaps I should model this as the star having two hemispheres: one with spots and one without. So when the star is viewed such that the spotty side is facing us, the flux is F_spotty, and when the clean side is facing us, the flux is F_clean.

Wait, but that can't be because the star is a sphere. The flux should be the same regardless of rotation because the total surface area is the same. But no, because the flux depends on which parts are visible.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to model the flux in two scenarios: when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side (facing us) and when it's on the far side.

Scenario 1: Spotty hemisphere is near.

- The near side is spotty, so the flux from the near side is F_spotty_hemi.
- The far side is clean, so the flux from the far side is F_clean_hemi.

So total flux F1 = F_spotty_hemi + F_clean_hemi.

Scenario 2: Spotty hemisphere is far.

- The near side is clean, so flux is F_clean_hemi.
- The far side is spotty, so flux is F_spotty_hemi.

So F2 = F_clean_hemi + F_spotty_hemi.

Wait, but F1 and F2 are the same because addition is commutative. So F1 = F2, which would mean no brightness variation, which can't be right. So I must be making a mistake in how I'm conceptualizing the problem.

Hmm, perhaps the star's spots are only on one side, and when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the spots are on the equator, perhaps, and when they rotate into the view, they cause a dip in brightness.

Wait, perhaps the star's spots are on a single hemisphere, and when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, leading to a periodic brightness variation.

In any case, maybe I should approach this problem by calculating the relative change in flux when the star presents the spot hemisphere versus when it's not visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler: the star's brightness variation due to spots is similar to a planet blocking part of the star, but in this case, the effect is due to differing temperatures.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute the maximum and minimum possible fluxes from the star, then find the amplitude.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the flux from the star in two cases: when the spotty hemisphere is facing us and when the clean hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but earlier conclusion was that the flux would be same in both cases, but that can't be. So I must have an error in the model.

Alternative approach: perhaps the star is only spotty on one side (hemisphere), and when the star rotates, the spotty area comes into view, making the star appear dimmer.

So when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, the flux is lower.

Let me model the star as a sphere with two hemispheres: the "front" and the "back". The front hemisphere is spotty, the back is clean.

When the star is viewed such that the front is near, the flux is F_front + F_back.

When the star is viewed from the opposite side, the front is now the back, so F_back + F_front.

Wait, but that's the same as before, so it still doesn't change flux.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that when a star has spots only on one hemisphere, the modulation in brightness isn't due to rotation, but perhaps due to the spots being cooler when they are on the visible side.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation is because when the spots are on the near side, the total flux is less than when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the entire star isn't emitting uniformly. So when the star's rotation brings the spotty area into view, the observed flux drops by the area of the spots, but scaled by their lower temperature.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute the difference in flux when the spots are on the near side versus when they're on the far side.

So, the star's total flux when the spots are on the far side (not visible) is F_clean = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_spotty = (4π R² - area of spots) σ T_eff^4 + (area of spots) σ T_spot^4.

Wait, the area of the spots is the filling factor times the area of the hemisphere. Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

So area of spots = 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

So, when the spots are on the near side, the flux is:

F_spotty = [(4π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ T_eff^4] + [0.4 π R² * σ T_spot^4].

Simplify:

= (3.6 π R²) σ T_eff^4 + (0.4 π R²) σ T_spot^4.

When the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_clean = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F_clean and F_spotty.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_clean = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

When they're on the near side, F_spotty is as above.

So the difference in flux is:

ΔF = F_clean - F_spotty = [4π R² σ T_eff^4] - [3.6 π R² σ T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4].

= (4 - 3.6) π R² σ T_eff^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

Wait, because (6000)^4 is higher than (5000)^4.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is ΔF = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

But how does this compare to the case where a planet transits the star?

In the planet case, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_total, because the planet blocks a part of the star's light. So the dip amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_total.

Wait, but in the star's spot case, the amplitude is ΔF = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

We need to find Rpl such that (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_total = ΔF.

Because F_total is 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 * 4 π R² σ (6000)^4 = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

Simplify both sides:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 * 4 (6000)^4 = 0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4).

Divide both sides by 4 (6000)^4:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = [0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4)] / [4 (6000)^4 ].

Simplify:

= (0.4 /4) * [ (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 ]

= 0.1 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333. Let's compute (0.8333)^4.

0.8333^2 = approx 0.694444.

0.694444^2 ≈ 0.482253.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.1 * [ 1 - 0.4823 ] = 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177.

Take square root:

Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.2275. Let me check the options:

Options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of them are around 0.227. Did I make a mistake in my approach?

Wait, perhaps my model is incorrect. Let me re-examine the assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated the flux when the spots are on the near side is incorrect. Because when the star has spots on a hemisphere, the total flux when the spots are on the near side isn't just F_spotty = (area of non-spots on hemisphere) * Teff^4 + (area of spots) * T_spot^4. Because the star's flux is from the entire surface. Wait, no—if the spots are on the near hemisphere, the far hemisphere is entirely clean.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's entire flux when the spots are on the near side as the sum of the near side's flux (spotty) and the far side's flux (clean). So F_spotty = F_near_spotty + F_far_clean.

Similarly, when the spots are on the far side, F_clean = F_near_clean + F_far_spotty.

Wait, but in that case, the total flux when the spots are on the near side is F_near_spotty + F_far_clean.

And when the spots are on the far side, it's F_near_clean + F_far_spotty.

But since the far side when the spots are on the near side is clean, and the near side when the spots are far is clean, perhaps the fluxes are different.

Let me compute F_near_spotty: it's the flux from the near hemisphere which has spots. So area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² (since it's a hemisphere, area is 2π R²). So the flux from the near side is:

F_near_spotty = (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ T_eff^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ T_spot^4.

= (1.6 π R² σ T_eff^4) + (0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4).

The flux from the far side (hemisphere) when the near side is spotty is 2π R² σ T_eff^4.

So total flux when near is spotty: F1 = [1.6 π R² σ T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 ] + 2 π R² σ T_eff^4.

= (1.6 + 2) π R² σ T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4.

= 3.6 π R² σ T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4.

When the spots are on the far side, the near side is clean.

So F_near_clean = 2 π R² σ T_eff^4.

The far side is spotty: F_far_spotty = (0.8 * 2 π R² σ T_eff^4) + (0.2 * 2 π R² σ T_spot^4).

= 1.6 π R² σ T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4.

So total flux when near is clean (spots on far side): F2 = 2 π R² σ T_eff^4 + 1.6 π R² σ T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4.

= (2 +1.6) π R² σ T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4.

= 3.6 π R² σ T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4.

Wait, but F1 and F2 are the same. So the flux doesn't change, which can't be right because the problem says the brightness varies. So my model is wrong.

Ah, I think I understand why. Because when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is near, the total flux is F1. When the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is far, the flux is F2. But in both cases, the flux is the same. So this model predicts no brightness variation, which contradicts the problem statement.

So I must have a wrong model. Perhaps the star's spots are not arranged in hemispheres but are on a single side, and their rotation brings them into and out of view, causing a varying brightness.

Alternative approach: perhaps the star's spots occupy a certain fraction of its surface. When the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, leading to a periodic change in brightness. The amplitude of this change depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the star.

In that case, the maximum flux is when no spots are visible (F_max = F0), and the minimum is when the maximum number of spots are visible (F_min = F0 - ΔF).

The amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Wait, but in the case of the star with spots, the brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler. So when spots are visible, the flux is less than when they aren't. So the maximum flux is when no spots are visible (F_max = F0), and the minimum is when maximum spots are visible (F_min = F0 - ΔF).

The amplitude is (F_max - F_min) = ΔF.

Wait, but how do we compute ΔF? The area of the spots on the star's surface times the difference in flux per unit area.

So, the area of the spots is f * A_total, where f is the filling factor (0.2) and A_total is the star's total surface area (4 π R²).

So area of spots: A_spots = 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

Wait, no. The problem states that the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So it's 20% of a hemisphere.

Hemisphere area is 2 π R². So area of spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

The flux from the spots when they are visible is 0.4 π R² * σ T_spot^4.

The flux from the same area when it's at Teff is 0.4 π R² * σ T_eff^4.

So the difference in flux when spots are present is ΔF = 0.4 π R² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the brightness variation amplitude is ΔF = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

Now, compare this to the case of a planet transiting the star.

When a planet of radius Rpl transits, it blocks an area of π Rpl². The flux dip is:

ΔF_planet = (π Rpl² / (4 π Rstar²)) * F0.

Because the area blocked is (π Rpl²) and the star's area is 4 π Rstar². So the fraction is (Rpl²)/(4 Rstar²), hence the dip is (Rpl/(2 Rstar))². Wait, no, the fraction is (Rpl^2)/( (4 Rstar^2) ), so dip is (Rpl/(2 Rstar))^2.

Wait, no, the dip is (blocked area)/(star's area) = (π Rpl²)/(4 π Rstar²) ) = (Rpl²)/(4 Rstar²).

So ΔF_planet = F0 * (Rpl²)/(4 Rstar²).

But in our case, the brightness variation amplitude from spots is ΔF_spot = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

But F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So ΔF_spot = (0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ) = 4 π R² σ (6000^4) * (0.4 (1 - (5000/6000)^4)/4 )

Because,

ΔF_spot = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4) = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) [1 - (5/6)^4 ]

= F0 * (0.4 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) )

Because F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000^4 ), so 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 ) = (0.4 /4 ) F0 = 0.1 F0.

So,

ΔF_spot = 0.1 F0 [1 - (5/6)^4 ]

= 0.1 F0 [1 - (approx 0.4823) ]

= 0.1 F0 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177 F0.

Set this equal to ΔF_planet.

ΔF_planet = (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar² )) F0.

So,

0.05177 F0 = (Rpl² / (4 Rstar² )) F0.

Divide both sides by F0:

0.05177 = Rpl² / (4 Rstar² )

=> Rpl² = 0.05177 * 4 Rstar².

= 0.20708 Rstar².

Take square root:

Rpl = sqrt(0.20708) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Wait, but that's approximately 0.455, which is around 0.46. But that's not one of the options. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the star's spots are only on one hemisphere and that the effect is rotational. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a varying brightness. But the variation amplitude would be different than if the spots were spread across the entire star.

Wait, perhaps the maximum and minimum fluxes would be when the spots are fully in view and when they're fully out of view. So the flux variation is between F_min and F_max, where F_min is when the entire spot area is visible, and F_max is when none is.

Wait, but if the star's spots are only on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully visible. When it's not, the spots are on the far side, so not visible. So the flux variation would be the difference between F_max (no spots visible) and F_min (spots visible).

So F_min is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. F_max is when it's not.

So F_min = (area of star without spots) * Teff^4 + (area of spots) * T_spot^4.

Wait, no. The entire star has two hemispheres: one with spots (spotty hemisphere) and one without (clean hemisphere). So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty_hemi + F_clean_hemi.

Wait, but when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, the flux is F_clean_hemi (near) + F_spotty_hemi (far, which is not visible).

Wait, this is getting me more confused. Maybe another approach: think of the star as having a fraction f of its surface covered by spots, each at a lower temperature. The brightness variation amplitude would be the difference between when the spots are on the near side (lower flux) and when they're on the far side (higher flux).

Wait, but the filling factor f is 0.2, but only for one hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² (for the hemisphere) = 0.4 π R².

So the total area of spots is 0.4 π R².

The star's total surface area is 4 π R².

So the fraction of spots on the star is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.4/4 = 0.1 or 10%.

So the star has 10% of its surface covered by spots.

When the star rotates, the spots come into view and out of view, causing the flux to vary.

So the maximum flux is when no spots are visible (F_max = F0), and the minimum is when all spots are visible (F_min = F0 - ΔF).

But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are in view. So the flux is F_min = F0 - (area of spots) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * σ.

Wait, more accurately, the flux when the spots are visible is F_min = F0 - (A_spots) σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is F_max - F_min = (A_spots) σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

But F0 = 4 π R² σ Teff^4.

So,

Amplitude ΔF = A_spots σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

Now, for a planet, the amplitude is ΔF_planet = (π Rpl² / (4 π Rstar² )) * F0.

= (Rpl² / (4 Rstar² )) * 4 π Rstar² σ Teff^4.

= (Rpl² / (4 Rstar² )) * F0.

Set ΔF = ΔF_planet:

0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4) = (Rpl²/(4 Rstar² )) * 4 π Rstar² σ (6000^4).

Simplify:

0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4) = Rpl² σ (6000^4).

Divide both sides by σ (6000^4):

0.4 π R² [ (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4 ] = Rpl².

Compute the term in the brackets:

(6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 1 - (0.8333)^4 ≈ 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

So,

0.4 π R² * 0.517747 = Rpl².

0.4 * 0.517747 = 0.207099.

So,

0.207099 π R² = Rpl².

Take Rpl = sqrt(0.207099 π ) R.

Compute sqrt(0.207099 * 3.1416) ≈ sqrt(0.65) ≈ 0.806.

Wait, but wait: Rpl² = 0.207099 π R².

So,

Rpl = sqrt(0.207099 * π ) R.

Compute 0.207099 * π ≈ 0.207099 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.65.

sqrt(0.65) ≈ 0.806. So Rpl ≈ 0.806 Rstar.

But that's around 0.8, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I must be doing something wrong here. Let me check my reasoning again.

Wait, perhaps the approach is incorrect because the star's spots are only on one hemisphere, and when they're on the near side, the flux is lower, but when they're on the far side, the flux is higher. So the amplitude is the difference between maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, but when the spots are on the far side, they are not visible, so the flux is higher than when they're on the near side.

So, when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F1 = F0 - ΔF.

When the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0.

Wait, that can't be right because when the spots are on the far side, they're not contributing less flux. Wait, no, the entire star's flux is sum of all its parts. So when the spots are on the near side, they contribute less flux, so the total is lower. When the spots are on the far side, the near side is clean, so the flux is F0.

So the maximum flux is F0, and the minimum is F_min = F0 - ΔF.

So the amplitude is F0 - F_min = ΔF.

So ΔF = F0 - F_min.

F_min is when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side.

Compute F_min:

F_min = (Area of clean regions on near side) * Teff^4 + (Area of spots on near side) * T_spot^4 + (Area of far side) * Teff^4.

Because when the near side is spotty, the far side is clean.

Wait, no. The far side is always clean, because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the near side is spotty, the far side is clean. So the flux is:

F_min = (near hemisphere without spots) * Teff^4 + (near hemisphere with spots) * T_spot^4 + (far hemisphere) * Teff^4.

The near hemisphere's area is 2 π R². The area without spots is 0.8 * 2 π R² = 1.6 π R². The area with spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

The far hemisphere is entirely clean, so 2 π R² * Teff^4.

So,

F_min = (1.6 π R² * Teff^4) + (0.4 π R² * T_spot^4 ) + (2 π R² * Teff^4 )

= (1.6 + 2) π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4.

= 3.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4.

The maximum flux F_max is when the near side is clean. So the near side is clean, and the far side is clean.

F_max = 2 π R² Teff^4 (near) + 2 π R² Teff^4 (far) = 4 π R² Teff^4.

So the amplitude is:

ΔF = F_max - F_min = [4 π R² Teff^4 ] - [ 3.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ]

= (0.4 π R² Teff^4 ) - (0.4 π R² T_spot^4 )

= 0.4 π R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So the amplitude is 0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4) σ.

Now, the planet's amplitude is (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )) F0.

Set them equal:

0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4) σ = (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )) * 4 π Rstar² σ (6000^4 )

Simplify:

0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4) = (Rpl^2 /4 Rstar² ) * 4 π Rstar² (6000^4 )

The 4 in denominator and numerator cancel.

So,

0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4) = Rpl^2 π Rstar² (6000^4 )

Divide both sides by π:

0.4 R² (6000^4 -5000^4) = Rpl^2 Rstar² (6000^4 )

Divide both sides by Rstar²:

0.4 (R/Rstar)^2 (6000^4 -5000^4) ) = Rpl^2 (6000^4 )

But R is the star's radius, Rstar. So R = Rstar.

So,

0.4 (1)^2 (6000^4 -5000^4) = Rpl^2 (6000^4 )

=> Rpl^2 = 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

= 0.4 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

Rpl^2 = 0.4 * (1 - 0.4823) = 0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.20708.

Take square root:

Rpl ≈ sqrt(0.20708) ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Which is about 0.455, but the options don't have this. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots.

Wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

But the star's total area is 4 π R², so the area of spots is 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the star's surface (0.4 /4 = 0.1).

Wait, but in the planet case, the dip is (Rpl^2) / (4 Rstar^2) = (Rpl/(2 Rstar))^2.

Wait, no, the dip is (Rpl^2) / (4 Rstar^2) = (Rpl/(2 Rstar))^2. Because area blocked is π Rpl², and star's area is 4 π Rstar². So (π Rpl²) / (4 π Rstar²) ) = (Rpl²)/(4 Rstar²) = (Rpl/(2 Rstar))^2.

So in the planet case, the amplitude is (Rpl/(2 Rstar))^2.

In the star's case, the amplitude is 0.4 (1 - (5/6)^4) = approx 0.4 * 0.5177 = 0.20708.

So setting:

0.20708 = (Rpl/(2 Rstar))^2.

Rpl^2 = 0.20708 * 4 Rstar^2.

Rpl^2 = 0.8283 Rstar^2.

Rpl ≈ sqrt(0.8283) Rstar ≈ 0.91 Rstar.

Wait, but this can't be right because a planet larger than the star would cause a larger dip than possible. So I must have messed up the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation amplitude is 0.20708 F0, and the planet would cause a dip of (Rpl/(2 Rstar))^2 F0.

Wait, but in the previous calculation, we have:

Amplitude from spots = 0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) σ.

Amplitude from planet = (Rpl^2/(4 Rstar^2 )) F0.

Set them equal:

0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) σ = (Rpl^2/(4 Rstar^2 )) * 4 π Rstar² σ (6000^4 )

Wait, F0 = 4 π Rstar² σ (6000^4 )

So,

0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) σ = (Rpl^2/(4 Rstar^2 )) * F0.

= (Rpl^2/(4 Rstar^2 )) * 4 π Rstar² σ (6000^4 )

= Rpl² π σ (6000^4 )

So,

0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) σ = Rpl² π σ (6000^4 )

Cancel π and σ:

0.4 R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) = Rpl² (6000^4 )

Divide both sides by 6000^4:

0.4 R² (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = Rpl².

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

0.4 R² (1 - 0.4823 ) = Rpl².

= 0.4 R² * 0.5177 ≈ 0.20708 R².

So,

Rpl² = 0.20708 R².

Rpl = sqrt(0.20708) R ≈ 0.455 R.

Ah, same result as before. But the options don't have 0.455. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the star's spots are only on one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but the planet's transit would cause a dip that's a simple area ratio. So the brightness variation amplitude from the spots is:

ΔF_spot = (area of spots) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / (Teff^4 )

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently.

The star's brightness variation due to spots can be modeled as a change in the effective temperature because part of the surface is cooler. The flux from the star when the spots are visible is F1, and when they're not, F0.

The dip is F0 - F1.

F0 is the total flux when all areas are at Teff.

F1 is the flux when the spots are visible.

F1 = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot,

where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the spots cover a fraction f of the surface, the flux is (1-f) F0 + f F_spot.

So,

F1 = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot.

The dip is F0 - F1 = F0 - [ (1-f) F0 + f F_spot ].

= F0 - (1 - f) F0 - f F_spot.

= f (F0 - F_spot ).

Now, F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spots, which is σ T_spot^4.

F0 is σ T_eff^4.

So,

F0 - F_spot = σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ).

Thus,

dip = f σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ).

And F0 = σ T_eff^4 * 4 π R².

So,

dip = f * 4 π R² σ T_eff^4 * ( T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / T_eff^4.

Wait, no, perhaps I should express dip as:

dip = F0 * f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So,

dip = F0 * f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Comparing this to the planet's dip:

dip_planet = F0 * (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )).

Setting them equal:

F0 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) = F0 * (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )).

Cancel F0:

f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) = Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )

Solve for Rpl/Rstar:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 4 f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So,

Rpl/Rstar = 2 sqrt( f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) )

Now, plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.2 (but wait, f is the total area of spots on the entire star? Or just one hemisphere?)

Wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

The star's total area is 4 π R².

So f = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1.

So f=0.1.

T_spot = 5000 K, Teff=6000 K.

Compute (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = 1 - (0.8333)^4 = 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 4 * 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.4 * 0.5177 = 0.20708.

So,

Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.20708 ) ≈ 0.455.

But again, this isn't an option. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, the problem states that the star's brightness variation resembles that of a planet, so perhaps the approach is to make the dip caused by the spots equal to the dip caused by the planet.

But in the case of the star, the dip is due to the spots being cooler, which is a different mechanism than the planet blocking light. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the relative change in flux when the spots are in view, and equate that to the planet's dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler than that. The brightness variation amplitude from the spots is the same as that from a planet, so we can compute the equivalent planet radius.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the same formula as the planet case, so the dip caused by the spots is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, and we need to compute Rpl such that this equals the dip from the spots.

But in the case of the spots, the dip is f (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4 ), where f is the area fraction.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Because the dip from the planet is (Rpl^2)/(4 Rstar^2) F0, and the dip from the spots is f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) F0.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think.

The dip from the spots is dip_spot = F0 * (f) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

The dip from the planet is dip_planet = F0 * (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )).

Set them equal:

F0 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) = F0 (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )).

Cancel F0:

f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) = Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 ).

So,

Rpl^2 = 4 Rstar^2 f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So,

Rpl = 2 Rstar sqrt( f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ).

Plugging in:

f = 0.1 (because the total spot area is 0.1 of the star's surface).

(1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ≈ 0.5177.

So,

Rpl = 2 Rstar * sqrt( 0.1 * 0.5177 ) = 2 Rstar * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 2 Rstar * 0.2275 ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Again, same result. But the options don't have this. Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the spots are on the entire star, not just one hemisphere. Let me check that.

If the spots cover the entire star with a filling factor of 20%, then f would be 0.2. Let's see:

Rpl^2 = 4 * 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.41416.

Rpl ≈ sqrt(0.41416 ) ≈ 0.643 Rstar.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the planet's radius such that the maximum dip is the same as the star's dip when the spots are fully in view.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip caused by the spots when they're fully visible and set that equal to the dip from the planet.

In the star's case, the dip is dip_spot = F0 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Planet's dip is dip_planet = (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )) F0.

Set dip_spot = dip_planet:

F0 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) = (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )) F0.

Cancel F0:

f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) = Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )

So,

Rpl^2 = 4 Rstar^2 f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Which is the same as before.

So maybe the problem is designed to have Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.455, but the options don't include this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the brightness variation due to the spots as a modulation, not a dip. So when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower, and when they're on the far side, it's higher, leading to a sine-like variation.

Wait, but the amplitude would be (F_max - F_min)/2.

Wait, no, the maximum flux is when the spots are on the far side, and the minimum when on the near side.

So F_max = F0.

F_min = F0 - dip_spot.

Amplitude is (F_max - F_min ) = dip_spot.

So the same approach as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck here because my calculation leads me to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.455, which isn't in the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of f.

Wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Total star area is 4 π R². So f = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1.

So f=0.1.

So,

Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(4 * 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )) )

= sqrt(0.4 * 0.5177 )

= sqrt(0.20708 )

= ~0.455.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is considering the spot coverage on the entire star, not just a hemisphere. Let's see.

If the spot filling factor is 20% for the entire star, then f=0.2.

Then,

Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(4 * 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )) )

= sqrt(0.8 * 0.5177 )

= sqrt(0.41416 ) ≈ 0.643.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the spot's temperature is 6000 + 1000 K = 7000 K. But that wouldn't make sense because spots are cooler, not hotter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot to be hotter. But that's not typical.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the brightness variation due to the spots as (area) * (Teff - T_spot)^2 / Teff^2.

Wait, but flux is proportional to T^4, not T^2. So that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the area of the spots as f * pi Rstar^2, but that would be incorrect because the star's area is 4 pi Rstar^2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have a much smaller Rpl. Let me think about the numbers.

The options include 0.11, which is option C. Let me see what Rpl/Rstar would be to give a dip of 0.0517 F0.

Because earlier, dip_spot ≈ 0.4 * 0.5177 F0 = 0.20708 F0.

Wait, no, dip_spot is 0.4 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) sigma.

But F0 is 4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 ), so dip_spot = 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 * 6000^4 ) * F0.

= 0.1 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) F0 ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 F0 ≈ 0.05177 F0.

So, dip_spot ≈ 0.05177 F0.

Setting this equal to the planet's dip:

dip_planet = (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )) F0.

So,

(Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )) F0 = 0.05177 F0.

So,

Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 ) = 0.05177.

Rpl^2 = 0.05177 *4 Rstar^2.

= 0.20708 Rstar^2.

Rpl ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Still the same result. Not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing a key insight.

Alternative approach: perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots modulating the light as the star rotates, but the amplitude is (A_spots / A_star) * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ), but not subtracted.

Wait, perhaps the flux when spots are visible is F1 = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot.

So F1 = (1-f) F0 + f (F0 * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

= F0 [ (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]

= F0 [ 1 - f (1 - T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]

So the dip is F0 - F1 = F0 * f (1 - T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ).

Which is the same as before.

So dip_spot = F0 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Set equal to dip_planet = F0 * (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )).

So,

f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) = Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2 )

Rpl^2 = 4 Rstar^2 f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Again, same formula.

With f=0.1,

Rpl^2 = 4 * 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.20708.

Rpl= ~0.455 Rstar.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the Rpl/Rstar as sqrt( (0.4 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )) ), which is sqrt(0.4 * 0.5177) = sqrt(0.20708) ≈ 0.455, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in f.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just a hemisphere.

If f=0.2,

Rpl^2 = 4 * 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.41416.

Rpl ≈ 0.643 Rstar.

No, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as covering the entire star, but the filling factor is 20% of the star's surface, so f=0.2.

No, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the difference in brightness as the sum of the area and the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative change in flux when the star's spots are visible.

The area of the spots is 0.4 π R², as before.

The change in flux per unit area is (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

So the total change is 0.4 π R² * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

Which is 0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4.

Divide by F0 (4 π R² 6000^4 ) to get the fractional dip.

So,

dip_spot = [0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 π R² 6000^4 ]

= 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )/(4 * 6000^4 )

= 0.1 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177.

So dip_spot ≈ 0.05177, or about 5.177% dip.

Set this equal to the planet's dip:

(Rpl/(2 Rstar ))^2 = 0.05177.

Take square root:

Rpl/(2 Rstar ) = sqrt(0.05177 ) ≈ 0.2275.

So Rpl = 2 Rstar * 0.2275 ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Again same result.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake in assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the star's brightness variation is such that the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side, but the minimum is when the spots are on the near side. So the amplitude is dip_spot = 0.05177 F0.

But the planet's dip is (Rpl^2/(4 Rstar^2 )) F0.

So,

(Rpl^2/(4 Rstar^2 )) = 0.05177.

=> Rpl^2 = 0.20708 Rstar^2.

Rpl = sqrt(0.20708 ) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as a single spot, not spread across a hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2π R². No, that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the spots as covering the entire star, but with a filling factor of 20% for the entire surface, meaning f=0.2. Let me recalculate with f=0.2.

Then,

dip_spot = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035.

Set equal to planet dip:

(Rpl/(2 Rstar ))^2 = 0.1035.

Rpl/(2 Rstar ) = sqrt(0.1035 ) ≈ 0.3217.

Rpl = 0.643 Rstar.

Still not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spot to be on the limb and thus blocking more light. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the options are meant to be of the order of 0.45, but since that's not present, perhaps the closest is option D: ~0.32.

Wait, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, 0.32 is sqrt(0.1024 ), because (0.32)^2 = 0.1024.

So if Rpl^2 = 0.1024 Rstar^2, then dip is 0.1024/4 = 0.0256.

But dip_spot is 0.05177, which is twice that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the maximum dip when the planet causes a transit, but the star's spots' dip is being compared to the planet's maximum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Rpl such that the amplitude is the same, which would require Rpl being about 0.455 Rstar. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C: ~0.11.

Wait, 0.11 squared is 0.0121. Hmm, that's much smaller than 0.05177.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the dip in terms of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = dip_spot.

So dip_spot = (Rpl^2/(4 Rstar^2 )).

So,

Rpl^2 = dip_spot *4 Rstar^2.

= 0.05177 *4 ≈ 0.20708.

Rpl = sqrt(0.20708 ) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Again, same result.

I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach. Perhaps the problem is intended to use a different approach, such as considering the brightness variation as a function of the spot's area and temperature, but perhaps the solution is to compute the equivalent planet radius as Rpl = sqrt(f) * Rstar * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^2 ).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's effect on the star's total luminosity when viewed from an angle, which may involve the cosine law of brightness.

Wait, the brightness of a star's surface varies with the angle due to limb darkening, but perhaps that's complicating things beyond the intended scope.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking to compute the ratio of the areas, given that the star's brightness variation is equivalent to a planet's transit. So:

Rpl^2 = (f) (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 )

Rpl = sqrt( 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )) * Rstar.

Compute (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

Rpl = sqrt(0.2 * 0.5177 ) ≈ sqrt(0.1035 ) ≈ 0.3217 Rstar.

Ah! Now that's about 0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct approach is to set Rpl^2 = f (1 - (T_spot/T_eff )^4 ), which gives Rpl ≈ 0.32 Rstar.

So the answer is D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the brightness variation caused by the star's spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor** of 20% (\( f = 0.2 \)).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness variation is caused by the cooler spots modulating the observed flux as the star rotates.
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference from the rest of the star.

3. **Planet's Brightness Variation**:
   - A planet transiting the star would cause a brightness dip proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]

4. **Equivalence**:
   - The goal is to find \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \) such that the amplitude of the planet's brightness dip matches the amplitude of the star's brightness variation due to the spots.

---

### Analysis:
1. **Star's Brightness Variation**:
   - The area of the spots is \( A_{\text{spots}} = f \cdot A_{\text{star}} = 0.2 \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.8 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The flux from the spots is reduced due to their lower temperature. The amplitude of the brightness variation is:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = F_0 \cdot f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right),
     \]
     where \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \) is the star's total flux without spots.

2. **Planet's Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude of the planet's brightness dip is:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = F_0 \cdot \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]

3. **Equating the Amplitudes**:
   - Setting \( \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = \Delta F_{\text{planet}} \), we get:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823 \).
   - Thus, \( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \approx 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177 \).
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.2 \cdot 0.5177 = 0.1035.
     \]
   - Taking the square root:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.32.
     \]

---

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to **Option D**.
