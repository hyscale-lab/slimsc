Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let me break this down. Di-substituted aromatic ring means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The ring is six-membered, so benzene is the base, and with two substituents. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has six carbons, so the substituents add two more carbons in total. Wait, wait, no—wait, benzene has six carbons, and the substituents add two more, because the compound is 8 carbons in total. So substituents contribute two carbons? Or is it that the substituent groups add up to two carbons each? Or perhaps the substituents themselves are two groups, each contributing some carbons.

Wait, maybe I should think about possible structures. The IR has a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen attached to the ring.

Wait, benzaldehyde has a carbonyl group (CHO) attached to benzene. But that's a single substituent. So if the ring is di-substituted, then the other substituent must be a halogen. So perhaps it's something like benzaldehyde with a halogen (like Cl or Br) attached at another position.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: one being a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something), and the other a halogen (Cl, Br, I, F). But what kind of substituents would give a total of 8 carbons?

Wait the total carbons is 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents add two, meaning each substituent is one carbon each. Wait, no, because two substituents each with one carbon would add two, making the total eight.

Wait, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. So the substituents would be -CHO (which is one substituent, one carbon) and, say, a Cl as another substituent. Wait wait, no: benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO. That's 7 carbons in total (6 in benzene, 1 in CHO). But the question says the compound has 8 carbons. So perhaps the substituent isn't an aldehyde. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. For example, maybe it's a ketone group. Let's think: perhaps it's a benzophenone derivative, but that's getting more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acyl group, like an ester.

Wait, another approach: The total number of carbons is 8. So substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon? If one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is two substituents attached to the carbonyl. Wait, no. So, if it's an aldehyde group, that's one substituent with one carbon. Then the other substituent is a halogen, which is just a single atom, not contributing a carbon. Wait, that can't be right because that would only add one substituent's carbon.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently. Maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like an ester) and another group that's a halogen. But wait, esters have more carbons. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, another possibility is that one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and the other is a halogen. For example, if the substituents are a ketone (like R-CO-) and a halogen. But wait, the ketone would require another carbon attached to the carbonyl. So that would be a substituent like CH2CO something? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group like an acetyl group (CH3CO-) attached as a substituent. Then, another substituent is a halogen. Let's see: Benzene with an acetyl group (which is two carbons: the CH3 and the CO-) and a halogen. So the acetyl group contributes two carbons (the CH3 and the CO), and the halogen contributes nothing, so total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. Oh wait, that would make sense.

Wait, but benzaldehyde is a substituent with one carbon (the aldehyde group). So if the substituents are a aldehyde group and a halogen, that's one substituent with one carbon, and the other substituent is a halogen (no carbon). So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) =7, which is less than 8. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another group. Like an ester group. Let's think: an ester group is O-CO-O-R. No, wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. Hmm, perhaps if one substituent is an ester group, which would have more carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl attached to a methylene group (like CH2CO- something). Let me think of the structure.

Another approach: Let me think about the options and work backward. The NMR data can give clues about the structure.

The IR has a carbonyl, so we're looking for a peak around 1700-1800 ppm. But the NMR options don't directly show that, but the substituents would influence the shifts.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s). That's a singlet around 10 ppm. Could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. So in this option, there's an aldehyde group.

Then, peaks at 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring, but perhaps with substituents leading to two doublets. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. Alternatively, if the substituent is an aldehyde and another group.

Wait, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the coupling would be between adjacent Hs. But wait, if the aromatic ring has two substituents, each at the para positions, then the Hs would be in a different environment.

Alternatively, think of a substituent that causes two doublets. Like a substituent with electron-withdrawing groups, causing ortho and para directing. Hmm.

Wait, but let me think about the substituents. If one substituent is an aldehyde (CHO) and another is a halogen, say, Cl or Br, then the aromatic ring would have these two substituents.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be split based on the substituents. For para-substituted rings, the protons would be in two sets, perhaps as a doublet each.

Wait, but if the substituents are in para positions, the neighboring Hs would have coupling. So maybe the aromatic Hs would show as two doublets. So for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the Hs in the ortho positions would be equivalent, and those in the meta positions would be as well.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: if the substituents are at para positions (positions 1 and 3, for example), then the ring would have Hs in positions 2, 4, 5, and 6. Wait, no, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para), then the Hs at 2 and 6 would be ortho to substituent A, and Hs at 3 and 5 would be ortho to substituent B. But wait, if substituents are at 1 and 4, then the Hs in 2 and 6 are ortho to substituent 1, and Hs in 3 and 5 are para to substituent 1 and ortho to substituent 4.

Hmm, perhaps in that case, the Hs at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the NMR would show two sets of doublets.

In option A, the peaks are 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that could fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each causing the neighboring Hs to couple.

But then, what about the aldehyde proton in option A: 9.9 (1H, s). That would fit with an aldehyde group.

So, the substituents would be an aldehyde group (CHO) and a halogen. But wait, the IR also indicates an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are CHO and X (halogen).

But in this case, the compound would have 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (X, since X is an atom, not a carbon) =7 carbons. But the question says 8 carbons in total. Hmm, so that doesn't add up. So maybe the substituents are something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a ketone (CO-) and a halogen. But a ketone would require another carbon attached. Let's say, R-CO-. For example, a propanone group (like in acetophenone). So if the substituent is an acetyl group (COCH3), that's two carbons (the CO and CH3). Then the other substituent is a halogen. So benzene would have substituents: COCH3 and X.

So, the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) =8. That fits. So substituents are COCH3 and X.

So, in this case, the IR would show a strong carbonyl peak (around 1700 cm-1), which matches the question.

In the NMR, the COCH3 would show up as a singlet for the methyl group (CH3) attached to the carbonyl. Because the CH3 is next to a carbonyl, it's deshielded, so maybe around 2.3 ppm as a singlet. For example, in acetophenone, the CH3CO group appears as a singlet around 2.6 ppm. Wait, but in the options, option C has a peak at 2.3 (3H, s), which would fit a CH3 attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). So that would correspond to a COCH3 group. So, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. Because if two substituents are in para positions, the remaining Hs would be in pairs that couple with each other.

So, the substituents are COCH3 and, say, Cl.

Wait, but in that case, the aromatic protons would be influenced by both substituents. Let me think about the coupling. If the substituents are para, then the Hs adjacent to each substituent would be in specific environments.

Wait, for example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para), then the Hs at 2 and 6 would be ortho to the COCH3 substituent and meta to Cl (if Cl is at 4). The Hs at 3 and 5 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COCH3.

So, the Hs at positions 2 and 6 would be in one environment, and those at 3 and 5 in another. Depending on the substituents, their chemical shifts would be different. So in the NMR, you would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So option C's aromatic peaks fit that scenario.

Additionally, option C has a 2.3 ppm peak for 3H, which would be the CH3 from the COCH3 group. So the NMR for option C would have the aromatic doublets and a singlet for the methyl group.

But wait, the question says the compound contains 8 carbons in total. Benzene (6) + COCH3 (2 carbons) + Cl (0 carbons) = 8. That fits.

But wait, option C doesn't have any peaks that correspond to a halogen. Because in the NMR, halogens typically don't have protons, so their presence isn't directly seen in 1H NMR unless the compound has protons near them. But the substituent is Cl, which doesn’t have Hs, so nothing in the NMR would directly indicate Cl except for the deshielding of neighboring Hs.

Wait, but the IR peak for aromatic-halogen is present. So the presence of Cl or Br would have a peak in the IR around 600-800 cm-1 for the C-X stretch. So that's covered.

So option C would have a COCH3 group as a substituent and a Cl as another substituent in para positions. Then the NMR would show two doublets (each 2H) for the aromatic Hs, and a singlet for the CH3 of the COCH3.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. If the substituents are in para positions, the two doublets would be for the two sets of equivalent Hs. So that matches with option C.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) is likely an aldehyde proton. But that would only add one carbon, making the total 7, which doesn't fit.

Option B: Peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are around where OCH2 groups might appear, like in an ether or ester. But that doesn’t fit with a carbonyl group from a ketone or aldehyde.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s) might be an aromatic proton, but the others are at 4.8 and 4.6, which again suggests some OCH2 groups or something else, not a carbonyl group.

Option C: The peaks fit a para-substituted benzene with COCH3 substituent and another substituent (like Cl).

So the correct NMR data should be option C.

Wait, but I thought the substituents would be COCH3 and Cl in para positions. So the aromatic Hs would be two sets of doublets. So option C's aromatic peaks are 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d), which fits.

So the answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. The total number of carbons (8) suggests that the benzene ring (6 carbons) has two substituents contributing 2 carbons in total. One substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br), which does not contribute any carbons.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks at 9.9 ppm (1H, s) suggest an aldehyde proton.  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring.  
   - However, an aldehyde group contributes only 1 carbon, making the total carbons 7 (6 from benzene + 1 from CHO), which does not match the given total of 8 carbons.  
   - **Eliminated**.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d) and 4.6 ppm (2H, d) suggest OCH2 groups, such as in an ether or ester.  
   - These peaks are inconsistent with the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), as required by the IR data.  
   - **Eliminated**.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring with two distinct environments for the aromatic protons.  
   - The peak at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) corresponds to a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (e.g., COCH3).  
   - This structure fits the criteria: benzene (6 carbons) + COCH3 (2 carbons) = 8 carbons total.  
   - The halogen substituent (e.g., Cl or Br) does not directly appear in the 1H NMR but would contribute to the aromatic chemical shifts and the IR peak for the C-X bond.  
   - **Matches all criteria**.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks at 6.9 ppm (1H, s), 4.8 ppm (2H, d), and 4.6 ppm (2H, d) suggest a structure with an aromatic proton and OCH2 groups, inconsistent with the presence of a carbonyl group.  
   - **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion:
The correct structure is a para-substituted benzene with a COCH3 group and a halogen substituent. The NMR data in **Option C** matches this structure, with two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl.

But wait, if substituents are at 1 and 4, then the Hs in 2 and 6 are ortho to substituent 1, and Hs in 3 and 5 are para to substituent 1 and ortho to substituent 4.

Hmm, perhaps in that case, the Hs at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the NMR would show two sets of doublets.

In option A, the peaks are 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that could fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each causing the neighboring Hs to couple.

But then, what about the aldehyde proton in option A: 9.9 (1H, s). That would fit with an aldehyde group.

So, the substituents would be an aldehyde group (CHO) and a halogen. But wait, the IR also indicates an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are CHO and X (halogen).

For example, in acetophenone, the CH3CO group appears as a singlet around 2.6 ppm. Wait, but in the options, option C has a peak at 2.3 (3H, s), which would fit a CH3 attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). So that would correspond to a COCH3 group. So, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. If the substituents are in para positions, the two doublets would be for the two sets of equivalent Hs. So that matches with option C.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) is likely an aldehyde proton. But that would only add one carbon, making the total 7, which doesn't fit.

Option B: Peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are around where OCH2 groups might appear, like in an ether or ester. But that doesn’t fit with a carbonyl group from a ketone or aldehyde.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s) might be an aromatic proton, but the others are at 4.8 and 4.6, which again suggests some OCH2 groups or something else, not a carbonyl group.

Option C: The peaks fit a para-substituted benzene with COCH3 substituent and another substituent (like Cl).

So the correct NMR data should be option C.

Wait, but I thought the substituents would be COCH3 and Cl in para positions. So the aromatic Hs would be two sets of doublets. So option C's aromatic peaks are 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d), which fits.

So the answer should be option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. The total number of carbons (8) suggests that the benzene ring (6 carbons) has two substituents contributing 2 carbons in total. One substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br), which does not contribute any carbons.

   - Peaks at 9.9 ppm (1H, s) suggest an aldehyde proton.  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring.  
   - However, an aldehyde group contributes only 1 carbon, making the total carbons 7 (6 from benzene + 1 from CHO), which does not match the given total of 8 carbons.  
   - **Eliminated**.

   - The peak at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) corresponds to a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (e.g., COCH3).  
   - This structure fits the criteria: benzene (6 carbons) + COCH3 (2 carbons) = 8 carbons total.  
   - The halogen substituent (e.g., Cl or Br) does not directly appear in the 1H NMR but would contribute to the aromatic chemical shifts and the IR peak for the C-X bond.  
   - **Matches all criteria**.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks at 6.9 ppm (1H, s), 4.8 ppm (2H, d), and 4.6 ppm (2H, d) suggest a structure with an aromatic proton and OCH2 groups, inconsistent with the presence of a carbonyl group.  
   - **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion:
The correct structure is a para-substituted benzene with a COCH3 group and a halogen substituent. The NMR data in **Option C** matches this structure, with two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl.
