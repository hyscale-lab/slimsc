Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them, which makes me think Y is probably a common element that can form multiple fluorides. Common ones could be like oxygen, but fluorine is a halogen, so maybe something else. Wait, maybe Y is another halogen like chlorine? Or perhaps an alkali or alkaline earth metal? Hmm, not sure yet.

So, the problem describes several substances, A1 to A5, each with different properties. Let me parse each line.

Starting with A1: It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, but it can form compounds, like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. Wait, but if A1 is oxidizing Xe, that suggests A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so maybe A1 is a fluoride with a high oxidation state of Y.

Wait, but fluorine is the other element in the compounds. So Y is in different oxidation states. Let me think: if Y is oxygen, but fluorine and oxygen can't form binary compounds because O is more electronegative, but actually, F2O, F2O2, etc., are known but not common. Alternatively, Y could be another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen? But wait, when fluorine is combined with oxygen, they form compounds like F2O, F2O2, but I'm not sure about their properties. Alternatively, maybe Y is another halogen like chlorine, so we have ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc. But then, how many binary compounds are there? Let's see: Cl can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7? Wait, I'm not sure about ClF7. Alternatively, maybe Y is nitrogen? Hmm, but nitrogen and fluorine can form various compounds, but I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is an alkali metal like sodium? Then the compounds would be NaF, NaF2, etc. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the decomposition of A1. It decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So A1 must contain more fluorine, and when it breaks down, it releases F2. So the reaction would be something like YF_x → YF_y + F2. For example, if YF3 decomposes into YF and F2? Or perhaps YF5 decomposes into YF3 and F2.

Wait, but the oF (oxidation state?) of A2 is 31.96%. Wait, I think oF might be the oxidation number. Wait, 31.96% as a percentage? Hmm, that's about 0.32 when converted to a decimal, but oxidation states are integers. Wait, perhaps that's the percentage of fluorine by mass. Oh, wait, that makes more sense. So, the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2 is 31.96%. Let me calculate what that implies about the molecular formula.

Alternatively, maybe oF stands for oxidation state of F in A2. Wait, fluorine usually has an oxidation state of -1. But wait, sometimes it can be higher, like in certain compounds. Hmm, but for most fluorides, F is -1.

Wait, maybe the given 31.96% is the mass percentage of fluorine in A2. Let me think. So, if A2 is a binary compound of Y and F, and F is 31.96% by mass, then I can find the ratio of Y to F.

Assuming A2 is YF_x. The mass percent of F is (x * atomic mass of F) / (atomic mass of Y + x * atomic mass of F) ) * 100% = 31.96%.

Atomic mass of F is about 19 g/mol. Let me denote Y's atomic mass as M. So:

(x * 19) / (M + x * 19) ) = 0.3196

Let me solve for M in terms of x.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

x *19 = 0.3196 * (M + x *19)

Divide both sides by 19:

x = (0.3196/19) (M + x *19)

Wait, perhaps it's better to rearrange:

x *19 = 0.3196 * M + 0.3196 x *19

Bring terms involving M to one side and the rest to the other:

x *19 - 0.3196 x *19 = 0.3196 M

Factor x*19:

x *19 (1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196 M

1 - 0.3196 = 0.6804

So,

x *19 * 0.6804 = 0.3196 M

Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals:

x *19 *6804 = 3196 M

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute numerically.

Let me compute 0.3196 as approximately 0.32.

So,

x *19 = 0.32 (M + x *19)

Multiply out:

19x = 0.32 M + 6.08 x

Bring terms:

19x -6.08x = 0.32 M

12.92 x = 0.32 M

M = (12.92 / 0.32) x

Compute 12.92 / 0.32:

0.32 *40 =12.8, so 12.92 is a bit more than 40, say approx 40.375.

So M ≈40.375 x.

But M is the atomic mass of Y. Let's think about possible Y with M around 40 x.

Wait, possible Y could be something like Cl, which is about 35.5. Or perhaps O is about 16, but wait:

Wait, if Y is Cl (atomic mass ~35.5), then M =35.5.

So:

35.5 =40.375 x → x≈35.5 /40.375 ≈0.88. But x has to be an integer, so maybe x=1?

Hmm, but that would imply M≈40.375. So Y's atomic mass is about 40.375. That's around 40, which is close to the atomic mass of calcium (40.08). Alternatively, maybe it's not Cl but another element.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Maybe A1 is ClF3, but when it decomposes, it produces ClF and F2. Or perhaps Y is oxygen. Let me think: if Y is O, then O has atomic mass ~16. So M=16.

So,

16 =40.375 x → x≈0.396. Hmm, that's not possible because x must be an integer, and 0.396 is less than 1. So Y can't be O in this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me try again.

The equation: (x *19)/(M +x *19) =0.3196

Multiply both sides by denominator:

x*19 = 0.3196 (M + x*19)

Expand:

x*19 =0.3196 M + 0.3196 *19 x

Bring terms with M to left, others to right:

x*19 - 0.3196*19 x =0.3196 M

Factor x*19:

x*19*(1 -0.3196) =0.3196 M

Compute 1-0.3196=0.6804.

So,

x *19 *0.6804 =0.3196 M

Compute 19 *0.6804 ≈13. (19 *0.68 is 12.92)

So,

x *12.92 ≈0.3196 M → M≈ (12.92 /0.3196) x → M≈40.46 x.

So M must be approximately 40.46 times x.

Wait, but M is the atomic mass of Y, which is probably an element with a mass around 40 or so. So Y could be something like calcium (40.08) or perhaps another element.

If x is 1: M≈40.46 → Y is Ca.

If x is 2: M≈80.92. That's too high, since most common elements are under 100.

So x must be 1, and Y is Ca.

Wait, but then A2 would be CaF. But calcium typically forms CaF2. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if A2 is CaF, but in reality, CaF2 is the common compound. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Let me think, maybe Y is sulfur, atomic mass ~32. So M=32.

Then,

32=40.46 x → x≈0.79. Hmm, not possible, so the only possibility is x=1 and Y with M≈40.46, which is around calcium.

But wait, let me think again about the initial decomposition. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, like CaF3, decomposing into CaF and F2? But Ca typically doesn't form CaF3. Wait, maybe I should think of Y as chlorine.

If Y is Cl, atomic mass ~35.5. So,

35.5 =40.46 x → x≈0.876. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of another angle.

A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon can form fluorides such as XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. So if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a highly oxidized fluoride. For example, XeF6 is a strong oxidizing agent. But wait, the problem says A1 is a binary compound of Y and F, not Xe and F. So Y must be another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is O? Because O can form OF2, which is a strong oxidizing agent. OF2 is a yellowish gas, but the question says A1 is bright red. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is Cl. ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent, but I don't know its color.

Wait, ClF3 is a pale yellow-green liquid, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the decomposition: A1 → A2 + F2.

If A1 is ClF3, perhaps it decomposes into ClF and F2. But ClF is not stable. Alternatively, ClF3 might decompose into Cl2 and F2 under certain conditions, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, like ClF5. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another element, like S. So A1 is SF6? Wait, but SF6 is a gas, not a bright red solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think about the reaction where adding Y to a solution of A4 gives A5, which then decomposes into two substances in water. That sounds familiar. Maybe it's a double displacement reaction or something.

Wait, when you add Y (element) to a solution of a salt, you might get a precipitation or a redox reaction. For example, if Y is a metal, adding it to a solution might displace another ion.

Wait, let me think about the fifth point. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

So if A4 is a salt, adding Y (maybe a metal) could result in a different salt. For example, suppose A4 is a nitrate salt, and Y is sodium—maybe not. Alternatively, if A4 is a sulfate, adding Y (like sodium) might not do much. Alternatively, maybe A4 is a sulfonic acid or something else.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a metal fluoride. For example, if Y is sodium (Na), and A4 is NaF. But adding Na to NaF solution in a 1:1 ratio would not change much. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, let me think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is something like CaCl2·2H2O, which upon decomposition gives CaCl2 and water. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, Y reacts with F2 to form A3. If Y is a metal, the fluorination would form a fluoride, like YF, YF2, etc.

So, A3 is YF_x. Now, A3 can interact with xenon. Xenon is a noble gas and can form compounds, but perhaps A3 is a strong enough oxidizing agent to react with Xe.

Wait, but Y is another element. Hmm.

Let me try to summarize:

- Five binary compounds of Y and F exist.

So Y must be an element that can form multiple fluorides. Candidates include Cl (ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7?), O (maybe O can form multiple fluorides, but I'm not sure), or perhaps S (but I don't recall multiple sulfurs with F).

Wait, another element that forms multiple fluorides is carbon. But carbon's fluorides are generally not common. Alternatively, maybe Y is nitrogen. Nitrogen can form NF3, but I'm not sure about others.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another halogen, like bromine or iodine. Let me think: I don't think they form multiple binary fluorides beyond their diatomic and triatomic forms, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alkali metal like sodium, which can form NaF and perhaps more complex fluorides, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. Let's say A1 is YF4, which decomposes into YF2 and F2. So, YF4 → YF2 + F2↑.

In that case, the fluorine percentage in A2 (YF2) would be: (2*19)/(M_Y + 2*19) ) *100% =31.96%.

So, let me compute that.

(38)/(M +38) )=0.3196 → 38 =0.3196 (M +38)

Divide both sides by 0.3196: 38/0.3196 ≈ 118.9 = M +38 → M≈118.9 -38=80.9.

So Y's atomic mass would be about 80.9. What element has an atomic mass around 81? That's probably Y is Br, which has an atomic mass of about 79.9 (so around 80). So Y is Br.

Let me test this:

If Y is Br, then A2 is BrF2.

Fluorine percentage in BrF2 is (2*19)/(80 + 38) ) *100% = (38/118)*100 ≈32.2%, which is close to 31.96%. So that fits.

So Y is Br.

So A2 is BrF2.

Then, A1 is BrF4. Because BrF4 would decompose into BrF2 and F2.

BrF4 → BrF2 + F2↑.

That makes sense.

So, now, A1 is BrF4. It is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K. Wait, I'm not sure about the color of BrF4, but let's proceed.

A1 oxidizes xenon. So BrF4 is a strong oxidizing agent, which can oxidize Xe to XeF2 or higher fluorides.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Br. So Br reacts with F2 to form A3. So A3 could be BrF, BrF3, or BrF5, etc. But which one? It's said that A3 can also interact with xenon. So perhaps A3 is BrF3, which is a strong fluorinating agent and could react with Xe.

Wait, but BrF3 is a liquid or gas? I think it's a liquid. It's a powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agent.

So yes, A3 is BrF3.

Moving on, when Y (Br) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed.

Wait, Br is being added to a solution of A4. What could A4 be?

If the solution is colorless and concentrated, perhaps it's a solution of a bromide salt. But adding Br metal would not do much unless it's a redox reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a bromate or some other compound. Wait, but adding Br metal to a bromate solution would displace O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrO4 (bromic acid). But I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, A4 is a solution of a bromide salt, like KBr.

Wait, if A4 is a bromide salt (like KBr), adding Br metal (in 1:1 ratio) would not change much because Br2 is more reactive than KBr, so KBr would be oxidized. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal bromide. Let's say A4 is AlBr3. Adding Br metal would not react, as Al is more reactive than Br.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt that, when Br is added, produces another compound.

Wait, the result of adding Br to A4's solution is A5, which decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A5 is a different bromide or a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is HBrO4 (bromic acid). Adding Br metal (Br2) in a 1:1 molar ratio might not react, but if it's a concentrated solution, maybe it undergoes some reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is HBrO3, and adding Br2 leads to HBrO4 and other products. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a bromide salt, and adding Br metal in a 1:1 ratio leads to a different bromide. For example, if A4 is NaBr, adding Br metal might not do much unless in a redox reaction.

Wait, another thought: when Y (Br) is added to a solution of A4, perhaps it's a precipitation reaction. For example, if A4 is a nitrate, adding Br metal might precipitate a bromide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of H2O. No, that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of a bromide salt, and adding Br metal would lead to a more complex bromide, but I'm not sure about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a synthesis of a different bromide. For example, if A4 is NaBrO3, adding Br metal could reduce it to NaBr. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps adding Br metal to a concentrated solution of HBrO4 (a strong acid) would not react, as HBrO4 is a strong acid and Br metal is less reactive.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the decomposition of A5 in water. It produces two substances. So A5 could be a salt that, when dissolved in water, decomposes into two ions, or perhaps a gas is released.

Wait, maybe A5 is a bromide of a metal that reacts with water. For example, if A5 is CaBr2, but that's not a decomposition.

Alternatively, suppose A4 is a solution of a bromide salt, like AlBr3. Adding Br metal (Br2) might not react, but perhaps in a hot concentrated solution, some reaction occurs.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options given for the molecular weight of A4.

The options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

So, I need to find the molecular weight of A4. If Y is Br, then A4 is a compound of Br and F.

Wait, A4 is in a solution, and adding Br metal (1:1) gives A5. So, perhaps A4 is a higher fluoride of Br, like BrF5. Because BrF5 is a known compound.

Wait, but let me think: if A4 is BrF5, adding Br metal (Br2) in a 1:1 molar ratio would lead to what?

The reaction could be:

BrF5 + Br → ?

But I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a bromide salt that reacts with Br metal to form another bromide.

Wait, maybe A4 is a solution of a bromide, like AgBr. Then adding Br metal might not do much. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a bromate, like KBrO3. Adding Br metal could lead to a reduction or oxidation reaction. For example, KBrO3 + Br → ?

But I'm not certain about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrO4. When Br metal is added, perhaps it doesn't react because HBrO4 is a strong acid and Br is less reactive.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to the next part. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, perhaps A5 is a salt that is unstable in water and breaks down. For example, if A5 is AgBr, but that's not soluble in water. Hmm.

Alternatively, if A5 is CaBr2, that's soluble in water and dissociates into Ca^2+ and 2Br^-, but that's just a dissolution, not decomposition.

Wait, another thought: if A4 is a bromide salt that, when Br is added, produces BrF3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different compound. Maybe it's a fluoride salt. For example, if A4 is NaF, adding Br metal wouldn't react. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures.

A4 must be a binary compound of Br and F. The options given are about the molecular weight of A4. So possible candidates are BrF, BrF3, BrF5, etc.

If Y is Br, then A4 is a binary compound. Let's compute molecular weights:

Br atomic weight ≈80, F≈19.

BrF: 80 +19=99 → option D (110-130) is close but lower than 99. So not matching.

BrF3: 80 + 3*19=80+57=137 → which falls into option C (160-180? No, 137 is between 110-130 (option D) and 140-160 (option A)).

Wait, 137 is between 110-130 (option D) and 130-140 would be option A's lower end. Hmm.

Alternatively, BrF5: 80 +5*19=80+95=175. That falls into option C (160-180) and option B is higher.

So, if A4 is BrF3, molecular weight is 137, which is in option D (110-130) is 130, so 137 is just above. Hmm, the options are ranges.

So 137 is between 130 and 140, which would be in the 140-160 range (option A starts at 140).

So if A4 is BrF3, its molecular weight is 137, which is just below option A's lower bound.

Alternatively, if A4 is BrF5, molecular weight 175, which falls into option C (160-180).

Wait, but how do we determine which one it is?

Let me think about the earlier parts. A1 is BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2. So A2 is BrF2, which has a molecular weight of 80 + (2*19)= 118.

Wait, earlier in the problem, the fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.96%, which matches BrF2.

So A2 is BrF2, which is correct.

Then, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Br). So Y (Br) + F2 → BrF3? Because BrF3 is a product of Br and F2.

Wait, but BrF3 is formed when Br is fluorinated with excess F2? Or maybe it's the product when Br is reacted with F2 in a certain proportion.

Alternatively, perhaps A3 is BrF, but that's less likely as BrF is unstable.

Alternatively, A3 could be BrF5, but that requires more F2.

Wait, but when you fluorinate Br, the product is likely BrF3, as it's a common fluoride.

So, A3 is BrF3.

Then, A4 is another binary compound. The options are about A4's molecular weight.

If A4 is BrF5, molecular weight is 80 +5*19=175. That falls into option C (160-180).

If A4 is BrF3, then 137, which would be option D (110-130) is just below, but perhaps the option includes it. Wait, the description says "range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls."

So 137 is between 130 and 140. So looking at the options:

A) 140-160 → 140 and up.

B) 220-240 → higher.

C) 160-180 → 160 and up.

D) 110-130 → 130 and below.

So 137 would be in the 140-160 (option A) or in D's upper end. But D ends at 130, so 137 is above that. So perhaps the correct option is A (140-160) for BrF3? No, wait, BrF3 is 137, which is between 130 and 140. So none of the options directly cover that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let me think about other possibilities.

If Y is Br, then another binary compound could be BrF5, which is 175 g/mol. So that would fall into option C (160-180).

But how does that fit into the situation?

When Y (Br) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4 (BrF5?), what happens?

Wait, adding Br metal to BrF5 solution might not react, but perhaps in a concentrated solution, maybe some reaction occurs, like:

BrF5 + Br → ?

But I'm not sure about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a bromide salt, like KBrF4 or something else, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of another compound. Maybe it's a solution of HBrO4. Adding Br metal (Br2) might not react.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is BrF5, it's a liquid, but in water, it might react as a strong acid.

Wait, BrF5 reacts with water to produce HBrO4 (bromic acid) and HF. Let me write the reaction:

BrF5 + H2O → HBrO4 + 2 HF + ½ O2 ?

Wait, I'm not certain about the exact reaction, but BrF5 can hydrolyze in water to form HBrO4 and HF, and possibly oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is another compound. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps when Y (Br) is added to A4's solution, a displacement reaction occurs. For example, if A4 is a bromide salt, like AgBr, adding Br might not do anything. But if A4 is a higher bromide, like KBrO3, adding Br could reduce it.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrO4. Adding Br metal wouldn't react, as HBrO4 is a strong acid and Br is less reactive.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options for molecular weight of A4 are:

A) 140-160 → BrF3 is 137, which is just below. BrF5 is 175, which is in option C.

So if A4 is BrF5, then the molecular weight is 175, which falls into option C (160-180).

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is BrF4, which is 80 + 4*19=156. That's in option A (140-160). Hmm, 156 is within 140-160.

Wait, BrF4 has a molecular weight of 80 + (4*19)=80+76=156. So that falls into option A.

So, let me reevaluate.

If A4 is BrF4, which is a binary compound of Br and F.

When Y (Br) is added in 1:1 ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of BrF4, what happens? Maybe it's a decomposition reaction.

Wait, perhaps adding Br to BrF4 in a concentrated solution might not do much, but perhaps it's a redox reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps BrF4 is a solution of a salt, like KBrF4, and adding Br metal would not react.

I'm not sure, but given the options, if A4 is BrF4, its molecular weight is 156, which falls into option A (140-160).

Alternatively, if A4 is BrF3, 137, which would be between 130 and 140, but the options don't have a range that includes 137 except maybe option D (110-130), but 137 is above that.

So, perhaps A4 is BrF4, molecular weight 156, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I thought A1 was BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2. So A4 can't be BrF4 if A1 is already BrF4.

Wait, no, A1 is a specific compound, and A4 is another. So perhaps A4 is another fluoride, like BrF5, which has a molecular weight of 175.

So, if A4 is BrF5, then the molecular weight is 175, which falls into option C (160-180).

But earlier, I thought A1 is BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2. So then, A4 could be BrF5, which is another binary compound.

So, putting it all together, A4 has a molecular weight of 175, which is in option C.

So the correct option would be C) 160-180.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of bromine (Br) and fluorine (F). The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Information and Assumptions**:
   - Five binary compounds of Br and F exist.
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas.
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Br, and it can interact with xenon.
   - A4 is a binary compound of Br and F. When Br is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Y**:
   - Y is identified as bromine (Br), as it forms multiple binary compounds with fluorine and matches the decomposition and oxidation properties described.

3. **Analyzing A1, A2, and A3**:
   - A1 is identified as BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 (A2) and F2. The fluorine percentage in BrF2 is calculated to be approximately 31.96%, confirming A2 as BrF2.
   - A3 is identified as BrF3, a known strong oxidizing and fluorinating agent.

4. **Determining A4**:
   - A4 is another binary compound of Br and F. Possible candidates are BrF3, BrF4, and BrF5.
