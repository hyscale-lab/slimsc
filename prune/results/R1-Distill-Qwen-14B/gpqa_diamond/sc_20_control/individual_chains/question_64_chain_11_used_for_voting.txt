Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what I can do.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which together weigh 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes: the first has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second has Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. 

The results are that tube 1's weight increased by 3.60 grams, tube 3's weight increased by 0.80 grams (forming CuO), and tube 2's weight didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, I think the heating of the salts likely causes them to decompose or react, producing gases. The fact that only a mixture of gases is formed suggests that A and B are likely carbonates, bicarbonates, or maybe sulfites that release CO2 or SO2 upon heating.

When the gases pass through the first tube with Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous, it probably absorbs water. So if the weight increased by 3.60 grams, that might be water. Mg(ClO4)2 is a deliquescent substance; it absorbs water from the air, forming Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O.

Wait, but in the problem, the gases are passed through it, so the Mg(ClO4)2 would react with water vapor in the gases. So the gas mixture likely contains water vapor, which is captured by tube 1. So the 3.60g increase is H2O.

Next, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. Since it didn't gain any weight, that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas. Because if CO2 were present, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, increasing the tube's weight. But since there's no change, CO2 isn't present. So the original gases don't contain CO2, which probably rules out carbonates or bicarbonates for salts A and B.

Then, the third tube is red-hot copper. The gases passed through this caused the weight to increase by 0.80g, forming CuO. So something reacted with copper. Red hot copper can react with certain gases. For example, water vapor (H2O) might not react, but perhaps a gas like H2S could. Alternatively, maybe SO2 or another gas that can be oxidized by copper at high temperatures. Wait, but SO2 reacts with copper at high temperatures.

Wait, but the third tube's gain is 0.80g. Let's think: CuO is produced. So maybe the gas is H2S. Because when H2S is passed over hot copper, it can be oxidized to S, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the gas is H2O, it wouldn't react with copper unless perhaps in steam reforming, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the gas is a carbon monoxide or another reducing gas. But then again, I'm not sure. Let me think about the reactions.

Wait, another approach: the gases after the three tubes have only 2.24 liters left. Since gas C is at STP, 22.4 L is 1 mole, so 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So that's 0.1 moles of gas C remaining.

So let's think about the gases that passed through each tube.

First, the gases from A and B are a mixture. After passing through tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2), which absorbs H2O, the remaining gas would be the dry gases. So the H2O is captured, adding 3.60g, which is H2O.

Then, the dry gases go into tube 2, which is Ca(OH)2. No reaction, so the gas doesn't have CO2. So the initial gas has H2O and maybe another gas, perhaps SO2 or H2S or something else.

Then, the gas passes through red-hot copper. The weight increase is 0.80g, which suggests that 0.80g of gas was consumed and converted into something. Since CuO forms, the gas must be something that reacts with Cu to form CuO. For example, if the gas is H2S, then H2S + Cu → CuS (but I'm not sure about that). Alternatively, maybe the gas is SO2. Wait, SO2 when passed through red-hot copper... I'm not exactly sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is CO. Because CO can react with copper oxide. Wait, but the copper here is red-hot, so maybe the gas is H2O, which upon passing through red hot copper could cause some reaction. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps let's think about the reactions step by step.

In tube 1, Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs H2O. The increase is 3.6g, which is the mass of H2O. So moles of H2O would be 3.6g / 18g/mol = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 moles of H2O were in the gas mixture.

Then, the remaining gas is dry, as the H2O is removed. So the dry gas goes into tube 2, which has Ca(OH)2 solution. Since no change occurs, no CO2 is present, which suggests that the initial salts (A and B) don't produce CO2 upon heating. So perhaps they produce another gas, maybe SO2 or H2S.

But then, in tube 3, the gas reacts with red-hot copper, gaining 0.80g. Let's think about what 0.80g of gas would be. Let's calculate the moles.

Assuming that the gas is SO2: molar mass is 64g/mol. 0.8g would be 0.8 /64 = 0.0125 mol.

If the gas is H2S: molar mass is 34g/mol. 0.8/34 ≈ 0.0235 mol.

If the gas is CO: 28g/mol → 0.0286 mol.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is a combination, but perhaps it's a single gas reacting with the copper.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is that the gas is H2S, which is oxidized by the hot copper. H2S + Cu → CuS + H2. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another angle: when the gas passes through red-hot copper, the gas is consumed, and the copper is oxidized to CuO. So the reaction would be something like:

Gas + Cu → CuO + something.

If the gas is H2S, maybe:

H2S + Cu (hot) → CuS + H2↑ ?

Wait, but that would produce H2, which is a gas. But in the problem, after the third tube, only gas C remains, which is 2.24 L (0.1 mol) at STP. So maybe gas C is H2.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is SO2. SO2 could react with copper at high temperatures, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is SO2 + Cu → CuSO4 (if it's a sufficient condition), but that would require more SO2.

Wait, but if the gas is SO2, then perhaps the reaction is:

2 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuSO4 + O2↑. Wait, but that would produce O2, which is a gas, but in the end, only C remains. But the problem states that after the third tube, only gas C is left, which is 2.24 L (0.1 mol).

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a mixture of H2O and another gas, but the H2O is already absorbed in the first tube.

Wait, so the initial gases from salts A and B are H2O and another gas (say X). H2O is absorbed in tube 1, leaving X. Then X is passed through tube 2, which is Ca(OH)2. If X is, say, NH3, then Ca(OH)2 would react with NH3, but in the problem, tube 2's weight didn't change, so perhaps X isn't NH3.

Wait, maybe the other gas is H2S. So the initial gases are H2O and H2S. H2O is absorbed in tube 1, leaving H2S. Then, H2S is passed through Ca(OH)2 solution. H2S is a weak acid; it would react with Ca(OH)2:

H2S + Ca(OH)2 → CaS + 2 H2O.

So if that's the case, the weight of the tube would increase due to CaS and water. But in the problem, tube 2's weight didn't change, so perhaps that's not the case. Therefore, H2S isn't present, or perhaps tube 2 doesn't react with it. Alternatively, maybe the gas isn't H2S.

Wait, maybe the other gas is a hydrocarbon, but that seems less likely in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the other gas is NH3. But then, in tube 2, NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2, which would increase the tube's weight. But since the weight didn't change, NH3 isn't present. So that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: the other gas is hydrogen (H2). But then, H2 wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2; maybe it would just pass through. So, in that case, tube 2's weight wouldn't change. Then, when H2 passes through hot copper, perhaps there's a reaction. Let's think about that.

Hydrogen reacts with hot copper? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the third tube is where H2 is oxidized to water, but I thought tube 1 already took out the H2O.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is a mixture of H2O and CO. Then, CO would pass through tube 1, as H2O is absorbed, leaving CO. Then, CO wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2, so tube 2's weight remains the same. Then, in tube 3, CO would react with copper. I'm not sure about that, though. Wait, CO can act as a reducing agent. When CO is passed through hot CuO, it can reduce it to Cu. The reaction is:

CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

But in this case, the copper is already in the metal form, maybe as Cu metal. So perhaps the reaction is different. Alternatively, maybe CO doesn't react with copper metal.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should approach it differently.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. The initial gases from heating salts A and B contain H2O (from tube 1's gain) and another gas X. X doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 (so no CO2, as tube 2 didn't change), and X reacts with Cu to form CuO, and gas C is left.

2. The moles of H2O in tube 1: 3.6g → 3.6 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

3. The moles of X (the other gas) that reacted in tube 3: 0.8g. Let's find possible candidates.

Assume X is SO2: molar mass 64g/mol → 0.8g is 0.0125 mol.

Or, X is H2S: 34g/mol → ~0.0235 mol.

Or, X is CO: 28g/mol → ~0.0286 mol.

Now, what happens in tube 3? The gas X reacts with red-hot copper to form CuO and possibly another product, and gas C is left.

Suppose X is H2S. Then, reaction could be:

H2S + Cu → CuS + H2.

But then, the H2 would be gas C, which is 0.1 mol.

Wait, since 0.8g of H2S is about 0.0235 mol, and if the reaction produces H2, then according to the stoichiometry, how much H2 would be produced?

In the reaction, for each mole of H2S, you get 1 mole of H2. So 0.0235 mol H2S → 0.0235 mol H2. But the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol. So that would mean that more H2S reacted than that. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, if X is SO2, then in the presence of copper, perhaps it's oxidized to SO3 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's not reacting, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The total initial gas mixture has H2O (0.2 mol) and another gas X with 0.8g (let's say 0.0235 mol if it's H2S). After passing through all the tubes, the only remaining gas is C, which is 0.1 mol. So perhaps the initial X is 0.1235 mol? Because 0.0235 mol reacts, and 0.100 mol remains as C.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas X is something else.

Wait, maybe the gas X is hydrogen (H2). Let's see. If the tube 3's gain is 0.8g, which would be H2: 0.8g / 2g/mol = 0.4 mol. But that's much higher than the 0.8g, so probably not.

Wait, another thought: let's think about the total moles of gas after all the reactions.

The initial gas has 0.2 mol H2O and n mol of X. After tube 1, the H2O is removed, leaving X. Then, in tube 3, some of X is consumed, and gas C is released.

Assuming that all of X is consumed, but that leaves gas C. So perhaps X is completely consumed, and gas C is from some other source.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of gases, but I think the problem states it's a mixture, but the way it's written says a mixture of gases was formed, so perhaps more than one gas.

Wait, but the results after the three tubes: only gas C remains. So gas X is either fully consumed or leaves as gas C.

Wait, perhaps the initial mixture is H2O and X, which is a gas that doesn't react in tube 2 (so not CO2), and then in tube 3, X is consumed, leaving gas C.

Assuming X is SO2, which doesn't react with Ca(OH)2? Wait, that's not right because SO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaS and H2O. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change, so perhaps X isn't SO2.

Wait, perhaps X is H2S. Let me think again. H2S would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaS and water. But in the problem, the weight of tube 2 didn't change, so perhaps H2S isn't present. Unless the reaction didn't proceed, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another angle: what if salts A and B are sulfites or something else.

Wait, if A and B are sulfites, upon heating, they could decompose to produce SO2 and possibly other gases.

But wait, if the salts are sodium sulfite and something else, heating them might release SO2. But then, when SO2 is passed through Ca(OH)2 solution, it would form CaSO3 and water, which would cause tube 2's weight to increase. But the problem says tube 2's weight didn't change, so that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the salts are nitrates that decompose into NO or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the salts are basic carbonates. For example, sodium carbonate can decompose into sodium oxide and CO2. But then, the CO2 would be absorbed by Ca(OH)2, which would increase the weight. But since tube 2's weight didn't change, that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are bicarbonates. For example, sodium bicarbonate decomposes into sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O upon heating. Then, the CO2 would be captured by tube 2, but the problem says tube 2's weight didn't change, so that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the salts are nitrides or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the salts are ammonium salts, like ammonium carbonate, but upon heating, they release NH3 and CO2. But again, that would lead to reactions in tube 2.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the data given.

The total mass of salts A and B is 7.20 g, equimolar. Let's say each salt is M molar mass, and they are n moles each. So 2nM =7.20 g.

Wait, but without knowing the exact salts, this might not help directly.

Wait, the gases: after all the reactions, 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas C is left. Let's think about what gas C could be. It could be H2, O2, N2, etc.

But considering the reactions, perhaps it's H2. Because in the presence of red-hot copper, H2 might not react, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's CO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the tube 3 reaction again. The weight increases by 0.80 g, forming CuO. So the reaction must involve the gas and copper to form CuO.

One possibility is that the gas is H2O, but that's already absorbed in tube 1. So perhaps not.

Another possibility: the gas is H2S, and in tube 3, it's oxidized by copper to S, producing H2. Let me think about the reaction:

H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑.

The reaction would produce H2, which would be gas C. So 0.8g of H2S would produce some H2.

Wait, let's calculate that.

Molar mass of H2S is 34g/mol. 0.8g is 0.8/34 ≈ 0.0235 mol.

In the reaction, 1 mole of H2S produces 1 mole of H2.

So 0.0235 mol H2S → 0.0235 mol H2.

But the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol. So that's not matching up. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the gas is SO2. Let's think about SO2 and copper. Is there a reaction where SO2 reacts with copper to form CuO and another product, releasing gas C?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is: 4 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuSO4 + O2↑.

In that case, for every 4 moles of SO2, 2 moles of O2 are produced. But O2 is a gas, so if that's the case, the O2 would be gas C. Let's see if the moles make sense.

If the initial SO2 is 0.8g, that's 0.8 /64 = 0.0125 mol. According to the reaction, 4 SO2 → 2 O2, so per 4 moles of SO2, 2 moles of O2 are produced. So 0.0125 mol SO2 would produce (0.0125 * 2)/4 = 0.00625 mol O2. But the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol. So that doesn't add up.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me consider another angle.

The problem states that the initial mixture of salts A and B is equimolar, so let's assume each is n moles, so total moles is 2n.

Upon heating, they produce H2O and another gas X, which is captured in tube 3.

So, 0.2 moles of H2O and some moles of X.

In tube 3, X reacts with copper, and 0.8g is gained as CuO. Let's find out how much X reacted.

Assuming X is a gas that reacts with Cu to form CuO and releases gas C.

Suppose X is CO. The reaction could be:

CO + Cu → CuO + C (graphite).

But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here, and whether it produces any gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

2 CO + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + C (but this would produce solid carbon, so no gas would be left, which contradicts the 0.1 mol gas C).

Hmm. Maybe the reaction is:

H2 + Cu → Cu + H2↑. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the gas X is H2. Then, when H2 passes through hot Cu, it doesn't react. So gas C would be H2, and the 0.8g gain in tube 3 would have to come from another reaction. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas X is NH3. Then, when NH3 passes through hot copper, it doesn't react, so tube 3's weight doesn't change. But the problem says tube 3's weight increased by 0.8g, so that can't be it.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else, like O2. But O2 wouldn't react with copper unless it's in a specific condition. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is O2, but then it would not react with copper, so tube 3's weight wouldn't change. But in the problem, tube 3's weight did increase, so that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the total moles of each component.

From the initial salts, A and B, which together weigh 7.2g. They are equimolar, so let's say each has a molar mass of M. So 2nM =7.2 → n =7.2/(2M).

Upon heating, the salts decompose into H2O and another gas X.

The moles of H2O are 0.2 mol (3.6g /18g/mol). The moles of X are (assuming all X passed through and reacted) 0.8g/(molar mass of X).

But in the end, only gas C remains, which is 0.1 mol.

So perhaps the total moles of gas after decomposition were 0.2 (H2O) + x (X) = total.

But after passing through the tubes, H2O is removed (0.2 mol), X is partially or fully reacted, leaving gas C as 0.1 mol.

Wait, but before, the gases passed through tube 1, which removed H2O, leaving X. Then, X passed through tube 3, which gained 0.8g. So perhaps X is a gas that reacts in tube 3, producing CuO and gas C.

So the initial moles of X would be (mass of X) / molar mass of X.

Let's suppose X is SO2. Then, 0.8g is 0.8/64 = 0.0125 mol.

In tube 3, the reaction is 4 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuSO4 + O2↑.

So for each mole of SO2, we get 0.5 mole of O2. So 0.0125 mol SO2 would produce 0.00625 mol O2, which is 0.00625 *32 =0.2g, but the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol, which would be 2.24 L. That doesn't match, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, if X is H2S, 0.8g is 0.0235 mol.

If the reaction is H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑, then 0.0235 mol H2S would produce 0.0235 mol H2, which is 0.0235 *2 =0.047g. But problem states gas C is 0.1 mol, which is much larger, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is 2 H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑ + S↓. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry, and it's getting complicated.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the gas X is something else. Let me think about the moles involved.

The initial moles of X would be (mass of X) =0.8g. Let's call molar mass of X as Mx. So moles x =0.8 / Mx.

In the reaction in tube3, suppose a moles of X react to form a certain product and generate gas C.

But I'm not sure, so perhaps I'll have to make an assumption. Let me try to think that the gas X is H2S, and the reaction is:

H2S + Cu → CuS + H2.

In this case, the moles of H2S is 0.0235 mol, which would produce 0.0235 mol H2 (gas C). But the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol, so that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 H2S + 3 Cu → 3 CuS + H2↑. Then, for 0.0235 mol H2S, moles of H2 would be 0.0235 * (1/2) = 0.01175 mol. Still less than 0.1.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the reaction is different. Let's think about the other possibility: that the gas X is a mixture of H2O and another gas, but that doesn't seem to fit with the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas X is a combination of two gases, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the total moles of gas C is 0.1 mol. Let's think about what that could be.

If gas C is H2, then 0.1 mol H2 is 0.2g, which is possible.

If gas C is O2, then 0.1 mol is 3.2g, which seems a lot, but perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the reaction in tube 3 is that X reacts with Cu to form CuO and produces O2.

For example, if X is H2O, but that was already captured in tube 1. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if X is O2, then it wouldn't react with Cu, so no weight gain. So that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another angle.

Let me think about the overall process.

The initial salts A and B are heated to produce H2O and another gas X. The H2O is captured in tube 1, so X is the only gas left before tube 3.

In tube 3, X reacts with Cu, causing a weight gain of 0.8g as CuO. The reaction must produce gas C, which is 0.1 mol.

Possible reaction: X is SO2, which upon heating with Cu produces CuSO4 and O2.

But earlier, that didn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydrocarbon, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

2 H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑.

In this case, 2 moles of H2S produce 1 mole of H2. So 0.8g H2S is 0.8 /34 ≈ 0.0235 mol. Then, moles of H2 would be 0.0235 * (1/2) =0.01175 mol, which is about 0.25 L at STP. But the problem says gas C is 2.24 L (0.1 mol). So that doesn't match.

Hmm. Maybe the initial assumption that X is H2S is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the gas X is a mixture of H2O and another gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different gas, like ammonia (NH3), but earlier analysis suggested that wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the salts A and B are such that upon heating, they release H2O and another gas, say, Cl2, but I don't think that would react with Cu.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the salt is sodium carbonate and another carbonate. But heating them would release CO2, which would react in tube 2, which it didn't, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the salts are metal nitrides. For example, Ca3N2 upon heating with water would produce NH3 and CaO. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are ammonium carbonate, which upon heating would release NH3, CO2, and H2O. But then, NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2, leading to a weight gain, which didn't happen, so that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm not making progress on the gas identification. Let's try to think about the possible answer options.

The options for the total number of atoms in salts A and B are 13, 17, 15, or 19.

So perhaps the salts are simple, like NaHCO3 and something else. Let me compute the molar masses.

Wait, if the salts are NaHCO3 and something else, like KNO3.

But in any case, perhaps the salts are such that each has a formula where the total number of atoms is, say, 8 (like NaHCO3 has 5 atoms) and another salt with 5 atoms, giving a total of 10. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the salts are KNO3 and NaNO3. Each is KNO3 → K, N, 3 O → 4 atoms. So two moles would be 8 atoms. But the options don't have 8.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are Na2CO3 (3 atoms: Na, C, O3) and something else. Wait, Na2CO3 has 2 Na, 1 C, 3 O → 6 atoms per formula unit.

Wait, perhaps the salts are Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. Let's compute moles.

Wait, the total weight is 7.20g, equimolar.

Let me suppose each salt is n moles. So 2n(M_A + M_B) =7.20g.

But without knowing the salts, perhaps it's hard to proceed.

Wait, maybe the salts are CaCO3 and MgCO3. Each would have 5 atoms per formula unit. So each salt has 5 atoms, so per mole, 5 atoms. If the salts are equimolar, total atoms per mole would be 5 +5 =10. For n moles, 10n atoms.

If the total weight is 7.2g, what's n?

Each mole of CaCO3 is 100g/mol. MgCO3 is 84g/mol. Let's say n is the moles of each.

So total weight is n*(100 +84) = 184n =7.2 → n=7.2/184≈0.039 mol. So atoms would be 10 *0.039≈0.39 mol. But the options are for the total number of atoms in the salts, not per mole. Wait, no: the question is "the total number of all atoms in salts A and B." So perhaps per formula unit.

Wait, but the problem says "the total number of all atoms in salts A and B." So for example, if each salt is NaCl (2 atoms), and you have n moles of each, total atoms would be 2n +2n =4n.

But the options are 13, 19, 17, 15, which are all odd numbers, suggesting that each salt has an odd number of atoms per formula unit.

Hmm, perhaps salts have formula units with 5 and 7 atoms, leading to 12 atoms per two salts. Or maybe 6 and 7 per salt, leading to 13 atoms. Wait, but the options are 13, 15, 17, 19.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the salts are such that each has a formula with (x + y) atoms, and when added, the total is an option number. For example, if each salt has 8 atoms, the total would be 16 per 2 salts. But 16 isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 8 and 7 atoms, totaling 15.

But I'm not sure. Perhaps the correct answer is 15 atoms, which is option D.

But I'm not confident. Let me try to think about the steps again.

Wait, perhaps the initial salts are sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and something else. NaHCO3 has 5 atoms per formula unit. Suppose the other salt is, say, MgCO3, which has 5 atoms as well. So each salt contributes 5 atoms, and since they're equimolar, total atoms per mole of mixture would be 5 +5=10 atoms. For 7.2g, let's compute moles.

NaHCO3 molar mass=84g/mol. MgCO3=84g/mol as well. So each is 84g/mol.

Wait, if each is 84g/mol, and equimolar, then total for two moles would be 84*2=168g. But that's way more than 7.2g. So n would be 7.2/(2*84) )= 7.2/168 = 0.04286 moles each.

So atoms per mole: each salt is 5 atoms, so two salts → 10 atoms. So 0.04286 moles × 10 atoms/mol = 0.4286 moles of atoms. But the question is asking for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which are 7.2g. So the number would be moles × atoms per molecule.

Wait, but in the salts, each molecule has a certain number of atoms. So, for example, NaHCO3 has 5 atoms, so moles of NaHCO3 ×5 atoms.

If the salts are A and B, each with 5 atoms, and equimolar, then for n moles of each, total atoms would be (5n +5n)=10n.

Total weight is (n * M_A) + (n * M_B) )=7.2g. If M_A and M_B are both, say, 84g/mol, then 2n*84=7.2 → n=0.04286. So atoms would be 10 *0.04286 ≈0.4286 mol. But that's the number of atoms, and the options are about the total number of atoms, but not per mole. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all atoms in the salts, regardless of moles. But that doesn't make much sense because atoms are counted per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is indicating that the salts A and B each have a certain number of atoms per formula unit, and the total is one of the options. For example, if one salt has 8 atoms and the other has 7, the total would be 15.

So perhaps the correct answer is 15 atoms, option D.

The problem involves determining the total number of atoms in an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which weigh 7.20 g. Upon heating, the salts produce a mixture of gases. These gases pass through three tubes:  

1. **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: The weight increases by 3.60 g, indicating the absorption of water (H₂O). The moles of H₂O are calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂O} = \frac{3.60 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.2 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: The weight remains unchanged, indicating no CO₂ is present in the gas mixture.

3. **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The weight increases by 0.80 g, forming CuO. This suggests the presence of a gas that reacts with copper to form CuO. The moles of this gas (X) are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of X} = \frac{0.80 \, \text{g}}{\text{Molar mass of X}}.
   \]

After passing through all three tubes, only 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure. This indicates that gas C is likely a simple gas like H₂, O₂, or another light gas.  

The salts A and B are equimolar, and their total mass is 7.20 g. Let the molar mass of each salt be \( M \). The total moles of the salts are:  
\[
\text{Total moles} = \frac{7.20 \, \text{g}}{2M}.
\]

The problem requires determining the total number of atoms in salts A and B. The options provided (13, 17, 15, 19) suggest that the salts have a specific number of atoms per formula unit. For example, if each salt has 8 atoms, the total number of atoms in the mixture would be:  
\[
\text{Total atoms} = 2 \times 8 = 16.
\]
However, this does not match the options. If one salt has 7 atoms and the other has 8, the total number of atoms would be:  
\[
\text{Total atoms} = 7 + 8 = 15.
\]

This matches one of the options. Based on the reasoning and the constraints of the problem, the most plausible answer is that the total number of atoms in salts A and B is **15**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what I can do.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which together weigh 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes: the first has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second has Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. 

The results are that tube 1's weight increased by 3.60 grams, tube 3's weight increased by 0.80 grams (forming CuO), and tube 2's weight didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, I think the heating of the salts likely causes them to decompose or react, producing gases. The fact that only a mixture of gases is formed suggests that A and B are likely carbonates, bicarbonates, or maybe sulfites that release CO2 or SO2 upon heating.

When the gases pass through the first tube with Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous, it probably absorbs water. So if the weight increased by 3.60 grams, that might be water. Mg(ClO4)2 is a deliquescent substance; it absorbs water from the air, forming Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O.

Wait, but in the problem, the gases are passed through it, so the Mg(ClO4)2 would react with water vapor in the gases. So the gas mixture likely contains water vapor, which is captured by tube 1. So the 3.60g increase is H2O.

Next, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. Since it didn't gain any weight, that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas. Because if CO2 were present, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, increasing the tube's weight. But since there's no change, CO2 isn't present. So the original gases don't contain CO2, which probably rules out carbonates or bicarbonates for salts A and B.

Then, the third tube is red-hot copper. The gases passed through this caused the weight to increase by 0.80g, forming CuO. So something reacted with copper. Red hot copper can react with certain gases. For example, water vapor (H2O) might not react, but perhaps a gas like H2S could. Alternatively, maybe SO2 or another gas that can be oxidized by copper at high temperatures. Wait, but SO2 reacts with copper at high temperatures.

Wait, but the third tube's gain is 0.80g. Let's think: CuO is produced. So maybe the gas is H2S. Because when H2S is passed over hot copper, it can be oxidized to S, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the gas is H2O, it wouldn't react with copper unless perhaps in steam reforming, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the gas is a carbon monoxide or another reducing gas. But then again, I'm not sure. Let me think about the reactions.

Wait, another approach: the gases after the three tubes have only 2.24 liters left. Since gas C is at STP, 22.4 L is 1 mole, so 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So that's 0.1 moles of gas C remaining.

So let's think about the gases that passed through each tube.

First, the gases from A and B are a mixture. After passing through tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2), which absorbs H2O, the remaining gas would be the dry gases. So the H2O is captured, adding 3.60g, which is H2O.

Then, the dry gases go into tube 2, which is Ca(OH)2. No reaction, so the gas doesn't have CO2. So the initial gas has H2O and maybe another gas, perhaps SO2 or H2S or something else.

Then, the gas passes through red-hot copper. The weight increase is 0.80g, which suggests that 0.80g of gas was consumed and converted into something. Since CuO forms, the gas must be something that reacts with Cu to form CuO. For example, if the gas is H2S, then H2S + Cu → CuS (but I'm not sure about that). Alternatively, maybe the gas is SO2. Wait, SO2 when passed through red-hot copper... I'm not exactly sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is CO. Because CO can react with copper oxide. Wait, but the copper here is red-hot, so maybe the gas is H2O, which upon passing through red hot copper could cause some reaction. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps let's think about the reactions step by step.

In tube 1, Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs H2O. The increase is 3.6g, which is the mass of H2O. So moles of H2O would be 3.6g / 18g/mol = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 moles of H2O were in the gas mixture.

Then, the remaining gas is dry, as the H2O is removed. So the dry gas goes into tube 2, which has Ca(OH)2 solution. Since no change occurs, no CO2 is present, which suggests that the initial salts (A and B) don't produce CO2 upon heating. So perhaps they produce another gas, maybe SO2 or H2S.

But then, in tube 3, the gas reacts with red-hot copper, gaining 0.80g. Let's think about what 0.80g of gas would be. Let's calculate the moles.

Assuming that the gas is SO2: molar mass is 64g/mol. 0.8g would be 0.8 /64 = 0.0125 mol.

If the gas is H2S: molar mass is 34g/mol. 0.8/34 ≈ 0.0235 mol.

If the gas is CO: 28g/mol → 0.0286 mol.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is a combination, but perhaps it's a single gas reacting with the copper.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is that the gas is H2S, which is oxidized by the hot copper. H2S + Cu → CuS + H2. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another angle: when the gas passes through red-hot copper, the gas is consumed, and the copper is oxidized to CuO. So the reaction would be something like:

Gas + Cu → CuO + something.

If the gas is H2S, maybe:

H2S + Cu (hot) → CuS + H2↑ ?

Wait, but that would produce H2, which is a gas. But in the problem, after the third tube, only gas C remains, which is 2.24 L (0.1 mol) at STP. So maybe gas C is H2.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is SO2. SO2 could react with copper at high temperatures, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is SO2 + Cu → CuSO4 (if it's a sufficient condition), but that would require more SO2.

Wait, but if the gas is SO2, then perhaps the reaction is:

2 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuSO4 + O2↑. Wait, but that would produce O2, which is a gas, but in the end, only C remains. But the problem states that after the third tube, only gas C is left, which is 2.24 L (0.1 mol).

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a mixture of H2O and another gas, but the H2O is already absorbed in the first tube.

Wait, so the initial gases from salts A and B are H2O and another gas (say X). H2O is absorbed in tube 1, leaving X. Then X is passed through tube 2, which is Ca(OH)2. If X is, say, NH3, then Ca(OH)2 would react with NH3, but in the problem, tube 2's weight didn't change, so perhaps X isn't NH3.

Wait, maybe the other gas is H2S. So the initial gases are H2O and H2S. H2O is absorbed in tube 1, leaving H2S. Then, H2S is passed through Ca(OH)2 solution. H2S is a weak acid; it would react with Ca(OH)2:

H2S + Ca(OH)2 → CaS + 2 H2O.

So if that's the case, the weight of the tube would increase due to CaS and water. But in the problem, tube 2's weight didn't change, so perhaps that's not the case. Therefore, H2S isn't present, or perhaps tube 2 doesn't react with it. Alternatively, maybe the gas isn't H2S.

Wait, maybe the other gas is a hydrocarbon, but that seems less likely in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the other gas is NH3. But then, in tube 2, NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2, which would increase the tube's weight. But since the weight didn't change, NH3 isn't present. So that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: the other gas is hydrogen (H2). But then, H2 wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2; maybe it would just pass through. So, in that case, tube 2's weight wouldn't change. Then, when H2 passes through hot copper, perhaps there's a reaction. Let's think about that.

Hydrogen reacts with hot copper? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the third tube is where H2 is oxidized to water, but I thought tube 1 already took out the H2O.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is a mixture of H2O and CO. Then, CO would pass through tube 1, as H2O is absorbed, leaving CO. Then, CO wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2, so tube 2's weight remains the same. Then, in tube 3, CO would react with copper. I'm not sure about that, though. Wait, CO can act as a reducing agent. When CO is passed through hot CuO, it can reduce it to Cu. The reaction is:

CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

But in this case, the copper is already in the metal form, maybe as Cu metal. So perhaps the reaction is different. Alternatively, maybe CO doesn't react with copper metal.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should approach it differently.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. The initial gases from heating salts A and B contain H2O (from tube 1's gain) and another gas X. X doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 (so no CO2, as tube 2 didn't change), and X reacts with Cu to form CuO, and gas C is left.

2. The moles of H2O in tube 1: 3.6g → 3.6 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

3. The moles of X (the other gas) that reacted in tube 3: 0.8g. Let's find possible candidates.

Assume X is SO2: molar mass 64g/mol → 0.8g is 0.0125 mol.

Or, X is H2S: 34g/mol → ~0.0235 mol.

Or, X is CO: 28g/mol → ~0.0286 mol.

Now, what happens in tube 3? The gas X reacts with red-hot copper to form CuO and possibly another product, and gas C is left.

Suppose X is H2S. Then, reaction could be:

H2S + Cu → CuS + H2.

But then, the H2 would be gas C, which is 0.1 mol.

Wait, since 0.8g of H2S is about 0.0235 mol, and if the reaction produces H2, then according to the stoichiometry, how much H2 would be produced?

In the reaction, for each mole of H2S, you get 1 mole of H2. So 0.0235 mol H2S → 0.0235 mol H2. But the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol. So that would mean that more H2S reacted than that. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, if X is SO2, then in the presence of copper, perhaps it's oxidized to SO3 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's not reacting, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The total initial gas mixture has H2O (0.2 mol) and another gas X with 0.8g (let's say 0.0235 mol if it's H2S). After passing through all the tubes, the only remaining gas is C, which is 0.1 mol. So perhaps the initial X is 0.1235 mol? Because 0.0235 mol reacts, and 0.100 mol remains as C.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas X is something else.

Wait, maybe the gas X is hydrogen (H2). Let's see. If the tube 3's gain is 0.8g, which would be H2: 0.8g / 2g/mol = 0.4 mol. But that's much higher than the 0.8g, so probably not.

Wait, another thought: let's think about the total moles of gas after all the reactions.

The initial gas has 0.2 mol H2O and n mol of X. After tube 1, the H2O is removed, leaving X. Then, in tube 3, some of X is consumed, and gas C is released.

Assuming that all of X is consumed, but that leaves gas C. So perhaps X is completely consumed, and gas C is from some other source.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of gases, but I think the problem states it's a mixture, but the way it's written says a mixture of gases was formed, so perhaps more than one gas.

Wait, but the results after the three tubes: only gas C remains. So gas X is either fully consumed or leaves as gas C.

Wait, perhaps the initial mixture is H2O and X, which is a gas that doesn't react in tube 2 (so not CO2), and then in tube 3, X is consumed, leaving gas C.

Assuming X is SO2, which doesn't react with Ca(OH)2? Wait, that's not right because SO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaS and H2O. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change, so perhaps X isn't SO2.

Wait, perhaps X is H2S. Let me think again. H2S would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaS and water. But in the problem, the weight of tube 2 didn't change, so perhaps H2S isn't present. Unless the reaction didn't proceed, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another angle: what if salts A and B are sulfites or something else.

Wait, if A and B are sulfites, upon heating, they could decompose to produce SO2 and possibly other gases.

But wait, if the salts are sodium sulfite and something else, heating them might release SO2. But then, when SO2 is passed through Ca(OH)2 solution, it would form CaSO3 and water, which would cause tube 2's weight to increase. But the problem says tube 2's weight didn't change, so that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the salts are nitrates that decompose into NO or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the salts are basic carbonates. For example, sodium carbonate can decompose into sodium oxide and CO2. But then, the CO2 would be absorbed by Ca(OH)2, which would increase the weight. But since tube 2's weight didn't change, that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are bicarbonates. For example, sodium bicarbonate decomposes into sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O upon heating. Then, the CO2 would be captured by tube 2, but the problem says tube 2's weight didn't change, so that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the salts are nitrides or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the salts are ammonium salts, like ammonium carbonate, but upon heating, they release NH3 and CO2. But again, that would lead to reactions in tube 2.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the data given.

The total mass of salts A and B is 7.20 g, equimolar. Let's say each salt is M molar mass, and they are n moles each. So 2nM =7.20 g.

Wait, but without knowing the exact salts, this might not help directly.

Wait, the gases: after all the reactions, 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas C is left. Let's think about what gas C could be. It could be H2, O2, N2, etc.

But considering the reactions, perhaps it's H2. Because in the presence of red-hot copper, H2 might not react, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's CO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the tube 3 reaction again. The weight increases by 0.80 g, forming CuO. So the reaction must involve the gas and copper to form CuO.

One possibility is that the gas is H2O, but that's already absorbed in tube 1. So perhaps not.

Another possibility: the gas is H2S, and in tube 3, it's oxidized by copper to S, producing H2. Let me think about the reaction:

H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑.

The reaction would produce H2, which would be gas C. So 0.8g of H2S would produce some H2.

Wait, let's calculate that.

Molar mass of H2S is 34g/mol. 0.8g is 0.8/34 ≈ 0.0235 mol.

In the reaction, 1 mole of H2S produces 1 mole of H2.

So 0.0235 mol H2S → 0.0235 mol H2.

But the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol. So that's not matching up. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the gas is SO2. Let's think about SO2 and copper. Is there a reaction where SO2 reacts with copper to form CuO and another product, releasing gas C?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is: 4 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuSO4 + O2↑.

In that case, for every 4 moles of SO2, 2 moles of O2 are produced. But O2 is a gas, so if that's the case, the O2 would be gas C. Let's see if the moles make sense.

If the initial SO2 is 0.8g, that's 0.8 /64 = 0.0125 mol. According to the reaction, 4 SO2 → 2 O2, so per 4 moles of SO2, 2 moles of O2 are produced. So 0.0125 mol SO2 would produce (0.0125 * 2)/4 = 0.00625 mol O2. But the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol. So that doesn't add up.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me consider another angle.

The problem states that the initial mixture of salts A and B is equimolar, so let's assume each is n moles, so total moles is 2n.

Upon heating, they produce H2O and another gas X, which is captured in tube 3.

So, 0.2 moles of H2O and some moles of X.

In tube 3, X reacts with copper, and 0.8g is gained as CuO. Let's find out how much X reacted.

Assuming X is a gas that reacts with Cu to form CuO and releases gas C.

Suppose X is CO. The reaction could be:

CO + Cu → CuO + C (graphite).

But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here, and whether it produces any gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

2 CO + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + C (but this would produce solid carbon, so no gas would be left, which contradicts the 0.1 mol gas C).

Hmm. Maybe the reaction is:

H2 + Cu → Cu + H2↑. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the gas X is H2. Then, when H2 passes through hot Cu, it doesn't react. So gas C would be H2, and the 0.8g gain in tube 3 would have to come from another reaction. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas X is NH3. Then, when NH3 passes through hot copper, it doesn't react, so tube 3's weight doesn't change. But the problem says tube 3's weight increased by 0.8g, so that can't be it.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else, like O2. But O2 wouldn't react with copper unless it's in a specific condition. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is O2, but then it would not react with copper, so tube 3's weight wouldn't change. But in the problem, tube 3's weight did increase, so that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the total moles of each component.

From the initial salts, A and B, which together weigh 7.2g. They are equimolar, so let's say each has a molar mass of M. So 2nM =7.2 → n =7.2/(2M).

Upon heating, the salts decompose into H2O and another gas X.

The moles of H2O are 0.2 mol (3.6g /18g/mol). The moles of X are (assuming all X passed through and reacted) 0.8g/(molar mass of X).

But in the end, only gas C remains, which is 0.1 mol.

So perhaps the total moles of gas after decomposition were 0.2 (H2O) + x (X) = total.

But after passing through the tubes, H2O is removed (0.2 mol), X is partially or fully reacted, leaving gas C as 0.1 mol.

Wait, but before, the gases passed through tube 1, which removed H2O, leaving X. Then, X passed through tube 3, which gained 0.8g. So perhaps X is a gas that reacts in tube 3, producing CuO and gas C.

So the initial moles of X would be (mass of X) / molar mass of X.

Let's suppose X is SO2. Then, 0.8g is 0.8/64 = 0.0125 mol.

In tube 3, the reaction is 4 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuSO4 + O2↑.

So for each mole of SO2, we get 0.5 mole of O2. So 0.0125 mol SO2 would produce 0.00625 mol O2, which is 0.00625 *32 =0.2g, but the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol, which would be 2.24 L. That doesn't match, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, if X is H2S, 0.8g is 0.0235 mol.

If the reaction is H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑, then 0.0235 mol H2S would produce 0.0235 mol H2, which is 0.0235 *2 =0.047g. But problem states gas C is 0.1 mol, which is much larger, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is 2 H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑ + S↓. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry, and it's getting complicated.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the gas X is something else. Let me think about the moles involved.

The initial moles of X would be (mass of X) =0.8g. Let's call molar mass of X as Mx. So moles x =0.8 / Mx.

In the reaction in tube3, suppose a moles of X react to form a certain product and generate gas C.

But I'm not sure, so perhaps I'll have to make an assumption. Let me try to think that the gas X is H2S, and the reaction is:

H2S + Cu → CuS + H2.

In this case, the moles of H2S is 0.0235 mol, which would produce 0.0235 mol H2 (gas C). But the problem states that gas C is 0.1 mol, so that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 H2S + 3 Cu → 3 CuS + H2↑. Then, for 0.0235 mol H2S, moles of H2 would be 0.0235 * (1/2) = 0.01175 mol. Still less than 0.1.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the reaction is different. Let's think about the other possibility: that the gas X is a mixture of H2O and another gas, but that doesn't seem to fit with the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas X is a combination of two gases, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the total moles of gas C is 0.1 mol. Let's think about what that could be.

If gas C is H2, then 0.1 mol H2 is 0.2g, which is possible.

If gas C is O2, then 0.1 mol is 3.2g, which seems a lot, but perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the reaction in tube 3 is that X reacts with Cu to form CuO and produces O2.

For example, if X is H2O, but that was already captured in tube 1. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if X is O2, then it wouldn't react with Cu, so no weight gain. So that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another angle.

Let me think about the overall process.

The initial salts A and B are heated to produce H2O and another gas X. The H2O is captured in tube 1, so X is the only gas left before tube 3.

In tube 3, X reacts with Cu, causing a weight gain of 0.8g as CuO. The reaction must produce gas C, which is 0.1 mol.

Possible reaction: X is SO2, which upon heating with Cu produces CuSO4 and O2.

But earlier, that didn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydrocarbon, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

2 H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑.

In this case, 2 moles of H2S produce 1 mole of H2. So 0.8g H2S is 0.8 /34 ≈ 0.0235 mol. Then, moles of H2 would be 0.0235 * (1/2) =0.01175 mol, which is about 0.25 L at STP. But the problem says gas C is 2.24 L (0.1 mol). So that doesn't match.

Hmm. Maybe the initial assumption that X is H2S is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the gas X is a mixture of H2O and another gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different gas, like ammonia (NH3), but earlier analysis suggested that wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the salts A and B are such that upon heating, they release H2O and another gas, say, Cl2, but I don't think that would react with Cu.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the salt is sodium carbonate and another carbonate. But heating them would release CO2, which would react in tube 2, which it didn't, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the salts are metal nitrides. For example, Ca3N2 upon heating with water would produce NH3 and CaO. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are ammonium carbonate, which upon heating would release NH3, CO2, and H2O. But then, NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2, leading to a weight gain, which didn't happen, so that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm not making progress on the gas identification. Let's try to think about the possible answer options.

The options for the total number of atoms in salts A and B are 13, 17, 15, or 19.

So perhaps the salts are simple, like NaHCO3 and something else. Let me compute the molar masses.

Wait, if the salts are NaHCO3 and something else, like KNO3.

But in any case, perhaps the salts are such that each has a formula where the total number of atoms is, say, 8 (like NaHCO3 has 5 atoms) and another salt with 5 atoms, giving a total of 10. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the salts are KNO3 and NaNO3. Each is KNO3 → K, N, 3 O → 4 atoms. So two moles would be 8 atoms. But the options don't have 8.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are Na2CO3 (3 atoms: Na, C, O3) and something else. Wait, Na2CO3 has 2 Na, 1 C, 3 O → 6 atoms per formula unit.

Wait, perhaps the salts are Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. Let's compute moles.

Wait, the total weight is 7.20g, equimolar.

Let me suppose each salt is n moles. So 2n(M_A + M_B) =7.20g.

But without knowing the salts, perhaps it's hard to proceed.

Wait, maybe the salts are CaCO3 and MgCO3. Each would have 5 atoms per formula unit. So each salt has 5 atoms, so per mole, 5 atoms. If the salts are equimolar, total atoms per mole would be 5 +5 =10. For n moles, 10n atoms.

If the total weight is 7.2g, what's n?

Each mole of CaCO3 is 100g/mol. MgCO3 is 84g/mol. Let's say n is the moles of each.

So total weight is n*(100 +84) = 184n =7.2 → n=7.2/184≈0.039 mol. So atoms would be 10 *0.039≈0.39 mol. But the options are for the total number of atoms in the salts, not per mole. Wait, no: the question is "the total number of all atoms in salts A and B." So perhaps per formula unit.

Wait, but the problem says "the total number of all atoms in salts A and B." So for example, if each salt is NaCl (2 atoms), and you have n moles of each, total atoms would be 2n +2n =4n.

But the options are 13, 19, 17, 15, which are all odd numbers, suggesting that each salt has an odd number of atoms per formula unit.

Hmm, perhaps salts have formula units with 5 and 7 atoms, leading to 12 atoms per two salts. Or maybe 6 and 7 per salt, leading to 13 atoms. Wait, but the options are 13, 15, 17, 19.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the salts are such that each has a formula with (x + y) atoms, and when added, the total is an option number. For example, if each salt has 8 atoms, the total would be 16 per 2 salts. But 16 isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 8 and 7 atoms, totaling 15.

But I'm not sure. Perhaps the correct answer is 15 atoms, which is option D.

But I'm not confident. Let me try to think about the steps again.

Wait, perhaps the initial salts are sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and something else. NaHCO3 has 5 atoms per formula unit. Suppose the other salt is, say, MgCO3, which has 5 atoms as well. So each salt contributes 5 atoms, and since they're equimolar, total atoms per mole of mixture would be 5 +5=10 atoms. For 7.2g, let's compute moles.

NaHCO3 molar mass=84g/mol. MgCO3=84g/mol as well. So each is 84g/mol.

Wait, if each is 84g/mol, and equimolar, then total for two moles would be 84*2=168g. But that's way more than 7.2g. So n would be 7.2/(2*84) )= 7.2/168 = 0.04286 moles each.

So atoms per mole: each salt is 5 atoms, so two salts → 10 atoms. So 0.04286 moles × 10 atoms/mol = 0.4286 moles of atoms. But the question is asking for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which are 7.2g. So the number would be moles × atoms per molecule.

Wait, but in the salts, each molecule has a certain number of atoms. So, for example, NaHCO3 has 5 atoms, so moles of NaHCO3 ×5 atoms.

If the salts are A and B, each with 5 atoms, and equimolar, then for n moles of each, total atoms would be (5n +5n)=10n.

Total weight is (n * M_A) + (n * M_B) )=7.2g. If M_A and M_B are both, say, 84g/mol, then 2n*84=7.2 → n=0.04286. So atoms would be 10 *0.04286 ≈0.4286 mol. But that's the number of atoms, and the options are about the total number of atoms, but not per mole. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all atoms in the salts, regardless of moles. But that doesn't make much sense because atoms are counted per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is indicating that the salts A and B each have a certain number of atoms per formula unit, and the total is one of the options. For example, if one salt has 8 atoms and the other has 7, the total would be 15.

So perhaps the correct answer is 15 atoms, option D.


The problem involves determining the total number of atoms in an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which weigh 7.20 g. Upon heating, the salts produce a mixture of gases. These gases pass through three tubes:  

1. **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: The weight increases by 3.60 g, indicating the absorption of water (H₂O). The moles of H₂O are calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂O} = \frac{3.60 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.2 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: The weight remains unchanged, indicating no CO₂ is present in the gas mixture.

3. **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The weight increases by 0.80 g, forming CuO. This suggests the presence of a gas that reacts with copper to form CuO. The moles of this gas (X) are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of X} = \frac{0.80 \, \text{g}}{\text{Molar mass of X}}.
   \]

After passing through all three tubes, only 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure. This indicates that gas C is likely a simple gas like H₂, O₂, or another light gas.  

The salts A and B are equimolar, and their total mass is 7.20 g. Let the molar mass of each salt be \( M \). The total moles of the salts are:  
\[
\text{Total moles} = \frac{7.20 \, \text{g}}{2M}.
\]

The problem requires determining the total number of atoms in salts A and B. The options provided (13, 17, 15, 19) suggest that the salts have a specific number of atoms per formula unit. For example, if each salt has 8 atoms, the total number of atoms in the mixture would be:  
\[
\text{Total atoms} = 2 \times 8 = 16.
\]
However, this does not match the options. If one salt has 7 atoms and the other has 8, the total number of atoms would be:  
\[
\text{Total atoms} = 7 + 8 = 15.
\]

This matches one of the options. Based on the reasoning and the constraints of the problem, the most plausible answer is that the total number of atoms in salts A and B is **15**.
