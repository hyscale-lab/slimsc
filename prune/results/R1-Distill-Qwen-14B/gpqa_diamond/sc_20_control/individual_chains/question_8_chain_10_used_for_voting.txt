Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, G3. They're candidate genes, and we've made knock-out mutants for each, as well as double mutants. The experiment is testing their resistance to anthracnose. The results show how much resistance each mutant has compared to the wild-type control.

The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes. I remember that when dealing with gene interactions, epistasis can play a role. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Like one gene masks or modifies the expression of another. So, when two genes interact, their double mutant might show a different phenotype than expected.

Looking at the data: 

Wild-type is 100% resistance. 

g1 (G1 knockout) is 75% resistance. So, not as resistant as wild-type. 

g2 is 0% resistance. That's a big drop—so the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. 

g3 is 50% resistance. So, halfway. 

Double mutants:
g1g3 is 10%. That's way lower than either g1 or g3 alone. 
g2g3 is 0%. Same as g2. 
g1g2 is 0%. Same as g2. 

So, from this, I need to figure out the gene relationships. The question also states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, so it's regulating other genes. 

Let me think about each gene's effect. 

First, g2 knockout has 0% resistance. That's a complete loss of resistance. So, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that's crucial for the resistance pathway. If G2 is absent, the plant can't resist. 

Then, the double mutants involving G2: g2g3 and g1g2 are both 0%. So, when G2 is knocked out, adding another mutation (g3 or g1) doesn't change the phenotype—it's already at 0%, so it can't get worse. So, G2 is epistatic over G3 and G1. Because the double mutants don't show any additional effect beyond what g2 alone does. 

What about G1 and G3? The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops even further. So their effects are additive. 

Wait, but what does that mean in terms of their relationship? If knocking out both makes the resistance worse, maybe they are in the same pathway and work redundantly. Or perhaps they're in parallel pathways. 

Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So, if one is knocked out, the other can take over, so the phenotype isn't as severe. But if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse. Like in g1g3 here, since 75% and 50% are better than the wild-type, their combined knockout is worse. Hmm, wait no. Wait, in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%—so each is less resistant than wild-type. But their double mutant is even worse, 10%. So, perhaps they are in the same pathway and each contributes to the resistance. 

Wait, but another angle: if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would mean that neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. Because G2 is the upstream regulator. So, in that case, the g2 mutant would have neither G1 nor G3 product. 

But wait, the single mutants g1 and g3 still have some resistance. So maybe G2 is not directly upstream of both. Or maybe G1 and G3 have other functions. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and another gene but not G3. Or vice versa. 

Let me think about the possible options. The options mention things like transcription factors, gene redundancy, pleiotropy, and epistatic relationships.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. But I'm not sure how that applies here. Also, G2 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that G2's phenotype masks G1's. But in the double mutants, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So maybe G1 is epistatic over G2? Wait, I'm confused.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so they are co-regulated), G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, same promoter would mean they're in the same operon, which is more bacterial. In plants, more likely they have separate promoters but perhaps are co-regulated. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then G3's presence would mask G1's effect. But in g3 mutant, the resistance is 50%, and g1 is 75%. So in the double mutant, g1g3 is 10%. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant would have the same as G3 knockout, which is 50%. But the double mutant is 10%, so that doesn't fit. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy again. If G1 is epistatic, then the presence of G1's function affects G3. But I'm not sure how that would play out. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, which suggests that they are additive. So perhaps their functions are in parallel pathways. But with G2 being a TF, perhaps it's not directly related.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if you knock out one, the other can take over. So, a single mutant (g1 or g3) would have less severe phenotype than the double mutant. Which is what we're seeing: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and their double is 10%. So, knocking out both leads to worse resistance. That suggests redundancy because each alone can contribute some resistance, but together they're worse.

Epistasis: The term 'epistatic towards' refers to one gene masking another. So, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then when G1 is present, G3's effect is masked. But in the double mutant, both are knocked out. So, maybe when G1 is present, it's the one that's more important. Or perhaps G1 is epistatic, so in the absence of G1, G3's effect is seen. 

Wait, in g1, resistance is 75%, and in g3 it's 50%. If G1 is epistatic, then when G1 is present, G3's effect doesn't matter. So, when G1 is knocked out (g1), the effect is 75%, but the presence of G3 would perhaps not change it much. But the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either. So that suggests that their functions are additive, not epistatic. 

Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about epistasis again. If Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, then the pathway is A → B. So, if A doesn't work, B doesn't matter. So, the phenotype of a double mutant A and B would be the same as a single A mutant. But in our case, the single g1 is 75%, and the double g1g3 is 10%. That's much worse than g1 alone. So that suggests that their pathways are not linear but perhaps in parallel. 

Wait, if both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, but are in different pathways, then knocking out both would lead to a worse phenotype. That would be a case of redundancy perhaps? Or maybe they're both in the same pathway but in series. 

Alternatively, if G2 is the transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, then knocking G2 out would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. So, in the wild type, G1 and G3 are both active because G2 is the TF activating them. So, in the g2 mutant, neither is expressed, leading to 0% resistance. 

In that case, the single mutants g1 and g3 would have some residual function, perhaps because the other gene is still active. So, g1 would have G3 active, leading to 75% (but why is that higher than g3's 50%?), and g3 would have G1 active, leading to 50%. Hmm, that seems conflicting. 

Wait, but the data shows g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So, perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is still present, but it's not enough, so resistance drops to 75%. When G3 is knocked out, G1 is present, which is enough for 50% resistance. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, both regulated by G2. 

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So, if G2 is upstream, then in g2, both G1 and G3 are inactive, so 0% resistance. But in the single mutants, each has one gene active. So, in the g1 mutant, G3 is active, leading to 75% resistance. In g3 mutant, G1 is active, leading to 50% resistance. Then, their double mutant would be 75% (if G3 is active) and 50% (if G1 is active), but in the data, it's 10%. So that doesn't add up. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2 isn't upstream of both, but only of one. Let's think about the double mutants. The g1g2 and g2g3 are both 0%. So, when G2 is knocked out, any other knockout doesn't change the resistance. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So, G2's function is upstream, and without it, G1 and G3 don't matter. 

So, G2 is a transcription factor. Because the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, G2 is likely the TF. 

So, G2's presence is necessary for any resistance. So, in the g2 mutants, resistance is zero. 

Now, looking at the other mutants: 

g1 has 75% resistance, so without G1, the plant still has some resistance. Similarly, g3 has 50%. So, G1 and G3 must be contributing to resistance but are not the only factors. 

The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is way lower than either single. So, the functions of G1 and G3 are additive. Meaning, when both are absent, the resistance drops significantly. That suggests that they're working in the same pathway but in series, or perhaps in parallel. 

If they're in the same pathway, the double mutant might not be worse than the single if they're in series. But if they're in parallel pathways, the double would be additive. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. 

Wait, but the presence of G2 is necessary for these pathways. Because without G2, the resistance is zero. So, G2 might be activating either G1 or G3, or both.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF upstream of G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So, without G2, both are off. So, the g2 mutant has zero resistance. 

But in the single mutants, g1 (G1 knocked out) and G2 is present. So, G3 is still expressed. But why does the resistance drop to 75%? Because perhaps G3 alone isn't enough. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out but G1 is present, the resistance is 50%. So, G1 contributes more than G3. 

Wait, that makes sense. So, G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is absent, neither are, leading to 0%. 

In the single mutants: 

- g1: G2 is working, so G3 is expressed. But perhaps G3's contribution is less than G1, so resistance is 75%. 

- g3: G2 is working, so G1 is expressed, leading to higher resistance (50% compared to g1's 75%?? Wait, wait no, g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. Wait, that makes G1 more important. So, if G1 is knocked out, the plant retains G3, which gives 75%. If G3 is knocked out, the plant retains G1, which gives 50% resistance. So, G1 is more important than G3. 

So, the double mutant g1g3 would have neither G1 nor G3, so resistance would be lower than either single. Hence, 10%. 

So, now, looking at the options. Option D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. 

Wait, gene redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. So, the single mutants would have a phenotype, but the double would be worse. Which we see: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So, this fits with redundancy. 

But what about epistasis? The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, G1's effect masks G3's. But in the double mutant, both are knocked out. So, perhaps in the presence of G1, G3's effect is not seen. But I'm not sure. 

Looking at the options, the key is to determine which genes are epistatic to each other. 

In this scenario, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because without G2, the resistance is zero regardless of the state of G1 and G3. So, G2 is upstream. 

So, looking at the options, which ones state that G2 is the TF and epistatic to others?

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because our analysis suggests G2 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so co-regulated by G2). But the option says G3 is epistatic to G1. 

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here. 

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, if G1 is epistatic, then in the absence of G1, G3's effect is seen. But the data shows that when both are gone (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. If G1 is epistatic, then g1 would have the same as g1g3, but that's not the case. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the epistatic relationships. 

When G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of other genes. So, the presence of G2 is epistatic to the other genes. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. 

But the options don't all list that. Let's look at each option's first part.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2 is the TF based on resistance of G2 knockout. 

Option B: G2 is TF. Yes.

Option C: G2 is TF. Yes.

Option D: G2 is TF. Yes.

So, only options B, C, D have G2 as the TF. 

Now, the second part of the options: 

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So, they're co-regulated. If G2 is a TF, it would activate both. So, in g2, both are off. But in g1, since the same promoter is not working, because G1 is knocked out. Wait, if they have the same promoter, then knocking out G1 would not affect the promoter for G3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are co-regulated by G2. So, G2 activates both. So, in the single mutants, g1 and g3, the other gene is still active. 

So, in g1 (G1 knocked out), G3 is still present. If G2 is the TF for both, then G3 expression depends on G2. So, in g1, G3 is expressed because G2 is present. 

So, the resistance of g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So, G1 contributes more. 

In the double mutant g1g3, neither G1 nor G3 is present, so resistance is 10%. 

So, perhaps G2 is the TF activating both, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. So their functions are additive when both are present, but each contributes separately. 

Now, looking at the options, which one fits this scenario? 

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Redundancy would mean that when one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So, the single mutants would have some phenotype, but the double mutant would be much worse. Which is what we're seeing. So, gene redundancy fits. 

Epistasis: In which direction? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1's presence would determine the phenotype. But in this case, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is present but the resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out, G1 is present and resistance is 50%. So, without G1, G3 can still give 75% (which is better than when G3 is without G1, which is 50%). Hmm, that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic to G1. So, the presence of G3 determines the resistance. But in g3, resistance is 50%, which is less than g1's 75%. So, that doesn't fit either. 

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Maybe G2 is epistatic to both. So, as long as G2 is present, the resistance is determined by G1 and G3. But when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero. 

So, in our case, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. But the options don't directly state that. 

Looking back at the options, which one correctly states that G2 is the TF, and the epistatic relationships?

Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. So, in g1g2, the resistance is 0% (same as g2). So, when G2 is knocked out, the presence of G1 doesn't matter. Which fits. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. 

But wait, the option also says G1 is a TF. But from our analysis, G2 is the TF. So option A is incorrect. 

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so same regulation), G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, G3's presence would determine the resistance. If G3 is present, G1 doesn't matter. But in the data, g1 has higher resistance (75%) than g3 (50%). So, in this scenario, when G1 is absent (g1), G3 is present but gives lower resistance than when G1 is present. So, this doesn't fit because G3 is epistatic, but without G1, G3's presence doesn't give higher resistance.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here we're dealing with two genes affecting the same trait. So, perhaps pleiotropy isn't the right term. 

Alternatively, G1 and G3 are in gene redundancy, as in option D. So, their functions are redundant but not in the same pathway. So, each contributes independently.

But then, why is the double mutant g1g3 so much worse than either single? Because without both, the resistance is much lower. So, that's consistent with redundancy.

Epistasis in option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, the presence of G1 masks the effect of G3. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out, G3's presence gives 75%, which is better than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So, G1's presence would allow higher resistance. So, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3 in the sense that when G1 is present, G3's contribution is not as important. But in reality, without G1, G3 contributes more (75% resistance) than without G3, which is 50%. So, G3's contribution is less than G1's. 

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. 

The correct answer must be option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. 

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that the presence of G1 determines the phenotype regardless of G3. So, in g1, G3 is present but the resistance is 75%. In g3, G1 is present and resistance is 50%. That doesn't fit, because if G1 is epistatic, then in g3, the resistance should be determined by G1. But in g3, G1 is present and the resistance is 50%, which is lower than g1's 75% resistance. 

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, in the presence of G3, the resistance is determined by G3. But in g3, the resistance is 50%, and in g1, resistance is 75%. So, without G3, G1's presence gives higher resistance. That suggests that G1's effect is more significant than G3's. So, G1 is epistatic to G3. 

But the data shows that when both are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either single. So, perhaps their functions are additive. 

Wait, perhaps the way to think about this is through the concept of epistatic hierarchy. If Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, then the phenotype of A masks the effect of B. So, in the absence of A, the phenotype is determined by B. 

So, in our case, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the presence of G1 (i.e., when G1 is functional), the resistance is determined by G1. When G1 is knocked out, the resistance is determined by G3. 

So, in the single mutants:

- g1: G1 is knocked out, so resistance is determined by G3. But here, resistance is 75%. 

- g3: G3 is knocked out, so resistance is determined by G1. Here, resistance is 50%. 

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because in g1, when G1 is not present, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is not present (50%). So, if G1 is epistatic, G3's presence would give higher resistance than when G1 is present. But in reality, G1's presence gives higher resistance (g3 is 50%, but when G1 is present, resistance is higher). So perhaps G1 is epistatic towards G3 in the sense that when G1 is present, the pathway is active, and when G1 is knocked out, G3's effect is what determines the resistance. 

So, in g1, G3's presence gives 75% resistance. In g3, G1's presence gives 50%. So, G1 is epistatic because when it's present, the pathway is working, but when it's knocked out, G3's effect is what's seen. 

So, in the double mutant g1g3, neither is present, so the resistance is 10%. 

So, according to this, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Because when G1 is present, the resistance is determined by G1, and when G1 is absent, it's determined by G3. 

So, putting it all together: G2 is the transcription factor, and it's epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 show some form of redundancy, meaning each contributes to the resistance when the other is absent. G1 is epistatic towards G3 because when G1 is present, it determines the resistance, and when G1 is absent, G3's effect is seen. 

Looking at the options again, option D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. 

So, that fits. So, the conclusion is option D.

The experiment investigates the interactions of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The data shows the resistance levels of single and double mutants compared to the wild-type (100% resistance). The goal is to determine the relationships between these genes, including their roles as transcription factors, redundancy, pleiotropy, and epistasis.

### Key Observations:
1. **G2 Knockout (g2):** Resistance is 0%, indicating G2 is critical for resistance and likely acts as a transcription factor upstream of other genes.
2. **G1 Knockout (g1):** Resistance is 75%, suggesting G1 contributes to resistance but is not essential on its own.
3. **G3 Knockout (g3):** Resistance is 50%, indicating G3 also contributes to resistance but less significantly than G1.
4. **Double Mutants:**
   - **g1g3:** Resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant, indicating additive or complementary roles for G1 and G3.
   - **g1g2 and g2g3:** Resistance is 0%, the same as g2, showing G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

### Analysis:
- **G2 as a Transcription Factor:** The complete loss of resistance in g2 suggests G2 regulates downstream genes, including G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute to resistance.
- **G1 and G3 Contributions:** The partial resistance in g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) indicates that G1 and G3 independently contribute to resistance. Their combined knockout (g1g3) results in 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, suggesting they are not in the same pathway but may act redundantly or in parallel.
- **Epistasis:** G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because the resistance of any mutant involving G2 (g2, g1g2, g2g3) is 0%, masking the effects of G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 appears to be epistatic over G3, as the resistance in g1 (75%) is higher than in g3 (50%), indicating G1 has a more significant role.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. It claims G1 is a transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is the transcription factor, as g2 has 0% resistance.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. While G2 is a transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported. Additionally, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as g1 has higher resistance than g3.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. While G2 is a transcription factor, pleiotropy is not supported by the data, as G1 and G3 do not affect multiple traits. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3 in the way described.
- **Option D:** Correct. G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (their combined knockout results in worse resistance than either single mutant), and G1 is epistatic to G3, as G1's presence contributes more significantly to resistance than G3's.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, G3. They're candidate genes, and we've made knock-out mutants for each, as well as double mutants. The experiment is testing their resistance to anthracnose. The results show how much resistance each mutant has compared to the wild-type control.

The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes. I remember that when dealing with gene interactions, epistasis can play a role. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Like one gene masks or modifies the expression of another. So, when two genes interact, their double mutant might show a different phenotype than expected.

Looking at the data: 

Wild-type is 100% resistance. 

g1 (G1 knockout) is 75% resistance. So, not as resistant as wild-type. 

g2 is 0% resistance. That's a big drop—so the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. 

g3 is 50% resistance. So, halfway. 

Double mutants:
g1g3 is 10%. That's way lower than either g1 or g3 alone. 
g2g3 is 0%. Same as g2. 
g1g2 is 0%. Same as g2. 

So, from this, I need to figure out the gene relationships. The question also states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, so it's regulating other genes. 

Let me think about each gene's effect. 

First, g2 knockout has 0% resistance. That's a complete loss of resistance. So, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that's crucial for the resistance pathway. If G2 is absent, the plant can't resist. 

Then, the double mutants involving G2: g2g3 and g1g2 are both 0%. So, when G2 is knocked out, adding another mutation (g3 or g1) doesn't change the phenotype—it's already at 0%, so it can't get worse. So, G2 is epistatic over G3 and G1. Because the double mutants don't show any additional effect beyond what g2 alone does. 

What about G1 and G3? The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops even further. So their effects are additive. 

Wait, but what does that mean in terms of their relationship? If knocking out both makes the resistance worse, maybe they are in the same pathway and work redundantly. Or perhaps they're in parallel pathways. 

Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So, if one is knocked out, the other can take over, so the phenotype isn't as severe. But if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse. Like in g1g3 here, since 75% and 50% are better than the wild-type, their combined knockout is worse. Hmm, wait no. Wait, in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%—so each is less resistant than wild-type. But their double mutant is even worse, 10%. So, perhaps they are in the same pathway and each contributes to the resistance. 

Wait, but another angle: if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would mean that neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. Because G2 is the upstream regulator. So, in that case, the g2 mutant would have neither G1 nor G3 product. 

But wait, the single mutants g1 and g3 still have some resistance. So maybe G2 is not directly upstream of both. Or maybe G1 and G3 have other functions. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and another gene but not G3. Or vice versa. 

Let me think about the possible options. The options mention things like transcription factors, gene redundancy, pleiotropy, and epistatic relationships.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. But I'm not sure how that applies here. Also, G2 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that G2's phenotype masks G1's. But in the double mutants, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So maybe G1 is epistatic over G2? Wait, I'm confused.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so they are co-regulated), G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, same promoter would mean they're in the same operon, which is more bacterial. In plants, more likely they have separate promoters but perhaps are co-regulated. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then G3's presence would mask G1's effect. But in g3 mutant, the resistance is 50%, and g1 is 75%. So in the double mutant, g1g3 is 10%. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant would have the same as G3 knockout, which is 50%. But the double mutant is 10%, so that doesn't fit. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy again. If G1 is epistatic, then the presence of G1's function affects G3. But I'm not sure how that would play out. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, which suggests that they are additive. So perhaps their functions are in parallel pathways. But with G2 being a TF, perhaps it's not directly related.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if you knock out one, the other can take over. So, a single mutant (g1 or g3) would have less severe phenotype than the double mutant. Which is what we're seeing: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and their double is 10%. So, knocking out both leads to worse resistance. That suggests redundancy because each alone can contribute some resistance, but together they're worse.

Epistasis: The term 'epistatic towards' refers to one gene masking another. So, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then when G1 is present, G3's effect is masked. But in the double mutant, both are knocked out. So, maybe when G1 is present, it's the one that's more important. Or perhaps G1 is epistatic, so in the absence of G1, G3's effect is seen. 

Wait, in g1, resistance is 75%, and in g3 it's 50%. If G1 is epistatic, then when G1 is present, G3's effect doesn't matter. So, when G1 is knocked out (g1), the effect is 75%, but the presence of G3 would perhaps not change it much. But the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either. So that suggests that their functions are additive, not epistatic. 

Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about epistasis again. If Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, then the pathway is A → B. So, if A doesn't work, B doesn't matter. So, the phenotype of a double mutant A and B would be the same as a single A mutant. But in our case, the single g1 is 75%, and the double g1g3 is 10%. That's much worse than g1 alone. So that suggests that their pathways are not linear but perhaps in parallel. 

Wait, if both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, but are in different pathways, then knocking out both would lead to a worse phenotype. That would be a case of redundancy perhaps? Or maybe they're both in the same pathway but in series. 

Alternatively, if G2 is the transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, then knocking G2 out would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. So, in the wild type, G1 and G3 are both active because G2 is the TF activating them. So, in the g2 mutant, neither is expressed, leading to 0% resistance. 

In that case, the single mutants g1 and g3 would have some residual function, perhaps because the other gene is still active. So, g1 would have G3 active, leading to 75% (but why is that higher than g3's 50%?), and g3 would have G1 active, leading to 50%. Hmm, that seems conflicting. 

Wait, but the data shows g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So, perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is still present, but it's not enough, so resistance drops to 75%. When G3 is knocked out, G1 is present, which is enough for 50% resistance. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, both regulated by G2. 

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So, if G2 is upstream, then in g2, both G1 and G3 are inactive, so 0% resistance. But in the single mutants, each has one gene active. So, in the g1 mutant, G3 is active, leading to 75% resistance. In g3 mutant, G1 is active, leading to 50% resistance. Then, their double mutant would be 75% (if G3 is active) and 50% (if G1 is active), but in the data, it's 10%. So that doesn't add up. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2 isn't upstream of both, but only of one. Let's think about the double mutants. The g1g2 and g2g3 are both 0%. So, when G2 is knocked out, any other knockout doesn't change the resistance. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So, G2's function is upstream, and without it, G1 and G3 don't matter. 

So, G2 is a transcription factor. Because the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, G2 is likely the TF. 

So, G2's presence is necessary for any resistance. So, in the g2 mutants, resistance is zero. 

Now, looking at the other mutants: 

g1 has 75% resistance, so without G1, the plant still has some resistance. Similarly, g3 has 50%. So, G1 and G3 must be contributing to resistance but are not the only factors. 

The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is way lower than either single. So, the functions of G1 and G3 are additive. Meaning, when both are absent, the resistance drops significantly. That suggests that they're working in the same pathway but in series, or perhaps in parallel. 

If they're in the same pathway, the double mutant might not be worse than the single if they're in series. But if they're in parallel pathways, the double would be additive. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. 

Wait, but the presence of G2 is necessary for these pathways. Because without G2, the resistance is zero. So, G2 might be activating either G1 or G3, or both.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF upstream of G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So, without G2, both are off. So, the g2 mutant has zero resistance. 

But in the single mutants, g1 (G1 knocked out) and G2 is present. So, G3 is still expressed. But why does the resistance drop to 75%? Because perhaps G3 alone isn't enough. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out but G1 is present, the resistance is 50%. So, G1 contributes more than G3. 

Wait, that makes sense. So, G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is absent, neither are, leading to 0%. 

In the single mutants: 

- g1: G2 is working, so G3 is expressed. But perhaps G3's contribution is less than G1, so resistance is 75%. 

- g3: G2 is working, so G1 is expressed, leading to higher resistance (50% compared to g1's 75%?? Wait, wait no, g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. Wait, that makes G1 more important. So, if G1 is knocked out, the plant retains G3, which gives 75%. If G3 is knocked out, the plant retains G1, which gives 50% resistance. So, G1 is more important than G3. 

So, the double mutant g1g3 would have neither G1 nor G3, so resistance would be lower than either single. Hence, 10%. 

So, now, looking at the options. Option D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. 

Wait, gene redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. So, the single mutants would have a phenotype, but the double would be worse. Which we see: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So, this fits with redundancy. 

But what about epistasis? The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, G1's effect masks G3's. But in the double mutant, both are knocked out. So, perhaps in the presence of G1, G3's effect is not seen. But I'm not sure. 

Looking at the options, the key is to determine which genes are epistatic to each other. 

In this scenario, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because without G2, the resistance is zero regardless of the state of G1 and G3. So, G2 is upstream. 

So, looking at the options, which ones state that G2 is the TF and epistatic to others?

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because our analysis suggests G2 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so co-regulated by G2). But the option says G3 is epistatic to G1. 

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here. 

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, if G1 is epistatic, then in the absence of G1, G3's effect is seen. But the data shows that when both are gone (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. If G1 is epistatic, then g1 would have the same as g1g3, but that's not the case. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the epistatic relationships. 

When G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of other genes. So, the presence of G2 is epistatic to the other genes. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. 

But the options don't all list that. Let's look at each option's first part.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2 is the TF based on resistance of G2 knockout. 

Option B: G2 is TF. Yes.

Option C: G2 is TF. Yes.

Option D: G2 is TF. Yes.

So, only options B, C, D have G2 as the TF. 

Now, the second part of the options: 

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So, they're co-regulated. If G2 is a TF, it would activate both. So, in g2, both are off. But in g1, since the same promoter is not working, because G1 is knocked out. Wait, if they have the same promoter, then knocking out G1 would not affect the promoter for G3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are co-regulated by G2. So, G2 activates both. So, in the single mutants, g1 and g3, the other gene is still active. 

So, in g1 (G1 knocked out), G3 is still present. If G2 is the TF for both, then G3 expression depends on G2. So, in g1, G3 is expressed because G2 is present. 

So, the resistance of g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So, G1 contributes more. 

In the double mutant g1g3, neither G1 nor G3 is present, so resistance is 10%. 

So, perhaps G2 is the TF activating both, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. So their functions are additive when both are present, but each contributes separately. 

Now, looking at the options, which one fits this scenario? 

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Redundancy would mean that when one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So, the single mutants would have some phenotype, but the double mutant would be much worse. Which is what we're seeing. So, gene redundancy fits. 

Epistasis: In which direction? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1's presence would determine the phenotype. But in this case, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is present but the resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out, G1 is present and resistance is 50%. So, without G1, G3 can still give 75% (which is better than when G3 is without G1, which is 50%). Hmm, that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic to G1. So, the presence of G3 determines the resistance. But in g3, resistance is 50%, which is less than g1's 75%. So, that doesn't fit either. 

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Maybe G2 is epistatic to both. So, as long as G2 is present, the resistance is determined by G1 and G3. But when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero. 

So, in our case, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. But the options don't directly state that. 

Looking back at the options, which one correctly states that G2 is the TF, and the epistatic relationships?

Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. So, in g1g2, the resistance is 0% (same as g2). So, when G2 is knocked out, the presence of G1 doesn't matter. Which fits. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. 

But wait, the option also says G1 is a TF. But from our analysis, G2 is the TF. So option A is incorrect. 

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so same regulation), G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, G3's presence would determine the resistance. If G3 is present, G1 doesn't matter. But in the data, g1 has higher resistance (75%) than g3 (50%). So, in this scenario, when G1 is absent (g1), G3 is present but gives lower resistance than when G1 is present. So, this doesn't fit because G3 is epistatic, but without G1, G3's presence doesn't give higher resistance.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here we're dealing with two genes affecting the same trait. So, perhaps pleiotropy isn't the right term. 

Alternatively, G1 and G3 are in gene redundancy, as in option D. So, their functions are redundant but not in the same pathway. So, each contributes independently.

But then, why is the double mutant g1g3 so much worse than either single? Because without both, the resistance is much lower. So, that's consistent with redundancy.

Epistasis in option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, the presence of G1 masks the effect of G3. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out, G3's presence gives 75%, which is better than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So, G1's presence would allow higher resistance. So, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3 in the sense that when G1 is present, G3's contribution is not as important. But in reality, without G1, G3 contributes more (75% resistance) than without G3, which is 50%. So, G3's contribution is less than G1's. 

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. 

The correct answer must be option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. 

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that the presence of G1 determines the phenotype regardless of G3. So, in g1, G3 is present but the resistance is 75%. In g3, G1 is present and resistance is 50%. That doesn't fit, because if G1 is epistatic, then in g3, the resistance should be determined by G1. But in g3, G1 is present and the resistance is 50%, which is lower than g1's 75% resistance. 

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, in the presence of G3, the resistance is determined by G3. But in g3, the resistance is 50%, and in g1, resistance is 75%. So, without G3, G1's presence gives higher resistance. That suggests that G1's effect is more significant than G3's. So, G1 is epistatic to G3. 

But the data shows that when both are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either single. So, perhaps their functions are additive. 

Wait, perhaps the way to think about this is through the concept of epistatic hierarchy. If Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, then the phenotype of A masks the effect of B. So, in the absence of A, the phenotype is determined by B. 

So, in our case, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the presence of G1 (i.e., when G1 is functional), the resistance is determined by G1. When G1 is knocked out, the resistance is determined by G3. 

So, in the single mutants:

- g1: G1 is knocked out, so resistance is determined by G3. But here, resistance is 75%. 

- g3: G3 is knocked out, so resistance is determined by G1. Here, resistance is 50%. 

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because in g1, when G1 is not present, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is not present (50%). So, if G1 is epistatic, G3's presence would give higher resistance than when G1 is present. But in reality, G1's presence gives higher resistance (g3 is 50%, but when G1 is present, resistance is higher). So perhaps G1 is epistatic towards G3 in the sense that when G1 is present, the pathway is active, and when G1 is knocked out, G3's effect is what determines the resistance. 

So, in g1, G3's presence gives 75% resistance. In g3, G1's presence gives 50%. So, G1 is epistatic because when it's present, the pathway is working, but when it's knocked out, G3's effect is what's seen. 

So, in the double mutant g1g3, neither is present, so the resistance is 10%. 

So, according to this, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Because when G1 is present, the resistance is determined by G1, and when G1 is absent, it's determined by G3. 

So, putting it all together: G2 is the transcription factor, and it's epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 show some form of redundancy, meaning each contributes to the resistance when the other is absent. G1 is epistatic towards G3 because when G1 is present, it determines the resistance, and when G1 is absent, G3's effect is seen. 

Looking at the options again, option D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. 

So, that fits. So, the conclusion is option D.


The experiment investigates the interactions of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The data shows the resistance levels of single and double mutants compared to the wild-type (100% resistance). The goal is to determine the relationships between these genes, including their roles as transcription factors, redundancy, pleiotropy, and epistasis.

### Key Observations:
1. **G2 Knockout (g2):** Resistance is 0%, indicating G2 is critical for resistance and likely acts as a transcription factor upstream of other genes.
2. **G1 Knockout (g1):** Resistance is 75%, suggesting G1 contributes to resistance but is not essential on its own.
3. **G3 Knockout (g3):** Resistance is 50%, indicating G3 also contributes to resistance but less significantly than G1.
4. **Double Mutants:**
   - **g1g3:** Resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant, indicating additive or complementary roles for G1 and G3.
   - **g1g2 and g2g3:** Resistance is 0%, the same as g2, showing G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

### Analysis:
- **G2 as a Transcription Factor:** The complete loss of resistance in g2 suggests G2 regulates downstream genes, including G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute to resistance.
- **G1 and G3 Contributions:** The partial resistance in g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) indicates that G1 and G3 independently contribute to resistance. Their combined knockout (g1g3) results in 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, suggesting they are not in the same pathway but may act redundantly or in parallel.
- **Epistasis:** G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because the resistance of any mutant involving G2 (g2, g1g2, g2g3) is 0%, masking the effects of G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 appears to be epistatic over G3, as the resistance in g1 (75%) is higher than in g3 (50%), indicating G1 has a more significant role.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. It claims G1 is a transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is the transcription factor, as g2 has 0% resistance.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. While G2 is a transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported. Additionally, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as g1 has higher resistance than g3.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. While G2 is a transcription factor, pleiotropy is not supported by the data, as G1 and G3 do not affect multiple traits. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3 in the way described.
- **Option D:** Correct. G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (their combined knockout results in worse resistance than either single mutant), and G1 is epistatic to G3, as G1's presence contributes more significantly to resistance than G3's.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

**Answer: D**
