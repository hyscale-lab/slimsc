Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. The two states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The options are A to D, each with different energy differences.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the lifetime of an energy state relates to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy is related to the inverse of the lifetime. The formula I think is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, the shorter the lifetime (the more precisely the energy is known), the larger the uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, but in this problem, they're talking about the energy difference between two states. So I need to find the minimum energy difference that can be distinguished. I think the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or wait, maybe I should think about the lifetimes and how that affects the resolution.

Oh, wait, another angle: the lifetime relates to the energy uncertainty of each state. Each state has its own uncertainty. But the question is about distinguishing two different states. So maybe the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the uncertainties, they won't overlap, making them resolvable.

So let me calculate the uncertainty for each state. The lifetime given is the mean lifetime τ. The uncertainty principle says ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, depending on the exact form. I think the precise formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ), but for an order of magnitude, maybe it's sufficient to approximate it as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.

Let me get the constants straight. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So ħ, which is h/(2π), is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for each state, let's compute their ΔE.

First state: τ1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-25 J.

I need to convert that to eV because the options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 = 1.05457e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 1.05457e-25 divided by 1.602e-19 is (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-6. Approximately, 1.05457/1.602 is about 0.658. So 0.658e-6 eV is 6.58e-7 eV. So about 7e-7 eV, but let me perhaps round it to 6.6e-7 eV.

Second state: τ2 = 1e-8 seconds.

Same calculation: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (1.05457e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05457e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2, so we're looking for ΔE = E2 - E1. But wait, no, in the problem, the two states have their own lifetimes. So each has their own energy uncertainty. So for the energy difference to be distinguishable, I think the actual energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of both states. Because each state has an uncertainty, and the total uncertainty in their separation would be the sum.

Wait, no. Each state's energy is uncertain by ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the uncertainty in the difference between E1 and E2 would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because Δ(E2 - E1) = ΔE2 + ΔE1. So the energy difference ΔE must be larger than this combined uncertainty for them to be clearly resolved.

So the combined uncertainty is ΔE1 + ΔE2.

ΔE1 is 6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.6e-8 eV. So sum is 7.26e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.26e-7 eV for them to be clearly distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is 0.001 nano, which is way smaller than 7.26e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, way below.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → that's 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 7.26e-7. So 1e-4 eV would definitely be larger than the required 7.26e-7, so it is resolvable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 → 1e-8 is smaller than 7.26e-7, so D is too small.

Wait, but option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times greater than the required 7.26e-7 eV. So that would be clearly distinguishable.

But wait, I have to double-check the initial approach. I assumed that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Let me think again.

Each state has an uncertainty in energy. When you measure the energy, the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 and in E2 is ΔE2. The energy difference between E2 and E1 would have an uncertainty of sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), because when you subtract two independent uncertainties, they add quadratically.

Wait, that's a different approach. So the uncertainty in the difference ΔE = E2 - E1 is sqrt((ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2).

So let's compute that.

ΔE1 = 6.6e-7 eV; ΔE2 = 6.6e-8 eV.

(ΔE1)^2 = (6.6e-7)^2 ≈ 4.356e-13

(ΔE2)^2 = (6.6e-8)^2 ≈ 4.356e-15

Adding them: 4.356e-13 + 4.356e-15 ≈ 4.399e-13. Taking the square root: sqrt(4.399e-13) ≈ 6.63e-7 eV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 6.63e-7 eV.

Therefore, for the energy difference to be distinguishable, it must be larger than this value. So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than approximately 6.6e-7 eV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. 0.0001 eV is 1e-4, which is 1.0e4 times larger than 6.6e-7. So yes, it's much larger, so it's resolvable.

Other options: option A is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.001 nano, way smaller than 6.6e-7. So no. Option B is 1e-11, even smaller. Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.01e-6, so 1e-8 is 1/6.6 times smaller than 6.6e-7, so it's just 1.5e-8, which is smaller than 6.6e-7, so D is too small.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate to make sure I didn't miscalculate the uncertainties.

Wait, τ1 is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) or ħ/τ1? Let me double-check the uncertainty principle. The correct formula is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt).

Wait, so perhaps I should have used ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ) instead of ħ/τ.

Ah, that changes things. Let me recalculate.

So for τ1 =1e-9 s,

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 5.27e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 =1e-8 s,

ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8) = 1.05457e-34 / (2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So now, the uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE is sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (1.08e-13) + (1.08e-15) ) ≈ sqrt(1.09e-13) ≈ 3.3e-7 eV.

So the minimum energy difference should be greater than about 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options again, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. So it's resolvable.

But wait, option C is way larger than 3.3e-7 eV. So that's definitely resolvable. What about the other options?

So the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 → much bigger.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 → 0.01 nano, which is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is about 3% of 3.3e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.3e-7, so it's not enough. So D is too small.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
- For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the uncertainty in the energy difference
The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is given by:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}
\]
Substituting \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) and \( \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(3.29 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (3.29 \times 10^{-8})^2}
\]
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-13} + 1.08 \times 10^{-15}} \approx \sqrt{1.09 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Let us compare this with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also too small.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient for resolution.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished.

Because if the difference is larger than the uncertainties, they won't overlap, making them resolvable.

So let me calculate the uncertainty for each state. The lifetime given is the mean lifetime τ. The uncertainty principle says ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, depending on the exact form. I think the precise formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ), but for an order of magnitude, maybe it's sufficient to approximate it as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.

Let me get the constants straight. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So ħ, which is h/(2π), is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for each state, let's compute their ΔE.

First state: τ1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-25 J.

I need to convert that to eV because the options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 = 1.05457e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 1.05457e-25 divided by 1.602e-19 is (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-6. Approximately, 1.05457/1.602 is about 0.658. So 0.658e-6 eV is 6.58e-7 eV. So about 7e-7 eV, but let me perhaps round it to 6.6e-7 eV.

Second state: τ2 = 1e-8 seconds.

Same calculation: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (1.05457e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05457e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2, so we're looking for ΔE = E2 - E1. But wait, no, in the problem, the two states have their own lifetimes. So each has their own energy uncertainty. So for the energy difference to be distinguishable, I think the actual energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of both states. Because each state has an uncertainty, and the total uncertainty in their separation would be the sum.

Wait, no. Each state's energy is uncertain by ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the uncertainty in the difference between E1 and E2 would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because Δ(E2 - E1) = ΔE2 + ΔE1. So the energy difference ΔE must be larger than this combined uncertainty for them to be clearly resolved.

So the combined uncertainty is ΔE1 + ΔE2.

ΔE1 is 6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.6e-8 eV. So sum is 7.26e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.26e-7 eV for them to be clearly distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is 0.001 nano, which is way smaller than 7.26e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, way below.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → that's 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 7.26e-7. So 1e-4 eV would definitely be larger than the required 7.26e-7, so it is resolvable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 → 1e-8 is smaller than 7.26e-7, so D is too small.

Wait, but option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times greater than the required 7.26e-7 eV. So that would be clearly distinguishable.

But wait, I have to double-check the initial approach. I assumed that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Let me think again.

Each state has an uncertainty in energy. When you measure the energy, the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 and in E2 is ΔE2. The energy difference between E2 and E1 would have an uncertainty of sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), because when you subtract two independent uncertainties, they add quadratically.

Wait, that's a different approach. So the uncertainty in the difference ΔE = E2 - E1 is sqrt((ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2).

So let's compute that.

ΔE1 = 6.6e-7 eV; ΔE2 = 6.6e-8 eV.

(ΔE1)^2 = (6.6e-7)^2 ≈ 4.356e-13

(ΔE2)^2 = (6.6e-8)^2 ≈ 4.356e-15

Adding them: 4.356e-13 + 4.356e-15 ≈ 4.399e-13. Taking the square root: sqrt(4.399e-13) ≈ 6.63e-7 eV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 6.63e-7 eV.

Therefore, for the energy difference to be distinguishable, it must be larger than this value. So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than approximately 6.6e-7 eV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. 0.0001 eV is 1e-4, which is 1.0e4 times larger than 6.6e-7. So yes, it's much larger, so it's resolvable.

Other options: option A is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.001 nano, way smaller than 6.6e-7. So no. Option B is 1e-11, even smaller. Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.01e-6, so 1e-8 is 1/6.6 times smaller than 6.6e-7, so it's just 1.5e-8, which is smaller than 6.6e-7, so D is too small.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate to make sure I didn't miscalculate the uncertainties.

Wait, τ1 is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) or ħ/τ1? Let me double-check the uncertainty principle. The correct formula is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt).

Wait, so perhaps I should have used ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ) instead of ħ/τ.

Ah, that changes things. Let me recalculate.

So for τ1 =1e-9 s,

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 5.27e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 =1e-8 s,

ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8) = 1.05457e-34 / (2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So now, the uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE is sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (1.08e-13) + (1.08e-15) ) ≈ sqrt(1.09e-13) ≈ 3.3e-7 eV.

So the minimum energy difference should be greater than about 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options again, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. So it's resolvable.

But wait, option C is way larger than 3.3e-7 eV. So that's definitely resolvable. What about the other options?

So the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 → much bigger.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 → 0.01 nano, which is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is about 3% of 3.3e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.3e-7, so it's not enough. So D is too small.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
- For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the uncertainty in the energy difference
The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is given by:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}
\]
Substituting \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) and \( \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(3.29 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (3.29 \times 10^{-8})^2}
\]
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-13} + 1.08 \times 10^{-15}} \approx \sqrt{1.09 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Let us compare this with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also too small.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient for resolution.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

Answer: C
