Okay, so I've got this question about two planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 with 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 with 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I think is something like T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance, R_s is the star's radius, T_s is the star's effective temperature, and a is the planet's distance. Oh wait, wait, I think the formula is more like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) ) but since both have the same albedo, that term cancels out when taking the ratio.

But wait, in this problem, the question doesn't give us the orbital distances of the planets. It gives us the Doppler shifts from the RV method. Hmm. Oh right! So maybe I can find the mass and then the velocity, but wait how does that tie into the distance?

Wait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet based on the Doppler shift. The shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so denominator simplifies. But since the planets are detected via transit as well, their orbital planes are edge-on, so sin i is 1. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3... wait, maybe I should think of it another way.

Wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. But without knowing the orbital period or the distance, can we find the distance from the given Doppler shifts?

Wait, the problem gives the Doppler shifts for each planet. Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. And the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity that causes this shift. Because the Doppler shift formula is approximated as delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. So K is approximately (delta_lambda) / (lambda) * c = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * 3e8 m/s. Wait, let me calculate that.

Wait, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å, which is 0.03e-10 meters. Lambda is 6300 Å (or 6300e-10 m). So delta_lambda / lambda is 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6. Then, K = (delta_lambda/lambda) * c ≈ 4.76e-6 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.428e3 m/s. Wait, that seems high. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.03 Å is 3e-2 angstroms. Oh wait, no: 0.03 Å is 3e-2 * 1e-10 m = 3e-12 m. Lambda is 6300e-10 m, so ratio is 3e-12 / 6300e-10 = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = approx 4.76e-6.

Then K = (4.76e-6) * c. c is 3e8 m/s. So 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s. So K for Planet1 is about 1428 m/s. Similarly, Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å, so K would be (0.04 / 6300) * c = approx 1.905e3 m/s.

Wait, but Doppler shift tells us about the star's velocity. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) = ( (27.4 m/s) * (M_p / M_Jup) (P yr)^(-1/3) (M_star / M_sun)^(-2/3) ) ) ), but that's another version. Alternatively, the formula is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) ). But I think the key is that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), but without knowing P, it's tricky.

Wait, but wait: Since both planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same. So the ratio of their K velocities would be (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (P1 / P2 )^(-1/3) ). But we don't have P1 and P2. Hmm.

Alternatively, the formula for K can be written as K = (v * sin i) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) * c, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v_star) = ( ( (M_p * sin i) ) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * ( (2π G ) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so we can ignore that term. So K ≈ ( (M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * ( (2π G ) / (P) )^(1/3) )^(1).

But again, without knowing P, the orbital period, I can't find a and hence the distance. But wait, the transit method gives the period because the transit duration depends on the orbital period and the planet's orbital speed, the star's size, etc. But the question doesn't give the period, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets depends on the distance from the star, since T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if I can find the ratio of a1/a2, then I can find the ratio of their temperatures.

But how? Because the RV method gives us the velocity of the star, which depends on the planet's mass and the distance. So, perhaps the K velocity is related to the planet's mass and the distance.

Wait, another formula: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (c) )

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me recall the correct formula for K. I think the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Assuming sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, as transit implies), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Rearranging, (K)^(3) = ( (2π G ) ) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 P )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe another approach. The orbital velocity of the star is given by K, which relates to the planet's orbital velocity. The star and planet orbit their common barycenter, so their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, v_p = (M_star / M_p) * v_star. So v_p is the planet's orbital speed, which is 2π a_p / P, where a_p is the planet's orbital radius. Similarly, v_star is K. So:

v_p / v_star = M_star / M_p

But v_p = (2π a_p) / P.

So (2π a_p / P ) / K = M_star / M_p => a_p = ( K * M_star * P ) / (2 π M_p )

But without knowing P, I can't get a_p. Hmm.

Wait, but using Kepler's third law, which says that P^2 = (4π² a^3) / (G (M_star + M_p) ). Since M_p is small, this approximates to P² = (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So substituting P from this into the equation for a_p:

a_p = [ (K * M_star ) / (2 π M_p ) ] * [ (4 π² a_p^3 ) / ( G M_star ) ) )^(1/2) ) ]

Wait, this seems complicated. Let me try substituting P from Kepler's law into the a_p equation.

From Kepler's law: P² = (4 π² a_p^3) / ( G M_star )

So P = (4 π² a_p^3 / ( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substituting into a_p expression:

a_p = ( K * M_star * ( (4 π² a_p^3 / ( G M_star ))^(1/2) ) ) ) / ( 2 π M_p )

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Wait, perhaps let me rearrange the equation for a_p.

Wait, from earlier:

a_p = ( K * M_star * P ) / (2 π M_p )

But from Kepler's law, P = sqrt( (4 π² a_p^3) / (G M_star) ) ) = 2 π ( a_p^3 / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

So substitute this into the a_p equation:

a_p = [ K * M_star * 2 π ( a_p^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2) ) ] / ( 2 π M_p )

Simplify numerator: K M_star * 2 π * (a_p^3/(G M_star ))^(1/2) → 2 π K M_star * (a_p^(3/2)) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ) )

Denominator: 2 π M_p → So overall:

a_p = [ 2 π K M_star * a_p^(3/2) ) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ) ] / ( 2 π M_p )

The 2 π cancels. So:

a_p = [ K M_star * a_p^(3/2) ) ] / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) M_p )

Hmm. Let me rearrange:

a_p * M_p = ( K M_star ) a_p^(3/2) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

Multiply both sides by G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2):

a_p * M_p * G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) = K M_star a_p^(3/2)

Divide both sides by a_p^(3/2):

a_p^( -1/2 ) * M_p * G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) = K M_star

So:

a_p^(-1/2) = ( K M_star ) / ( M_p G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

Which can be written as:

a_p^(-1/2) = ( K sqrt(M_star) ) / ( M_p sqrt(G) ) )

Then, square both sides:

a_p^(-1) = ( K² M_star ) / ( M_p² G )

So a_p = ( M_p² G ) / ( K² M_star )

That's a formula for a_p in terms of K, M_p, M_star, and G.

Wait, that's a key equation. So for each planet, a_p is ( M_p^2 G ) / ( K^2 M_star )

Wait, let me check the units to make sure. M_p is mass, G has units of m^3/(kg s^2), K is velocity (m/s), M_star is kg.

So numerator: M_p² G → (kg)^2 * m^3/(kg s²) ) → kg m^3 / s².

Denominator: K^2 M_star → (m²/s²) * kg → kg m²/s².

So overall, (kg m^3/s²) / (kg m²/s² ) ) = m.

So units are meters, which is correct for a_p.

So yes, the formula a_p = ( G M_p² ) / ( K² M_star ) ) → that seems correct.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck.

Wait, when we had a_p^(-1/2) = ( K M_star ) / ( M_p G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

So, simplifying denominator: G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) = sqrt( G M_star )

So numerator is K M_star = K M_star.

So a_p^(-1/2) = ( K M_star ) / ( M_p sqrt(G M_star) ) )

Which can be written as K M_star / ( M_p sqrt(G M_star) ) ) = K sqrt(M_star) / ( M_p sqrt(G) ) )

Then, a_p^(-1/2) = ( K sqrt(M_star) ) / ( M_p sqrt(G) ) )

So, a_p^(1/2) = ( M_p sqrt(G) ) / ( K sqrt(M_star) ) )

Then a_p = [ ( M_p sqrt(G) ) / ( K sqrt(M_star) ) ) ]^2 → ( M_p² G ) / ( K² M_star )

Yes, that's correct.

So, for each planet, a_p is ( G M_p² ) / ( K² M_star )

So, the ratio a1 / a2 = [ ( M1² ) / ( K1² ) ] / [ ( M2² ) / ( K2² ) ] * ( M_star cancels )

Wait, actually, since a_p is proportional to M_p²/( K² ), because M_star is same for both planets.

So:

a1/a2 = ( M1² / K1² ) * ( K2² / M2² ) ) = ( M1² K2² ) / ( M2² K1² )

Because a_p is proportional to (M_p²)/(K^2). So the ratio a1/a2 is (M1² / M2²) * (K2² / K1²).

So, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their distances.

Because T_eq is proportional to (L_star / (16 pi sigma a^2 ))^(1/4 ), but since L_star is same for both planets, T_eq is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2) → T_eq ~ 1/sqrt(a)

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because if a1 > a2, T1 would be smaller than T2.

So, T_ratio = T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

Given that, we need to find a1 and a2.

Planet1:

M_p1 =7 Earth masses.

But need to convert to kg. Earth mass is about 5.97e24 kg. So 7 * 5.97e24 ≈ 4.179e25 kg.

K1 is 0.03 Å → 0.03e-10 m. Using the Doppler shift formula: K = (v/c) * lambda. Wait, earlier calculation gave K as 1428 m/s for Planet1.

Wait, no. Let me recheck. The shift is given as 0.03 Å, which is 0.03e-10 m. The line is at 6300 Å → 6300e-10 m.

The formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c → v = c * (delta_lambda/lambda)

So for Planet1: v = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, that's (0.03 /6300) * 3e8 = (0.03 /6300 ) is 4.76e-6 → 4.76e-6 *3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s.

So K1 is 1428 m/s.

Similarly, Planet2 has a shift of 0.04 Å → K2 = (0.04e-10 /6300e-10 ) *3e8 → 0.04/6300 ≈6.349e-6 → 6.349e-6 *3e8=1.9047e3 m/s.

So K1=1428 m/s, K2=1905 m/s.

M_p1=7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses.

Now, a1 = ( G M_p1² ) / ( K1² M_star )

Wait, but M_star is 1.5 solar masses. Solar mass is about 1.989e30 kg. So M_star=1.5 *1.989e30≈2.98e30 kg.

So for a1:

a1 = ( G * (7 Me)^2 ) / ( (1428)^2 * M_star )

Similarly, a2 = ( G * (5 Me)^2 ) / ( (1905)^2 * M_star )

But since M_star and G are same for both, the ratio a1/a2 = ( (7 Me)^2 / (1428)^2 ) / ( (5 Me)^2 / (1905)^2 ) )

Simplify:

a1/a2 = (7² /5² ) * (1905² /1428² )

Compute 7²=49, 5²=25 → 49/25=1.96

1905/1428 ≈ let's compute that.

1905 ÷ 1428 ≈ 1.333 approx.

Because 1428 * 1.333 = 1428*(4/3)= 1904, which is about 1905.

So (1905/1428)^2 ≈ (4/3)^2=16/9≈1.7778.

So a1/a2= 1.96 * 1.7778 ≈ 3.507.

So a1 is about 3.5 times a2. So a1 =3.5 a2.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, 1905/1428 is approximately 1.333, so squared is 1.777.

So a1/a2= (49/25) * ( (1905/1428)^2 ) → 1.96 * 1.7778 ≈ 3.507.

So a1 is about 3.5 times a2. So a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is further away.

Now, equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to (L / (a^2 ))^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo and the star's luminosity is same, the ratio of their temperatures is T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2 )

Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a1 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1/3.507 ) ≈ sqrt(0.285) ≈ 0.534.

So the ratio T1/T2 is approximately 0.534, which is about 0.53.

Looking at the options: option C is ~0.53.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is proportional to \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), where \( a \) is the orbital distance from the star. Since both planets orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of their orbital distances: 

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distance \( a \) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \), which is related to the planet's mass \( M_p \), the star's mass \( M_{\text{star}} \), and the Doppler shift. The formula for \( a \) is:

\[
a_p = \frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_{\text{star}}}
\]

Here, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M_p \) is the planet's mass, \( K \) is the RV semi-amplitude, and \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the star's mass. Since \( G \) and \( M_{\text{star}} \) are constant for both planets, the ratio of their orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_1^2 / K_1^2}{M_2^2 / K_2^2} = \frac{M_1^2 K_2^2}{M_2^2 K_1^2}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( K \) for each planet
The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is derived from the Doppler shift formula:

\[
K = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} \cdot c
\]

For Planet1:
\[
\Delta \lambda = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \quad \lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å}, \quad c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
K_1 = \frac{0.03 \times 10^{-10}}{6300 \times 10^{-10}} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1428 \, \text{m/s}
\]

For Planet2:
\[
\Delta \lambda = 0.04 \, \text{Å}, \quad \lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å}
\]
\[
K_2 = \frac{0.04 \times 10^{-10}}{6300 \times 10^{-10}} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1905 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio of orbital distances
The masses of the planets are \( M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}} \) and \( M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}} \). Substituting into the formula for \( a_1 / a_2 \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_1^2 K_2^2}{M_2^2 K_1^2} = \frac{(7)^2 (1905)^2}{(5)^2 (1428)^2}
\]

First, calculate the squared terms:
\[
7^2 = 49, \quad 5^2 = 25, \quad \frac{1905}{1428} \approx 1.333, \quad \left(\frac{1905}{1428}\right)^2 \approx 1.778
\]

Now compute the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{49}{25} \cdot 1.778 = 1.96 \cdot 1.778 \approx 3.507
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 3.507 \, a_2 \).

### Step 3: Compute the temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.507}} \approx \sqrt{0.285} \approx 0.534
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \( 0.53 \).

Okay, so I've got this question about two planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 with 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 with 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I think is something like T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance, R_s is the star's radius, T_s is the star's effective temperature, and a is the planet's distance. Oh wait, wait, I think the formula is more like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) ) but since both have the same albedo, that term cancels out when taking the ratio.

But wait, in this problem, the question doesn't give us the orbital distances of the planets. It gives us the Doppler shifts from the RV method. Hmm. Oh right! So maybe I can find the mass and then the velocity, but wait how does that tie into the distance?

Wait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet based on the Doppler shift. The shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so denominator simplifies. But since the planets are detected via transit as well, their orbital planes are edge-on, so sin i is 1. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3... wait, maybe I should think of it another way.

Wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. But without knowing the orbital period or the distance, can we find the distance from the given Doppler shifts?

Wait, the problem gives the Doppler shifts for each planet. Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. And the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity that causes this shift. Because the Doppler shift formula is approximated as delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. So K is approximately (delta_lambda) / (lambda) * c = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * 3e8 m/s. Wait, let me calculate that.

Wait, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å, which is 0.03e-10 meters. Lambda is 6300 Å (or 6300e-10 m). So delta_lambda / lambda is 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6. Then, K = (delta_lambda/lambda) * c ≈ 4.76e-6 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.428e3 m/s. Wait, that seems high. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.03 Å is 3e-2 angstroms. Oh wait, no: 0.03 Å is 3e-2 * 1e-10 m = 3e-12 m. Lambda is 6300e-10 m, so ratio is 3e-12 / 6300e-10 = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = approx 4.76e-6.

Then K = (4.76e-6) * c. c is 3e8 m/s. So 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s. So K for Planet1 is about 1428 m/s. Similarly, Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å, so K would be (0.04 / 6300) * c = approx 1.905e3 m/s.

Wait, but Doppler shift tells us about the star's velocity. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) = ( (27.4 m/s) * (M_p / M_Jup) (P yr)^(-1/3) (M_star / M_sun)^(-2/3) ) ) ), but that's another version. Alternatively, the formula is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) ). But I think the key is that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), but without knowing P, it's tricky.

Wait, but wait: Since both planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same. So the ratio of their K velocities would be (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (P1 / P2 )^(-1/3) ). But we don't have P1 and P2. Hmm.

Alternatively, the formula for K can be written as K = (v * sin i) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) * c, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v_star) = ( ( (M_p * sin i) ) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * ( (2π G ) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so we can ignore that term. So K ≈ ( (M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * ( (2π G ) / (P) )^(1/3) )^(1).

But again, without knowing P, the orbital period, I can't find a and hence the distance. But wait, the transit method gives the period because the transit duration depends on the orbital period and the planet's orbital speed, the star's size, etc. But the question doesn't give the period, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets depends on the distance from the star, since T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if I can find the ratio of a1/a2, then I can find the ratio of their temperatures.

But how? Because the RV method gives us the velocity of the star, which depends on the planet's mass and the distance. So, perhaps the K velocity is related to the planet's mass and the distance.

Wait, another formula: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (c) )

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me recall the correct formula for K. I think the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Assuming sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, as transit implies), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Rearranging, (K)^(3) = ( (2π G ) ) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 P )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe another approach. The orbital velocity of the star is given by K, which relates to the planet's orbital velocity. The star and planet orbit their common barycenter, so their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, v_p = (M_star / M_p) * v_star. So v_p is the planet's orbital speed, which is 2π a_p / P, where a_p is the planet's orbital radius. Similarly, v_star is K. So:

v_p / v_star = M_star / M_p

But v_p = (2π a_p) / P.

So (2π a_p / P ) / K = M_star / M_p => a_p = ( K * M_star * P ) / (2 π M_p )

But without knowing P, I can't get a_p. Hmm.

Wait, but using Kepler's third law, which says that P^2 = (4π² a^3) / (G (M_star + M_p) ). Since M_p is small, this approximates to P² = (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So substituting P from this into the equation for a_p:

a_p = [ (K * M_star ) / (2 π M_p ) ] * [ (4 π² a_p^3 ) / ( G M_star ) ) )^(1/2) ) ]

Wait, this seems complicated. Let me try substituting P from Kepler's law into the a_p equation.

From Kepler's law: P² = (4 π² a_p^3) / ( G M_star )

So P = (4 π² a_p^3 / ( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substituting into a_p expression:

a_p = ( K * M_star * ( (4 π² a_p^3 / ( G M_star ))^(1/2) ) ) ) / ( 2 π M_p )

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Wait, perhaps let me rearrange the equation for a_p.

Wait, from earlier:

a_p = ( K * M_star * P ) / (2 π M_p )

But from Kepler's law, P = sqrt( (4 π² a_p^3) / (G M_star) ) ) = 2 π ( a_p^3 / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

So substitute this into the a_p equation:

a_p = [ K * M_star * 2 π ( a_p^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2) ) ] / ( 2 π M_p )

Simplify numerator: K M_star * 2 π * (a_p^3/(G M_star ))^(1/2) → 2 π K M_star * (a_p^(3/2)) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ) )

Denominator: 2 π M_p → So overall:

a_p = [ 2 π K M_star * a_p^(3/2) ) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ) ] / ( 2 π M_p )

The 2 π cancels. So:

a_p = [ K M_star * a_p^(3/2) ) ] / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) M_p )

Hmm. Let me rearrange:

a_p * M_p = ( K M_star ) a_p^(3/2) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

Multiply both sides by G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2):

a_p * M_p * G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) = K M_star a_p^(3/2)

Divide both sides by a_p^(3/2):

a_p^( -1/2 ) * M_p * G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) = K M_star

So:

a_p^(-1/2) = ( K M_star ) / ( M_p G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

Which can be written as:

a_p^(-1/2) = ( K sqrt(M_star) ) / ( M_p sqrt(G) ) )

Then, square both sides:

a_p^(-1) = ( K² M_star ) / ( M_p² G )

So a_p = ( M_p² G ) / ( K² M_star )

That's a formula for a_p in terms of K, M_p, M_star, and G.

Wait, that's a key equation. So for each planet, a_p is ( M_p^2 G ) / ( K^2 M_star )

Wait, let me check the units to make sure. M_p is mass, G has units of m^3/(kg s^2), K is velocity (m/s), M_star is kg.

So numerator: M_p² G → (kg)^2 * m^3/(kg s²) ) → kg m^3 / s².

Denominator: K^2 M_star → (m²/s²) * kg → kg m²/s².

So overall, (kg m^3/s²) / (kg m²/s² ) ) = m.

So units are meters, which is correct for a_p.

So yes, the formula a_p = ( G M_p² ) / ( K² M_star ) ) → that seems correct.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck.

Wait, when we had a_p^(-1/2) = ( K M_star ) / ( M_p G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

So, simplifying denominator: G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) = sqrt( G M_star )

So numerator is K M_star = K M_star.

So a_p^(-1/2) = ( K M_star ) / ( M_p sqrt(G M_star) ) )

Which can be written as K M_star / ( M_p sqrt(G M_star) ) ) = K sqrt(M_star) / ( M_p sqrt(G) ) )

Then, a_p^(-1/2) = ( K sqrt(M_star) ) / ( M_p sqrt(G) ) )

So, a_p^(1/2) = ( M_p sqrt(G) ) / ( K sqrt(M_star) ) )

Then a_p = [ ( M_p sqrt(G) ) / ( K sqrt(M_star) ) ) ]^2 → ( M_p² G ) / ( K² M_star )

Yes, that's correct.

So, for each planet, a_p is ( G M_p² ) / ( K² M_star )

So, the ratio a1 / a2 = [ ( M1² ) / ( K1² ) ] / [ ( M2² ) / ( K2² ) ] * ( M_star cancels )

Wait, actually, since a_p is proportional to M_p²/( K² ), because M_star is same for both planets.

So:

a1/a2 = ( M1² / K1² ) * ( K2² / M2² ) ) = ( M1² K2² ) / ( M2² K1² )

Because a_p is proportional to (M_p²)/(K^2). So the ratio a1/a2 is (M1² / M2²) * (K2² / K1²).

So, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their distances.

Because T_eq is proportional to (L_star / (16 pi sigma a^2 ))^(1/4 ), but since L_star is same for both planets, T_eq is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2) → T_eq ~ 1/sqrt(a)

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because if a1 > a2, T1 would be smaller than T2.

So, T_ratio = T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

Given that, we need to find a1 and a2.

Planet1:

M_p1 =7 Earth masses.

But need to convert to kg. Earth mass is about 5.97e24 kg. So 7 * 5.97e24 ≈ 4.179e25 kg.

K1 is 0.03 Å → 0.03e-10 m. Using the Doppler shift formula: K = (v/c) * lambda. Wait, earlier calculation gave K as 1428 m/s for Planet1.

Wait, no. Let me recheck. The shift is given as 0.03 Å, which is 0.03e-10 m. The line is at 6300 Å → 6300e-10 m.

The formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c → v = c * (delta_lambda/lambda)

So for Planet1: v = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, that's (0.03 /6300) * 3e8 = (0.03 /6300 ) is 4.76e-6 → 4.76e-6 *3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s.

So K1 is 1428 m/s.

Similarly, Planet2 has a shift of 0.04 Å → K2 = (0.04e-10 /6300e-10 ) *3e8 → 0.04/6300 ≈6.349e-6 → 6.349e-6 *3e8=1.9047e3 m/s.

So K1=1428 m/s, K2=1905 m/s.

M_p1=7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses.

Now, a1 = ( G M_p1² ) / ( K1² M_star )

Wait, but M_star is 1.5 solar masses. Solar mass is about 1.989e30 kg. So M_star=1.5 *1.989e30≈2.98e30 kg.

So for a1:

a1 = ( G * (7 Me)^2 ) / ( (1428)^2 * M_star )

Similarly, a2 = ( G * (5 Me)^2 ) / ( (1905)^2 * M_star )

But since M_star and G are same for both, the ratio a1/a2 = ( (7 Me)^2 / (1428)^2 ) / ( (5 Me)^2 / (1905)^2 ) )

Simplify:

a1/a2 = (7² /5² ) * (1905² /1428² )

Compute 7²=49, 5²=25 → 49/25=1.96

1905/1428 ≈ let's compute that.

1905 ÷ 1428 ≈ 1.333 approx.

Because 1428 * 1.333 = 1428*(4/3)= 1904, which is about 1905.

So (1905/1428)^2 ≈ (4/3)^2=16/9≈1.7778.

So a1/a2= 1.96 * 1.7778 ≈ 3.507.

So a1 is about 3.5 times a2. So a1 =3.5 a2.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, 1905/1428 is approximately 1.333, so squared is 1.777.

So a1/a2= (49/25) * ( (1905/1428)^2 ) → 1.96 * 1.7778 ≈ 3.507.

So a1 is about 3.5 times a2. So a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is further away.

Now, equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to (L / (a^2 ))^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo and the star's luminosity is same, the ratio of their temperatures is T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2 )

Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a1 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1/3.507 ) ≈ sqrt(0.285) ≈ 0.534.

So the ratio T1/T2 is approximately 0.534, which is about 0.53.

Looking at the options: option C is ~0.53.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is proportional to \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), where \( a \) is the orbital distance from the star. Since both planets orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of their orbital distances: 

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distance \( a \) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \), which is related to the planet's mass \( M_p \), the star's mass \( M_{\text{star}} \), and the Doppler shift. The formula for \( a \) is:

\[
a_p = \frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_{\text{star}}}
\]

Here, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M_p \) is the planet's mass, \( K \) is the RV semi-amplitude, and \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the star's mass. Since \( G \) and \( M_{\text{star}} \) are constant for both planets, the ratio of their orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_1^2 / K_1^2}{M_2^2 / K_2^2} = \frac{M_1^2 K_2^2}{M_2^2 K_1^2}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( K \) for each planet
The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is derived from the Doppler shift formula:

\[
K = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} \cdot c
\]

For Planet1:
\[
\Delta \lambda = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \quad \lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å}, \quad c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
K_1 = \frac{0.03 \times 10^{-10}}{6300 \times 10^{-10}} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1428 \, \text{m/s}
\]

For Planet2:
\[
\Delta \lambda = 0.04 \, \text{Å}, \quad \lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å}
\]
\[
K_2 = \frac{0.04 \times 10^{-10}}{6300 \times 10^{-10}} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1905 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio of orbital distances
The masses of the planets are \( M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}} \) and \( M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}} \). Substituting into the formula for \( a_1 / a_2 \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_1^2 K_2^2}{M_2^2 K_1^2} = \frac{(7)^2 (1905)^2}{(5)^2 (1428)^2}
\]

First, calculate the squared terms:
\[
7^2 = 49, \quad 5^2 = 25, \quad \frac{1905}{1428} \approx 1.333, \quad \left(\frac{1905}{1428}\right)^2 \approx 1.778
\]

Now compute the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{49}{25} \cdot 1.778 = 1.96 \cdot 1.778 \approx 3.507
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 3.507 \, a_2 \).

### Step 3: Compute the temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.507}} \approx \sqrt{0.285} \approx 0.534
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \( 0.53 \).
