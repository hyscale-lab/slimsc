Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with the ability of a compound to rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So if a molecule has a chiral center, it can exist as enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question gives four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each a combination of the numbers 1-4. Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, that structure. So biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 6' on each ring, which are nitro groups. Also, at positions 2 and 2', there are carboxylate groups, each as methyl esters. Wait, biphenyl systems can have what's called a biphenyl axis. If the substituents on each benzene ring are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, then maybe there's no optical isomerism. But if the substituents are in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, they might lead to enantiomers.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center? Let me think. The central single bond connecting the two benzene rings could allow for rotation, but if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, perhaps the molecule is chiral. Wait, but without a chiral center, can the molecule still be chiral? Oh right, some molecules are chiral due to their overall structure, like having a plane or center of asymmetry. Like the biphenyl with certain substituents. So if the substituents are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. Let's see: 6,6' are nitro, and 2,2' are ester groups. So on each benzene ring, substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, benzene is symmetric. If each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, but wait, the numbering is a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to the molecule having a plane of symmetry. So, I'm not sure about this one yet. I'll come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But wait, wait. Wait, the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be (CH3)COHCH2? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(COOH)CH(OH) something? Wait, wait. Or wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is (CH3)COHCH2COOH? Wait, maybe I should write it as CH3-CHOH-COOH. No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Let's think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that's only three carbons. So the ester would be that with the COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So let's see: the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3 group attached to carbon 2.
Carbon 2: has a hydroxyl (OH), a CH2COOCH3 group, and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Alternatively, the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH2. Wait, that would be four different groups attached to carbon 2: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and CH2 (wait, no, the CH2 is part of the chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm not visualizing it correctly.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO- ester. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So looking at the carbons: the central carbon (carbon 2) has attached groups: OH, CH3 (from CH2), COOCH3, and the adjacent CH2 group. Wait, but the adjacent group on carbon 2 is another CH2 group attached to carbon 1, which is CH3. So carbon 2 has:

- OH group
- CH2CH3 (from the CH2-)
- COOCH3 group
- and the carbon 1, which is CH2-.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the central carbon (the second C) is connected to:

- OH (on C2),
- a CH2- group (connected to C1, which is CH3),
- a COOCH3 group (on C3),
- and a CH2- connected to C3? Wait, no, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: -COOCH3

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central Carbon 2 is attached to:

- CH3 (from Carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),
- and a CH2 group? Wait, that's not quite right. Wait, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group? No, wait, no. Because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another H? No, that's not possible. Wait, no, wait, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it's CH2(OH) in this structure? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count the valency.

Each carbon must have four bonds. So for Carbon 2 in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3: it's connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- Two other carbons? No, only Carbon 3 (the COOCH3 group),
- An OH,
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no, because that would make four bonds. So the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So Carbon 2 has:

- CH3 group,
- OH,
- COOCH3 group,
- and a single bond to the next carbon, which is Carbon 3 (the COOCH3). Wait, no, Carbon 3 is the COOCH3, so Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 3. So Carbon 2 has the four bonds: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the single bond to Carbon 3.

So the four substituents on Carbon 2 are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single bond to the next carbon. But wait, the next carbon is CH2? No, wait, no. Let me draw it again.

Structure:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: -COOCH3

So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- OH,
- and another H? Because CH(OH) would have two H's. Wait, no, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (Carbon 2) has:

- Two CH groups: one to Carbon 1 (CH3), one to Carbon 3 (which is a carbonyl group),
- OH,
- and a single H.

Wait, but that would make four substituents: CH3 (from Carbon 1), COOCH3 (from Carbon 3), OH, and H. So, four different groups? No, because one substituent is H. So, the substituents would be: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. But H is not a different group from any other H attached to the same carbon. So, wait, that's four substituents, but are they all different? CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So they are all different. So Carbon 2 is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center; thus, it can have optical isomerism. So compound 2 can exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is phenyl group. So the structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two benzene rings. So the structure is: Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Now, let's see if this molecule has any chiral centers. The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it's double-bonded to O and attached to two phenyl groups and another phenyl group? Wait, no. Wait, benzophenone is (Ar)2CO, so the carbonyl group is between two aryl groups. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl oxygen. So the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the central carbon has:

- Two phenyl groups (which are same),
- One oxygen double bond (so it's not a substituent),
- And another substituent? Wait, no, the central carbon is in the carbonyl group, which is C=O. So, no, the central carbon is part of the carbonyl, so it's double-bonded to O, and connected to two phenyl groups. So the substituents are: phenyl, phenyl, O (double bond), and a lone pair (since double bonds take two substituents). Wait, but in terms of valency, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to two phenyl groups. So it's not a chiral center because it's only connected to two identical groups (two phenyls) and double-bonded O. So the substituents are two phenyls, O, and no other. So no, the central carbon is not a chiral center. Are there any other chiral centers in benzophenone? No, because the benzene rings themselves are planar and symmetrical. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, where the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and each of the other two carbons (2 and 3) have COOCH3 groups. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Now, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. The groups on each end of the double bond are:

On C1: CH3 (from CH2)
On C2: two COOCH3 groups and another substituent.

Wait, no, the structure is (E)-butenedioate. So the substituents on each end of the double bond are two COOCH3 groups on one carbon (C2), and a CH3 group and another substituent on C1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the geometry. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the substituents on the double bond are arranged in a trans configuration. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, can this molecule have stereoisomerism? Because of the double bond geometry. Wait, but in this case, we're looking for optical isomerism, which is about chirality, not geometric isomerism (cis-trans).

Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. Alternatively, if it has a chiral center, then it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, the molecule dimethyl fumarate: each COOCH3 is attached to C2 and C3 of the butenedioate. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the double bond is between C1 (CH2-) and C2 (which is connected to two COOCH3 groups). So the structure is:

CH2-CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, no. Because fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two central carbons, but in the E configuration. Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, butenedioic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but with a double bond. So fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but with a double bond between the two central CH2 groups, making it HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but that's not correct because that would be four carbons with a double bond. Wait, no: butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct: butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, while maleic acid is the cis isomer.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the ester of fumaric acid with methanol. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So on each end of the double bond, the groups are CH2- and two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no: the structure would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but with the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has CH2-, and C2 has two COOCH3 groups, arranged trans to each other.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Looking at the structure, each COOCH3 is attached to C2. So C2 is connected to:

- Two COOCH3 groups,
- A CH2 group (from C1),
- And another substituent? Hmm, no, the C2 in CH2=C(COOCH3)2 is connected to:

- One CH2 group (from C1),
- Two COOCH3 groups (since it's (COOCH3)2),
- And a double bond to C1.

Wait, no, each carbon in a double bond is bonded to three groups. So in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, so it's bonded to two H's and a CH. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the structure is (E)-CH2-C(COOCH3)2. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, so each of the two COOCH3 groups is attached to C2 (the double bond carbon). So C2 has:

- Two COOCH3 groups,
- A double bond to C1 (which is CH2),
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen? No, because in the double bond, each carbon is bonded to two substituents. So C1 is CH2 connected to the double bond, and C2 is connected to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond to C1. But that can't be right because each carbon in a double bond has three substituents. So C1 is CH2, so it's bonded to two H's and a double bond. C2 is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond to C1. So each double bond carbon has three substituents. So in this molecule, does any carbon have four different groups attached, making it a chiral center? Let's check each carbon.

Looking at the COOCH3 groups: each ester group is symmetrical. So for the central C (C2), it's bonded to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond to C1, and perhaps another substituent. Wait, but in this structure, C2 is attached to two COOCH3 groups, and double bonded to C1. So, no, C2 has only three substituents: two COOCH3 and the double bond. Therefore, no chiral center. So, does the molecule have any chiral centers? Let's see. The other carbons are in the COOCH3 groups: each O is connected to CH3, but those are all symmetric. So the entire molecule is symmetric around the double bond, perhaps. Wait, because in the (E) configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, but wait—another possibility: the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then it would be chiral.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two COOCH3 groups is on a different carbon, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So, the two COOCH3 groups are mirror images across the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry, meaning it's superimposable on its mirror image. So it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, that can't be right. Because sometimes, even with symmetry, if there's a lack of a plane of symmetry, the molecule can be chiral. Let me think again. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, then it would be chiral. But in fumarate's case, since the substituents are arranged trans, does that create a chiral center?

Wait, no, because in dimethyl fumarate, each of the C2's attached to the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, so they are identical. So each of those carbons is connected to two identical groups, which means they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and is not optically active. Wait, but I seem to remember that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Wait, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical activity. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about the structure again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each of the two COOCH3 groups is attached to the same carbon (C2). So C2 is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond to C1 (CH2), and another substituent? Wait, no, that's three substituents. So C2 has three groups: two COOCH3 and a double bond. Therefore, it's not a chiral center. So the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism here. But wait, I thought that in some cases, the molecule can be chiral without a chiral center, such as in the case of allenes or certain bicyclic compounds. But in dimethyl fumarate, I don't think that's the case. The molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about another example. For example, tartaric acid has two stereocenters and can exhibit optical isomerism. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are symmetric, so no chiral centers. So, I think compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center. Let's recap.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the biphenyl has substituents at 6 and 2 positions on each ring. Are the substituents arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral? Let me imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at the 6 position and a carboxylate ester at the 2 position. The biphenyl is connected through the 1 and 1' positions. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 3, and 5 are meta, and 2,4,6 are the other positions.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So on each ring, the two substituents are para to each other. Now, the biphenyl's two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1', so the substituents are in positions that could create a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, this molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or perhaps not.

Wait, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to each other. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, when you have substituents in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it can be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents in the biphenyl leads to a chiral structure. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. But to determine that, I'd need to imagine the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are on each ring at positions that mirror each other, the molecule would be achiral. But in this case, the substituents are at 6 and 2 on each ring. Wait, perhaps the arrangement is such that each substituent on one ring is mirrored on the other ring, leading to a plane of symmetry. So the molecule would be achiral. Therefore, compound 1 does not show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: look for examples. For instance, 1,2-dimethyl-1,2-biphenyl would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the substituents are at positions that don't mirror each other, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. So, on each ring, the substituents are at opposite ends. So, considering the biphenyl structure, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule is not chiral, hence no optical isomerism.

So, based on this, compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So to summarize:

1: No optical isomerism.

2: Yes, has a chiral center, so yes.

3: No, no chiral centers.

4: No, because no chiral centers, but wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, another idea: dimethyl fumarate has a structure where the two ester groups are on the same carbon, so let me think about that carbon.

Wait, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the C in the double bond (C2) has two COOCH3 groups attached. Each of those groups is the same, so C2 has two identical substituents. Therefore, C2 cannot be a chiral center.

But wait, what about the other carbons? The other carbons are in the COOCH3 groups, which are symmetrical. So no chiral centers in the molecule. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I remember that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, but that's about E and Z isomerism, not optical isomerism. So, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chiral centers.

So, putting it all together:

Which compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

1: No.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

The options are:

A) 1,2,4.

B)3,4.

C)2,3.

D)1,2.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to D as follows:

A) 1,2 and4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2.

Hmm, according to my analysis, only compound 2 does. So none of the options say 2 only. But wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let's reevaluate compound 4.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each COOCH3 is attached to C2, which is double-bonded to C1 (CH2). So, the structure is:

CH2-CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, C2 is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond to C1 (CH2), and perhaps another substituent. Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is triple-bonded? No, double bonds have two substituents. So, in this structure, C2 is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond to C1. So, the substituents are two COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, but no, the CH2 is part of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each substituent on C2 is a COOCH3 group, and the other substituent is the double bond. So, the four substituents on C2 are: COOCH3 (twice), and the double bond (which is considered as two substituents—like a single substituent that's a double bond). No, wait, that's not correct. Each double bond is a single substituent. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a center that's a chiral center. Let me imagine the structure again. Suppose the structure is CH2-CH(COOCH3)2, but with a double bond. So, the structure would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, that's not correct because that would mean a double bond between C1 and C2, with C2 having two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. But that can't be because a double bond is between two carbons, each bonded to two other groups.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possibility of a chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. Each COOCH3 group is attached to C2. So, the substituents on C2 are two COOCH3 groups, a CH2 group (from the double bond), and what else? Oh wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C2 is bonded to C1 (which is CH2), and two COOCH3 groups. So, C2 has three substituents: two COOCH3 and a CH2 group connected via a double bond. But wait, that's three substituents, so C2 can't have a chiral center because it's part of a double bond. Therefore, no chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. So, no optical isomerism.

So, going back, only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking back, the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2.

Hmm, but according to my analysis, only 2 does. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Another possibility: dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. But that's about E and Z isomerism, not optical isomerism. So, for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral due to a different reason. For example, if the molecule has a plane of asymmetry, it can be chiral without any chiral centers. But I don't think dimethyl fumarate fits that scenario.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same carbon, but perhaps that carbon isn't part of the double bond. Let me think. No, because fumarate is an E isomer, so the substituents are on opposite sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, based on this, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, what about compound 1? Let's think again. The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Now, in the biphenyl, the substituents are arranged such that each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each substituent is para to the other on the same ring.

But when considering the entire molecule, the arrangement of substituents on the two rings could create a chiral center. Wait, but each substituent is para on its own ring, but their positions relative to each other could create asymmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, the entire molecule would be achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically across the biphenyl axis. For example, if the substituents are on the same side of each ring, the molecule could be chiral.

But it's a bit hard to visualize without a drawing. Let me think of a simpler case. If a biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, and the substituents are the same on each ring, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, the substituents are in the same positions on each ring. So when connected via the 1 and 1' positions, the substituents are mirrored, leading to a plane of symmetry. Hence, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, only compound 2 does. But looking back, the options don't include an option with only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. The central carbon (C2) is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond to C1, and another substituent.

Wait, no, in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two substituents. So, for C2 in CH2=C(COOCH3)2, it's connected to:

- Two COOCH3 groups,

- A double bond to C1 (CH2).

Wait, that's only three substituents. So, no, C2 is not a chiral center because it's part of a double bond. Therefore, no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I missed another compound. Let's think about compound 4 again. Could the molecule have any other chiral centers?

Wait, the COOCH3 groups are attached to the same carbon (C2). Each COOCH3 is -OOCR, so the carbonyl is part of the ester. So, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to OCH3. So, the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center. So, no.

So, in conclusion:

Only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think: could the molecule have a chiral center elsewhere?

Wait, perhaps the ester groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Let me think: in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same carbon, but are they attached to a central chiral carbon?

Wait, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the C2 is bonded to two COOCH3 groups, a CH2 (from C1), and part of a double bond. So, C2 is CH(COOCH3)2, but in reality, it's part of a double bond. So, no, C2 can't be a chiral center because it's part of a double bond.

But wait, what if the molecule isn't symmetric? For example, if the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are arranged trans, which might create a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach: Which of the given options include compound 2 and any others that might have a chiral center.

Looking at the options, option A includes 2, option D includes 2 and 1, which I thought doesn't have it. Option A includes 4, which I don't think has it. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Each of the COOCH3 groups is attached to C2, which is part of a double bond. So, the substituents on C2 are two COOCH3 groups, a CH2 group, and a double bond. Wait, no, a double bond is a single substituent, so C2 would have three substituents. Therefore, no chiral center.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the other compounds.

Wait, let me re-examine compound 4. Another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a plane of asymmetry, making it chiral without any chiral centers. For example, the molecule might be a meso compound.

Wait, in fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same carbon and in the trans configuration. So, the molecule is symmetric along the double bond. Hence, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to my initial conclusion: only compound 2.

But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the structure of compound 4.

Wait, another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, which doesn't impact optical isomerism. So, no optical activity.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is only 2, but since the options don't have that, maybe I made a mistake with another compound.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each benzene ring has substituents at 6 and 2. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'. Now, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. For example, the substituents might be arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, considering the substituents on each ring: each has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, when looking at the entire molecule, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a non-symmetrical way across the biphenyl axis. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side, leading to no plane of symmetry.

But without a clear image, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Another approach: perhaps the substituents are at positions that create a chiral axis or plane, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a central axis of symmetry, making it achiral. Because the substituents on each ring are mirrored, leading to a plane of symmetry.

So, in that case, compound 1 is achiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Thus, I'm back to the initial conclusion: only compound 2.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe the structure is such that it has a chiral center.

Wait, another possibility: the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that it has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the ester groups are attached in a way that creates a chiral center on the carbonyl carbon. But no, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to two ester groups. So, no, not a chiral center.

Hmm. Perhaps I should re-examine all the compounds.

Wait, another approach: which compounds have at least one chiral center.

Compound 1: No.

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So, only 2.

But looking at the options, option A includes 2 and 4, but I don't think 4 has a chiral center. So perhaps the correct answer is only 2, but it's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the question intended to include another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think: is there any possibility that the molecule has a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is dimethyl fumarate, which is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Now, the substituents on the double bond are two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. Wait, but each of the double bond carbons has two substituents. So, perhaps one of those substituents is a chiral center.

Wait, the substituent on C1 (CH2) is connected to two H's and a double bond. So, no, that's not a chiral center.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center in a different position. For example, perhaps the methyl groups in the ester create a chiral center. But that's not the case because the ester groups are on the same carbon, making it symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, after all this, I think the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a stereogenic center on the central carbon.

Wait, no. The central carbon in the ester is the carbonyl carbon, which is not a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, including 2 and 4, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 actually does have a chiral center.

Wait, what if the structure of dimethyl fumarate is different? Suppose it's not CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but instead, the substituents are on adjacent carbons with a double bond. For example, CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, that structure would have the two COOCH3 groups on C2 and C3, making the structure more complex. In that case, perhaps C2 and C3 would have different substituents, leading to chiral centers.

Wait, but that's not the structure of fumarate. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, so the substituents are on the same carbon across the double bond. So, I think I was correct earlier.

In conclusion, I think only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options match this, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A includes 1,2, and 4. If I'm incorrect about 1 and 4, maybe both have optical isomerism.

Let me think again about compound 1. If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged asymmetrically, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

In dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The connection is at 1 and 1'.

So, the molecule's structure would have substituents on each ring that are para to each other. But when considering the entire molecule, perhaps the arrangement creates a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical along the biphenyl axis, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, conclusion: only compound 2.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think one more time. Another possibility is that in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere, like in the ester groups. But no, the ester groups are symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 2. Let me re-examine that.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (Carbon 2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent CH2 group (which is connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3).

Wait, no, Carbon 2 is attached to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,

- Carbon 3: COOCH3,

- OH,

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that would mean four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, four different groups. Therefore, Carbon 2 is a chiral center, so the molecule has optical isomerism.

So, I'm confident that compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So, perhaps the correct answer includes 2 and another compound that I missed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Another thought: perhaps the molecule has a plane of asymmetry, making it chiral.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to select the option that includes compound 2 and any others I think might be correct.

Looking at the options, option A includes 1, 2, and 4. But I don't think 1 and 4 are correct. Option D includes 1 and 2. I don't think 1 is correct. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think: the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the C2 has two COOCH3 groups, a double bond to C1, and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, but that's three substituents. So, no chiral center.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, including 2 and 4, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Another possibility: the molecule has a double bond which allows for geometric isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, making it achiral despite having stereogenic centers.

Wait, but I don't think that's the case here.

In conclusion, I'll go with the option that includes compound 2. Looking at the options, option A includes 2, but I'm not sure about 1 and 4.

But perhaps I should reevaluate. Let me think about each compound one last time.

1: No.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

So, only 2. But options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including 2 and 4, but I think 4 doesn't have it. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2 and4.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll have to make a decision based on the time I've spent.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other features that enable chirality, such as a lack of symmetry or a plane of asymmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The substituents on each ring are para to each other, and the molecule likely has a plane of symmetry due to the mirrored arrangement of substituents on the two rings. Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. Since it is a chiral center, the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph is a phenyl group. The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group and is bonded to two identical phenyl groups, a double-bonded oxygen, and no other substituents. It has no chiral centers and is symmetric, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid and has the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. The double bond is in the trans (E) configuration, and the two COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **Compound 2** (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only Compound 2. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **Option A (1, 2, and 4)**, assuming the question intends for Compound 4 to exhibit optical isomerism, despite the analysis suggesting otherwise.
