Alright, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects with neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me think. Okay, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But since these clouds are absorbing it, we're looking at absorption lines. So when this light comes from a quasar behind the cloud, the absorption would shift into a different wavelength due to redshift.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So for them to detect the absorption line, the shifted wavelength has to be in the optical range. So the redshift must be enough to move the 1216 Angstrom line into the visible spectrum.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is about 121.6 nm (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm). Optical wavelengths are longer, say from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So I need to find the redshift z where 121.6 nm*(1+z) is around 400 nm or more, because that's when the wavelength is in the optical range.

Let me do the math. Let's set 121.6*(1+z) = 400. Solving for z: (400/121.6) -1 = z. Let me calculate that. 400 divided by 121.6 is about 3.29. So 3.29 minus 1 is 2.29. So z is approximately 2.29.

Wait, but if the redshift is lower than that, the observed wavelength would still be shorter than 400 nm, which is ultraviolet, and ground-based telescopes can't see it. So the lower limit on the redshift is when the wavelength is just entering the optical range, so around z=2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close. Option D is 1.9, which would give a wavelength of 121.6*(2.9)= ~353 nm, which is still in the UV. So the lower limit must be higher than 1.9. So the options are B)1.2, D)1.9, C)2.4.

Wait, wait, I think I should double-check my calculation. Let me compute 121.6 * (1 + z) = 400. So 1+z = 400/121.6 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29.

So the lower redshift would be around 2.29. The options don't have exactly that. So the next higher option is C) 2.4. But wait, perhaps I should consider the maximum wavelength the telescope can observe. What's the maximum optical wavelength? Maybe around 700 nm. Then 121.6*(1+z) = 700. 700/121.6 ≈ 5.759. So z is about 4.759. But that's the upper limit. The question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z where the wavelength is just in the optical.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift so that the object can be detected. So if z is too low, the observed wavelength is still UV, which we can't see. So the minimal z is when 121.6*(1+z) is about the start of the optical range, say 400 nm.

So z ≈ 2.29. The options are 2.4, 1.9, etc. So the lower limit would be z=2.3, which isn't an option here. So the closest lower option is option C) 2.4. Or wait, perhaps the calculation should be done more precisely.

Let me compute 121.6 * (1 + z) = 400.

z = (400/121.6) - 1.

Compute 400 / 121.6: Let me compute 121.6 * 3 = 364.8. 400 - 364.8 = 35.2. 35.2/121.6 = 0.289 approx. So 3.289. So z ≈ 2.289.

So approximately 2.29. The options are 2.4 and 1.9. So 2.29 is between 1.9 and 2.4. The question is asking for the lower limit. So if the redshift is just enough for the line to be observed, that would be the minimal z. So the minimal z is about 2.29, but the options don't have that. So perhaps option C is 2.4, which is close but higher.

Wait, but what if the optical telescope can go a bit into the near-UV? Maybe 350 nm is sometimes accessible? Then 121.6*(1+z)=350.

z = (350/121.6)-1 ≈ (2.88) -1 ≈1.88. So z ≈1.88.

But that's still lower than option D which is 1.9. Hmm. So perhaps the initial assumption is that the optical range starts at 400 nm, but sometimes telescopes can go to 350 nm, so if the question allows for that, the lower limit would be about 1.88, which is close to option D (1.9). But that depends on the definition of optical.

Wait, what's the typical optical range? I think it's usually considered to be 400-700 nm. So the Lyman alpha line would have to be redshifted to at least 400 nm. So that would require a redshift of around 2.29. So looking at the options, the closest one is C)2.4. But wait, the options don't have 2.3, but perhaps 2.4 is the next higher. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29, so the minimal redshift would be around z=2.29. Since we don't have that option, perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman limit, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the Lyman-alpha absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm). For ground-based optical telescopes, the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm (so-called Lyman limit). So in order to observe the absorption line, the redshift must shift the 121.6 nm to above 300 nm.

Wait, that would make more sense. Because if the redshifted wavelength is above 300 nm, it's in the near-UV or optical, which can pass through the atmosphere.

So set 121.6*(1+z) = 300 nm.

So 1+z = 300/121.6 ≈ 2.467.

So z ≈ 1.467.

Wait, but then the redshift would be about 1.47, which is higher than option B (1.2) and lower than D (1.9). So perhaps the correct lower limit is when the wavelength is just above 300 nm. So z≈1.47.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match. Let me check again. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So 1.47 is between B and D. So perhaps the question is including the 300 nm as the cutoff. So the minimal z is around 1.47.

Wait, but 300 nm is in the UV, but certain telescopes can observe down to 300 nm. So perhaps the lower limit is z where wavelength is above 300 nm.

So 121.6*(1+z) = 300.

z = (300 / 121.6) -1 = approx 2.467 -1 = 1.467.

So about z=1.47. Looking at the options, the available options are B)1.2 and D)1.9. So 1.47 is between them. So which is the correct lower limit? Hmm. If the question is about the lower limit, the minimal z is 1.47, so any z above that would allow detection. So the lower limit is z≈1.47.

But the options don't have 1.47. So looking at the options again, B is 1.2, which is lower than 1.47, so at z=1.2, the wavelength would be 121.6*(2.2)= 267.52 nm, which is below 300 nm, so not observable. So to be observable, the redshift must be higher than z≈1.47. So the minimal is about 1.47, but since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm, and for it to be in the optical (say 400 nm), the redshift is higher. Or perhaps I'm mixing up emission and absorption.

Wait, wait, Lyman alpha is a transition in hydrogen. For emission, it's at 121.6 nm. But absorption lines would be in the same wavelength. So when a quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the cloud absorbs at 121.6 nm (rest frame). So the quasar's light, when observed, would have a absorption line at a longer wavelength, depending on the redshift.

So the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * (1+z).

Optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths shorter than about 300 nm (because of atmospheric cutoff). So for λ_obs >=300 nm, the absorption line is in the observable range. So solving 121.6*(1+z) =300.

z= (300/121.6) -1 ≈2.467 -1=1.467.

So the minimal redshift is around 1.47. So the lower limit is z=1.47. Since the options are 1.2, 1.9, etc., the minimal z is about 1.47, which is higher than option B (1.2) and lower than D (1.9). So the minimal redshift is 1.47, so the lower limit is z=1.47. So the object must have a redshift higher than this to be detected. So which option is the lower limit? The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of the object such that they can be detected. So the minimal z is 1.47, so any object with z >=1.47 would be detected.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is D)1.9, but that's higher than 1.47. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimal z such that the line is just in the optical. So the minimal would be 1.47, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I should think about where the Lyman series is. Wait, the Lyman series is in the UV, so for ground-based telescopes, to see Lyman-alpha absorption, the absorption line must be shifted into the visible spectrum, which starts at 400 nm. So the calculation is as I did earlier, leading to z≈2.29.

So which is the correct approach? Because if the atmosphere allows down to 300 nm, then the lower z is 1.47. But if the telescope is only looking in the optical (400-700 nm), then the minimal z is higher.

I think this is the crux of the problem. The question says 'optical ground-based telescopes'. So optical typically refers to 400-700 nm. So the Lyman alpha line must be redshifted into that range. So the minimal z is when 121.6*(1+z)=400. So z≈2.29.

So the options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. 2.29 is between them. Since it's a lower limit, the minimal possible z is 2.29, so the minimal redshift is just above 2.29. Therefore, the minimal z is approximately 2.29, but the options don't have that. So the closest higher option is C)2.4. Therefore, the lower limit would be z=2.29, so any z above that is detectable. So the lower limit is z=2.3, so option C)2.4 is the correct answer.

Wait, but why is option D)1.9 present? Because 1.9 is lower than 2.29, so at z=1.9, the observed wavelength is 121.6*(2.9)= 353 nm, which is still in the near-UV. So a ground-based telescope can't see that because the atmosphere blocks wavelengths below about 300 nm. Wait, no, 353 nm is above 300, so some telescopes can actually observe that. Oh! Maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.

Ah, wait, I think I'm confusing the cutoff. The atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm. So 353 nm is above that. So 353 nm is in the near-UV, which can pass through the atmosphere. So, yes, ground-based telescopes can observe 350 nm and above, but not below. So, the minimal redshift is when the observed wavelength is 300 nm. So the question is, does the telescope's optical range include 300 nm?

If the optical range is considered to start at 300 nm, then z=1.47. But if the optical range is 400 nm, then z=2.29.

So I'm a bit confused now. Maybe the question is considering the Lyman limit. The Lyman limit is about 91 nm, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm, and to be in the optical, it needs to be redshifted beyond 400 nm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but likely the correct approach is to assume that to be in the optical, the wavelength needs to be longer than 400 nm, which gives z≈2.29.

So the options are 2.4 and 1.9. 2.29 is closer to 2.4. So the lower limit on the redshift is just over 2.29, so the minimal redshift is approximately 2.3. Among the options, the closest higher is C)2.4.

But what if the question refers to the Lyman-alpha forest? The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in quasar spectra, and these are observed at wavelengths just into the optical. The Lyman-alpha forest occurs at redshifts where the Lyman-alpha wavelength is between about 380 nm (violet) and 430 nm (blue), I think. So the redshifts would be around (380/121.6)-1 ≈(3.12)-1=2.12, and (430/121.6)-1≈3.53-1=2.53.

So the Lyman-alpha forest is observed at redshifts z≈2-3. So the lower limit would be around z≈2.12. So the lower limit on redshift would be about 2.12, so the minimal z is around 2.12. Looking at the options, the closest is C)2.4, but that's higher. Hmm, but the options don't have 2.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the minimal z where the Lyman-alpha absorption line is in the optical. So the lower limit would be when the line is just entering the optical. So the minimal z would be when λ_obs=400 nm.

So, z=(400/121.6)-1≈2.29.

So the options are 2.4 and 1.9. So 2.29 is between them. But since the options don't have 2.29, perhaps the correct answer is the next higher option, which is C)2.4.

Wait, but 2.4 is a bit higher, but it's the only option above 2.29. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light is in the optical, but the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the near-UV. But then the redshift would have to be lower. Hmm.

I think I've overcomplicated this. Let me try to recap.

Problem: Estimate the lower limit on the redshift such that neutral hydrogen clouds can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes.

Key points:
- Lyman-alpha wavelength: 121.6 nm (rest frame)
- Observed wavelength must be in the optical range (400-700 nm) to be detected by optical telescopes.
- The atmosphere absorbs wavelengths shorter than ~300 nm, so anything below that isn't observable from the ground.

Wait, but optical usually refers to 400-700 nm. So if the observed wavelength is just above 400 nm, that's the minimal redshift for detection.

So 121.6 * (1+z) = 400.

z= (400/121.6) -1 ≈3.29-1=2.29.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest higher is C)2.4. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29, so any object with z ≥2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is z=2.29. Since the options don't have that, the correct answer must be the smallest z option that is above 2.29. Among the options, only option C (2.4) is above 2.29. So the correct answer is C)2.4.

To estimate the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) such that large clouds of neutral hydrogen can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we consider the following:

1. **Lyman-alpha Wavelength**: The Lyman-alpha absorption line occurs at a rest wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \) (1216 Å).

2. **Optical Range**: Optical ground-based telescopes typically observe wavelengths in the range \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) to \( 700 \, \text{nm} \). For the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable, the redshifted wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must fall within this range.

3. **Redshift Formula**: The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the redshift formula:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
   \]
   To determine the lower limit on \( z \), we set \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 400 \, \text{nm} \), which is the start of the optical range:
   \[
   400 = 121.6 \cdot (1 + z)
   \]
   Solving for \( z \):
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{400}{121.6} \approx 3.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \approx 2.29
   \]

4. **Atmospheric Considerations**: The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths shorter than approximately \( 300 \, \text{nm} \). However, since the question specifies "optical" telescopes, the relevant range is \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) to \( 700 \, \text{nm} \). Thus, the calculation above holds.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (\( z = 3 \))**: This corresponds to a wavelength longer than \( 400 \, \text{nm} \), so it is valid but not the lower limit.
   - **Option B (\( z = 1.2 \))**: At \( z = 1.2 \), the observed wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 121.6 \cdot (1 + 1.2) = 267.5 \, \text{nm} \), which is in the UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.
   - **Option C (\( z = 2.4 \))**: At \( z = 2.4 \), the observed wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 121.6 \cdot (1 + 2.4) = 353.4 \, \text{nm} \), which is in the near-UV and just detectable by some ground-based telescopes. This is the closest option to the calculated lower limit of \( z \approx 2.29 \).
   - **Option D (\( z = 1.9 \))**: At \( z = 1.9 \), the observed wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 121.6 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 353.4 \, \text{nm} \), which is still in the near-UV and not fully in the optical range.

6. **Conclusion**: The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest higher value is \( z = 2.4 \), making **Option C** the correct answer.
