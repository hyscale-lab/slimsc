Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules consist of two atoms bonded together, like O2 or HCl. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because in a rigid rotor, the bond length doesn't change, but in a non-rigid one, it can, which probably affects the vibrational and rotational energies.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh, right, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, where the vibrational quantum number is zero (n=0). So it's at the ground state for vibrations.

The question asks about the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, what does that mean? Well, the next lowest state after the fundamental state. But I'm a bit confused—are they talking about the next vibrational state or the next rotational state, or maybe a combination?

Wait, I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the molecule can have transitions that involve changes in both. But the question says the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's moving to the next higher energy state, which might involve the first excited vibrational state (n=1) with the rotational quantum number at its lowest possible value.

But wait, the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". Hmm, the next state would probably be the first excited state, but under the non-rigid rotor model, maybe that's the first vibrational state (n=1) with the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1?).

Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0) perhaps. So when you absorb a photon, the molecule could go to a higher vibrational state, or a higher rotational state, or both. But the question is about the 'next state' with the lowest possible energy, so I think it's the next in energy, which might be just a higher vibrational state with the same or minimal rotational state.

Wait, but the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized, and the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The vibration part has higher energy spacing compared to rotation, I think. So the next state after the fundamental (n=0, J=0) would be n=1, J=0? Or maybe J=1, n=0? Which transition would require less energy? Because the vibrational energy spacing is about hν, where ν is the frequency. And rotational energy spacing is about (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the vibrational energy is given by (n + 1/2) hν, and rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So the spacing between n=0 and n=1 is hν. The rotational spacing from J=0 to J=1 is ( (1(2)) - (0(1)) ) * (ħ²)/(2I) ) = (2 * ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So which is larger, hν or (ħ²)/(I)? Because if hν is larger, then the next state would be a vibrational transition, else a rotational one.

Given the data:

w = angular frequency = 4e14 rad/s.

So ν = w/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.28) ≈ ~6.37e13 Hz. So hν would be Planck's constant (h) times that. Let me calculate hν: h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So 6.626e-34 * 6.37e13 ≈ approx 4.22e-20 J.

Now, the rotational spacing: ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05e-34 J·s. So ħ squared is about 1.1e-68 (J·s)^2. I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r². μ is the reduced mass.

The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) amu. 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. So I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy spacing is (ħ²)/(I) = (1.1e-68) / (1.206e-46) ≈ about 9.12e-23 J.

Wait, comparing hν (4.22e-20 J) and the rotational spacing (9.12e-23 J). So hν is larger. So the vibrational transition requires more energy than the rotational. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either make a vibrational transition or a rotational one. Since the question is about the lowest possible energy transition, perhaps it's the smallest possible photon energy needed to reach the next state. So maybe the next state after the fundamental is the lowest energy state that's higher, which would be the next rotational state (J=1) with n=0.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state (n=0), but the rotational state could be higher. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the next rotational state (J=1) with n=0, because that requires less energy than moving to n=1.

Because the energy gap for J=0→J=1 is smaller than n=0→n=1.

So the photon must provide the energy equal to the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 in the same vibrational state n=0.

Wait, but how? Let me think again.

The fundamental state is n=0, and the rotational state could be J=0. So the next state would be either n=0, J=1 or n=1, J=0. Which of these has a lower energy? Because the rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I) and vibrational is (n + 1/2) hν. For n=1, J=0: energy is hν/2 + 0. For n=0, J=1: energy is (1*2 * ħ²)/(2I) ) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I). Which one is smaller?

We have the two energies: E_vib = hν/2 (for n=1, J=0) and E_rot = ħ²/(I) (for n=0, J=1).

Earlier, we found that hν was approximately 4.22e-20 J, so E_vib would be half that, about 2.11e-20 J. And E_rot was approximately 9.12e-23 J. So E_rot is much smaller. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be J=1, n=0. Because that requires less energy than n=1, J=0.

So the photon needs to supply the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 in n=0.

So the energy required is E_rot = ħ²/(I). So the photon's energy must be equal to this.

Wait, let me compute that value.

Wait, I had I = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.10e-68 (J·s)^2.

So E_rot = (1.10e-68) / (1.206e-46) ≈ 9.12e-23 J.

So the photon's energy E_photon must be 9.12e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about momentum. The photon's momentum p is related to its energy. Because for a photon, E = pc, where c is the speed of light. So p = E/c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.12e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.12e-23) / 3e8 = 3.04e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me see the options:

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, the answer I'm getting is about 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s (since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s).

Looking at the options, none of them are in that range. So that suggests I might have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait a minute, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Perhaps the transition isn't purely rotational but a combination of vibrational and rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next state would be (v=1, J=0), requiring a photon of energy hν. But let me compute the momentum in that case.

E_photon = hν = 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.37e13 Hz = approximately 4.22e-20 J.

Then, p = E/c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s = 1.407e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which matches this.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the rotational transition required less energy. But the rotational energy difference was about 9e-23 J, which is higher than the vibrational transition? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, earlier I got E_rot as 9e-23 J, which is higher than E_vib. Because E_vib was about 2e-20 J (for n=1, J=0), but wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the case of n=0, J=0, the next state is either n=0, J=1 (E_rot) or n=1, J=0 (E_vib). So E_rot is about 9e-23 J, which is much less than E_vib (hν/2 ~ 2e-20 J). So the photon needed for E_rot would be smaller. So why is the option D matching the E_vib?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0 and J=0, I think. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the next higher energy, which would be either J=1 or n=1. But which requires less energy? E_rot is 9e-23 J, while E_vib is ~2e-20 J. So the rotational transition needs less energy. So the photon would have to have energy 9e-23 J, which would correspond to momentum p = 9e-23 / 3e8 = 3e-31 Ns. But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the calculation. Let me recompute I.

Wait, I = μ r².

μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) amu.

20 *2 = 40; 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ let me compute that.

1.8 * 1.66 = 3.0, so approximately 3e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg·m².

Wait, correct.

Now, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

So E_rot = (J(J+1) - J0 (J0+1)) * (ħ²)/(2I).

Wait, in the case of J=0 to J=1, the change is from J=0 to J=1, so the energy difference is (1*2 * ħ² / 2I) - (0*1 * ħ² / 2I) = (2 - 0) * ħ²/(2 I) )= (2 * ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ² / I.

So E_rot = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46.

(1.05e-34)^2 = approx 1.1e-68.

1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 = approx 9.16e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.16e-23 J. Then p = E/c = 9.16e-23 /3e8 = 3.05e-31 kg·m/s = 3.05e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are near that. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is about transitioning to the next higher vibrational state, which would be n=1, but in the same rotational state J=0. Because maybe the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state and the next state is (v=1, J=0).

But in that case, the energy would be E_vib = h ν.

Wait, but let me compute that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s. ν is w/(2π) = 4e14 / 6.28 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

So p_photon = E/c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s = 1.407e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this.

So why is this the case? Because perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next state is (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon with energy hν. So the momentum would be 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy, but perhaps the problem doesn't consider that. Maybe the question is only about the vibrational transition.

Wait, the question says: the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0). To switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Since (v=0, J=1) requires less energy, the photon would need to supply that. But as that gives a momentum option not present, perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the model used here includes both, but the photon must supply the energy for a transition to the next state, which could be either. But given the options, only the vibrational transition gives a matching option.

Wait, maybe I confused the question. The question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." The next state with the lowest possible energy is the one that requires the least energy. So the photon must supply the smallest possible energy to get to a higher state. So if E_rot is smaller than E_vib, then the photon would supply E_rot.

But in the options, the only option that matches E_rot is not present, but the option D matches E_vib.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the reduced mass. Let me recheck.

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg.

1.8 * 1.66 is about 3, but 1.818 * 1.66 ≈ let's calculate:

1.818 * 1.66 = 

1.818 * 1 = 1.818

1.818 * 0.6 = 1.0908

1.818 * 0.06 = 0.10908

Adding them: 1.818 + 1.0908 = 2.9088 + 0.10908 = 3.01788.

So μ ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Correct.

So E_rot = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46.

(1.05e-34)^2 is 1.1025e-68.

Divided by 1.207e-46 gives 9.13e-23 J.

So then p = 9.13e-23 /3e8 = 3.04e-31 kg·m/s = 3.04e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition to the first excited vibrational state (n=1) regardless of rotational state. Or perhaps the model here is such that the next state is the combination of some vibrational and rotational changes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy of the photon as the sum of both a vibrational and a rotational transition, but that would be a higher energy. But then the momentum would be higher than option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is being modeled as a rigid rotor, but the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, the question says it can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. So the vibrational and rotational energies are both considered.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy for the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). The energy is E_rot = [ (1)(2) - (0)(1) ] * (ħ²)/(2I) = 2 * (ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So E_rot = (1.05e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46) ≈ 9.13e-23 J.

So that's the energy needed. The photon's momentum is then E/c, which is 3e-31 Ns. But this isn't an option.

So, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition. Let's compute E_vib = hν = 6.626e-34 * 4e14/(2π) ≈ 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.22e-20 /3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Because perhaps the problem expects to consider only the vibrational transition when it's the next state. Hmm, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but given the options, option D is the only one that matches the E_vib.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition that requires the least energy, which is the E_rot, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended approach is to consider the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the model used in the question is such that the molecule can only absorb a photon that changes the vibrational state, not the rotational. But that's not correct because the rotation-vibration model allows for both.

Hmm, given that I can't find an option matching the rotational transition and the vibrational transition's momentum is option D, perhaps that's the intended answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the energy transitions in the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state \( n = 0 \) and the lowest rotational state \( J = 0 \). The question asks for the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:
   - The total energy of the molecule is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies:
     \[
     E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
     \]
     where \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h\nu \) and \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{J(J+1)\hbar^2}{2I} \).

2. **Next State with the Lowest Energy**:
   - The next state with the lowest energy could either be:
     - \( n = 1, J = 0 \) (vibrational transition),
     - \( n = 0, J = 1 \) (rotational transition).
   - The energy difference for a vibrational transition is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu \), while the energy difference for a rotational transition is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \).

3. **Comparison of Energy Gaps**:
   - The vibrational energy gap \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \nu = \frac{w}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.37 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz},
     \]
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.37 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The rotational energy gap \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \) is calculated as:
     - The reduced mass \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} \), which converts to \( \mu \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).
     - The moment of inertia \( I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \).
     - Using \( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), 
       \[
       \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.13 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
       \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
   - For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.13 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The rotational transition momentum \( 3.04 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \) does not match any of the given options.
   - The vibrational transition momentum \( 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \) matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the next state refers to the vibrational transition to \( n = 1, J = 0 \), as the rotational transition momentum is not among the options. Therefore, the photon momentum required is \( 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules consist of two atoms bonded together, like O2 or HCl. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because in a rigid rotor, the bond length doesn't change, but in a non-rigid one, it can, which probably affects the vibrational and rotational energies.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh, right, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, where the vibrational quantum number is zero (n=0). So it's at the ground state for vibrations.

The question asks about the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, what does that mean? Well, the next lowest state after the fundamental state. But I'm a bit confused—are they talking about the next vibrational state or the next rotational state, or maybe a combination?

Wait, I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the molecule can have transitions that involve changes in both. But the question says the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's moving to the next higher energy state, which might involve the first excited vibrational state (n=1) with the rotational quantum number at its lowest possible value.

But wait, the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". Hmm, the next state would probably be the first excited state, but under the non-rigid rotor model, maybe that's the first vibrational state (n=1) with the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1?).

Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0) perhaps. So when you absorb a photon, the molecule could go to a higher vibrational state, or a higher rotational state, or both. But the question is about the 'next state' with the lowest possible energy, so I think it's the next in energy, which might be just a higher vibrational state with the same or minimal rotational state.

Wait, but the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized, and the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The vibration part has higher energy spacing compared to rotation, I think. So the next state after the fundamental (n=0, J=0) would be n=1, J=0? Or maybe J=1, n=0? Which transition would require less energy? Because the vibrational energy spacing is about hν, where ν is the frequency. And rotational energy spacing is about (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the vibrational energy is given by (n + 1/2) hν, and rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So the spacing between n=0 and n=1 is hν. The rotational spacing from J=0 to J=1 is ( (1(2)) - (0(1)) ) * (ħ²)/(2I) ) = (2 * ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So which is larger, hν or (ħ²)/(I)? Because if hν is larger, then the next state would be a vibrational transition, else a rotational one.

Given the data:

w = angular frequency = 4e14 rad/s.

So ν = w/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.28) ≈ ~6.37e13 Hz. So hν would be Planck's constant (h) times that. Let me calculate hν: h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So 6.626e-34 * 6.37e13 ≈ approx 4.22e-20 J.

Now, the rotational spacing: ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05e-34 J·s. So ħ squared is about 1.1e-68 (J·s)^2. I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r². μ is the reduced mass.

The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) amu. 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. So I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy spacing is (ħ²)/(I) = (1.1e-68) / (1.206e-46) ≈ about 9.12e-23 J.

Wait, comparing hν (4.22e-20 J) and the rotational spacing (9.12e-23 J). So hν is larger. So the vibrational transition requires more energy than the rotational. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either make a vibrational transition or a rotational one. Since the question is about the lowest possible energy transition, perhaps it's the smallest possible photon energy needed to reach the next state. So maybe the next state after the fundamental is the lowest energy state that's higher, which would be the next rotational state (J=1) with n=0.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state (n=0), but the rotational state could be higher. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the next rotational state (J=1) with n=0, because that requires less energy than moving to n=1.

Because the energy gap for J=0→J=1 is smaller than n=0→n=1.

So the photon must provide the energy equal to the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 in the same vibrational state n=0.

Wait, but how? Let me think again.

The fundamental state is n=0, and the rotational state could be J=0. So the next state would be either n=0, J=1 or n=1, J=0. Which of these has a lower energy? Because the rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I) and vibrational is (n + 1/2) hν. For n=1, J=0: energy is hν/2 + 0. For n=0, J=1: energy is (1*2 * ħ²)/(2I) ) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I). Which one is smaller?

We have the two energies: E_vib = hν/2 (for n=1, J=0) and E_rot = ħ²/(I) (for n=0, J=1).

Earlier, we found that hν was approximately 4.22e-20 J, so E_vib would be half that, about 2.11e-20 J. And E_rot was approximately 9.12e-23 J. So E_rot is much smaller. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be J=1, n=0. Because that requires less energy than n=1, J=0.

So the photon needs to supply the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 in n=0.

So the energy required is E_rot = ħ²/(I). So the photon's energy must be equal to this.

Wait, let me compute that value.

Wait, I had I = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.10e-68 (J·s)^2.

So E_rot = (1.10e-68) / (1.206e-46) ≈ 9.12e-23 J.

So the photon's energy E_photon must be 9.12e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about momentum. The photon's momentum p is related to its energy. Because for a photon, E = pc, where c is the speed of light. So p = E/c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.12e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.12e-23) / 3e8 = 3.04e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me see the options:

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, the answer I'm getting is about 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s (since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s).

Looking at the options, none of them are in that range. So that suggests I might have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait a minute, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Perhaps the transition isn't purely rotational but a combination of vibrational and rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next state would be (v=1, J=0), requiring a photon of energy hν. But let me compute the momentum in that case.

E_photon = hν = 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.37e13 Hz = approximately 4.22e-20 J.

Then, p = E/c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s = 1.407e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which matches this.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the rotational transition required less energy. But the rotational energy difference was about 9e-23 J, which is higher than the vibrational transition? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, earlier I got E_rot as 9e-23 J, which is higher than E_vib. Because E_vib was about 2e-20 J (for n=1, J=0), but wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the case of n=0, J=0, the next state is either n=0, J=1 (E_rot) or n=1, J=0 (E_vib). So E_rot is about 9e-23 J, which is much less than E_vib (hν/2 ~ 2e-20 J). So the photon needed for E_rot would be smaller. So why is the option D matching the E_vib?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0 and J=0, I think. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the next higher energy, which would be either J=1 or n=1. But which requires less energy? E_rot is 9e-23 J, while E_vib is ~2e-20 J. So the rotational transition needs less energy. So the photon would have to have energy 9e-23 J, which would correspond to momentum p = 9e-23 / 3e8 = 3e-31 Ns. But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the calculation. Let me recompute I.

Wait, I = μ r².

μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) amu.

20 *2 = 40; 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ let me compute that.

1.8 * 1.66 = 3.0, so approximately 3e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg·m².

Wait, correct.

Now, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

So E_rot = (J(J+1) - J0 (J0+1)) * (ħ²)/(2I).

Wait, in the case of J=0 to J=1, the change is from J=0 to J=1, so the energy difference is (1*2 * ħ² / 2I) - (0*1 * ħ² / 2I) = (2 - 0) * ħ²/(2 I) )= (2 * ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ² / I.

So E_rot = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46.

(1.05e-34)^2 = approx 1.1e-68.

1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 = approx 9.16e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.16e-23 J. Then p = E/c = 9.16e-23 /3e8 = 3.05e-31 kg·m/s = 3.05e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are near that. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is about transitioning to the next higher vibrational state, which would be n=1, but in the same rotational state J=0. Because maybe the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state and the next state is (v=1, J=0).

But in that case, the energy would be E_vib = h ν.

Wait, but let me compute that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s. ν is w/(2π) = 4e14 / 6.28 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

So p_photon = E/c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s = 1.407e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this.

So why is this the case? Because perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next state is (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon with energy hν. So the momentum would be 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy, but perhaps the problem doesn't consider that. Maybe the question is only about the vibrational transition.

Wait, the question says: the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0). To switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Since (v=0, J=1) requires less energy, the photon would need to supply that. But as that gives a momentum option not present, perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the model used here includes both, but the photon must supply the energy for a transition to the next state, which could be either. But given the options, only the vibrational transition gives a matching option.

Wait, maybe I confused the question. The question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." The next state with the lowest possible energy is the one that requires the least energy. So the photon must supply the smallest possible energy to get to a higher state. So if E_rot is smaller than E_vib, then the photon would supply E_rot.

But in the options, the only option that matches E_rot is not present, but the option D matches E_vib.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the reduced mass. Let me recheck.

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg.

1.8 * 1.66 is about 3, but 1.818 * 1.66 ≈ let's calculate:

1.818 * 1.66 = 

1.818 * 1 = 1.818

1.818 * 0.6 = 1.0908

1.818 * 0.06 = 0.10908

Adding them: 1.818 + 1.0908 = 2.9088 + 0.10908 = 3.01788.

So μ ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Correct.

So E_rot = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46.

(1.05e-34)^2 is 1.1025e-68.

Divided by 1.207e-46 gives 9.13e-23 J.

So then p = 9.13e-23 /3e8 = 3.04e-31 kg·m/s = 3.04e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition to the first excited vibrational state (n=1) regardless of rotational state. Or perhaps the model here is such that the next state is the combination of some vibrational and rotational changes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy of the photon as the sum of both a vibrational and a rotational transition, but that would be a higher energy. But then the momentum would be higher than option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is being modeled as a rigid rotor, but the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, the question says it can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. So the vibrational and rotational energies are both considered.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy for the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). The energy is E_rot = [ (1)(2) - (0)(1) ] * (ħ²)/(2I) = 2 * (ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So E_rot = (1.05e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46) ≈ 9.13e-23 J.

So that's the energy needed. The photon's momentum is then E/c, which is 3e-31 Ns. But this isn't an option.

So, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition. Let's compute E_vib = hν = 6.626e-34 * 4e14/(2π) ≈ 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.22e-20 /3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Because perhaps the problem expects to consider only the vibrational transition when it's the next state. Hmm, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but given the options, option D is the only one that matches the E_vib.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition that requires the least energy, which is the E_rot, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended approach is to consider the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the model used in the question is such that the molecule can only absorb a photon that changes the vibrational state, not the rotational. But that's not correct because the rotation-vibration model allows for both.

Hmm, given that I can't find an option matching the rotational transition and the vibrational transition's momentum is option D, perhaps that's the intended answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the energy transitions in the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state \( n = 0 \) and the lowest rotational state \( J = 0 \). The question asks for the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:
   - The total energy of the molecule is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies:
     \[
     E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
     \]
     where \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h\nu \) and \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{J(J+1)\hbar^2}{2I} \).

2. **Next State with the Lowest Energy**:
   - The next state with the lowest energy could either be:
     - \( n = 1, J = 0 \) (vibrational transition),
     - \( n = 0, J = 1 \) (rotational transition).
   - The energy difference for a vibrational transition is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu \), while the energy difference for a rotational transition is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \).

3. **Comparison of Energy Gaps**:
   - The vibrational energy gap \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \nu = \frac{w}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.37 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz},
     \]
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.37 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The rotational energy gap \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \) is calculated as:
     - The reduced mass \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} \), which converts to \( \mu \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).
     - The moment of inertia \( I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \).
     - Using \( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), 
       \[
       \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.13 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
       \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
   - For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.13 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The rotational transition momentum \( 3.04 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \) does not match any of the given options.
   - The vibrational transition momentum \( 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \) matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the next state refers to the vibrational transition to \( n = 1, J = 0 \), as the rotational transition momentum is not among the options. Therefore, the photon momentum required is \( 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).

**Answer: D**
