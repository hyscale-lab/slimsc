Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and think about what I know.

The question is about five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variation. They’re in orbital resonance and have periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet has a longer period based on those ratios. The question asks for the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming they have the same albedo.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I think the formula for equilibrium temperature involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since the albedos are the same for all planets, that part cancels out. The formula I remember is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²) )^½ ), but wait, I think the simplified version when comparing planets around the same star is T ∝ (L / d² )^½. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature should be T = T_effective of the star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms.

Wait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I think I've got that wrong. Let me think again.

I recall that the equilibrium temperature formula is T = ( L * (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the orbital distance. Since all the planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ are the same for all. Also, A is the same for all, so that term can be factored out. So the temperature ratio between two planets will depend on the inverse square root of the ratio of their distances.

Wait, no, because when you take the ratio, the (1-A) and other constants (like π, σ) will cancel out. So the temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2/a1) )^ (something). Let me write it more carefully.

The equilibrium temperature (Teq) is given by:

Teq = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

So when comparing two planets, say Planet_i and Planet_j,

Teqi / Teqj = [ ( (1 - Ai) / (1 - Aj) )^(1/4) ) ] * [ ( a_j² / a_i² ) ]^(1/4 )

But since A is the same for all, (1 - A) cancels out when taking the ratio. So,

Teqi / Teqj = ( a_j² / a_i² )^(1/4 ) = ( (a_j / a_i)² )^(1/4 ) = (a_j / a_i )^(1/2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( a_j / a_i ). So the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio.

Wait, no. Because if Planet_j is farther away (a_j > a_i), then Teqj would be lower than Teqi. Because the farther away, the less flux, hence lower temperature. Let me double-check the math.

The temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), because when you take the fourth root of 1/a², it's the same as (1/a)^(1/2). So, higher a means lower temperature.

So, Teq is inversely proportional to the square root of a.

So, Teq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)

Therefore, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital period? Wait no, orbital period depends on the distance. Because from Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. Oh wait, no, Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³, assuming same star. So a = (P²)^(1/3) * k, where k is a constant for the star.

Wait, so P² is proportional to a³. So a = (P²)^(1/3) = P^(2/3) * [constant terms]. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, if I can find the ratio of a4 to a2, then I can find the ratio of their temperatures.

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So for Planet_2, the period is 2 units; Planet_4 is 3.5 units.

So, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3), because a ∝ P^(2/3).

Wait, let's clarify. Since a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3).

Then, the temperature ratio Teq4 / Teq2 is (a2/a4)^(1/2) because Teq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

Wait, no. Because:

Teq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). So Teq4 / Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Because (Teq4) / (Teq2) = [1/sqrt(a4)] / [1/sqrt(a2)] ] = sqrt(a2)/sqrt(a4) = sqrt(a2/a4).

So substituting a4/a2 ratio:

Teq4/Teq2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ) = sqrt( (a2/a4) )

So, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) because a ∝ P^(2/3). Because a4 = (P4)^(2/3) * k, a2 = (P2)^(2/3)*k. So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So, putting it all together:

Teq4/Teq2 = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) )

Which is equal to (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because sqrt(x^(2/3)) is x^(1/3), since sqrt is x^(1/2), so (x^(2/3))^(1/2) = x^(1/3).

So, Teq4/Teq2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me make sure:

Teq ∝ 1/sqrt(a) → Teq4/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (a2/a4) )

But a2 = K * P2^(2/3), a4=K*P4^(2/3), so a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So sqrt(a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So, Teq4/Teq2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

But wait, the formula I have is Teq4/Teq2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So, let's compute this with the given periods.

P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2/3.5.

Simplify 2/3.5: 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3) → cube root of 4/7.

What's the cube root of 4/7? Let me compute that.

But let me think, 4 is about 1.587 when cube rooted (since 1.587^3 ≈ 4), but wait, no, 1.587 is cube root of 4? Let me compute 1.58^3: 1.58 * 1.58 = approx 2.4964, then *1.58. 2.4964 * 1.58 ≈ approximately 3.95. So, 1.58^3 ≈ ~3.95, which is close to 4. So cube root of 4 is about 1.587.

Cube root of 7: 7 is between 1.9^3 (6.859) and 2.0^3 (8). Let's see, 1.913^3 is about 7. So 1.913^3 ≈ 7. So cube root of 7 is approximately 1.913.

So cube root of 4/7 is cube_root(4) / cube_root(7) ≈ 1.587 / 1.913 ≈ approximately 0.83.

Wait, let me compute 1.587 divided by 1.913. 1.587 / 1.913 ≈ roughly 0.83.

So 0.83 is approximately the cube root of (4/7).

Wait, but wait, my calculation: 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714 is the same as cube root of (4/7). Let me compute it with a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (4/7)^(1/3) more accurately.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute it numerically.

But I'm doing this in my head, so let me think.

Compute x where x^3 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

What's 0.83^3? 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, *0.83 ≈ 0.5717. Oh! So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.5717, which is very close to 0.5714. So x ≈ 0.83.

So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83.

So Teq4/Teq2 ≈ 0.83. So Planet_4 is cooler than Planet_2, which makes sense because Planet_4 has a longer period (farther away), so lower temperature.

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2, so Teq4/Teq2 is 0.83, which is approximately 0.83, which is option C.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So option C is 0.83. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So Teq ∝ 1/√a.

2. From Kepler's third law, a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3).

3. Therefore, a4 = K * P4^(2/3), a2 = K * P2^(2/3).

4. So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

5. Teq4/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

6. P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

7. Cube root of 0.5714 is 0.83. So Teq4/Teq2 = 0.83.

Yes, all steps seem correct. So the answer should be C.

To determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start with the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital distance. From Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \(a\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\), where \(P\) is the orbital period. Thus, the ratio of distances \(a_4/a_2\) is given by:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio \(T_{\text{eq,4}}/T_{\text{eq,2}}\) is then:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,4}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Given the orbital period ratios \(P_2 = 2\) and \(P_4 = 3.5\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714
\]

The cube root of \(4/7\) is approximately:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio \(T_{\text{eq,4}}/T_{\text{eq,2}} \approx 0.83\).

From the options provided:

- A) ~0.57
- B) ~0.69
- C) ~0.83
- D) ~0.75

The correct answer is:

**C) ~0.83**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and think about what I know.

So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet has a longer period based on those ratios. The question asks for the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming they have the same albedo.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I think the formula for equilibrium temperature involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since the albedos are the same for all planets, that part cancels out. The formula I remember is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²) )^½ ), but wait, I think the simplified version when comparing planets around the same star is T ∝ (L / d² )^½. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature should be T = T_effective of the star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms.

Wait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I think I've got that wrong. Let me think again.

I recall that the equilibrium temperature formula is T = ( L * (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the orbital distance. Since all the planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ are the same for all. Also, A is the same for all, so that term can be factored out. So the temperature ratio between two planets will depend on the inverse square root of the ratio of their distances.

Wait, no, because when you take the ratio, the (1-A) and other constants (like π, σ) will cancel out. So the temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2/a1) )^ (something). Let me write it more carefully.

The equilibrium temperature (Teq) is given by:

Teq = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

So when comparing two planets, say Planet_i and Planet_j,

Teqi / Teqj = [ ( (1 - Ai) / (1 - Aj) )^(1/4) ) ] * [ ( a_j² / a_i² ) ]^(1/4 )

But since A is the same for all, (1 - A) cancels out when taking the ratio. So,

Teqi / Teqj = ( a_j² / a_i² )^(1/4 ) = ( (a_j / a_i)² )^(1/4 ) = (a_j / a_i )^(1/2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( a_j / a_i ). So the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio.

Wait, no. Because if Planet_j is farther away (a_j > a_i), then Teqj would be lower than Teqi. Because the farther away, the less flux, hence lower temperature. Let me double-check the math.

The temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), because when you take the fourth root of 1/a², it's the same as (1/a)^(1/2). So, higher a means lower temperature.

So, Teq is inversely proportional to the square root of a.

So, Teq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)

Therefore, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital period? Wait no, orbital period depends on the distance. Because from Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. Oh wait, no, Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³, assuming same star. So a = (P²)^(1/3) * k, where k is a constant for the star.

Wait, so P² is proportional to a³. So a = (P²)^(1/3) = P^(2/3) * [constant terms]. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, if I can find the ratio of a4 to a2, then I can find the ratio of their temperatures.

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So for Planet_2, the period is 2 units; Planet_4 is 3.5 units.

So, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3), because a ∝ P^(2/3).

Wait, let's clarify. Since a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3).

Then, the temperature ratio Teq4 / Teq2 is (a2/a4)^(1/2) because Teq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

Wait, no. Because:

Teq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). So Teq4 / Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Because (Teq4) / (Teq2) = [1/sqrt(a4)] / [1/sqrt(a2)] ] = sqrt(a2)/sqrt(a4) = sqrt(a2/a4).

So substituting a4/a2 ratio:

Teq4/Teq2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ) = sqrt( (a2/a4) )

So, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) because a ∝ P^(2/3). Because a4 = (P4)^(2/3) * k, a2 = (P2)^(2/3)*k. So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So, putting it all together:

Teq4/Teq2 = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) )

Which is equal to (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because sqrt(x^(2/3)) is x^(1/3), since sqrt is x^(1/2), so (x^(2/3))^(1/2) = x^(1/3).

So, Teq4/Teq2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me make sure:

Teq ∝ 1/sqrt(a) → Teq4/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (a2/a4) )

But a2 = K * P2^(2/3), a4=K*P4^(2/3), so a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So sqrt(a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So, Teq4/Teq2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

But wait, the formula I have is Teq4/Teq2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So, let's compute this with the given periods.

P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2/3.5.

Simplify 2/3.5: 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3) → cube root of 4/7.

What's the cube root of 4/7? Let me compute that.

But let me think, 4 is about 1.587 when cube rooted (since 1.587^3 ≈ 4), but wait, no, 1.587 is cube root of 4? Let me compute 1.58^3: 1.58 * 1.58 = approx 2.4964, then *1.58. 2.4964 * 1.58 ≈ approximately 3.95. So, 1.58^3 ≈ ~3.95, which is close to 4. So cube root of 4 is about 1.587.

Cube root of 7: 7 is between 1.9^3 (6.859) and 2.0^3 (8). Let's see, 1.913^3 is about 7. So 1.913^3 ≈ 7. So cube root of 7 is approximately 1.913.

So cube root of 4/7 is cube_root(4) / cube_root(7) ≈ 1.587 / 1.913 ≈ approximately 0.83.

Wait, let me compute 1.587 divided by 1.913. 1.587 / 1.913 ≈ roughly 0.83.

So 0.83 is approximately the cube root of (4/7).

Wait, but wait, my calculation: 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714 is the same as cube root of (4/7). Let me compute it with a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (4/7)^(1/3) more accurately.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute it numerically.

But I'm doing this in my head, so let me think.

Compute x where x^3 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

What's 0.83^3? 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, *0.83 ≈ 0.5717. Oh! So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.5717, which is very close to 0.5714. So x ≈ 0.83.

So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83.

So Teq4/Teq2 ≈ 0.83. So Planet_4 is cooler than Planet_2, which makes sense because Planet_4 has a longer period (farther away), so lower temperature.

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2, so Teq4/Teq2 is 0.83, which is approximately 0.83, which is option C.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So option C is 0.83. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So Teq ∝ 1/√a.

2. From Kepler's third law, a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3).

3. Therefore, a4 = K * P4^(2/3), a2 = K * P2^(2/3).

4. So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

5. Teq4/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

6. P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

7. Cube root of 0.5714 is 0.83. So Teq4/Teq2 = 0.83.

Yes, all steps seem correct. So the answer should be C.


To determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start with the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital distance. From Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \(a\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\), where \(P\) is the orbital period. Thus, the ratio of distances \(a_4/a_2\) is given by:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio \(T_{\text{eq,4}}/T_{\text{eq,2}}\) is then:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,4}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Given the orbital period ratios \(P_2 = 2\) and \(P_4 = 3.5\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714
\]

The cube root of \(4/7\) is approximately:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio \(T_{\text{eq,4}}/T_{\text{eq,2}} \approx 0.83\).

From the options provided:

- A) ~0.57
- B) ~0.69
- C) ~0.83
- D) ~0.75

The correct answer is:

**C) ~0.83**

Answer: C
