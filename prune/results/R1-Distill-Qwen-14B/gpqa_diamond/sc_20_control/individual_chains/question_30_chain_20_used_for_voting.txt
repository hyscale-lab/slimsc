Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and light absorption. Hmm, let me think. The question says a textile dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light at 2.3393 eV. They're asking what color is absorbed by the compound. The options are Red, Violet, Blue, or Yellow.

Wait, right, when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap in the molecule. Oh, and conjugated pi-electrons mean that the molecule has a large conjugated system, which affects the energy gap.

So, the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I remember the relationship between energy and wavelength is given by E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.0e8 m/s. But wait, since energy is in eV, maybe I should use a different approach. Oh right, 1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of about 1240 nm. So if E is 2.3393 eV, the wavelength λ is 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's calculate that.

1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me do the math. 2.3393 times 500 is 1169.65. Hmm, 2.3393 * 530 is about 1243. So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ around 530 nm. Wait, 2.3393 * 530 = let me compute 2.3393 * 500 is 1169.65, plus 2.3393 *30=70.18, total 1240 approx. Yeah, so λ is about 530 nm.

What color is 530 nm? I remember the visible spectrum ranges from about 400 to 700 nm. Violet is around 400-450, blue is 450-495, green is 495-570, yellow 570-590, orange 590-620, red 620-700. So 530 is right in the green part of the spectrum.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed, not emitted. Oh, wait! When a molecule absorbs a photon, it emits another photon. The energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed? No, wait, no, the molecule emits the photon when it drops from a higher energy state to a lower one. So, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than what's emitted? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Extensively conjugated pi systems have smaller energy gaps. So they absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light. For example, something like beta-carotene absorbs in the visible range, giving it an orange color. Wait, but the question is about the color of the absorbed light.

Wait, when a substance emits light (like fluorescence), it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon and then emits a lower energy photon. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted one.

Wait, but in this question, the emission is at 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. Let me calculate the wavelength of the absorbed photon.

Wait, but wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is the energy of the emitted photon. The molecule absorbs a photon of energy equal to the energy gap, and then emits a photon when it returns to the ground state. Or maybe not? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no, in fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited to a higher energy state, and then emits a photon when it returns to the ground state. The energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed one because some energy is lost as heat or other processes.

Wait, so in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. So the absorbed photon's energy would be higher, which would correspond to a shorter wavelength (since E is inversely proportional to λ).

So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. Let me calculate that. Let's say E_absorbed is higher than 2.3393 eV. Let's say E_abs = E_emit + something, but I don't have the exact number, but I can find the range.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the complementary color. The color emitted is green (530 nm), so the absorbed color would be the complement. Wait, in color theory, if a substance emits green, it absorbs the complementary color, which is magenta or purple. But the options don't have purple; they have violet, which is a similar color.

Wait, but maybe this approach isn't correct because the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. Alternatively, perhaps the emitted light is the one we see, and the absorbed is the one that's not seen.

Wait, let me go back. The problem says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which as I calculated is about 530 nm (green). So when the dye is excited, it emits green light. So the dye must have absorbed a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to get excited in the first place.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. Let's compute that. Let's say, for example, if the absorbed photon is at 3 eV. Then λ = 1240 / 3 ≈ 413 nm, which is violet. So the absorbed color would be violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky. Let me check: if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), then the absorbed photon must have higher energy, so shorter wavelength. Violet is about 400-450 nm, which is higher energy than green. So the dye would absorb violet light, and emit green upon relaxation.

Alternatively, are there any other possibilities? Let me see. Another approach: in conjugated systems, the extent of conjugation affects the energy gap. A larger conjugated system (like more double bonds) leads to a smaller energy gap, which means lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So, when the molecule absorbs light, the energy is such that the photon's energy corresponds to the gap.

Wait, but the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy of the gap, which is the energy between the ground and excited states. When the molecule emits, it emits a photon of lower energy than the absorbed.

So, the absorbed photon's energy should be higher than 2.3393 eV. So, the wavelength of the absorbed photon is shorter than 530 nm. So in the visible spectrum, the next color below green is blue, then violet.

Wait, what's the energy for blue and violet? Let's compute.

If a photon has 2.8 eV, λ =1240 /2.8≈442.86 nm, which is blue-violet.

Another example: 3 eV is 413 nm, which is violet.

So the absorbed photon is in the violet or blue region, perhaps.

Wait, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So, the absorbed color would be violet or blue, perhaps.

Wait, but I thought the emitted photon is green, so the absorbed must be higher energy, which would be in the blue or violet.

But how to determine between B and C? Because both are higher in energy than green.

Wait, perhaps the emitted photon is green, so the absorbed would be in the blue or violet, but how do I know which?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference corresponds to the energy of the photon emitted, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy of the absorbed photon. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron from the ground state to the excited state. The energy of the photon must match the energy gap.

Upon relaxation, the molecule emits a photon with energy less than or equal to the absorbed photon's energy. So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon's energy.

In this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that.

So, to find the absorbed photon's color, I need to calculate its wavelength.

Wait, but I don't have the exact energy of the absorbed photon, only the emitted one. How can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps the energy difference between the ground and excited state is the energy of the absorbed photon. So, the molecule has a certain energy gap (E_abs), and the emitted photon has energy E_emit = E_abs - (energy lost as heat, etc.). So E_abs is greater than E_emit.

But without knowing the exact E_abs, I can't directly calculate the wavelength. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the exact color, but about the region. Since the molecule has extensive conjugation, the energy gap is smaller. So the absorbed photon is of lower energy (longer wavelength) than molecules with less conjugation.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), which is higher energy than red (which is about 1.5-2 eV). Wait, no: red is ~1.8-2.1 eV, green is ~2.1-2.4 eV.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me check the energy of colors:

- Violet: ~2.3-3 eV
- Blue: ~2.0-2.3 eV
- Green: ~1.9-2.1 eV
- Yellow: ~2.0-2.1 eV
- Orange: ~1.8-2.0 eV
- Red: ~1.6-1.9 eV

Wait, so 2.3393 eV is in the violet range? No, wait that doesn't make sense because earlier calculation said 2.3393 eV is 530 nm, which is green. So I think the color chart I'm thinking of is maybe in terms of wavelengths, not eV.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me get the correct eV to color mapping.

The visible spectrum in terms of energy (eV):

- Violet: ~2.3-3 eV (shorter wavelength, higher energy)
- Blue: ~2.0-2.3 eV
- Green: ~1.9-2.1 eV
- Yellow: ~2.0-2.1 eV (wait, that can't be right, perhaps I'm mixing up the ranges)
- Orange: ~1.6-1.9 eV
- Red: ~1.2-1.8 eV

Wait, perhaps I should get the exact conversion between wavelength and eV.

The energy E (in eV) is given by E = 1240 / λ (in nm). So:

- 400 nm (violet): 1240/400 ≈ 3.1 eV
- 450 nm (blue): ~2.76 eV
- 500 nm (green): 2.48 eV
- 550 nm (green): ~2.25 eV
- 600 nm (orange): ~2.07 eV
- 700 nm (red): ~1.77 eV

Wait, wait, that's different. So for 530 nm, E = 1240/530 ≈ 2.34 eV. Oh, so that matches the given energy of 2.3393 eV. So 530 nm is green, which emits at that wavelength. So the emitted photon is green.

So the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) than 530 nm. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.34 eV, so wavelength less than 530 nm.

So the possible colors are in the violet or blue regions.

The question is: what color is absorbed? So the dye absorbs the photon that's higher energy than the emitted one.

So, if the emitted photon is green (2.34 eV), the absorbed must be higher than that, so in the blue or violet.

Wait, but the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which one is it?

Hmm, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.34 eV, so the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So, let's see what's the color for 2.4 eV. E=2.4 eV => λ=1240/2.4≈516.67 nm, which is green. Wait, no, 516 nm is around green but slightly towards blue. Hmm, no, wait 516 is green, but 450 is blue.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since 2.34 eV is green emission, the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon could be in the blue or violet regions.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the question wants us to assume that the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy difference between the ground and excited state.

Wait, but in fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So, let's see: what is the wavelength of 2.4 eV? It's 516.67 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon would be in the green or higher (blue, violet) range.

Wait, but this seems circular. Alternatively, perhaps the absorbed photon is in the blue range.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy difference between the ground state and excited state is E_abs = E_emit + (some loss). But without knowing the exact loss, perhaps we can approximate that the absorbed photon's energy is around 2.3393 eV plus a small amount.

Wait, but that doesn't help much. Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy gap, but that doesn't make sense because in fluorescence, some energy is lost as heat, so the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Hmm, perhaps the question is not worded correctly. Wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy, so shorter wavelength.

So the absorbed photon could be in the blue or violet regions.

So the options are B (violet) and C (blue). Now, which is it?

If the emitted photon is green (530 nm), and the absorbed is higher energy, let's calculate the wavelength for a higher energy.

For example, let's say the absorbed photon is 2.5 eV. Then λ=1240/2.5=496 nm, which is blue.

At 2.76 eV, it's 450 nm, which is blue.

At 3.1 eV, it's 400 nm, which is violet.

So the absorbed photon could be in either blue or violet. So how do I decide between B and C?

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed, so perhaps the organic compound absorbs the complementary color of what it emits. The complementary of green is magenta or violet. Since violet is an option, maybe that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule emits green, so it absorbs light in the blue region. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV plus some. Hmm, but that's unclear.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher. Let's think about common conjugated dyes.

For example, many dyes with extensive conjugation (like those in the visible range) absorb in the UV or visible. For example, a dye that emits green would have absorbed blue or violet light.

Alternatively, let's think about the energy transition. If the molecule emits green, the absorbed photon must have higher energy, so the absorption is in the blue or violet.

But which is more likely? I think that many dyes with extensive conjugation absorb in the blue or green. Wait, but if the emission is green, the absorption is likely at a higher energy (shorter wavelength), so blue or violet.

Wait, for example, if a molecule emits green, it might have absorbed blue light. But another molecule could emit green after absorbing violet.

But without more specific info, it's hard. However, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV. So the possible options are B and C.

But in the initial calculation, 2.3393 eV emitted is green. So the absorbed must be higher, say, 2.5 eV (blue) or 3 eV (violet).

So, the question is, which is the correct color absorbed.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher than this. So the absorbed photon's energy is in the range of blue or violet.

But among the options, which is correct?

I think I may have to choose between B and C. Let me think about what color when absorbed would result in green emission.

If the molecule absorbs blue light (say, 2.76 eV, 450 nm), then emits green (2.3393 eV, 530 nm). That's possible.

Alternatively, if it absorbed violet (3 eV, 413 nm), emits green.

Which is more likely? Well, in practice, many fluorescent dyes emit in the visible range and absorb in the UV or visible. For example, fluorescein absorbs around 480 nm (blue) and emits green.

If that's the case, the absorbed color would be blue, so the answer is C.

But then why is the emitted wavelength 530 nm, which is green. So if the absorption is at 480 nm (blue), the energy is higher.

Another example: Rhodamine B absorbs at around 550 nm (green) and emits in the red, but that's opposite.

Wait, maybe in this case, the absorbed photon is in the blue, so the answer is C.

Alternatively, if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the absorption maximum is at longer wavelengths (lower energy, so redshift). Wait, no, extensive conjugation lowers the energy gap, so the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy, redshift), meaning the absorbed photon has lower energy, which would imply that the emitted photon is even lower? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. Extensive conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps. So the energy required for the electron transition is lower. So the absorption occurs at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than a molecule with less conjugation.

Wait, but in this question, the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV (green). So if the conjugation is extensive, the energy gap is small, so the absorption would be at a longer wavelength, which is lower energy. But that would mean the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed.

But wait, that's not possible because the emitted photon comes from the energy difference between ground and excited states. So if the energy gap is smaller, the emitted photon would have lower energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy of the transition from ground state to excited state (E_abs). The molecule then emits a photon when it returns to the ground state. The energy of the emitted photon (E_emit) is less than E_abs because some energy is lost as heat or other processes. So E_abs = E_emit + (energy lost).

So E_abs is higher than E_emit.

In this case, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So E_abs must be higher.

So the absorbed photon is higher in energy, which is shorter wavelength. Now, the molecule is extensively conjugated, which usually leads to a smaller energy gap. So the E_abs is smaller compared to a less conjugated molecule. Wait, but if the conjugation is extensive, the energy gap (E_abs) is smaller, so the absorbed photon is lower in energy, which would be a longer wavelength.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

Extensive conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps (E_abs is lower). So the absorbed photon has lower energy (longer wavelength), which would be redshift.

But in this problem, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy (shorter wavelength) than that, meaning the absorption is in the blue or violet regions.

But if the molecule has extensive conjugation, the energy gap is smaller. So E_abs is smaller than what it would be if the conjugation were less. Wait, but E_abs must be higher than E_emit.

Wait, perhaps the molecule's E_abs is just slightly higher than E_emit, so the absorbed photon has only slightly higher energy than the emitted. Let's say E_abs is 2.5 eV, which is 496 nm (blue). So the molecule absorbs blue and emits green.

Alternatively, if E_abs is 3 eV (413 nm, violet), emits green.

But with extensive conjugation, which would make E_abs smaller. So, perhaps E_abs is not too much higher than E_emit.

So if E_emit is 2.3393 eV, E_abs is a little higher. Let's say 2.5 eV (blue). So the absorbed color is blue.

Therefore, the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but earlier I thought the complementary color of green is violet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule emits green, so it must absorb violet. Because when you have a substance that allows green light to pass through, it's because it's absorbing the complementary color, which is magenta (a combination of red and blue). But that's for subtractive color mixing, not absorption and emission.

Wait, in emission, the color emitted is what the molecule emits. The color absorbed is the photon that causes the excitation.

So in this case, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon (blue or violet), which excites it, and then it emits a lower energy photon (green).

So which one is it?

I think I need to go with the calculation. The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength). So the absorbed photon is either blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV). The question is, which one is it.

But without knowing the exact E_abs, it's hard. Perhaps in the absence of more information, the most likely answer is that the absorbed photon is in the blue region. So option C) Blue.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, the emitted photon is green, which is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed would be higher, such as blue (say, 450 nm, 2.76 eV). So the absorbed color is blue. So the answer would be C.

But another approach: since the molecule emits green, it must be absorbing the energy in the blue region. Because when you look at the color wheel, green's complementary is magenta, but that's for absorption. But in this case, it's emission, so maybe it's different.

Wait no, in fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, and emits a photon of lower energy. So the color absorbed is the one that excites it, which is higher energy than the emitted.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think again.

E_emit = 2.3393 eV → λ_emit ≈530 nm (green).

E_abs must be higher than E_emit → λ_abs < 530 nm.

So, the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet region.

The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which one is it?

If we think about common fluorescent dyes, many absorb in the UV or blue regions. For example, fluorescein absorbs at around 480 nm (blue), emits green.

So in that case, the answer would be Blue (C).

But another example, rhodamine B absorbs at 550 nm (green) and emits red, but that's opposite.

So, in this case, the dye emits green, so it's likely absorbing blue.

So the answer would be C) Blue.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted photon and the absorbed photon. The compound emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm (green light). Fluorescence occurs when a molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon, as some energy is lost as heat or other processes during the transition.

The energy of the absorbed photon must therefore be greater than 2.3393 eV, corresponding to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. This places the absorbed photon in the blue or violet regions of the visible spectrum. 

To differentiate between blue (450–495 nm) and violet (400–450 nm), we consider the energy difference. A photon with an energy of 2.5 eV corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 496 nm (blue), while a photon with an energy of 3.1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 400 nm (violet). Since the question specifies that the molecule has an extensively conjugated π-system, which typically absorbs in the blue or violet regions, the absorbed photon is most likely in the blue region.

Thus, the compound absorbs blue light, which aligns with the given options and the behavior of fluorescent dyes.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and light absorption. Hmm, let me think. The question says a textile dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light at 2.3393 eV. They're asking what color is absorbed by the compound. The options are Red, Violet, Blue, or Yellow.

Wait, right, when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap in the molecule. Oh, and conjugated pi-electrons mean that the molecule has a large conjugated system, which affects the energy gap.

So, the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I remember the relationship between energy and wavelength is given by E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.0e8 m/s. But wait, since energy is in eV, maybe I should use a different approach. Oh right, 1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of about 1240 nm. So if E is 2.3393 eV, the wavelength λ is 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's calculate that.

1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me do the math. 2.3393 times 500 is 1169.65. Hmm, 2.3393 * 530 is about 1243. So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ around 530 nm. Wait, 2.3393 * 530 = let me compute 2.3393 * 500 is 1169.65, plus 2.3393 *30=70.18, total 1240 approx. Yeah, so λ is about 530 nm.

What color is 530 nm? I remember the visible spectrum ranges from about 400 to 700 nm. Violet is around 400-450, blue is 450-495, green is 495-570, yellow 570-590, orange 590-620, red 620-700. So 530 is right in the green part of the spectrum.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed, not emitted. Oh, wait! When a molecule absorbs a photon, it emits another photon. The energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed? No, wait, no, the molecule emits the photon when it drops from a higher energy state to a lower one. So, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than what's emitted? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Extensively conjugated pi systems have smaller energy gaps. So they absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light. For example, something like beta-carotene absorbs in the visible range, giving it an orange color. Wait, but the question is about the color of the absorbed light.

Wait, when a substance emits light (like fluorescence), it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon and then emits a lower energy photon. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted one.

Wait, but in this question, the emission is at 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. Let me calculate the wavelength of the absorbed photon.

Wait, but wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is the energy of the emitted photon. The molecule absorbs a photon of energy equal to the energy gap, and then emits a photon when it returns to the ground state. Or maybe not? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, let me go back. The problem says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which as I calculated is about 530 nm (green). So when the dye is excited, it emits green light. So the dye must have absorbed a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to get excited in the first place.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. Let's compute that. Let's say, for example, if the absorbed photon is at 3 eV. Then λ = 1240 / 3 ≈ 413 nm, which is violet. So the absorbed color would be violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky. Let me check: if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), then the absorbed photon must have higher energy, so shorter wavelength. Violet is about 400-450 nm, which is higher energy than green. So the dye would absorb violet light, and emit green upon relaxation.

Alternatively, are there any other possibilities? Let me see. Another approach: in conjugated systems, the extent of conjugation affects the energy gap. A larger conjugated system (like more double bonds) leads to a smaller energy gap, which means lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption.

Wait, what's the energy for blue and violet? Let's compute.

If a photon has 2.8 eV, λ =1240 /2.8≈442.86 nm, which is blue-violet.

Another example: 3 eV is 413 nm, which is violet.

So the absorbed photon is in the violet or blue region, perhaps.

Wait, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So, the absorbed color would be violet or blue, perhaps.

Wait, but I thought the emitted photon is green, so the absorbed must be higher energy, which would be in the blue or violet.

But how to determine between B and C? Because both are higher in energy than green.

Wait, perhaps the emitted photon is green, so the absorbed would be in the blue or violet, but how do I know which?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference corresponds to the energy of the photon emitted, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy of the absorbed photon. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron from the ground state to the excited state. The energy of the photon must match the energy gap.

Upon relaxation, the molecule emits a photon with energy less than or equal to the absorbed photon's energy. So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon's energy.

In this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that.

So, to find the absorbed photon's color, I need to calculate its wavelength.

Wait, but I don't have the exact energy of the absorbed photon, only the emitted one. How can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps the energy difference between the ground and excited state is the energy of the absorbed photon. So, the molecule has a certain energy gap (E_abs), and the emitted photon has energy E_emit = E_abs - (energy lost as heat, etc.). So E_abs is greater than E_emit.

But without knowing the exact E_abs, I can't directly calculate the wavelength. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the exact color, but about the region. Since the molecule has extensive conjugation, the energy gap is smaller. So the absorbed photon is of lower energy (longer wavelength) than molecules with less conjugation.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), which is higher energy than red (which is about 1.5-2 eV). Wait, no: red is ~1.8-2.1 eV, green is ~2.1-2.4 eV.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me check the energy of colors:

- Violet: ~2.3-3 eV
- Blue: ~2.0-2.3 eV
- Green: ~1.9-2.1 eV
- Yellow: ~2.0-2.1 eV
- Orange: ~1.8-2.0 eV
- Red: ~1.6-1.9 eV

Wait, so 2.3393 eV is in the violet range? No, wait that doesn't make sense because earlier calculation said 2.3393 eV is 530 nm, which is green. So I think the color chart I'm thinking of is maybe in terms of wavelengths, not eV.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me get the correct eV to color mapping.

The visible spectrum in terms of energy (eV):

- Violet: ~2.3-3 eV (shorter wavelength, higher energy)
- Blue: ~2.0-2.3 eV
- Green: ~1.9-2.1 eV
- Yellow: ~2.0-2.1 eV (wait, that can't be right, perhaps I'm mixing up the ranges)
- Orange: ~1.6-1.9 eV
- Red: ~1.2-1.8 eV

Wait, perhaps I should get the exact conversion between wavelength and eV.

The energy E (in eV) is given by E = 1240 / λ (in nm). So:

- 400 nm (violet): 1240/400 ≈ 3.1 eV
- 450 nm (blue): ~2.76 eV
- 500 nm (green): 2.48 eV
- 550 nm (green): ~2.25 eV
- 600 nm (orange): ~2.07 eV
- 700 nm (red): ~1.77 eV

Wait, wait, that's different. So for 530 nm, E = 1240/530 ≈ 2.34 eV. Oh, so that matches the given energy of 2.3393 eV. So 530 nm is green, which emits at that wavelength. So the emitted photon is green.

So the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) than 530 nm. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.34 eV, so wavelength less than 530 nm.

So the possible colors are in the violet or blue regions.

The question is: what color is absorbed? So the dye absorbs the photon that's higher energy than the emitted one.

So, if the emitted photon is green (2.34 eV), the absorbed must be higher than that, so in the blue or violet.

Wait, but the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which one is it?

Hmm, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.34 eV, so the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So, let's see what's the color for 2.4 eV. E=2.4 eV => λ=1240/2.4≈516.67 nm, which is green. Wait, no, 516 nm is around green but slightly towards blue. Hmm, no, wait 516 is green, but 450 is blue.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since 2.34 eV is green emission, the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon could be in the blue or violet regions.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the question wants us to assume that the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy difference between the ground and excited state.

Wait, but in fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So, let's see: what is the wavelength of 2.4 eV? It's 516.67 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon would be in the green or higher (blue, violet) range.

Wait, but this seems circular. Alternatively, perhaps the absorbed photon is in the blue range.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy difference between the ground state and excited state is E_abs = E_emit + (some loss). But without knowing the exact loss, perhaps we can approximate that the absorbed photon's energy is around 2.3393 eV plus a small amount.

Wait, but that doesn't help much. Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy gap, but that doesn't make sense because in fluorescence, some energy is lost as heat, so the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Hmm, perhaps the question is not worded correctly. Wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy, so shorter wavelength.

So the absorbed photon could be in the blue or violet regions.

So the options are B (violet) and C (blue). Now, which is it?

If the emitted photon is green (530 nm), and the absorbed is higher energy, let's calculate the wavelength for a higher energy.

For example, let's say the absorbed photon is 2.5 eV. Then λ=1240/2.5=496 nm, which is blue.

At 2.76 eV, it's 450 nm, which is blue.

At 3.1 eV, it's 400 nm, which is violet.

So the absorbed photon could be in either blue or violet. So how do I decide between B and C?

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed, so perhaps the organic compound absorbs the complementary color of what it emits. The complementary of green is magenta or violet. Since violet is an option, maybe that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule emits green, so it absorbs light in the blue region. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV plus some. Hmm, but that's unclear.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher. Let's think about common conjugated dyes.

For example, many dyes with extensive conjugation (like those in the visible range) absorb in the UV or visible. For example, a dye that emits green would have absorbed blue or violet light.

Alternatively, let's think about the energy transition. If the molecule emits green, the absorbed photon must have higher energy, so the absorption is in the blue or violet.

But which is more likely? I think that many dyes with extensive conjugation absorb in the blue or green. Wait, but if the emission is green, the absorption is likely at a higher energy (shorter wavelength), so blue or violet.

Wait, for example, if a molecule emits green, it might have absorbed blue light. But another molecule could emit green after absorbing violet.

But without more specific info, it's hard. However, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV. So the possible options are B and C.

But in the initial calculation, 2.3393 eV emitted is green. So the absorbed must be higher, say, 2.5 eV (blue) or 3 eV (violet).

So, the question is, which is the correct color absorbed.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher than this. So the absorbed photon's energy is in the range of blue or violet.

But among the options, which is correct?

I think I may have to choose between B and C. Let me think about what color when absorbed would result in green emission.

If the molecule absorbs blue light (say, 2.76 eV, 450 nm), then emits green (2.3393 eV, 530 nm). That's possible.

Alternatively, if it absorbed violet (3 eV, 413 nm), emits green.

Which is more likely? Well, in practice, many fluorescent dyes emit in the visible range and absorb in the UV or visible. For example, fluorescein absorbs around 480 nm (blue) and emits green.

If that's the case, the absorbed color would be blue, so the answer is C.

But then why is the emitted wavelength 530 nm, which is green. So if the absorption is at 480 nm (blue), the energy is higher.

Another example: Rhodamine B absorbs at around 550 nm (green) and emits in the red, but that's opposite.

Wait, maybe in this case, the absorbed photon is in the blue, so the answer is C.

Alternatively, if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the absorption maximum is at longer wavelengths (lower energy, so redshift). Wait, no, extensive conjugation lowers the energy gap, so the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy, redshift), meaning the absorbed photon has lower energy, which would imply that the emitted photon is even lower? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. Extensive conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps. So the energy required for the electron transition is lower. So the absorption occurs at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than a molecule with less conjugation.

Wait, but in this question, the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV (green). So if the conjugation is extensive, the energy gap is small, so the absorption would be at a longer wavelength, which is lower energy. But that would mean the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed.

But wait, that's not possible because the emitted photon comes from the energy difference between ground and excited states. So if the energy gap is smaller, the emitted photon would have lower energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy of the transition from ground state to excited state (E_abs). The molecule then emits a photon when it returns to the ground state. The energy of the emitted photon (E_emit) is less than E_abs because some energy is lost as heat or other processes. So E_abs = E_emit + (energy lost).

So E_abs is higher than E_emit.

In this case, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So E_abs must be higher.

So the absorbed photon is higher in energy, which is shorter wavelength. Now, the molecule is extensively conjugated, which usually leads to a smaller energy gap. So the E_abs is smaller compared to a less conjugated molecule. Wait, but if the conjugation is extensive, the energy gap (E_abs) is smaller, so the absorbed photon is lower in energy, which would be a longer wavelength.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

Extensive conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps (E_abs is lower). So the absorbed photon has lower energy (longer wavelength), which would be redshift.

But in this problem, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy (shorter wavelength) than that, meaning the absorption is in the blue or violet regions.

But if the molecule has extensive conjugation, the energy gap is smaller. So E_abs is smaller than what it would be if the conjugation were less. Wait, but E_abs must be higher than E_emit.

Wait, perhaps the molecule's E_abs is just slightly higher than E_emit, so the absorbed photon has only slightly higher energy than the emitted. Let's say E_abs is 2.5 eV, which is 496 nm (blue). So the molecule absorbs blue and emits green.

Alternatively, if E_abs is 3 eV (413 nm, violet), emits green.

But with extensive conjugation, which would make E_abs smaller. So, perhaps E_abs is not too much higher than E_emit.

So if E_emit is 2.3393 eV, E_abs is a little higher. Let's say 2.5 eV (blue). So the absorbed color is blue.

Therefore, the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but earlier I thought the complementary color of green is violet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule emits green, so it must absorb violet. Because when you have a substance that allows green light to pass through, it's because it's absorbing the complementary color, which is magenta (a combination of red and blue). But that's for subtractive color mixing, not absorption and emission.

Wait, in emission, the color emitted is what the molecule emits. The color absorbed is the photon that causes the excitation.

So in this case, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon (blue or violet), which excites it, and then it emits a lower energy photon (green).

So which one is it?

I think I need to go with the calculation. The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength). So the absorbed photon is either blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV). The question is, which one is it.

But without knowing the exact E_abs, it's hard. Perhaps in the absence of more information, the most likely answer is that the absorbed photon is in the blue region. So option C) Blue.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, the emitted photon is green, which is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed would be higher, such as blue (say, 450 nm, 2.76 eV). So the absorbed color is blue. So the answer would be C.

But another approach: since the molecule emits green, it must be absorbing the energy in the blue region. Because when you look at the color wheel, green's complementary is magenta, but that's for absorption. But in this case, it's emission, so maybe it's different.

Wait no, in fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, and emits a photon of lower energy. So the color absorbed is the one that excites it, which is higher energy than the emitted.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think again.

E_emit = 2.3393 eV → λ_emit ≈530 nm (green).

E_abs must be higher than E_emit → λ_abs < 530 nm.

So, the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet region.

The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which one is it?

If we think about common fluorescent dyes, many absorb in the UV or blue regions. For example, fluorescein absorbs at around 480 nm (blue), emits green.

So in that case, the answer would be Blue (C).

But another example, rhodamine B absorbs at 550 nm (green) and emits red, but that's opposite.

So, in this case, the dye emits green, so it's likely absorbing blue.

So the answer would be C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted photon and the absorbed photon. The compound emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm (green light). Fluorescence occurs when a molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon, as some energy is lost as heat or other processes during the transition.

The energy of the absorbed photon must therefore be greater than 2.3393 eV, corresponding to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. This places the absorbed photon in the blue or violet regions of the visible spectrum. 

To differentiate between blue (450–495 nm) and violet (400–450 nm), we consider the energy difference. A photon with an energy of 2.5 eV corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 496 nm (blue), while a photon with an energy of 3.1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 400 nm (violet). Since the question specifies that the molecule has an extensively conjugated π-system, which typically absorbs in the blue or violet regions, the absorbed photon is most likely in the blue region.

Thus, the compound absorbs blue light, which aligns with the given options and the behavior of fluorescent dyes.

Answer: C
