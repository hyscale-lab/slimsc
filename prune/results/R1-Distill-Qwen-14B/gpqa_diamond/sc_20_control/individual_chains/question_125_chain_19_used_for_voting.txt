Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Right, and this is similar to the 3D harmonic oscillator. 

The question has two parts: finding the energy of the third excited state and determining how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy eigenvalue.

First, I need to recall the structure of the 3D harmonic oscillator. Oh wait, in 3D, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but wait, no, maybe in spherical coordinates it's different. Because in 3D, especially for isotropic potentials, the energy levels are determined by the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the principal quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, maybe in spherical coordinates, it's better to think in terms of the radial quantum number and the angular momentum quantum numbers.

Wait, no. Let me think. The 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent 1D oscillators in each direction (x, y, z), each with their own quantum number. The total energy is the sum of each direction's energy. So the energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But wait, n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the sum (n_x + n_y + n_z) is the number of quanta in the system. Let me denote this sum as N. So N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy is E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, another way to think about it is that the energy levels are degenerate. Each energy level E_n is given by (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = 2, 3, etc., depending on the quantum numbers. Wait, no, maybe n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So for each possible sum N, the energy is E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, let's get this right. In 3D, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. The energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So for n=0, E=3/2 ħω, which is the ground state. Then n=1 is the first excited state, n=2 is the second, and so on. So the ground state has n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third excited state would be n=3.

Wait, no. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy. So if n=0, that's the ground state. The first excited state would have n=1. Then the second excited state is n=2, third excited is n=3. So the third excited state (meaning the fourth energy level) is n=3.

But wait, let's make sure. Ground state: n=0. That's the first energy level. Then n=1 is the next, which is the first excited state. Then n=2 is the second excited state, and n=3 is the third excited state. So the third excited state is when n=3.

So the energy for the third excited state would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω. Wait, no, wait: n is the sum, so for n=3, E_n = (3 +3/2) ħω? Wait, no, wait, the formula is E = (n + 3/2) ħω, right?

Wait, let me correct that. The energy levels in 3D harmonic oscillator are given by E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. So the ground state has nx=ny=nz=0, so E=(0+0+0 +3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would have one of the quantum numbers as 1, others 0: e.g., nx=1, others 0. So E=(1+3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Second excited state is when two quantum numbers are 1, or one is 2. Wait, but wait, the energy depends on the sum, so let's list the possible sums.

n can be 0,1,2,3,...

So E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω.

So the ground state is n=0, E=3/2 ħω.

First excited state: n=1, E=5/2 ħω.

Second excited: n=2, E=7/2.

Third excited: n=3, E=9/2 ħω. So the energy is (9/2) ħω.

So that's the first part of the question: the energy is (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, option A and C have this value. B and D have some other terms, which don't look like the energy expression I know.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, the degeneracy of the energy level when n=3.

So for each n, the degeneracy is the number of ways you can have nx + ny + nz = n, where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers. So for n=3, how many triplets (nx, ny, nz) are there?

This is a combinatorics problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = 3. The formula for this is (n +3 -1 choose 3-1) )= (3 +2 choose 2) )= (5 choose 2) )= 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So for n=3, the energy level is degenerate with multiplicity 10. So the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10, which matches. Option C has the correct energy but lists 3, which is wrong. So the correct answer should be A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle with mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of the system are determined by the quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$, which correspond to the quanta in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are non-negative integers. The energy levels are degenerate, with degeneracy determined by the number of ways to partition the total quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ into three non-negative integers.

### Part 1: Energy of the Third Excited State
The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$ (i.e., $n_x = n_y = n_z = 0$), with energy $E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega$. The first excited state corresponds to $n = 1$, the second to $n = 2$, and the third to $n = 3$. For $n = 3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

### Part 2: Degeneracy of the Energy Level
The degeneracy of the energy level for $n = 3$ is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Using combinatorics, the number of solutions is given by:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 10$ — Correct. The energy matches the calculated value for $n = 3$, and the degeneracy is 10.
- **Option B**: $11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ — Incorrect. The energy expression does not match the harmonic oscillator energy formula.
- **Option C**: $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 3$ — Incorrect. While the energy is correct, the degeneracy is listed as 3 instead of 10.
- **Option D**: $11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ — Incorrect. Both the energy and degeneracy are incorrect.

### Final Answer
The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \hbar \omega$, and the degeneracy is 10.
