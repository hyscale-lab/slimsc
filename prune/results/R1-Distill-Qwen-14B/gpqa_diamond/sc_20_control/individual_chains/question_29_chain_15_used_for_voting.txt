Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let's read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound is made up of five exons and four introns. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound, probably by disrupting the gene's function.

The problem says that EMS mutagenesis was used, and they looked at the target gene in all mutants. The changes are in the first exon area. So, I think the idea is that mutations in the coding regions (exons) can disrupt the gene's function, especially if they change the amino acids in the protein.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. Let's compare each mutant's DNA sequence to the intact gene to see what kind of mutations they have.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Wait, wait. Actually, looking at the given sequences, each line starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so they all have that. Let's look at the first part.

Let me write down the first part of each mutant and the wild type.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Hmm. Let's see the differences. Let's compare each position.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG C...
Wait, let me line them up better. Let me break each into segments.

For the first part:

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG C...
Wait, let me write each line with the same positions.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TTCT ACG C... Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the changes occur.

Looking at the first part:

The wild type has:

positions: 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
26-28: GAA? Wait, perhaps the format is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to look for where each mutant differs.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:

Compare with wild type:

Wild: after ATG, next is TTT.

Mutant 1: after ATG, it's T TCT ACG... Wait, perhaps not. Let me look at the first 20 nucleotides or so.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for the exact change.

Wild type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let me compare each position:

Looking at the first part:

Wild: ATG TTC TCG C...
Mutant 1: ATG TT CTA CGC...

Wait, let me break it down.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCT ACG C ... Hmm, perhaps I should look for the exact point where the sequences differ.

Another approach: for each mutant, find where the differing bases are.

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So, comparing:

Wild: positions 4-10: TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT
Mutant 1: positions 4-10: TCT ACG GCT GGT ACT

Wait, perhaps the first change is at position 4: Wild has TTT, Mutant 1 has TCT.

Wait, perhaps the first 6 nucleotides: Wild is TTC TCG.

Wait, looking at the exact letters:

Wild starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, perhaps it's better to write each 3-mer (codon) and see.

Wild: ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps not. Let me write each line:

Wild: ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA

Wait, perhaps not. Let me compare each codon.

Let me look at the first few codons.

Wild type codons (starting from ATG):

1. ATG (start)
2. TTC (Ser)
3. TCG (Ser)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
... and so on.

Mutant 1:

1. ATG
2. TT C (Wait, the second codon is TCT? Let me check.

Wait, the sequence for mutant 1 is:

ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A ...

Wait, perhaps the second codon is TCT instead of TTC.

Because wild type's second codon is TTC (Serine), while mutant 1's is TCT (Serine). So same amino acid? Hmm, but then the third codon in wild is TCG (Serine), mutant 1 has ACT? Wait, no. Let me count.

Wild: positions 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTC, 7-9: TCG, 10-12: GCT, etc.

Mutant 1: positions 4-6: TCT (since the sequence is ATG followed by T TCT... so 4-6 is TCT), 7-9: ACG (maybe), I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look for where each mutant differs from the wild type.

Let me go one by one.

Mutant 1:

The sequence starts with ATG, then T T C T A C G C T... Hmm, perhaps the changes are in the first few codons.

Wild: TTC (Ser) at positions 4-6, then TCG (Ser), then GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant 1: TCT (Ser) at positions 4-6, then ACG (Thr) at positions 7-9, perhaps. Let me count:

Wild: positions 4-6: TTC
Mutant1: 4-6: TCT (so TTC becomes TCT; that's a change in the third base, T->C. So TTC (Ser) becomes TCT (Ser). So same amino acid. Hmm, so no change in the amino acid.

Then, wild 7-9: TCG (Ser), mutant 1's next is ACG. So positions 7-9: ACG (Thr). So a change there.

So that's a substitution from Ser to Thr. So that might be a missense mutation. Let's see what the rest of the changes are.

Moving on to Mutant 2:

Mutant 2's sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Compare to wild type: The first part is ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant 2: ATG TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, let's look at the changes.

After ATG, wild has TTC, then TCG, then GCT. In Mutant 2, after TTC, next is TAA.

Wait, how?

Wild type: positions 4-6: TTC, 7-9: TCG, 10-12: GCT.

Mutant 2: positions 4-6: TCT (since the sequence is TTCTAAG). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each three nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the first few codons for each mutant.

Wild:
1. ATG
2. TTC (Ser)
3. TCG (Ser)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
... etc.

Mutant 1:
1. ATG
2. TCT (Ser) [position 4-6]
3. ACG (Thr) [7-9]
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
... etc.

Wait, so in Mutant 1, codon 2 is TCT instead of TTC (same amino acid, serine), codon 3 is ACG instead of TCG (Ser to Thr).

So that's two changes.

Mutant 2:

Sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Looking at the codons:

1. ATG
2. TCT (Ser) [pos4-6]
3. TAA (Stop codon?) Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because if a stop codon is introduced, the protein would be truncated. But wait, does this happen in the first exon?

Wait, but in the provided sequences, all the mutants end with TGA, which is another stop codon. Wait, in the wild type, it's ... TGA at the end. So perhaps the 'TGA' is the stop codon. So in the wild type, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So in the mutants, perhaps they have their own stop codons.

But looking at Mutant 2, after the ATG, the next codons are:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, no. Let me parse it correctly.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

1. ATG
2. TTT (Phe) ? No, wait: After ATG, the next three nucleotides are TCT.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express each mutant's sequence in triplets.

Let me write each sequence in groups of three, starting after the ATG.

Wild type:
TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant 1:
TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Wait, perhaps I'm not grouping correctly. Let me try again.

Wild type after ATG:

Positions 4-6: TTC (Ser)
7-9: TCG (Ser)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
25-27: GAT (Asp)
28-30: GAA (Glu)
31-33: CAT (His)
34-36: ATT (Ile)
37-39: TAT (Tyr)
40-42: TGT (Cys)
43-45: CGT (Arg)
46: TGA (Stop)

Mutant 1 after ATG:

Positions 4-6: TCT (Ser)
7-9: ACG (Thr)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
25-27: GAT (Asp)
28-30: GAA (Glu)
31-33: CAT (His)
34-36: ATT (Ile)
37-39: TAT (Tyr)
40-42: TGT (Cys)
43-45: CGC (Arg)
46: TGA (Stop)

So for Mutant 1, changes are:

- TTC → TCT (Ser to Ser, no change)
- TCG → ACG (Ser to Thr)
No other changes in the first few codons.

So the amino acids change from Ser (third codon) to Thr. So this is a missense mutation.

Mutant 2's sequence after ATG:

TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Breaking into codons:

1. TCT (Ser)
2. TAA (Stop)
3. GCT (Ala)
4. GGT (Gly)
5. ACT (Thr)
6. TCT (Ser)
7. GTG (Val)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. GAA (Glu)
10. CAT (His)
11. ATT (Ile)
12. TAT (Tyr)
13. TGT (Cys)
14. CGC (Arg)
15. TGA (Stop)

Wait, the second codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. So this would cause the protein to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. That's a nonsense mutation. So this would likely result in a nonfunctional protein, but maybe the compound is still present if the truncation is after the gene's important region. Alternatively, it could disrupt the gene function.

But given the question, we're looking for a mutation that would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, which probably means the gene is not functional anymore. So a frameshift or a nonsense mutation would do that, but let's check the other mutants.

Mutant 3:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

After ATG, breaking into codons:

1. TT T (Wait, no. Let's see. The sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps:

Positions 4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: TAC (Tyr)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: GTC (Val)
19-21: ACT (Thr)
22-24: TCT (Ser)
25-27: GTG (Val)
28-30: GAT (Asp)
31-33: GAA (Glu)
... and so on.

So comparing to wild:

Wild 4-6: TTC (Ser)
Mutant3 4-6: TTT (Phe) → change from Ser to Phe (a missense)

7-9: TCG (Ser) → Mutant3 has TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Ser to Tyr.

13-15: GCT (Ala) → in mutant3, it's GGT (Gly) in position 13-15? Wait, no:

Wait, wild's 13-15: GCT (Ala), but mutant3's positions 10-12: GCT (Ala). Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, perhaps better to write the entire sequence in triplets.

Wild:

ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

So the first few codons:

ATG, TTC becomes TTT, TCG becomes TAC, GCT remains GCT, GGT remains GGT, ACT remains ACT, TCT remains TCT, GTG remains GTG, etc.

So changes are at positions 2 and 3:

Codon 2: TTC (Ser) → TTT (Phe)
Codon 3: TCG (Ser) → TAC (Tyr)

So two amino acid changes. So this is a missense mutation, but doesn't lead to a stop.

Mutant4:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Breaking into codons:

After ATG,

1. TTT (Phe)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. GCT (Ala)
4. ACT (Thr)
5. TCT (Ser)
6. GTG (Val)
7. GAT (Asp)
8. GAA (Glu)
... and so on.

So comparing to wild:

Wild's codon 2: TTC (Ser) → Mutant4 has TTT (Phe)
Wild's codon 3: TCG (Ser) → Mutant4 has TAC (Tyr)

So same as Mutant3, but maybe more changes?

Wait, let me write the entire triplet:

Wild:

ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Wait, perhaps I'm not grouping correctly. Let me see the given sequence for Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, after ATG, the sequence is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Grouping into triplets:

ATG
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
TGA (Stop)

Wait, but the wild type at some point has GCT GGT... So in Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is GCT ACT, which is two codons: GCT (Ala) and ACT (Thr).

So in the wild, the sequence after TAC would be GCT GGT, which is Ala Gly.

In Mutant4, it's GCT ACT, so Ala Thr.

So, the third codon in Mutant4 is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr).

So the changes are:

Codon 2: TTC → TTT (Ser → Phe)
Codon 3: TCG → TAC (Ser → Tyr)
Codon 4: GCT (same)
Codon 5: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr)

Wait, that would be a third change. So three amino acid substitutions.

But wait, in the wild, after TAC (codon3) would be GCT (codon4) and GGT (codon5). In Mutant4, after TAC (codon3) is GCT (codon4) and ACT (codon5). So codon5 changes from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr).

So, three changes.

Now, the question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, meaning that the gene product is non-functional.

So, possible ways are:

- Nonsense mutation (introduces a stop codon), leading to a truncated protein that might not function.
- Missense mutations that disrupt the structure/function of the protein.
- Disruption of reading frame (frameshift), leading to a completely different downstream amino acid sequence.

Looking at the options:

Mutant 2 has a TAA codon (second codon after ATG) which is a stop codon. So that would cause the protein to be truncated. But the location matters. If the stop codon is early, the protein might be nonfunctional.

Mutant4 has no stop codon in the first few positions; it's a missense with multiple changes.

Mutant1 has a missense, changing two amino acids.

Mutant3 has two missense changes.

Mutant4 has three missense changes.

But the question is, which mutation would most probably eliminate the compound. So, mutations that disrupt the gene's function could be any of these.

But the question says that the changes are at the beginning of the gene. So perhaps if the mutation is in the first few codons, a frameshift or a stop early might disrupt the gene.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Wait, the problem states that the changes are in the first exon area. So all the mutations are in exons, which are coding regions.

So, if a mutation introduces a stop codon early in the gene, the resulting protein would be much shorter, possibly nonfunctional.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant2's second codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be very short, just two amino acids (ATG and TCT, then stop). So the protein is way shorter than normal, so likely nonfunctional.

Mutant4 doesn't have a stop codon, but has multiple amino acid changes. It might disrupt the function, but perhaps not completely eliminate the compound. Alternatively, maybe the truncation in Mutant2 is more effective.

Wait, but the wild type's first codon after ATG is TTC (Ser), then TCG (Ser), etc. So in Mutant2, the second codon is TAA (stop). So the resulting protein would be ATG (start), then TTC (Ser), then stop. So the amino acid sequence would be Met-Ser, then stop. So a very short peptide.

That would likely disrupt the gene's function entirely, leading to no compound being made. So the anti-nutritional compound would not be produced.

But wait, wait: in Mutant2, the sequence after ATG is TTCTAAG... So the first few codons are:

ATG → TCT (Ser) [positions 4-6], then TAA (stop) [positions 7-9].

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck.

The entire sequence for Mutant2 is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So after ATG is T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A ...

Grouped into triplets:

ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Ah, so the first codon after ATG is TCT (Ser), then TAA (stop). So the protein would be Met-Ser-Stop. So only two amino acids, which would likely result in a nonfunctional protein.

So this would eliminate the gene's function.

So, comparing all mutants:

- Mutant1: Two missense changes (no stop, so full-length but altered protein)
- Mutant2: Stop codon early → truncated protein (nonfunctional)
- Mutant3: Two missense changes
- Mutant4: Three missense changes and a possible frame shift? Wait, let me check.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So codons:

ATG → TTT (Phe) → TAC (Tyr) → GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr) → TCT (Ser) → GTG (Val) → GAT (Asp) → GAA (Glu) → ...

No stops in the early part. So the protein would be longer, but with some amino acid changes.

So the most likely to eliminate the compound is Mutant2, which introduces a stop codon early, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

But wait, the question is about the anti-nutritional compound being impossible to use. So the gene is responsible for the compound. If the gene is knocked out (nonfunctional), the compound won't be made, so the cultivar becomes usable.

So, which option is Mutant2? Let me check the options.

Options are:

A) Mutant2 → option A is Mutant2

So the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the target gene sequence. The gene consists of five exons, and the mutations occur in the first exon. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, thereby preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Wild Type Sequence**:
   - `ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA`
   - This sequence represents the intact gene, with no mutations.

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - `ATG TCT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA`
   - Changes:
     - Codon 2: `TTC` (Ser) → `TCT` (Ser) (no change in amino acid).
     - Codon 3: `TCG` (Ser) → `ACG` (Thr) (missense mutation).
   - Effect: Two amino acid changes, but no stop codon introduced. The protein is likely altered but still functional.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - `ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA`
   - Changes:
     - Codon 2: `TTC` (Ser) → `TCT` (Ser) (no change in amino acid).
     - Codon 3: `TCG` (Ser) → `TAA` (Stop) (nonsense mutation).
   - Effect: A stop codon is introduced at codon 3, resulting in a truncated protein (Met-Ser-Stop). This likely renders the protein nonfunctional, completely eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA`
   - Changes:
     - Codon 2: `TTC` (Ser) → `TTT` (Phe) (missense mutation).
     - Codon 3: `TCG` (Ser) → `TAC` (Tyr) (missense mutation).
   - Effect: Two amino acid changes, but no stop codon introduced. The protein is altered but may still retain partial functionality.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA`
   - Changes:
     - Codon 2: `TTC` (Ser) → `TTT` (Phe) (missense mutation).
     - Codon 3: `TCG` (Ser) → `TAC` (Tyr) (missense mutation).
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr) (missense mutation).
   - Effect: Three amino acid changes, but no stop codon introduced. The protein is altered, but it is unclear if it is completely nonfunctional.

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a stop codon early in the sequence, resulting in a truncated and nonfunctional protein. This ensures that the anti-nutritional compound is not synthesized.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let's read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound is made up of five exons and four introns. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound, probably by disrupting the gene's function.

The problem says that EMS mutagenesis was used, and they looked at the target gene in all mutants. The changes are in the first exon area. So, I think the idea is that mutations in the coding regions (exons) can disrupt the gene's function, especially if they change the amino acids in the protein.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. Let's compare each mutant's DNA sequence to the intact gene to see what kind of mutations they have.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Wait, wait. Actually, looking at the given sequences, each line starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so they all have that. Let's look at the first part.

Let me write down the first part of each mutant and the wild type.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Hmm. Let's see the differences. Let's compare each position.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG C...
Wait, let me line them up better. Let me break each into segments.

For the first part:

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG C...
Wait, let me write each line with the same positions.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TTCT ACG C... Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the changes occur.

Looking at the first part:

The wild type has:

positions: 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
26-28: GAA? Wait, perhaps the format is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to look for where each mutant differs.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:

Compare with wild type:

Wild: after ATG, next is TTT.

Mutant 1: after ATG, it's T TCT ACG... Wait, perhaps not. Let me look at the first 20 nucleotides or so.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for the exact change.

Wild type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let me compare each position:

Looking at the first part:

Wild: ATG TTC TCG C...
Mutant 1: ATG TT CTA CGC...

Wait, let me break it down.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCT ACG C ... Hmm, perhaps I should look for the exact point where the sequences differ.

Another approach: for each mutant, find where the differing bases are.

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So, comparing:

Wild: positions 4-10: TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT
Mutant 1: positions 4-10: TCT ACG GCT GGT ACT

Wait, perhaps the first change is at position 4: Wild has TTT, Mutant 1 has TCT.

Wait, perhaps the first 6 nucleotides: Wild is TTC TCG.

Wait, looking at the exact letters:

Wild starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, perhaps it's better to write each 3-mer (codon) and see.

Wild: ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps not. Let me write each line:

Wild: ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA

Wait, perhaps not. Let me compare each codon.

Let me look at the first few codons.

Wild type codons (starting from ATG):

1. ATG (start)
2. TTC (Ser)
3. TCG (Ser)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
... and so on.

Mutant 1:

1. ATG
2. TT C (Wait, the second codon is TCT? Let me check.

Wait, the sequence for mutant 1 is:

ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A ...

Wait, perhaps the second codon is TCT instead of TTC.

Because wild type's second codon is TTC (Serine), while mutant 1's is TCT (Serine). So same amino acid? Hmm, but then the third codon in wild is TCG (Serine), mutant 1 has ACT? Wait, no. Let me count.

Wild: positions 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTC, 7-9: TCG, 10-12: GCT, etc.

Mutant 1: positions 4-6: TCT (since the sequence is ATG followed by T TCT... so 4-6 is TCT), 7-9: ACG (maybe), I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look for where each mutant differs from the wild type.

Let me go one by one.

Mutant 1:

The sequence starts with ATG, then T T C T A C G C T... Hmm, perhaps the changes are in the first few codons.

Wild: TTC (Ser) at positions 4-6, then TCG (Ser), then GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant 1: TCT (Ser) at positions 4-6, then ACG (Thr) at positions 7-9, perhaps. Let me count:

Wild: positions 4-6: TTC
Mutant1: 4-6: TCT (so TTC becomes TCT; that's a change in the third base, T->C. So TTC (Ser) becomes TCT (Ser). So same amino acid. Hmm, so no change in the amino acid.

Then, wild 7-9: TCG (Ser), mutant 1's next is ACG. So positions 7-9: ACG (Thr). So a change there.

So that's a substitution from Ser to Thr. So that might be a missense mutation. Let's see what the rest of the changes are.

Moving on to Mutant 2:

Mutant 2's sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Compare to wild type: The first part is ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant 2: ATG TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, let's look at the changes.

After ATG, wild has TTC, then TCG, then GCT. In Mutant 2, after TTC, next is TAA.

Wait, how?

Wild type: positions 4-6: TTC, 7-9: TCG, 10-12: GCT.

Mutant 2: positions 4-6: TCT (since the sequence is TTCTAAG). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each three nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the first few codons for each mutant.

Wild:
1. ATG
2. TTC (Ser)
3. TCG (Ser)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
... etc.

Mutant 1:
1. ATG
2. TCT (Ser) [position 4-6]
3. ACG (Thr) [7-9]
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
... etc.

Wait, so in Mutant 1, codon 2 is TCT instead of TTC (same amino acid, serine), codon 3 is ACG instead of TCG (Ser to Thr).

So that's two changes.

Mutant 2:

Sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Looking at the codons:

1. ATG
2. TCT (Ser) [pos4-6]
3. TAA (Stop codon?) Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because if a stop codon is introduced, the protein would be truncated. But wait, does this happen in the first exon?

Wait, but in the provided sequences, all the mutants end with TGA, which is another stop codon. Wait, in the wild type, it's ... TGA at the end. So perhaps the 'TGA' is the stop codon. So in the wild type, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So in the mutants, perhaps they have their own stop codons.

But looking at Mutant 2, after the ATG, the next codons are:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, no. Let me parse it correctly.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

1. ATG
2. TTT (Phe) ? No, wait: After ATG, the next three nucleotides are TCT.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express each mutant's sequence in triplets.

Let me write each sequence in groups of three, starting after the ATG.

Wild type:
TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant 1:
TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Wait, perhaps I'm not grouping correctly. Let me try again.

Wild type after ATG:

Positions 4-6: TTC (Ser)
7-9: TCG (Ser)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
25-27: GAT (Asp)
28-30: GAA (Glu)
31-33: CAT (His)
34-36: ATT (Ile)
37-39: TAT (Tyr)
40-42: TGT (Cys)
43-45: CGT (Arg)
46: TGA (Stop)

Mutant 1 after ATG:

Positions 4-6: TCT (Ser)
7-9: ACG (Thr)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
25-27: GAT (Asp)
28-30: GAA (Glu)
31-33: CAT (His)
34-36: ATT (Ile)
37-39: TAT (Tyr)
40-42: TGT (Cys)
43-45: CGC (Arg)
46: TGA (Stop)

So for Mutant 1, changes are:

- TTC → TCT (Ser to Ser, no change)
- TCG → ACG (Ser to Thr)
No other changes in the first few codons.

So the amino acids change from Ser (third codon) to Thr. So this is a missense mutation.

Mutant 2's sequence after ATG:

TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Breaking into codons:

1. TCT (Ser)
2. TAA (Stop)
3. GCT (Ala)
4. GGT (Gly)
5. ACT (Thr)
6. TCT (Ser)
7. GTG (Val)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. GAA (Glu)
10. CAT (His)
11. ATT (Ile)
12. TAT (Tyr)
13. TGT (Cys)
14. CGC (Arg)
15. TGA (Stop)

Wait, the second codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. So this would cause the protein to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. That's a nonsense mutation. So this would likely result in a nonfunctional protein, but maybe the compound is still present if the truncation is after the gene's important region. Alternatively, it could disrupt the gene function.

But given the question, we're looking for a mutation that would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, which probably means the gene is not functional anymore. So a frameshift or a nonsense mutation would do that, but let's check the other mutants.

Mutant 3:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

After ATG, breaking into codons:

1. TT T (Wait, no. Let's see. The sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps:

Positions 4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: TAC (Tyr)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: GTC (Val)
19-21: ACT (Thr)
22-24: TCT (Ser)
25-27: GTG (Val)
28-30: GAT (Asp)
31-33: GAA (Glu)
... and so on.

So comparing to wild:

Wild 4-6: TTC (Ser)
Mutant3 4-6: TTT (Phe) → change from Ser to Phe (a missense)

7-9: TCG (Ser) → Mutant3 has TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Ser to Tyr.

13-15: GCT (Ala) → in mutant3, it's GGT (Gly) in position 13-15? Wait, no:

Wait, wild's 13-15: GCT (Ala), but mutant3's positions 10-12: GCT (Ala). Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, perhaps better to write the entire sequence in triplets.

Wild:

ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

So the first few codons:

ATG, TTC becomes TTT, TCG becomes TAC, GCT remains GCT, GGT remains GGT, ACT remains ACT, TCT remains TCT, GTG remains GTG, etc.

So changes are at positions 2 and 3:

Codon 2: TTC (Ser) → TTT (Phe)
Codon 3: TCG (Ser) → TAC (Tyr)

So two amino acid changes. So this is a missense mutation, but doesn't lead to a stop.

Mutant4:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Breaking into codons:

After ATG,

1. TTT (Phe)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. GCT (Ala)
4. ACT (Thr)
5. TCT (Ser)
6. GTG (Val)
7. GAT (Asp)
8. GAA (Glu)
... and so on.

So comparing to wild:

Wild's codon 2: TTC (Ser) → Mutant4 has TTT (Phe)
Wild's codon 3: TCG (Ser) → Mutant4 has TAC (Tyr)

So same as Mutant3, but maybe more changes?

Wait, let me write the entire triplet:

Wild:

ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Wait, perhaps I'm not grouping correctly. Let me see the given sequence for Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, after ATG, the sequence is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Grouping into triplets:

ATG
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
TGA (Stop)

Wait, but the wild type at some point has GCT GGT... So in Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is GCT ACT, which is two codons: GCT (Ala) and ACT (Thr).

So in the wild, the sequence after TAC would be GCT GGT, which is Ala Gly.

In Mutant4, it's GCT ACT, so Ala Thr.

So, the third codon in Mutant4 is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr).

So the changes are:

Codon 2: TTC → TTT (Ser → Phe)
Codon 3: TCG → TAC (Ser → Tyr)
Codon 4: GCT (same)
Codon 5: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr)

Wait, that would be a third change. So three amino acid substitutions.

But wait, in the wild, after TAC (codon3) would be GCT (codon4) and GGT (codon5). In Mutant4, after TAC (codon3) is GCT (codon4) and ACT (codon5). So codon5 changes from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr).

So, three changes.

Now, the question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, meaning that the gene product is non-functional.

So, possible ways are:

- Nonsense mutation (introduces a stop codon), leading to a truncated protein that might not function.
- Missense mutations that disrupt the structure/function of the protein.
- Disruption of reading frame (frameshift), leading to a completely different downstream amino acid sequence.

Looking at the options:

Mutant 2 has a TAA codon (second codon after ATG) which is a stop codon. So that would cause the protein to be truncated. But the location matters. If the stop codon is early, the protein might be nonfunctional.

Mutant4 has no stop codon in the first few positions; it's a missense with multiple changes.

Mutant1 has a missense, changing two amino acids.

Mutant3 has two missense changes.

Mutant4 has three missense changes.

But the question is, which mutation would most probably eliminate the compound. So, mutations that disrupt the gene's function could be any of these.

But the question says that the changes are at the beginning of the gene. So perhaps if the mutation is in the first few codons, a frameshift or a stop early might disrupt the gene.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Wait, the problem states that the changes are in the first exon area. So all the mutations are in exons, which are coding regions.

So, if a mutation introduces a stop codon early in the gene, the resulting protein would be much shorter, possibly nonfunctional.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant2's second codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be very short, just two amino acids (ATG and TCT, then stop). So the protein is way shorter than normal, so likely nonfunctional.

Mutant4 doesn't have a stop codon, but has multiple amino acid changes. It might disrupt the function, but perhaps not completely eliminate the compound. Alternatively, maybe the truncation in Mutant2 is more effective.

Wait, but the wild type's first codon after ATG is TTC (Ser), then TCG (Ser), etc. So in Mutant2, the second codon is TAA (stop). So the resulting protein would be ATG (start), then TTC (Ser), then stop. So the amino acid sequence would be Met-Ser, then stop. So a very short peptide.

That would likely disrupt the gene's function entirely, leading to no compound being made. So the anti-nutritional compound would not be produced.

But wait, wait: in Mutant2, the sequence after ATG is TTCTAAG... So the first few codons are:

ATG → TCT (Ser) [positions 4-6], then TAA (stop) [positions 7-9].

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck.

The entire sequence for Mutant2 is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So after ATG is T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A ...

Grouped into triplets:

ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Ah, so the first codon after ATG is TCT (Ser), then TAA (stop). So the protein would be Met-Ser-Stop. So only two amino acids, which would likely result in a nonfunctional protein.

So this would eliminate the gene's function.

So, comparing all mutants:

- Mutant1: Two missense changes (no stop, so full-length but altered protein)
- Mutant2: Stop codon early → truncated protein (nonfunctional)
- Mutant3: Two missense changes
- Mutant4: Three missense changes and a possible frame shift? Wait, let me check.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So codons:

ATG → TTT (Phe) → TAC (Tyr) → GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr) → TCT (Ser) → GTG (Val) → GAT (Asp) → GAA (Glu) → ...

No stops in the early part. So the protein would be longer, but with some amino acid changes.

So the most likely to eliminate the compound is Mutant2, which introduces a stop codon early, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

But wait, the question is about the anti-nutritional compound being impossible to use. So the gene is responsible for the compound. If the gene is knocked out (nonfunctional), the compound won't be made, so the cultivar becomes usable.

So, which option is Mutant2? Let me check the options.

Options are:

A) Mutant2 → option A is Mutant2

So the answer should be option A.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the target gene sequence. The gene consists of five exons, and the mutations occur in the first exon. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, thereby preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Wild Type Sequence**:
   - `ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA`
   - This sequence represents the intact gene, with no mutations.

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - `ATG TCT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA`
   - Changes:
     - Codon 2: `TTC` (Ser) → `TCT` (Ser) (no change in amino acid).
     - Codon 3: `TCG` (Ser) → `ACG` (Thr) (missense mutation).
   - Effect: Two amino acid changes, but no stop codon introduced. The protein is likely altered but still functional.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - `ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA`
   - Changes:
     - Codon 2: `TTC` (Ser) → `TCT` (Ser) (no change in amino acid).
     - Codon 3: `TCG` (Ser) → `TAA` (Stop) (nonsense mutation).
   - Effect: A stop codon is introduced at codon 3, resulting in a truncated protein (Met-Ser-Stop). This likely renders the protein nonfunctional, completely eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA`
   - Changes:
     - Codon 2: `TTC` (Ser) → `TTT` (Phe) (missense mutation).
     - Codon 3: `TCG` (Ser) → `TAC` (Tyr) (missense mutation).
   - Effect: Two amino acid changes, but no stop codon introduced. The protein is altered but may still retain partial functionality.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA`
   - Changes:
     - Codon 2: `TTC` (Ser) → `TTT` (Phe) (missense mutation).
     - Codon 3: `TCG` (Ser) → `TAC` (Tyr) (missense mutation).
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr) (missense mutation).
   - Effect: Three amino acid changes, but no stop codon introduced. The protein is altered, but it is unclear if it is completely nonfunctional.

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a stop codon early in the sequence, resulting in a truncated and nonfunctional protein. This ensures that the anti-nutritional compound is not synthesized.

**Answer: A**
