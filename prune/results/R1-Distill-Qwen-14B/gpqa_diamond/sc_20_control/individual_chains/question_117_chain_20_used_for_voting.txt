Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which of the given compounds can show optical isomerism. Optical isomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other, so they can rotate plane-polarized light. I remember that for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center. Alternatively, it might have some other form of asymmetry, like an allene or a helix, but I think the main focus here is on chiral centers.

Let's look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, this structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Wait, biphenyls can have some interesting stereochemistry. The substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', so on each ring, the nitro is opposite the connecting bond. The carboxylate groups are at 2 and 2', which are on the same side as each other? Or opposite? Wait, no. The substituents on the biphenyl would be at positions 2 and 2' on each benzene ring. So the overall structure is symmetrical? No, wait, the biphenyl has two rings connected at position 1. So the substituents at 2 and 2' would be on the same side if the rings are in a certain conformation. But wait, I'm trying to figure out if there's a plane of symmetry here. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it might not be chiral. Let me imagine the structure: each benzene has nitro groups at 6 and 6', so each ring has a nitro opposite the connection point. The other substituents are carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. So each ring has a carboxylate group at 2. So when connected, the two rings are attached at position 1, so each has a carboxylate group on the same side? Or perhaps they're arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical. Let me think. If the two rings are connected at position 1, then the substituents at 2 and 2' are on adjacent carbons. So if the two rings are arranged such that the substituents on 2 and 2' are on opposite sides, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are on the same side, maybe the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, but wait: the molecule is dimethyl, which means there are two methyl ester groups attached. Oh wait, no, the groups are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions on the biphenyl. So each benzene has a nitro at 6, and a carboxylate at 2. So the nitro and carboxylate are adjacent on each ring. So each substituent is on adjacent carbons. Let me think about the biphenyl structure. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', so each ring has substituents at position 2 and 6. So when the rings are in a certain conformation, the substituents might be arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, does the biphenyl itself have any chiral centers? No, because the biphenyl is a single bond, so it can rotate. Unless the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. Alternatively, a molecule can have a plane of symmetry, which would make it achiral even if it has stereogenic centers. So for option 1, are there any chiral centers? Let's look at the structure. The carbons in the biphenyl are part of the aromatic rings, so they're sp² hybridized, not tetrahedral. So they can't be chiral centers. The substituent groups are at the 2 and 6 positions, which are on the benzene rings. So the ester groups are attached to the benzene. So each ester is a carboxylate (OOCR) attached to the benzene. Wait, the actual structure would be like O=C-O-Me attached to the benzene. So the carbon where the ester is attached is the benzene's carbon, which is attached to two other carbons in the benzene ring. So no, those aren't tetrahedral carbons. So I don't think there are any chiral centers in this molecule. Unless there's some other form of asymmetry, like a planar chirality. But I'm not sure about that. Planar chirality might be present in certain structures, like biphenyls with substituents arranged asymmetrically. So maybe if the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that they don't mirror each other, the molecule could be chiral. But wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring. Let me imagine the structure. Each benzene has a nitro and a carboxylate ester. If the rings are connected in a way that the substituents are on the same side, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they're on opposite sides, then perhaps no plane of symmetry exists. But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit hard. Hmm. I'm not certain about this one. Maybe it's an achiral molecule because the substituents are symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of substituents around the single bond between the two benzene rings leads to a lack of a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no internal plane of symmetry due to the different substituents, then it could exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let's draw it. The middle carbon (carbon 2) is connected to a hydroxyl group, a methyl group (from CH3-C), a carbonyl group (from COOCH3), and another group. Wait, let's see: The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH with OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH3? Wait no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the structure where the propanoate is CH2CH2COO, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is CH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO- but the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3? No, Wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the chain would be CH2-CH2-COO-, but when you have 2-hydroxypropanoate, it's CH2(OH)-CH2-COO- methyl ester. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to: OH, CH3 (from the first carbon?), wait, maybe it's better to write the structure. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (from the chain), one to the first and second carbon. Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to:

- A carbon (the first carbon, which is CH3),

- A carbon (the third carbon, which is part of the COO group),

- An OH group,

- And a hydrogen?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When it's methyl ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (which is a carbonyl group),

- and a hydrogen.

So the four substituents on that central carbon are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Oh wait, that's four different groups! So that central carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 definitely shows optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. The structure is Ph-CO-Ph. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two benzene rings. The structure is (Ph)₂CO. Let's look for chiral centers. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, an oxygen (double bond), and the other substituent. Wait, the central carbon is C=O, so it's a carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized, so it can't be a chiral center because it's only attached to three groups (the two phenyls and the O). So no chiral centers here. Any other possible sources of chirality? Like planar chirality? Well, in benzophenone, the two phenyl groups are attached to the same carbon, but since they're on the same side of the carbonyl, the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, wait, if the two phenyl groups are on opposite sides, would that create a chiral molecule? No, because the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group. Alternatively, if they're on the same side, the molecule is symmetrical. So benzophenone isn't chiral because it doesn't have a chiral center and it's symmetrical. So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HO₂C-CHCH₂-COOH. When esterified with two methyl groups, it becomes MeO₂C-CHCH₂-COOMe. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)₂ with a double bond between the two CH groups. So dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on the double bond are opposite each other. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH₂(CO₂Me)–CH₂–CH₂(CO₂Me)? No, wait, no. Fumarate is the trans form of maleate. So the structure is CH₂(CO₂Me)–CH₂–CH₂(CO₂Me) with a double bond in the middle. No, wait, fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but in the trans configuration. So the dimethyl ester would have the ester groups on either end. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up maleic and fumaric. Let me get this right. Maleic acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH(COOH)–O, no, wait. Actually, maleic acid is HO₂C–CH=CH–COOH, but in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, no, maleic acid and fumaric acid are both di-carboxylic acids with a double bond between the two middle carbons. Maleic acid is cis, fumaric is trans.

So the structure of fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but that can't be right because that would be a single bond. Wait, no, the correct structure is that in fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but with a double bond between the two central carbons, making it HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH with a double bond. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try again. Maleic acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH(COOH)–O, but that's not right. I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the structure of fumaric acid as (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but with a double bond between the middle two carbons. So it's HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH with a double bond between the CH₂ groups? Or wait, perhaps it's HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH with a double bond between the two central carbons, making it HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH with a double bond between the CH₂ groups, which would actually be HO₂C–CH=CH–COOH. But wait, that would make fumaric acid trans, and maleic acid cis.

So when fumaric acid is converted to dimethyl ester, the structure becomes CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the correct structure is that the two methyl ester groups are on the same carbon. No, wait, no. Let me think about the actual structure. Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the dimethyl ester would replace the hydroxyls with OCH3 groups. So the structure is MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups.

Wait, no. No, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is MeO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂Me, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's MeO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂Me, but with a double bond between the central two carbons, making it MeO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂Me with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, but that would make it HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH with a double bond, which isn't possible because that would require four substituents on the double bond.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me try again. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So the correct structure is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the correct structure is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂s. So when esterified, it becomes MeO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂Me with the double bond in the trans configuration. So the structure is MeO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂Me with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it a trans configuration.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents on each side of the double bond are two methyl ester groups. So each CH₂ group is attached to a COOCH3. So the molecule is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester.

Now, can this molecule exhibit optical isomerism?

Well, the presence of a double bond doesn't necessarily mean the molecule is chiral. For a molecule with a double bond to be chiral, the substituents around the double bond should be arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry. So let's look at dimethyl fumarate. The structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's not correct. No, correct structure is that between the two COOCH3 groups, there's a double bond. So it's CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3), but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond in between. Wait, no, that's not the right way. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has the structure where the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond, making it a cis configuration, but wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. So in the trans configuration, the two substituents (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. Wait, that can't be right because some diastereomers can be chiral.

Wait, no. Let's think about it. If the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule would be symmetrical. So in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical groups. So each end is CH₂(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. So the substituents on each end are identical. Therefore, the molecule would have a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, that's not correct because, for example, in the case of 2-pentene, if it's (E), it's trans and each carbon has two identical substituents, so it's achiral. So in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two methyl ester groups (COOCH3). So each CH₂ group is the same on both ends. So the molecule would be symmetrical and not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so in the case of the ester, each end of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH3 (from the CH2). Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two ester groups. So the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
    ||
    CH₂–COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me imagine the structure. The double bond is between the two middle carbons. Each of those is attached to two CH₂ groups, each of which is attached to a COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two middle CH₂ groups. So the structure is COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 with a double bond between the two central CH₂ groups. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply four substituents on a carbon, which isn't possible. So perhaps it's COOCH3–CH₂–CH–CH₂–COOCH3, with double bond between the two CH groups. So it's CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So each CH₂ is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH₂. So the molecule would be symmetric around the double bond. So the substituents on each side are the same. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a moment. Am I confusing the structure with something else? I thought that some diesters of maleic acid can be chiral, but perhaps not. Let me think: in maleic anhydride, which is a bicyclic structure, it's not chiral. But maleic acid, as a cis-dioic acid, when esterified, can have a chiral center? No, because the two substituents on each end are the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the configurations. Let me think about dimethyl maleate. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, so its ester would have both ester groups on the same side of the double bond. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond, but with both ester groups on the same side. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the correct structure for dimethyl maleate is MeO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂Me, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups in the cis configuration. So each CH₂ is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try to imagine it correctly.

The structure of dimethyl maleate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3

But that's a very symmetric structure. So each CH₂ group is connected to the same groups on both sides, leading to a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate and dimethyl maleate are both not chiral because they have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps in some cases, the substituents around the double bond make the molecule chiral. For example, if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are different, then the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, the substituents are the same on each side, so it's not. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each substituent on the double bond is a CH₂ group attached to a COOCH3. So both sides are identical. Hence, the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about another example. For example, if you have a double bond with two different substituents on each carbon, like R and R' on each end, then it's possible to have E and Z configurations. But if R and R' are the same on both ends, then the E and Z would be the same as each other due to symmetry.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end are the same, so the molecule is symmetrical, and thus not chiral. Therefore, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I thought that when the substituents are the same, the molecule is not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate is not chiral, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possibility of allenes. Allene is a conjugated diene, but that's probably not relevant here.

So, putting it all together:

Option 1: I'm not sure yet. Let me think again. The molecule is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So it's a biphenyl structure with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So the substituents are nitro and ester on each ring.

The biphenyl group is connected at the 1 position, so the two benzene rings are attached at that point. The substituents at 2 and 2' are on each ring, which are adjacent to the connection point.

So, would this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, then the molecule is not chiral. But if they're arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule could be chiral.

In the case of 1,1'-biphenyl, the substituents on each ring can be in different positions, but in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. Are these groups arranged symmetrically? If the two rings have the same substituents in the same relative positions, then the molecule could be symmetrical. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. For each ring, the nitro is at 6, and the carboxylate is at 2. So the nitro is opposite the carboxylate on each ring. So each ring has substituents at opposite positions, leading to a symmetrical arrangement. Wait, but the two rings are connected at the 1 position. So if the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the 1 position, then the arrangement could be such that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents are all on the same face, the molecule might have chirality. Alternatively, if the substituents are on opposite faces, it might not. Without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it's a bit tricky. But I think that in this case, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. So option 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: the molecule has a center of symmetry. If there's a center where each atom has a corresponding mirror image, then the molecule is achiral. So if the substituents are arranged such that each ring's substituents mirror each other through the center, then the molecule is symmetrical. So perhaps in this case, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

So, to recap:

Option 1: Not chiral.

Option 2: Chiral (has a chiral center).

Option 3: Not chiral.

Option 4: Not chiral.

So the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is option 2. Wait, but the options given are:

Options:
A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. None of the other options do. So the correct answer would be where only option 2 is correct. Looking at the options, none of the options have only 2 correct. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

Hmm, so none of the options say only 2. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. The structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
    ||
    CH₂–COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me try to draw it properly.

The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 with a double bond, making it O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but with the double bond between the two CH₂ groups.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think of it another way. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So each substituent on the double bond is a CH₂(COOCH3). So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two middle CH₂ groups. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond. So each end is CH₂(COOCH3), and the double bond is in the middle.

In this case, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are CH₂(COOCH3) and H. Wait, no, perhaps each carbon is attached to two CH₂ groups. No, perhaps each carbon is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) and another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH₂(COOCH3))₂C=C.

No, that's not right because each carbon can only have two substituents with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two middle CH₂ groups. So each of those CH₂ groups is connected to a COOCH3.

In this case, the substituents on each end are the same, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, going back, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is option 2. But looking at the options, none of them have only option 2 correct. Wait, option A includes 1, 2, and 4. Option D includes 1 and 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 1.

Wait, perhaps option 1 is chiral. Let me think again. The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The two rings are connected at position 1.

So the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to each other. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group on adjacent carbons. Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the arrangement around the single bond connecting the two rings can lead to different isomers if the substituents are on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, in biphenyl systems, the substituents can be in the ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the connecting bond. In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other on each ring. Wait, no, the 2 and 6 positions on each ring are adjacent to the connecting bond (position 1), so 2 is adjacent to 1, and 6 is opposite to 1 on the ring.

So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 (adjacent) and 6 (opposite) relative to the connecting bond. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the two rings can rotate about the single bond connecting them. But in some cases, the substituents can be arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

Let me imagine the molecule: each ring has a nitro group opposite the connecting bond, and a carboxylate group adjacent to the connecting bond. So on each ring, the nitro is on the opposite side of the connecting bond, and the carboxylate is on the same side as the connecting bond.

If the two rings are arranged such that the substituents are on the same face, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they're on opposite faces, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but if the two rings are placed such that the substituents are on the same face, the molecule is symmetrical. If they're on opposite faces, it's asymmetrical and chiral.

So, does the biphenyl structure allow for such arrangements? Yes, because the rings can rotate freely unless hindered. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are on opposite sides of the ring. So when the rings are in a certain conformation, the substituents could be arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound. Wait, a meso compound has stereogenic centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

But in this case, the substituents are on a biphenyl, which is a single bond, so it's more about whether the entire structure has a plane of symmetry.

If the two rings are arranged such that the substituents are in a symmetrical fashion, then the molecule would be achiral. But if they're not, then it's chiral.

Hmm. I'm not entirely confident, but I think that in this case, the molecule may not be chiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Therefore, option 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, going back, only option 2 is correct. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2 correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is actually a meso compound. Wait, a meso compound has multiple stereogenic centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. Alternatively, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereogenic centers because the substituents are the same on each end.

Wait, another approach: Does the molecule have any stereogenic centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical substituents (CH₂(COOCH3)), so they can't be stereogenic centers. Therefore, the molecule isn't chiral.

So, putting it all together:

Only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake with option 4.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 4. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3), but with a double bond. No, that's not right. Let me think of it as (E)-MeO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂Me.

Wait, no. The correct structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond. Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond in the middle. So each CH₂ group is attached to a COOCH3. In this case, the substituents on each end are identical, so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral.

So, back to the conclusion: only option 2 is correct. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2 correct. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again. Suppose the structure is such that the substituents are arranged asymmetrically on the biphenyl. For example, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group, but their positions relative to each other on the biphenyl create a lack of symmetry.

If the two nitro groups are on opposite sides of the biphenyl, and the two carboxylate groups are on the same side, then the molecule might be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it's hard to say. Given the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are on opposite sides of each ring, perhaps the overall molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, option 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, the only correct answer is option 2. But the options don't have a choice with only option 2. So I must have made a mistake in evaluating one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 4. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3). Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think of it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3

But that's a symmetrical structure, so the molecule is achiral. So option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm. I'm stuck. According to my analysis, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think about the structure again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the substituents on each end of the double bond are on opposite sides. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure would look like:

COOCH3
|
CH2–C=C–CH2
|
COOCH3

But wait, that's not possible because each carbon in the double bond would have two substituents. So perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)–C=C–CH2(COOCH3)

But that's not correct because that would imply a four-carbon chain with a double bond, but each end has a CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider the possibility that option 4 is a diastereomer, but not chiral. So option 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, given that, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is option 2. But none of the options match that, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 1. Suppose the biphenyl structure has substituents arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically, making the entire molecule lack a plane of symmetry.

In such a case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry only if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. If they are not, the molecule would be chiral.

Given that option 1 has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, perhaps the arrangement leads to a chiral molecule. So, assuming that option 1 is chiral, then options 1 and 2 would both exhibit optical isomerism, making option D (1 and 2) the correct answer.

But earlier, I thought option 1 wasn't chiral. So perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine that each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. If the nitro is on one side and the carboxylate on the other, but the arrangement across the biphenyl is asymmetrical, then the molecule would be chiral.

In that case, option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if both options 1 and 2 are correct, then the answer would be option D.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option A, D, or another option. But according to my current analysis, options 1 and 2 are correct, so option D is the answer.

To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which requires a lack of internal symmetry and at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

### **Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1, with nitro groups at positions 6 and carboxylate ester groups at positions 2 on each ring. The substituents (nitro and carboxylate) are arranged symmetrically on the biphenyl structure. However, due to the flexibility of the single bond between the two benzene rings, the substituents can adopt different spatial arrangements. If the substituents are arranged asymmetrically (e.g., on opposite faces of the biphenyl), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and capable of exhibiting optical isomerism. Thus, this compound can show optical isomerism.

### **Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), a carbonyl group (-COOCH₃), and a hydrogen atom (-H). This makes the central carbon a chiral center. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### **Option 3: Benzophenone**

Benzophenone has the structure Ph-CO-Ph, where two benzene rings are connected by a carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical benzene rings. Since the carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and not a chiral center, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate**

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂(COOCH₃). The substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical (CH₂(COOCH₃)), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Option 1**: Exhibits optical isomerism due to potential asymmetry in the biphenyl structure.  
- **Option 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- **Option 3**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism as it is achiral.  
- **Option 4**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry.

The compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.
