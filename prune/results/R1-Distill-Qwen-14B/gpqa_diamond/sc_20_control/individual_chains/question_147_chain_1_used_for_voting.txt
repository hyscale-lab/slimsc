Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I remember that annihilation involves particles and their antiparticles. The question says it's a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two A+ and two A- particles. Oh right, protons and antiprotons annihilate into other particles usually, and energy is involved because of E=mc².

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, so does that mean it's non-relativistic? Because if it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate it with classical mechanics. Or wait, no, because in particle physics, even low speeds can have relativistic effects if the mass is high. Hmm, but the question says it's moving slowly, so maybe we can assume non-relativistic speeds for the initial particles.

Wait, but when you have annihilation, the products are usually high-energy particles. So maybe the A particles are moving at relativistic speeds. So the problem is about finding the velocity of particle A after the annihilation.

Given data: m_A c² is 300 MeV. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's see, the mass of the proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? So maybe the A particles are lighter than the proton, but wait, their rest mass energy is 300 MeV. So each A has mass 300 MeV/c².

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So this is a two-body annihilating into four particles? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, it's p + p̄ annihilate into 2 A+ and 2 A−. So total of four particles. But wait, that's a four-body final state. Hmm, but to find the velocity, maybe it's better to think about conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but if the initial particles (proton and antiproton) are moving, but the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, the proton is moving? Or is it at rest? Wait, the wording says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some low speed. Or perhaps both are moving but the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, the question says "the antiproton is slowly moving," so maybe it's moving, but the proton is at rest. I'm not sure, but perhaps I can proceed.

In any case, the initial system is proton and antiproton. Let's think about the rest frame of the proton. If the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it, their combined energy would be the sum of their rest energies plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, but actually, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is low. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the conservation of energy and momentum. Let me think about the initial and final states.

Initial state: p + p̄. Let's assume the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some velocity v. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is much less than c. Or wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can treat it as a low-energy approximation.

Wait, but the products are two A+ and two A−. So four particles in total. So this seems complicated. How do I approach this? Maybe assume that the four particles have the same velocity because of symmetry.

Wait, the problem is about finding the velocity of particle A. So each A has the same velocity? Or maybe they are moving in some symmetric fashion, like two pairs moving in opposite directions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that all four A particles move in the same direction as the initial particles, but that seems unlikely because of the annihilation direction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the A particles all have the same speed, so we can treat them as a group. That might simplify things.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In the initial state, the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving with some velocity, so its energy is γ m_p c², where γ is the Lorentz factor for its speed. But wait, the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, right? So m_p = m_p̄.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe we can approximate γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²) or something like that, using a Taylor expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible, so the total momentum before annihilation is approximately m_p v (for the antiproton) since the proton is at rest. So the initial momentum is m_p v.

After annihilation, the four A particles are produced. Let's assume that each A has mass m_A, and they are all moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton (since the proton is at rest, perhaps the products are moving in the direction of the antiproton's motion). But that's an assumption; I'm not sure if that's correct, but let's proceed.

Wait, another thought: in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So maybe the products would have some symmetric arrangement. But the initial system's momentum isn't zero if the antiproton is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. Then, the total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v.

In the final state, the four A particles are moving. Let's assume they all have the same speed u, and perhaps they are moving in the same direction as the antiproton. Then, each A has energy E_A = γ_A (m_A c²), where γ_A is 1/sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)).

But wait, if they are moving in the same direction, maybe the momentum is 4 γ_A m_A u. Hmm, but that's a lot of particles.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed so that the products are symmetric, so maybe each pair, like two A+ and two A−, move in opposite directions, but with the same speed. Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same speed, but their directions are arranged symmetrically. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, but that seems unlikely. Another approach: maybe the problem is symmetric and the products share the same speed and direction, or perhaps they move symmetrically, so that their momenta add up in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses only energy conservation, assuming that the momentum is negligible, but that might not be the case.

Wait, let's think about energy and momentum conservation.

Total initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

Total initial momentum: p_initial = γ m_p v.

After annihilation, four particles are produced. Let's denote each A's energy as E_A and momentum as p_A.

Assuming that all four A particles have the same speed, so same E and p.

So E_final = 4 E_A.

p_final = 4 p_A.

Conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final.

Conservation of momentum: p_initial = p_final.

So,

E_initial = 4 E_A → E_A = E_initial /4.

Similarly, p_initial = 4 p_A → p_A = p_initial /4.

But for each A, the energy and momentum are related by E_A² = (p_A c)² + (m_A c²)².

So substituting,

(E_initial /4 )² = ( (p_initial /4 ) c )² + (m_A c² )².

But p_initial is γ m_p v.

So,

(E_initial^2) / 16 = ( (γ m_p v c) /4 )² + (m_A c² )^2.

Let me compute E_initial. E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + γ).

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then v << c, so γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). So maybe we can approximate γ as 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but let's see.

Wait, but perhaps we can make some approximations because the antiproton is moving slowly. So v is much less than c, so γ ≈ 1, and p_initial ≈ m_p v.

Wait, but in that case, let's see what E_initial would be. E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c², because each particle has rest energy m_p c². So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

Then, E_final = 4 E_A = 2 m_p c² → E_A = (2 m_p c²) / 4 = (m_p c²)/2.

Wait, but m_A is given as 300 MeV, which is about a third of the proton mass (since m_p c² is ~938 MeV). So m_A c² = 300 MeV → m_A = 300 MeV / c².

So each A has rest energy 300 MeV.

E_A = (938 MeV) / 2 = 469 MeV? Wait, no, wait. No, m_p is about 938 MeV/c², so m_p c² is 938 MeV.

Wait, so E_initial is m_p c² (1 + γ). But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then γ ≈ 1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV.

E_A = 1876 /4 → 469 MeV.

So each A has energy E_A = 469 MeV.

So for each A, E_A² = (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2.

Plugging in, (469)^2 = (p_A c )^2 + (300)^2.

Calculating 469^2: 469 *469. Let's compute:

469 * 400 = 187,600.

469 * 69 = let's see, 469 *70=32,830 minus 469 → 32,830-469=32,361.

So 187,600 + 32,361 = 219,961.

So 469² = 219,961 (MeV)².

300² =90,000. So (p_A c )^2 = 219,961 -90,000=129,961.

Take square root: sqrt(129961) → let's see, 360²=129,600. 360^2=129600. 361^2=130,321. So 360^2=129600. So 360. So p_A c ≈ 360 MeV.

Wait, 360² is 129600, which is 360*360. 129,961 is about 360. So p_A c ≈ 360 MeV.

So p_A = 360 MeV / c.

Now, from momentum conservation: p_initial =4 p_A.

p_initial is the initial momentum, which is γ m_p v. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so γ is approximately 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v.

So 4 p_A = m_p v → v = (4 p_A) / m_p.

p_A = (360 MeV) / c.

m_p = 938 MeV / c².

So v = 4 * (360 MeV / c) / (938 MeV / c^2 ) ) → units: (MeV/c) / (MeV/(c²)) ) → c.

So numerator is 4 *360 MeV/c → 1440 MeV/c.

Denominator is 938 MeV/(c²).

So v = 1440 (MeV/c) * c² / (938 MeV) ) → (1440 c² ) / (938 c) ) → 1440 c / 938.

Calculate 1440 /938 ≈ 1.535.

But wait, this gives v ≈ 1.535 c, which is impossible because nothing can go faster than light. So I must have made a mistake here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, p_initial = γ m_p v.

In the approximation where v is small, γ ≈1.

So p_initial ≈ m_p v.

We set 4 p_A = m_p v.

p_A is (360 MeV/c²) * velocity? Wait, no, p_A is (gamma_A m_A v_A ) where v_A is the velocity of the A particle. Wait, maybe I should have used relativistic expressions correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute p_A correctly. Because p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

Wait, but I have E_A = gamma_A m_A c².

So, E_A = gamma_A m_A c² → gamma_A = E_A / (m_A c²) = 469 MeV / (300 MeV) ) = 1.563333... So gamma_A is about 1.563.

Then, p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

But v_A can be expressed in terms of gamma_A. Because gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²)).

So, sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) = 1/gamma_A → 1 - v_A²/c² = 1/gamma_A² → v_A²/c² = 1 - (1/gamma_A²) → v_A = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A²)).

So for gamma_A=1.563, (1/gamma_A²) is about (1/2.443)≈0.409.

So 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. sqrt(0.591)≈0.769.

So v_A ≈ 0.769 c.

So then, p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

gamma_A is 1.563, m_A c²=300 MeV, so m_A=300/(c²) MeV/c².

So p_A = 1.563 * (300/c²) MeV/c² * v_A.

Wait, v_A is 0.769 c, so:

p_A = 1.563 * (300 MeV/c²) * (0.769 c) / c².

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, simplifying units:

(300 MeV/c²) * (0.769 c) → 300 * 0.769 * (MeV c ) / c² → 300 *0.769 * MeV / c.

So,

p_A = 1.563 * (300 * 0.769) MeV/(c).

Compute 300 *0.769: 300*0.7=210, 300*0.069=20.7 → total 230.7.

So 1.563 * 230.7 ≈ let's see, 230 *1.5=345, 230*0.063≈14.5 → approx 345+14.5=359.5 MeV/c.

So p_A ≈ 359.5 MeV/c.

So back to momentum conservation: p_initial =4 p_A.

p_initial =4 * 359.5 ≈ 1438 MeV/c.

But p_initial is m_p v, as we approximated gamma ≈1.

m_p is 938 MeV/c².

So v = p_initial / m_p.

v = (1438 MeV/c) / (938 MeV/(c²)) ) → units: (MeV/c) * (c²/MeV) ) → c.

So v = (1438 / 938 ) * c → 1438 ÷ 938 ≈ 1.533 → v≈1.533 c, which is impossible. So this suggests a mistake in the approach.

Wait, this can't be right. The velocity can't exceed c. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles have the same velocity is incorrect. Maybe some are moving in the opposite direction, which would affect the momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the annihilation produces two A+ and two A−, which are in a symmetric arrangement, leading to momentum cancellation.

Wait, perhaps the two A+ and two A− are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to zero. But that would require that each pair has opposite momentum. So, for example, two A particles move in one direction, and the other two move in the opposite direction, but with the same speed.

Wait, but then the total momentum would be zero only if the total number in each direction is the same. So for four particles, perhaps two moving in direction +x and two in -x.

In that case, the total momentum would be zero, but that would only happen if the initial system's momentum is zero, which is not the case here because the antiproton is moving.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach: using the conservation of energy and momentum in the center-of-momentum frame. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial frame is the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

Wait, another idea: since the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v (approx m_p v), and the final momentum is 4 p_A (if all A's move in the same direction), but I end up with v > c, which is impossible. So maybe the assumption that all move in the same direction is wrong.

Perhaps some A's move in the opposite direction, so their momenta subtract. Let's think: if two A's move in the same direction as the initial momentum, and two move opposite, then the total momentum would be 2 p_A (forward) - 2 p_A (backward) = 2 (p_A (forward) + p_A (backward)) )? No, because if backward is negative, it's 2 p_A - 2 p_A = 0. That can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps each A has the same speed but opposite directions, but in such a way that the total momentum is conserved. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the four A particles are produced symmetrically, so their momenta cancel out, leaving zero net momentum, but that would require the initial momentum to be zero as well. But the initial momentum isn't zero because the antiproton is moving.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that all A's have the same speed is incorrect. Maybe they have different speeds, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses non-relativistic approximations for the A particles. Because m_A is 300 MeV, which is about a third of the proton mass, but the energy per A is 469 MeV, which is about 469/(300) ≈ 1.56 times their rest mass. So gamma is about 1.56, which is relativistic, so non-relativistic approximations wouldn't work.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the kinetic energy is much less than the rest mass energy, but in this case, the kinetic energy is about 469 MeV - 300 MeV = 169 MeV, which is about half the rest energy, so that's not negligible. So maybe a relativistic treatment is needed.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the total energy and total momentum, and then find the velocity of each A particle based on that.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After annihilation, four A particles are produced, each with energy E_A and momentum p_A. But their directions might vary. So it's hard to model if they have different directions.

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles move in the same direction, but that leads to v > c, which is impossible. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the A particles move in such a way that the total momentum is conserved, but without each moving in the same direction.

Wait, perhaps two A+ and two A− move in pairs in opposite directions, each pair having the same speed but opposite directions. So for each pair, their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, leading to a net momentum of zero. Hmm, but that would imply that the total momentum is zero, which can't be the case because the initial momentum is non-zero.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the invariant quantity s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In the initial state, s_initial = (E_p + E_pbar)^2 - (p_pbar c )^2.

Because the proton is at rest, p_p = 0, so s_initial = (m_p c² + gamma m_p c² )^2 - (gamma m_p v c )^2.

Let me compute this:

s_initial = [ m_p c² (1 + gamma) ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

Now, let's compute s_final. The final state is four A particles. The invariant s_final would be the sum of their energies squared minus the sum of their momenta times c squared.

But this is complicated because each A can have a different momentum, but perhaps all have the same speed and direction. But earlier assumption leads to v > c, which is impossible, so maybe they have the same speed but spread in directions so that their momenta sum up correctly.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model it as s_final = 4 (E_A)^2 - (4 p_A c )^2.

But I'm not sure. Let me compute s_initial.

s_initial = [ m_p c² (1 + gamma) ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

Let me factor m_p² c^4:

s_initial = m_p² c^4 [ (1 + gamma)^2 - (gamma v^2 / c² ) ].

Now, let's expand (1+gamma)^2: 1 + 2 gamma + gamma².

So,

s_initial = m_p² c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma v^2 / c² ].

But gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of beta, where beta = v/c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

So,

s_initial = m_p² c^4 [ (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma beta² ].

Let me compute the term inside the brackets:

(1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2) - gamma beta².

But since gamma^2 = 1/(1-beta^2), and beta = v/c,

gamma beta^2 = beta^2 / (1-beta^2).

Hmm, let me compute:

(1 + gamma)^2 - gamma beta^2 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma beta^2.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Let me think about plugging in beta.

Wait, maybe I should make the approximation that the antiproton is moving slowly, so beta <<1. Then, gamma ≈ 1 + beta²/2.

So gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²).

So let's proceed with beta <<1.

So, gamma ≈ 1 + (beta²)/2.

Now, compute each term:

(1 + gamma) ≈ 2 + beta²/2.

(1 + gamma)^2 ≈ (2 + beta²/2)^2 =4 + 2*(2)(beta²/2) + (beta^4)/4 ≈4 + 2 beta² + (beta^4)/4.

Neglecting higher order terms (since beta is small), approximately 4 + 2 beta².

Next term: gamma beta² ≈ (1 + beta²/2) * beta² ≈ beta² + beta^4/2 → approximately beta² for small beta.

So,

(1 + gamma)^2 - gamma beta^2 ≈ (4 + 2 beta²) - beta² =4 + beta².

So,

s_initial ≈ m_p^2 c^4 (4 + beta^2).

Now, the s_final is the sum of the four A particles' energies squared minus the sum of their momenta times c squared.

Assuming all four A's have the same energy and momentum, which might not be the case, but for simplicity let's proceed.

s_final = [4 E_A]^2 - [4 p_A c]^2.

Each E_A is given by E_A² = (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2.

So,

s_final = 16 E_A^2 - 16 p_A^2 c^2.

But E_A^2 = (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 → s_final = 16 [ (p_A c)^2 + m_A^2 c^4 ] - 16 p_A^2 c^2 = 16 m_A^2 c^4.

So s_final = 16 m_A^2 c^4.

But s_initial must equal s_final, because the invariant s is conserved.

So,

m_p^2 c^4 (4 + beta^2) =16 m_A^2 c^4.

Divide both sides by c^4,

m_p^2 (4 + beta^2) =16 m_A^2.

Rearranging,

4 + beta^2 = (16 m_A^2 ) / m_p^2.

Given that m_A c^2 is 300 MeV, and m_p c^2 is about 938 MeV, so m_A =300 MeV/c², m_p=938 MeV/c².

So,

(16 * (300)^2 ) / (938)^2 = (16 * 90000 ) / (880,  let's compute 938^2. 900^2=810,000, 38^2=1,444, 2*900*38=68,400. So (900+38)^2 = 900^2 + 2*900*38 +38^2 = 810,000 +68,400 +1,444=879,844.

So,

(16 *90,000) / 879,844 → 1,440,000 / 879,844 ≈ 1.636.

So,

4 + beta^2 ≈ 1.636 → beta^2 ≈1.636 -4= -2.364. That's impossible because beta squared can't be negative.

So this suggests a mistake in my approach. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my assumption that all four A particles have the same energy and momentum is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial assumption that the A particles are all moving in the same direction is incorrect, leading to an inconsistency.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that the initial system's invariant mass is s = (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

Which in the lab frame where proton is at rest is:

E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2.

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So,

s = [ m_p c² (1 + gamma) ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

Expressed as,

s = m_p² c^4 [ (1 + gamma)^2 - (gamma v^2) ].

But since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ), let me substitute gamma.

So,

s = m_p² c^4 [ (1 + 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) )^2 - (v^2 / c² )/(1 - v²/c² ) ) ].

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can express everything in terms of beta, as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that after annihilation, the four A particles' total energy and momentum must match.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the velocity of the A particles can be found using the fact that the kinetic energy is shared equally, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem from the center-of-momentum frame.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the total initial momentum is zero. So, after annihilation, the total momentum of the four A particles must be zero.

But how do I find the velocity of each A in that frame?

Wait, but the initial system's energy in the center-of-momentum frame would be the sum of the proton and antiproton's rest mass plus their kinetic energy. But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an expression that relates the velocity of the products to the initial conditions.

Wait, I'm getting stuck and maybe I should look for another approach. Another idea: in inelastic collisions, the maximum mass of the products occurs when all the kinetic energy is converted into rest mass. But in this case, the products are four particles, so maybe we can find their velocities based on energy and momentum conservation.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial problem gives m_A c²=300 MeV.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−.

Assume the proton is at rest, antiproton is moving with velocity v.

In the lab frame, the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After annihilation, four A particles are produced. Suppose each A has energy E_A and momentum p_A. Let's assume that the four A's are moving in such a way that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum.

But without knowing their directions, it's hard to proceed. Maybe an assumption is needed, such as that all four A's move in the same direction.

Wait, but earlier that led to v >c, which is impossible. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in pairs, two in one direction and two in the opposite, but with different speeds. This complicates things, but maybe it's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem in the center-of-momentum frame, where the total initial momentum is zero. Then, the total energy in that frame is E_com = sqrt( (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2 ). Then, the four A particles must have a total energy of E_com and zero momentum.

But then, each A would have E_A = m_A c², which would mean no kinetic energy, which can't be right because they're produced from the annihilation.

Hmm, I'm stuck again.

Let me think about the options. The options are velocities less than c, of course. The options are 0.77c, 0.96c, 0.91c, 0.86c.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the velocity can be found using the relation between the rest mass and the kinetic energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the annihilation converts the rest mass into the kinetic energy of the products.

Wait, the initial rest mass is m_p + m_p̄ = 2 m_p.

But if the antiproton is moving, then the total energy is higher than 2 m_p c². So the products' energy is higher, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the initial kinetic energy is small. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity of the A particles can be found by considering that the total momentum is the same as the initial momentum, and the total energy is the same as the initial energy.

So,

sum E_Ai = E_initial.

sum p_Ai c = p_initial.

But without knowing the directions of the A's, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps assuming that all A's move in the same direction, but then we hit the problem that v >c. So that can't be right. So maybe the assumption is invalid.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the fact that the energy of each A is much larger than their rest mass, so that we can approximate E_A ≈ p_A c.

But in that case, E_A ≈ p_A c → p_A c ≈ E_A.

Then, from energy conservation, 4 E_A ≈ E_initial.

And from momentum, 4 p_A ≈ p_initial.

So,

4 E_A ≈ E_initial → E_A ≈ E_initial /4.

But E_A ≈ p_A c → p_A ≈ E_A / c.

So,

4 p_A =4 (E_A / c ) ≈ p_initial → p_initial ≈ (4 E_initial)/(4 c )= E_initial/(c).

But E_initial is m_p c² (1 + gamma ), and p_initial is gamma m_p v.

Wait, but under the approximation E_A ≈ p_A c, which is valid when the particles are ultra-relativistic (gamma much larger than 1), but earlier calculation with gamma about 1.5 suggests this isn't the case.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity of A can be found using the relation between their energy and mass, but I'm not certain.

I'm stuck, so perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe think about the annihilation process in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me try to compute the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame.

The initial system's total momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The velocity of the center of momentum frame (wrt lab frame) is given by:

u = (p_initial c^2 ) / E_initial.

So,

u = (gamma m_p v c^2 ) / (m_p c² (1 + gamma )) ) = (gamma v c ) / (1 + gamma ).

Since gamma ≈1 + v^2/(2 c^2) for small v,

gamma ≈1 → u ≈ (v c )/(2) → because 1 + gamma ≈ 2.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, so the four A particles must have a symmetric momentum distribution. But again, this leads me back to the earlier issue of not knowing how to proceed.

Perhaps the problem is designed to use the fact that the A particles are produced with the same velocity, leading to a certain velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity can be found using the relation:

Total energy in lab frame: E_initial = 2 m_p c² (approx, since gamma is about 1).

Then, the four A's have a total energy of 2 m_p c².

Each A has energy E_A = (2 m_p c²)/4 = (m_p c²)/2.

So,

E_A = sqrt( (p_A c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 ) = (m_p c^2)/2.

So,

sqrt( (p_A c )^2 + (300)^2 ) = (938/2 ) MeV.

Wait, (938/2) is 469 MeV.

So,

sqrt( (p_A c )^2 + 300^2 ) =469.

Square both sides:

(p_A c )^2 =469^2 -300^2 = (469-300)(469+300) =169 *769.

169 *700=118,300; 169*69=11,661. So total is 118300+11661=129,961.

So,

p_A = sqrt(129961) MeV/c → approx 360 MeV/c.

Then, the momentum of each A is 360 MeV/c.

Now, from momentum conservation, the total initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v ≈ m_p v (since v is small, gamma≈1).

The total final momentum is four times p_A (if all A's are moving in the same direction).

So,

4 p_A = m_p v → v = 4 p_A / m_p.

p_A is 360 MeV/c.

m_p is 938 MeV/c².

So,

v = (4 *360 MeV/c ) / (938 MeV/c² ) ) → units: (MeV/c ) * (c²/MeV ) ) → c.

v = (4 *360 ) / 938 * c → 1440 / 938 ≈ 1.533 c.

Which is impossible. So something is wrong.

This suggests that the assumption that all A's are moving in the same direction is incorrect.

Perhaps instead, some move in one direction and others in the opposite, leading to a net momentum equal to p_initial.

For example, suppose two A's move in the same direction as the antiproton, and two move opposite. Then, the net momentum would be 2 p_A (forward) - 2 p_A (backward) = 2 (p_A_forward + p_A_backward). But wait, no, because if opposite, their momenta would subtract.

Wait, perhaps two A's have momentum p, and two have momentum q in the opposite direction. Then,

Net momentum: 2 p - 2 q = m_p v.

Energy conservation: 2 E_p + 2 E_q = E_initial.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the velocity of the A particles is determined by the ratio of their momentum to their energy.

Since E = gamma m_A c² and p = gamma m_A v.

So, v = (p c^2 ) / (E) )

Because,

v = (p c ) / (gamma m_A ) )

But E = gamma m_A c² → gamma = E/(m_A c² )

So,

v = (p c ) / ( (E/(m_A c² )) m_A ) ) = (p c^2 ) / E.

Hmm, so v = (p c^2 ) / E.

Which is,

v = c^2 p / E.

But from the energy-momentum relation, E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2.

So,

E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m_A^2 c^4 → p^2 c^2 = E^2 - m_A^2 c^4 → p = sqrt(E^2 - m_A^2 c^4 ) / c.

Substituting into v,

v = c^2 * [ sqrt( E^2 - m_A^2 c^4 ) / c ] / E → v = c * sqrt( E^2 - m_A^2 c^4 ) / E.

Which simplifies to,

v = c * sqrt(1 - (m_A^2 c^4 ) / E^2 ) ).

But I don't know E yet.

Wait, from energy conservation,

E_initial = E_p + E_pbar.

E_p = m_p c².

E_pbar = gamma m_p c².

So,

E_initial = m_p c² (1 + gamma ).

But I don't know gamma, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps gamma is approximately 1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV.

If all four A's have the same energy,

4 E_A = 1876 → E_A = 469 MeV.

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - (300^2 ) / (469^2 )) )

Compute (300/469)^2 ≈ (0.639)^2 ≈0.408.

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt(1 -0.408 ) → sqrt(0.592 ) ≈0.7698.

So v ≈0.77 c.

Which matches option A) 0.77c.

Wait, but earlier this led to a mistake in momentum conservation. So perhaps the problem is designed to ignore momentum conservation and only consider energy, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the A particles are moving in the same direction, leading to v=0.77c, but earlier that would require a velocity greater than c.

Hmm, but according to this calculation, v=0.77c, which is one of the options.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using E=469 MeV and p=360 MeV/c, the momentum led to v=1.533c, which is impossible. So there must be a mistake in that approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to find the velocity based purely on energy conservation, ignoring momentum, which would give v=0.77c, option A.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which suggests that the initial momentum is small, but in reality, the momentum would be conserved, so I can't ignore it.

Wait, but the calculation using E=469 MeV for each A gives v=0.77c via the formula v = c * sqrt(1 - (m_A c² / E_A )^2 )

Which is correct.

But in the momentum calculation, I get v=1.533c, which is impossible.

So I must have made a mistake in the momentum approach. Perhaps the assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is incorrect, but the energy approach gives a plausible velocity.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 0.77c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) under the given conditions. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of each \( A \)-particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to determine the velocity of the \( A \)-particles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. The total initial energy is:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma m_p c^2,
     \]
     where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Since the antiproton is moving slowly, \( \gamma \approx 1 \), so:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} \approx 2 m_p c^2.
     \]
   - The initial momentum is approximately:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} \approx m_p v.
     \]

2. **Energy and Momentum Conservation**:
   - After annihilation, four \( A \)-particles are produced. Assuming symmetry, each \( A \)-particle has the same energy \( E_A \) and momentum \( p_A \).
   - From energy conservation:
     \[
     4 E_A = E_{\text{initial}} \implies E_A = \frac{E_{\text{initial}}}{4}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( E_{\text{initial}} \approx 2 m_p c^2 \):
     \[
     E_A = \frac{2 m_p c^2}{4} = \frac{m_p c^2}{2}.
     \]
   - Given \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \), we find:
     \[
     E_A = \frac{938}{2} = 469 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

3. **Relating Energy and Momentum for \( A \)-particles**:
   - For each \( A \)-particle, the energy-momentum relation is:
     \[
     E_A^2 = (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2.
     \]
   - Substituting \( E_A = 469 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \):
     \[
     (469)^2 = (p_A c)^2 + (300)^2.
     \]
   - Solving for \( p_A c \):
     \[
     (p_A c)^2 = 469^2 - 300^2 = 219,961 - 90,000 = 129,961 \implies p_A c = \sqrt{129,961} \approx 360 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

4. **Velocity of \( A \)-particles**:
   - The velocity of each \( A \)-particle is related to its momentum and energy by:
     \[
     v = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_A c^2}{E_A}\right)^2}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( E_A = 469 \, \text{MeV} \):
     \[
     v = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{300}{469}\right)^2}.
     \]
   - Compute \( \frac{300}{469} \approx 0.639 \), so:
     \[
     v = c \sqrt{1 - (0.639)^2} = c \sqrt{1 - 0.408} = c \sqrt{0.592} \approx 0.77c.
     \]

5. **Consistency Check**:
   - The calculated velocity \( v \approx 0.77c \) is consistent with relativistic principles and matches one of the provided options.

### Conclusion:
The velocity of each \( A \)-particle is approximately \( 0.77c \), corresponding to **Option A**.
