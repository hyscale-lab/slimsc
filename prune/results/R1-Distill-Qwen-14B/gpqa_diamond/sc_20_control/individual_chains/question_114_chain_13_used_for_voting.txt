Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, each involving a reaction. I need to find the correct reagents A and B from the given options. Let me break it down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably via some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, no, wait—NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Oh, right! This could be a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group.

So, the carbonyl (C=O) in the ketone would react with CN-. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When CN- adds to the carbonyl, it would form a cyanohydrin. So the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. That makes sense because the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. 

But how does that happen? I think the mechanism is that the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets a negative charge. Then, maybe some acid is added to protonate the oxygen so that it can leave as water. So the reagent A is probably an acid because after the addition, you need to protonate the intermediate to get the OH group.

Wait, what's the typical reagent for forming cyanohydrins? I remember that HCN is used, but in this case, it's NaCN and a proton source. Because in the reaction, NaCN provides the cyanide ion, and then a strong acid like H3O+ (which is option A or B) might be used to protonate the intermediate. So for the first part, A is H3O+.

Wait, but another thought—could it be something else? Like, perhaps HCN itself is used, but the question gives NaCN as one of the reagents. So, the acid would come from the other reagent. So in the first reaction, A is H3O+ because it's the acid needed to protonate the oxygen after the nucleophilic attack.

So looking at options, the first part is A, and the options have either H3O+ or NaHSO3 for A. NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which is a weaker acid than H3O+. So which one is correct?

Wait, but the reaction of ketones with HCN (or CN-) in acidic conditions typically uses a protic acid. So for the formation of cyanohydrin, I think we need an acid catalyst. So A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (and H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is turning into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles involves either strong acidic or basic conditions. But in this case, the reagent B is used along with water. So what conditions are needed?

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group in the same carbon. Let's see: 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is R-CN, and the same carbon has an -OH group.

Hydrolysis of nitriles usually involves adding water, so maybe B is a strong acid like HCl or something else. Let me think: nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically uses either H2SO4 (concentrated) and heat, or sometimes using a catalyst like HgSO4 in acidic conditions. Alternatively, under basic conditions, nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylates, which are then acidified.

Wait, but in this reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid. So what's the hydrolysis condition? I think in acidic conditions, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, perhaps with a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis using a strong acid.

Looking at the options, B can be HCl or CH3COOH. HCl is a strong acid, CH3COOH is a weak acid.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another approach: the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which requires an acidic workup. So for that, A is H3O+.

The second reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. So the reagent should be an acid. Let's think about the typical conditions for nitrile hydrolysis. For example, in the presence of H2O and H+ (like HCl), the nitrile would hydrolyze. So, maybe B is HCl.

Wait, but what if the reaction uses a mild acid? Alternatively, sometimes, when you have a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol group, maybe there's some steric hindrance, but I'm not sure if that affects the reagent choice.

So, looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option B has B as acetic acid. Which is correct?

Wait, another thought: The nitrile group is R-CN. To make it into R-COOH, the hydrolysis typically involves adding water and acid. For example, using HCl (a strong acid) in aqueous conditions. Alternatively, sometimes H2SO4 is used as the acid. So, if B is HCl, that would make sense.

So, putting it together:

First reaction: A is H3O+.

Second reaction: B is HCl.

Looking at the options, which option has A as H3O+ and B as HCl? Let me check the options.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. That matches. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait another thought. The second reaction's product is a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is using a base, but that would give a carboxylate, which would then need to be acidified. But the reagent is B, which is H2O and B. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis in acidic conditions.

Wait, another possibility: The second reaction is a hydrolysis of nitrile to a ketone? No, because the product is a carboxylic acid. So, nitrile → carboxylic acid.

So, nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions (like with HCl) would produce the carboxylic acid.

So, I think option A is correct: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Wait, but the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So option A is a possible choice. But wait, I should confirm if the first reaction uses H3O+ as a reagent.

Wait, but in the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and A to form the cyanohydrin. The conditions for cyanohydrin formation are usually HCN in a protic acid, like H2SO4 or HCl. Alternatively, sometimes, using a base, but that's more for the formation of the disubstituted cyanohydrin.

Wait, but in the presence of NaCN, which provides CN- ions, the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So the acid (H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, and then the CN- attacks.

So yes, A is H3O+.

Thus, option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) is correct. So the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents A and B from the given options.

### Reaction 1: 
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs when a nitrile ion (CN⁻) reacts with a ketone in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing CN⁻ to attack. After the nucleophilic addition, the intermediate is protonated to yield the final product. Based on this, **A = H₃O⁺** is the correct reagent for this reaction.

### Reaction 2: 
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
In this reaction, a nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic conditions. Among the options, **B = HCl** is the most suitable reagent, as it provides the acidic environment necessary for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Conclusion: 
From the analysis, the correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
