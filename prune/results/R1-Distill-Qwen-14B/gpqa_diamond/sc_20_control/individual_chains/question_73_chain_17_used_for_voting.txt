Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, regular addition doesn't work because of relativistic effects. I think the correct way to add velocities is by using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). But wait, in this case, are both astronauts moving in the same direction? The question says positive x-direction, so yes, same direction.

Wait, but wait. Are we looking for the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame? Or maybe the speed of each relative to the other? Or, perhaps, the speed of the system's center of momentum frame? Hmm, the question says 'relative speed' but doesn't specify. Oh, probably the relative speed between them as seen by one of them.

Let me clarify: the problem states that the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or vice versa. Hmm, since they're moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait no. Because in relativity, velocities don't just subtract directly. So astronaut A would see B moving at (0.6c -0.5c) = 0.1c, but that's only in the non-relativistic case. But since both are moving at significant fractions of c, I can't use that. So I must apply the relativistic formula.

Wait, no, wait. The formula applies when you have two frames moving relative to each other. For example, if frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S, and an object is moving at v in S, then in S' it's (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in this case, if astronaut A is at rest in his own frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as astronaut A's motion (from the lab frame), wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, perhaps the lab frame is where both are moving, and I need to find the relative speed between them. Let me think: Let's say the lab frame is S, and astronaut A is moving at u=0.6c, astronaut B at v=0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Because in A's frame, A is at rest, and B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, u is the speed of A in S. So in S, B's speed is 0.5c. So from A's frame, the speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. So I can write that as -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. So the magnitude is approximately 0.143c, so about 0.14c.

Wait, but since the negative sign indicates direction, but the question is about the relative speed, they probably just care about the magnitude. So the relative speed is 0.14c, which matches one of the options.

Wait, but another thought: the problem says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." So the relative speed is between them, but regarding the total energy, I think it's the sum of their relativistic energies.

So each astronaut's energy (from the lab frame) is their rest mass energy multiplied by the gamma factor. Wait, but the problem states the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So the energies would be gamma * m c² each. Wait, but their rest mass is 2m and 3m.

Wait, so for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for A: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A is 2m * c² * gamma = 2m * c² * 1.25 = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for B: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) )= 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy of B is 3m * c² * 1.1547 ≈ 3 * 1.1547 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy is 2.5 + 3.464 = approx 5.964 m c². Rounding that, about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait another thing: could the total energy be calculated in another frame, like the center-of-momentum frame? Or is it just the sum of their energies in the lab frame?

The question says 'the total energy of the system.' In relativity, the total energy is frame-dependent. But the options seem to present the energy in the same frame as the velocities given. Because the velocities given are in the same lab frame, so the total energy would be the sum of their energies in that frame.

So the calculation I did earlier applies. So the energy would be 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

So the answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
Mass = \(2m\), Speed = \(0.6c\). Calculate \(\gamma_A\):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Energy of A:

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
Mass = \(3m\), Speed = \(0.5c\). Calculate \(\gamma_B\):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy of B:

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Match with Options
From the calculations:
- Relative speed: \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\)
- Total energy: \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\)

This matches **Option C**.

Wait, no, wait. The formula applies when you have two frames moving relative to each other. For example, if frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S, and an object is moving at v in S, then in S' it's (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in this case, if astronaut A is at rest in his own frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as astronaut A's motion (from the lab frame), wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, u is the speed of A in S. So in S, B's speed is 0.5c. So from A's frame, the speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. So I can write that as -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. So the magnitude is approximately 0.143c, so about 0.14c.

Wait, so for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for A: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A is 2m * c² * gamma = 2m * c² * 1.25 = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for B: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) )= 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy of B is 3m * c² * 1.1547 ≈ 3 * 1.1547 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy is 2.5 + 3.464 = approx 5.964 m c². Rounding that, about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
Mass = \(2m\), Speed = \(0.6c\). Calculate \(\gamma_A\):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Energy of A:

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
Mass = \(3m\), Speed = \(0.5c\). Calculate \(\gamma_B\):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy of B:

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Match with Options
From the calculations:
- Relative speed: \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\)
- Total energy: \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\)

This matches **Option C**.
