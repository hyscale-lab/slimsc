Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it. Let me read the question again.

So, two planets are orbiting a star, and both have been detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits. 

The problem mentions some Doppler shifts: Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. But the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Since they have the same albedo, that factor cancels out, I think.

Wait, so the key variables are the star's temperature, the planet's orbital distance, and the star's radius. But wait, the albedo is the same, so the equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

So I need to find T_eq for each planet and then take the ratio.

But wait, how do I find the orbital distances a for each planet? The problem gives the Doppler shifts. Oh, right, the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital distance.

The formula for K is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (1 year in seconds)) * something... Wait, maybe it's easier to remember that for circular orbits, e=0, and the semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i)/(M_earth) ) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) / ( (P/yr) )^(1/3) )

But since the problem gives the Doppler shifts in terms of wavelength shifts, which relate to velocity via the Doppler formula. The shift in wavelength λ is related to velocity v by v = c * (λ/λ0 - 1) / (1 + λ/λ0) approximately, but for small shifts, it's approximately v ≈ c * (Δλ/λ0). Let me think: the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So the shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So:

v1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) 
v2 = c * (0.04 / 6300)

Wait, but the Doppler shift from the star's perspective is the same as the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. So the semi-amplitude K is equal to v1 and v2 for each planet. Because the RV method measures the star's velocity.

So K1 = v1 = c * Δλ1 / λ0
Similarly, K2 = v2 = c * Δλ2 / λ0

Since the star's velocity is K = v, then for each planet, their K is given.

But K is also related to the planet's mass and the orbital period and distance. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )

Wait, maybe it's better to use the relation:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( P^(1/3) )) ) ... Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Oh wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^{2/3} ) ) ] * ( (1 / (P^{1/3} )) ) * ( (1 / ( (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) )) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so 1/(1-e²)^½ is 1. Also, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p / M_earth) * ( (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But wait, what's P? It's the orbital period. But I don't know P yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to a^3 / (M_star + M_p). Since M_p is much smaller, it's approximately (a^3) / (M_star). So P² = (4π² a^3)/(G(M_star + M_p)) ≈ (4π² a^3)/(G M_star )

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe find the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2, and then relate that to the ratio of their orbital distances.

Wait, the problem gives the Doppler shifts for each planet. So for each, K1 = (c * Δλ1)/λ0 and K2 = (c * Δλ2)/λ0.

Wait, because the forbidden line is at 6300 Å, so λ0 is 6300 Å. So for Planet1, Δλ = 0.03 Å. So K1 = c * (0.03/6300). Similarly, K2 = c * (0.04/6300).

So K1/K2 = (0.03)/(0.04) = 3/4 = 0.75.

So K1 = 0.75 K2.

But K is also proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) or something like that. Maybe another approach: since K ~ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) a^(1/2) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the formula for K can be written as:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( (1-e^2 )^(1/2) )) ) * 2π / (c * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )) ... Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, from another approach, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1) * (1 / ( (2π G )^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )) )

Wait, no. Let me try to find the relation between K and a.

The formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_earth) ) ] * [ (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ] * [ (P / yr )^(-1/3) ) ] / ( (1 - e² )^(1/2) )

Assuming e=0 and sin i ≈ 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for transit method), so:

K ≈ 27.4 * (M_p/ M_earth) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) * (P / yr )^(-1/3 )

But I don't know P for each planet. Hmm.

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² a³) / (G (M_star + M_p)) )

Again, M_p << M_star, so P² ≈ (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So P = [ (4π² a³) / (G M_star) ) ]^(1/2 )

Wait, substituting that into K:

K ≈ 27.4 * (M_p / M_earth) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) * [ ( (4π² a^3 / (G M_star )) )^(-1/6) ) ]

Wait, because P is in years, so I think I need to express P in a compatible unit. Maybe it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of a1 and a2 (the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2) because the ratio of K is known.

So K1/K2 = ( (M_p1)/(M_p2) ) * ( (a2)/(a1) )^(1/2) ) * ( (M_star + M_p2) / (M_star + M_p1) )^(1/3 )

But since M_p1 and M_p2 are much less than M_star (which is 1.5 solar masses), the terms (M_star + Mp) can be approximated as M_star.

So K1/K2 ≈ (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because the other terms would be (M_star)^(-2/3) in K, but when taking the ratio, it cancels out.

Wait, let's think about it:

The formula for K is:

K = (v) ≈ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p / M_earth) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) * (P / yr )^(-1/3 )

But from Kepler's law, P² = (4π² a³)/( G M_star )

So P = [ (4π²/G M_star )^(1/2) ) ] * a^(3/2 )

Wait, let me express P in terms of a.

But perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of P. Let me see:

a^3 = G M_star (P/(2π))^2 )

So a = [ G M_star (P/(2π))² ]^(1/3 )

But substituting this into K may be messy. Alternatively, perhaps express a in terms of P.

But I think a better approach is to find the ratio a1/a2.

Wait, from the ratio K1/K2 = 0.75, and K is proportional to (M_p) * (a)^(-1/2) ) / (M_star )^(2/3 )

So K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * sqrt(a2/a1) ) * [ ( M_star / M_sun )^(2/3 ) / ( M_star / M_sun )^(2/3 ) ] 

Wait, no, because when you take the ratio, the M_star terms would cancel. So:

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, because Planet1 has mass 7 Earth masses, Planet2 is 5.

So 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Let me solve for sqrt(a2/a1):

sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 * (5/7) ) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

So, a2/a1 = (15/28 )^2 ≈ (225)/(784) ≈ 0.287.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 15/28. 15 divided by 28 is about 0.5357. Squared is approximately 0.5357^2 ≈ 0.287.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.287. Alternatively, a1/a2 ≈ 1/0.287 ≈ 3.484.

Hmm.

So a1 is larger than a2. That makes sense because Planet1 has a larger RV shift (smaller K?) Wait, no, K is the velocity of the star. Wait, no, larger K would mean the star is moving more, which would imply the planet is more massive or closer. Because a planet closer in would cause a larger RV shift since the star's velocity is higher.

Wait, but K depends on planet mass and orbital distance. So a planet that's more massive and closer in would have a higher K. So in this case, Planet1 has a K of 0.03 Å, Planet2 0.04 Å. Wait, no, wait, wait, the shifts are 0.03 and 0.04, so K1 is 0.03 and K2 is 0.04. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Because the question says Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å, while Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å. So K2 > K1.

So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 0.75.

So according to my earlier equation, 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Wait, 7/5 is 1.4.

So 0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Then sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.5357² ≈ 0.287.

So a1 is about 3.484 times a2.

Hmm, so Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, but then, equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

Because the equilibrium temperature equation is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R_star)/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Since albedo is same, it cancels.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2/a1 )

Because sqrt( ( a2 )/( a1 ) )

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( 0.287 ) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5

So when taking the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, since albedo is same, it's sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So with a2/a1 ≈ 0.287, the ratio is sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.536 times that of Planet2. So the ratio T1/T2 ≈ 0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I should confirm the calculation.

Let me redo the steps:

Given:

Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ0 = 6300 Å → K1 = c * Δλ1/λ0.

Similarly, K2 = c * Δλ2/λ0.

So K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75.

From the RV formula, K is proportional to (M_p) * (a)^(-1/2) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But M_star is same for both, and since M_p is in Earth masses, the ratio is (7/5).

So, K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which becomes 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 * (5/7) = (3*5)/(4*7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357

So a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 225/784 ≈ 0.287.

So T_eq ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Which is approximately 0.53, so option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \text{albedo}}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Given the Doppler shifts, \(K_1/K_2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75\). Substituting the masses of the planets (\(M_{p1} = 7 M_{\text{Earth}}\), \(M_{p2} = 5 M_{\text{Earth}}\)):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Solving for \(\sqrt{a_2/a_1}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75 \cdot 5}{7} = \frac{3.75}{7} \approx 0.5357
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Now, substituting \(\sqrt{a_2/a_1} \approx 0.5357\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx 0.5357
\]

This corresponds to approximately \(0.53\). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it. Let me read the question again.

So, two planets are orbiting a star, and both have been detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits. 

The problem mentions some Doppler shifts: Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. But the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Since they have the same albedo, that factor cancels out, I think.

Wait, so the key variables are the star's temperature, the planet's orbital distance, and the star's radius. But wait, the albedo is the same, so the equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

So I need to find T_eq for each planet and then take the ratio.

But wait, how do I find the orbital distances a for each planet? The problem gives the Doppler shifts. Oh, right, the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital distance.

The formula for K is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (1 year in seconds)) * something... Wait, maybe it's easier to remember that for circular orbits, e=0, and the semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i)/(M_earth) ) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) / ( (P/yr) )^(1/3) )

But since the problem gives the Doppler shifts in terms of wavelength shifts, which relate to velocity via the Doppler formula. The shift in wavelength λ is related to velocity v by v = c * (λ/λ0 - 1) / (1 + λ/λ0) approximately, but for small shifts, it's approximately v ≈ c * (Δλ/λ0). Let me think: the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So the shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So:

v1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) 
v2 = c * (0.04 / 6300)

Wait, but the Doppler shift from the star's perspective is the same as the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. So the semi-amplitude K is equal to v1 and v2 for each planet. Because the RV method measures the star's velocity.

So K1 = v1 = c * Δλ1 / λ0
Similarly, K2 = v2 = c * Δλ2 / λ0

Since the star's velocity is K = v, then for each planet, their K is given.

But K is also related to the planet's mass and the orbital period and distance. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )

Wait, maybe it's better to use the relation:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( P^(1/3) )) ) ... Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Oh wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^{2/3} ) ) ] * ( (1 / (P^{1/3} )) ) * ( (1 / ( (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) )) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so 1/(1-e²)^½ is 1. Also, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p / M_earth) * ( (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But wait, what's P? It's the orbital period. But I don't know P yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to a^3 / (M_star + M_p). Since M_p is much smaller, it's approximately (a^3) / (M_star). So P² = (4π² a^3)/(G(M_star + M_p)) ≈ (4π² a^3)/(G M_star )

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe find the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2, and then relate that to the ratio of their orbital distances.

Wait, the problem gives the Doppler shifts for each planet. So for each, K1 = (c * Δλ1)/λ0 and K2 = (c * Δλ2)/λ0.

Wait, because the forbidden line is at 6300 Å, so λ0 is 6300 Å. So for Planet1, Δλ = 0.03 Å. So K1 = c * (0.03/6300). Similarly, K2 = c * (0.04/6300).

So K1/K2 = (0.03)/(0.04) = 3/4 = 0.75.

So K1 = 0.75 K2.

But K is also proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) or something like that. Maybe another approach: since K ~ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) a^(1/2) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the formula for K can be written as:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( (1-e^2 )^(1/2) )) ) * 2π / (c * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )) ... Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, from another approach, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1) * (1 / ( (2π G )^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )) )

Wait, no. Let me try to find the relation between K and a.

The formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_earth) ) ] * [ (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ] * [ (P / yr )^(-1/3) ) ] / ( (1 - e² )^(1/2) )

Assuming e=0 and sin i ≈ 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for transit method), so:

K ≈ 27.4 * (M_p/ M_earth) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) * (P / yr )^(-1/3 )

But I don't know P for each planet. Hmm.

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² a³) / (G (M_star + M_p)) )

Again, M_p << M_star, so P² ≈ (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So P = [ (4π² a³) / (G M_star) ) ]^(1/2 )

Wait, substituting that into K:

K ≈ 27.4 * (M_p / M_earth) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) * [ ( (4π² a^3 / (G M_star )) )^(-1/6) ) ]

Wait, because P is in years, so I think I need to express P in a compatible unit. Maybe it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of a1 and a2 (the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2) because the ratio of K is known.

So K1/K2 = ( (M_p1)/(M_p2) ) * ( (a2)/(a1) )^(1/2) ) * ( (M_star + M_p2) / (M_star + M_p1) )^(1/3 )

But since M_p1 and M_p2 are much less than M_star (which is 1.5 solar masses), the terms (M_star + Mp) can be approximated as M_star.

So K1/K2 ≈ (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because the other terms would be (M_star)^(-2/3) in K, but when taking the ratio, it cancels out.

Wait, let's think about it:

The formula for K is:

K = (v) ≈ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p / M_earth) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) * (P / yr )^(-1/3 )

But from Kepler's law, P² = (4π² a³)/( G M_star )

So P = [ (4π²/G M_star )^(1/2) ) ] * a^(3/2 )

Wait, let me express P in terms of a.

But perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of P. Let me see:

a^3 = G M_star (P/(2π))^2 )

So a = [ G M_star (P/(2π))² ]^(1/3 )

But substituting this into K may be messy. Alternatively, perhaps express a in terms of P.

But I think a better approach is to find the ratio a1/a2.

Wait, from the ratio K1/K2 = 0.75, and K is proportional to (M_p) * (a)^(-1/2) ) / (M_star )^(2/3 )

So K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * sqrt(a2/a1) ) * [ ( M_star / M_sun )^(2/3 ) / ( M_star / M_sun )^(2/3 ) ] 

Wait, no, because when you take the ratio, the M_star terms would cancel. So:

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, because Planet1 has mass 7 Earth masses, Planet2 is 5.

So 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Let me solve for sqrt(a2/a1):

sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 * (5/7) ) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

So, a2/a1 = (15/28 )^2 ≈ (225)/(784) ≈ 0.287.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 15/28. 15 divided by 28 is about 0.5357. Squared is approximately 0.5357^2 ≈ 0.287.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.287. Alternatively, a1/a2 ≈ 1/0.287 ≈ 3.484.

Hmm.

So a1 is larger than a2. That makes sense because Planet1 has a larger RV shift (smaller K?) Wait, no, K is the velocity of the star. Wait, no, larger K would mean the star is moving more, which would imply the planet is more massive or closer. Because a planet closer in would cause a larger RV shift since the star's velocity is higher.

Wait, but K depends on planet mass and orbital distance. So a planet that's more massive and closer in would have a higher K. So in this case, Planet1 has a K of 0.03 Å, Planet2 0.04 Å. Wait, no, wait, wait, the shifts are 0.03 and 0.04, so K1 is 0.03 and K2 is 0.04. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Because the question says Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å, while Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å. So K2 > K1.

So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 0.75.

So according to my earlier equation, 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Wait, 7/5 is 1.4.

So 0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Then sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.5357² ≈ 0.287.

So a1 is about 3.484 times a2.

Hmm, so Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, but then, equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

Because the equilibrium temperature equation is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R_star)/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Since albedo is same, it cancels.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2/a1 )

Because sqrt( ( a2 )/( a1 ) )

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( 0.287 ) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5

So when taking the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, since albedo is same, it's sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So with a2/a1 ≈ 0.287, the ratio is sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.536 times that of Planet2. So the ratio T1/T2 ≈ 0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I should confirm the calculation.

Let me redo the steps:

Given:

Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ0 = 6300 Å → K1 = c * Δλ1/λ0.

Similarly, K2 = c * Δλ2/λ0.

So K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75.

From the RV formula, K is proportional to (M_p) * (a)^(-1/2) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But M_star is same for both, and since M_p is in Earth masses, the ratio is (7/5).

So, K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which becomes 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 * (5/7) = (3*5)/(4*7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357

So a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 225/784 ≈ 0.287.

So T_eq ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Which is approximately 0.53, so option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \text{albedo}}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Given the Doppler shifts, \(K_1/K_2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75\). Substituting the masses of the planets (\(M_{p1} = 7 M_{\text{Earth}}\), \(M_{p2} = 5 M_{\text{Earth}}\)):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Solving for \(\sqrt{a_2/a_1}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75 \cdot 5}{7} = \frac{3.75}{7} \approx 0.5357
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Now, substituting \(\sqrt{a_2/a_1} \approx 0.5357\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx 0.5357
\]

This corresponds to approximately \(0.53\). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:
