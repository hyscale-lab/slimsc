Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think this through step by step.

The question says that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because velocity is relative. So if one frame says the other is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, the other sees it the same way but in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, actually, wait. The problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Oh, right, in special relativity, velocity is relative, but the measurements depend on the frame. So if the ejecta sees the Galaxy moving at 60,000 km/s, then from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So their relative speed is 60,000 km/s.

The question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, so time is different in each frame because of time dilation. So I need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says, "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. I need to find how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame during that same time, and then multiply by the speed to find the distance.

Hold on, no, because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at v=6e4 km/s. From the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is approaching at the same speed but in the opposite direction.

But when the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds have passed, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Because of time dilation, the two frames will measure different elapsed times.

Wait, but in this case, which frame is moving relative to the other. From the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, so the ejecta's proper time would be less than the Galaxy's time due to gamma factor.

Alternatively, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s, so the Galaxy's proper time would be less. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

In relativity, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. So if the ejecta is in its own rest frame, then the time it measures (50 seconds) is the proper time. The Galaxy, moving relative to the ejecta, would have its time dilated. So the Galaxy's clock would run slower, meaning that the time in the Galaxy's frame is less than the ejecta's time? No, wait, no—wait, the moving clock runs slower. So if the Galaxy is moving relative to the ejecta, the Galaxy's time would be running slower. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's clock is ticking slower.

Wait, so in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. How much time passes in the Galaxy's frame during that same time? Because the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the ejecta, the Galaxy's time is dilated. So the time in the Galaxy would be less. The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t'. Wait no, no. Wait, the proper time is t' = t / gamma. So t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, let me get this right. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the process. Here, the process is the movement of the ejecta towards the Galaxy. So in the ejecta's frame, the process is at rest, so t' is the proper time. So the Galaxy's frame (where the ejecta is moving) would see the proper time as t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So in the Galaxy's frame, the time elapsed is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait no, perhaps I'm getting it inverted. Let me think again. If you're in frame S (Galaxy) and observe frame S' (ejecta) moving at velocity v, then the time in S' is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So when 50 seconds pass in S' (ejecta's frame), how much time passes in S (Galaxy)? It would be t = t' / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the moving clock (S') runs slower, then for each second in S, more seconds pass in S'. So if S' says 50 seconds passed, in S less time has passed. Because from S's perspective, S' is moving and their clocks run slower.

Wait, no. Let me think of it this way. If I'm in S', and I observe S moving at velocity v, then in my frame, the time in S is running slow. So if I experience 50 seconds, the time that has passed in S would be less than 50 seconds.

So the formula I should use is t = t' * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since in S', t' =50 s, so t (Galaxy's time) is t =50 * sqrt(1 - (v²)/(c²)).

Wait, but v is 60,000 km/s. Let's compute v in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times c. So v = 0.2c.

So v²/c² = 0.04. So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So t =50 * 0.9798 ≈48.99 seconds. Approximately 49 seconds.

Wait, but I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s (0.2c), so in the Galaxy's frame, the distance is v * t (time in Galaxy's frame). So distance = 60,000 km/s * t.

So t is approximately 49 seconds, so distance is 60,000 *49 = 2,940,000 km. Wait, but that gives option A. But wait, let me think again: no, wait. No, because t is the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is the proper time?

Wait, wait, no. The problem is that the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s, so the distance is (60,000 km/s) multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. So if the Galaxy's frame time is t, then distance is 60000 * t.

But the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = t' * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t' is 50 s. So t ≈50 * 0.9798 ≈48.99 s.

So distance is 60000 *48.99 ≈2,939,400 km. Looking at the options, option A is 2,940,000 km, which is the closest.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I got the time dilation the wrong way around. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v, so from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's time is running slow. So when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's frame has experienced less time. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the Galaxy's frame time.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation to find the distance.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the distance in the ejecta's frame and then see how it transforms.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in 50 seconds, the distance the Galaxy has moved is 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. But wait, that's the distance the Galaxy moves in the ejecta's frame. But we need the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame. Are these the same? Wait, but the scenario is different.

Wait, no. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them, so the distance between them is closing. But the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the ejecta's time of 50 seconds.

Wait, perhaps I should find the time in the Galaxy's frame and then multiply by the speed. Let's re-express all this.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the elapsed time is t' =50 s. The speed of the Galaxy is v=6e4 km/s. The time in the Galaxy's frame (S) is t = t' * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) =50 * sqrt(0.96) ≈50 *0.9798≈48.99 s.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 6e4 km/s for t=48.99 s. So the distance is 6e4 *48.99 ≈2,939,400 km, which is approximately 2,940,000 km. So option A is 2,940,000 km.

But wait, let me check if I got the formula right. Is the time in S (Galaxy's frame) t = t' * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), or is it t' = t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)?

Ah, right. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the process. So for an event happening in the same place in a frame, the proper time is the shortest. So if the ejecta is in S', and the process (time) is 50 s in S', then the time in S (Galaxy) would be longer? Or shorter?

Wait, no. Wait, no. Because S' is moving relative to S. So from S's perspective, S' is moving, so the clocks in S' are running slower. So if S' measures 50 s, then the time in S would be longer. Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, the correct formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So when S' is moving at v relative to S, the time in S is t = gamma * t'. So in this case, v is 6e4 km/s, which is 0.2c. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) =1/sqrt(0.96)≈1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 s.

Wait, wait, that's different. So if in S' (ejecta), the time is 50 s, then in S (Galaxy's frame), the time is longer: 51.03 s.

But wait, that can't be right because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving, so the ejecta's clock should be running slower. So if 50 s pass in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's frame would have experienced less time, not more.

Wait, maybe I have the frames mixed up. Maybe S is the Galaxy's frame, S' is the ejecta's frame. So S' is moving at v=60,000 km/s relative to S.

Wait, in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at v. So the proper time for the ejecta is the time in S', t' = t * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2). So if in S, the time is t, then in S' it's t' = t * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2). So if in S' the time is 50 s, then t = t' / sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2) =50 / 0.9798 ≈51.03 s.

So in the Galaxy's frame, 51.03 seconds have passed. Therefore, the distance the ejecta has traveled is v * t =60,000 km/s *51.03 s ≈3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close to that.

Wait, now I'm getting a different answer. Earlier I thought it was around 2.94 million, but now with this approach, it's around 3.06 million.

So which approach is correct?

Let me clarify the setup. The ejecta is in its own frame S', and in that frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed is 60,000 km/s. The time that elapses in S' is 50 seconds. We need to find the distance the ejecta has moved in S (the Galaxy's frame) during that time.

Wait, in S', 50 seconds pass. How much time passes in S? Since S' is moving at v relative to S, the time in S is longer. So t = gamma * t' = t' / sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2) =50 / sqrt(0.96)≈51.03 s.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s for 51.03 seconds, so the distance is 60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km. Which is approximately 3,060,000 km, option D.

But why did I get two different answers earlier? Because I was confused about which frame was moving and which was the rest frame.

Wait, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the object is at rest. So in this problem, the ejecta is at rest in its own frame S', so the proper time for the ejecta is t' =50 s. The time in the Galaxy's frame (S) is longer. So t = t' / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈50 /0.9798≈51.03 s.

Thus, the distance is v * t =6e4 *51.03≈3,061,800 km. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but the options are A) 2,940,000, B)3,000,000, C)2,880,000, D)3,060,000.

So option D is the closest. So the answer should be D.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the calculation.

v =6e4 km/s =0.2c.

v²/c²=0.04.

sqrt(1 - v²/c²)=sqrt(0.96)=approx 0.9798.

t = t' / 0.9798 =50 /0.9798≈51.03 s.

Distance = v * t =6e4 *51.03=6e4=60,000.

60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km, which rounds to 3,060,000 km. So option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion and time dilation between the ejecta and the Galaxy. The ejecta is moving at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) (or \( 0.2c \)) relative to the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relative Velocity and Time Dilation**:  
   Since the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, the relative speed is \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). Time dilation occurs because the ejecta's clock runs slower in the Galaxy's frame. The time dilation factor is:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

2. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) by:  
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t'
   \]  
   Substituting \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   t = 1.0206 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]  
   This rounds to \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
