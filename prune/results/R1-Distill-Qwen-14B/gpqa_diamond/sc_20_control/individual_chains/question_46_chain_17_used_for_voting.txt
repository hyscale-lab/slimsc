Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me visualize the molecule. 3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, no, wait. Pent means five carbons. 1-ene is double bond at the first position. So structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So positions 1 and 2 are double bond, then the third carbon has a methyl group.

Wait, maybe I should write it out. 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, the third carbon (the one connected to the second carbon from the double bond) has a methyl group. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think: pent means five carbons. 1-ene is the first and second carbons double bonded. So, the structure should be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count again.

The molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, no that can't be right because that would only be four carbons. Oh wait, the formula is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So it's (CH2)2CH on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh, wait, no. Wait, pent- is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, that's four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. No, that's four carbons as well. Wait, maybe I should draw it. The formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. 3-methyl would add another CH3, making it C6H12? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let's see, pent-1-ene is C5H10. If we have a methyl substituent on C3, I think the formula would be C6H12? Because adding a CH3.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let me just write the structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that's six carbons. Because, wait, pent is five carbons. So the main chain is five carbons with double bond at 1-ene, and a methyl group on carbon 3.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is five carbons in the chain? Because the double bond is between 1 and 2, then 3 has a methyl, then 4 is CH2, and 5 is CH3. No, that's five in the main chain. So the structure is correct.

But perhaps I should focus on the reaction. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis or ring-opening metathesis. In this case, treating 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst would likely cause a ring-closing metathesis because the molecule has a terminal double bond, which is good for metathesis.

Wait, but Grubbs is also used for cross metathesis, but in this case, since it's a single alkene, perhaps it will undergo ring-closing. Wait, but 3-methylpent-1-ene is a straight chain molecule. So when Grubbs is used, which is a ring-closing catalyst, it would form a ring. So the reaction would form a cycloalkene.

So, the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let me count the carbons: the main chain is five carbons, with a methyl on C3. So, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in the main chain? Because the substituent is CH3 on C3.

Wait, no, wait: the formula would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? That's five carbons, but wait, no: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, the third carbon has a methyl group, so it's CH(CH3). Then, the fourth and fifth carbons are CH2 and CH3, respectively.

Wait, no, that would make the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's five carbons in the main chain, but the substituent is on C3.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the possible rings that can form. Grubbs catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of double bonds through metathesis. So, in ring-closing metathesis, the olefin (double bond) would react to form a ring.

So, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let's number the carbons as 1,2,3,4,5.

The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, if a ring forms, the other end of the molecule would need to connect somewhere to form a ring.

Wait, but for ring-closing, the catalyst would break the double bond and recombine with another part of the molecule to form a ring. So the molecule is a straight chain with a terminal double bond. So, the options for ring formation would be between the two ends.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about possible ring sizes. The molecule is 5 carbons, so possible rings could be 4-membered, 5-membered, etc.

Wait, but considering the structure, if the double bond is at C1-C2, then the possible sites for the other end are other double bonds or other positions. Wait, but the molecule is a single double bond. So, in metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond and rearrange.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's a case of cross-metathesis, but since it's a single molecule, perhaps it's a ring-closing.

Wait, I think I need to think about the possible products. The question is about how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene.

So, Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene, and in olefin metathesis, it breaks and reforms double bonds.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would cause the molecule to form a ring. So, the product would be a cyclic alkene.

But in this case, the starting molecule is a straight chain. So, the ring formed would depend on where the other end connects.

Wait, perhaps the molecule will undergo ring-closing to form a cyclic product. Let's think about possible ring sizes.

The molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the chain is 5 carbons long, but the substituent is on C3. So, from the double bond, how can the molecule form a ring?

Let me imagine the ends of the molecule. The double bond is at C1-C2. The other end of the molecule is at C5. So, perhaps the catalyst would facilitate a reaction where the end (C5) connects back to somewhere else, forming a ring.

Wait, but the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let me think about the possible ways to form a ring.

If the CH2 at C5 were to connect back to C2, that would form a 4-membered ring. Alternatively, connecting to C3 would give a 5-membered ring.

Wait, wait. Let me count the atoms between the two ends. For example, if the CH2 at C5 (which is the end of the chain) were to form a double bond with C2, then the ring would be formed between C2 and C5.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, and C5 is CH3.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is actually CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the fifth carbon is a CH3 group, attached to C4, which is CH2, which is attached to C3 (CH(CH3)), which is attached to C2 (CH2), which is attached to C1 (CH2), which is double bonded to C2.

Wait, no. Let me correct. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the main chain is five carbons. C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, connected by a double bond. C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, C5 is CH3.

So, the molecule is a straight chain with a methyl branch on C3.

So, in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond and form a new double bond by connecting two ends of the chain. So, the ends of the chain would form a ring.

So, the two ends are the CH2 group at C1 and the CH3 group at C5.

Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so if the catalyst causes a ring closure, perhaps the CH2 at C1 (which was part of the double bond) would connect to another part of the chain.

Wait, perhaps the ring size depends on which carbon the other end connects to.

Let me think about possible connections:

1. If the double bond breaks, and then the CH2 groups from C1 and C5 form a new double bond, but that would require the ends to meet, which might form a ring.

So, the possibilities are based on the possible ring sizes that can form.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible rings that can form.

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, the chain is:

1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3).

The double bond is between 1 and 2.

If the ring forms between C2 and C5, that would make a 4-membered ring (since 2 to 5 is 3 bonds apart, making a 4-membered ring).

Wait, no, because the number of atoms in the ring is the number of atoms between the two points plus one. So, from C2 to C5, the atoms in between are C3, C4, and C5. So that's 4 atoms, which would make a 5-membered ring. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the positions where the metathesis can occur. So, the Grubbs catalyst would cause the breaking of the double bond and form a new one with another part of the chain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction would result in the formation of a cyclopropane, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe a cycloalkene.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs is used with a monounsaturated alkene, the reaction can lead to ring formation by connecting two ends of the chain. The size of the ring depends on how far the ends are apart.

In this case, the alkyl chain is five carbons long. So, possible ring sizes would be 4, 5, or 6-membered rings.

Wait, but let's think: the double bond is at C1-C2. The other end is C5, which is a methyl group. So, if the catalyst causes the C5 (CH3) to connect back to, say, C2, that would form a ring. The number of atoms in the ring would be C2 to C5 plus the two ends. So, C2 to C5 is three carbons (C3, C4, C5), and the two ends (C1 and C2). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine that the double bond breaks, and the two ends (the CH2 from C1 and the CH3 from C5) form a new double bond.

Wait, but that would just produce ethene and a longer chain, but that's not applicable here because the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, no, wait. The molecule is racemic, which means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. So, perhaps the configuration around the stereogenic center (if any) affects the outcome.

Wait, but in this molecule, is there a stereogenic center? Let me see. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbon at position 3 is CH(CH3), attached to CH2 from C2 and CH2 from C4. Wait, so the groups attached to C3 are: CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), CH2 (from C4), and another CH2 (from C5? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, C3 is connected to CH2 (from C2), CH3 (the substituent), CH2CH3 (from C4), and another CH2 (from C5?), but I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps I should look for stereogenic centers. C3 is connected to four different groups: CH2 (from C2, which is connected to the double bond), CH3 (the substituent), CH2 (from C4, which is connected to C5), and another CH2 (from C5? Wait, no. Wait, C3 is in the middle, so it's connected to C2, C4, and the substituent. Let me think again.

The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write the structure properly:

Carbon 1: CH2=CH- (so C1 is CH2 connected by double bond to C2)
Carbon 2: CH- (connected to C1 and C3)
Carbon 3: CH(CH3) (connected to C2, C4, and two CH2 groups?)
Wait, no. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, Carbon 3 is connected to Carbon 2 (CH from the double bond), a CH3 group, Carbon 4 (CH2), and a hydrogen. So, four substituents: CH2 (from C2?), CH3, CH2 (from C4), and H. So, yes, C3 is a stereogenic center. So, the molecule has a chiral center at C3, making it a racemic mixture (so both enantiomers are present).

But how does this affect the metathesis reaction? Well, in olefin metathesis, the catalyst typically breaks the double bond and forms new ones. The configuration of the stereogenic center might influence where the metathesis occurs.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products, excluding ethene. So, perhaps the reaction forms multiple rings or different ring sizes, and the stereoisomerism could lead to different products.

Hmm, perhaps the racemic nature leads to different diastereomers as products. Or maybe the different positions of the ring closure would produce different products.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider the possible products in terms of ring sizes.

If the Grubbs catalyst causes ring-closing metathesis, the possible rings formed would depend on how the ends of the molecule connect.

Let me consider the possible ring sizes:

1. Connecting C1 and C5: that would form a 5-membered ring (since the chain is 5 carbons, but the ring would be 5-membered because the ends would connect to form a ring. Wait, but the double bond is at C1-C2, so if the metathesis connects C1 and C5, that's a 5-membered ring. Alternatively, connecting C2 and C5 would form a 4-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the end of the chain is C5. So, the distance between C2 and C5 is three bonds (C2-C3-C4-C5). So, if the catalyst causes the C2 and C5 to form a new double bond, the ring would be 4-membered (since it's C2, C3, C4, C5, and back to C2 via the new double bond).

Alternatively, if the catalyst causes the C1 and C5 to form a new double bond, that's a 5-membered ring (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and back to C1).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The double bond is at C1-C2. So, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The possible ring sizes would depend on which two carbons form the new double bond.

Possible connections:

a) C1 and C4: but wait, that would require a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible ring sizes.

Let me consider the possible new double bonds that can form:

- If the new double bond is between C1 and C5, then the ring would be 5-membered. But that's unlikely because connecting C1 and C5 would require a longer chain, maybe a six-membered ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the number of carbons in the ring.

The molecule has five carbons, so if a ring forms by connecting C1 and C5, that would form a five-membered ring (since the chain is five carbons, but the ring would be five, as it's a cyclic structure).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the possible ring sizes. For a five-carbon chain, the possible rings are 4-membered, 5-membered, etc.

Wait, but wait, when the catalyst breaks the double bond and forms a new one by connecting two ends, the ring size is determined by the positions of the two ends.

So, for example:

- If the new double bond forms between C1 and C4, that would create a four-membered ring (C1-C2-C3-C4, then back to C1 via the new double bond).

Wait, but the chain is longer than that. Alternatively, connecting C2 and C5 would form a four-membered ring, as that's the distance between those two carbons.

Alternatively, connecting C1 and C5 would form a five-membered ring.

So, the possible products would be the different ring sizes formed.

But wait, another possibility is that the metathesis could occur in such a way that a six-membered ring forms, but that's probably less likely.

But wait, the starting molecule is five carbons long. So, a ring would involve some of those carbons.

Another approach: the Grubbs catalyst can cause the molecule to undergo ring-closing metathesis, and the possible products would be different rings based on where the ring forms.

So, in 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is at C1-C2, and the substituent is at C3. So, the possible rings would be:

1. Connecting C1 and C5, forming a five-membered ring.

2. Connecting C2 and C5, forming a four-membered ring.

3. Connecting C1 and C4, forming a four-membered ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about this again.

The molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

The possible sites for ring closure would involve the breaking of the double bond and the formation of a new double bond between two other carbons in the chain.

For example, breaking the C1-C2 double bond and forming a new double bond between C2 and C5.

In that case, the product would be a four-membered ring: the new double bond is between C2 and C5.

Alternatively, the new double bond could form between C1 and C4, making a four-membered ring as well.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think about the structure again.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think of the possible rings formed and then count the stereoisomers.

But back to the problem: the molecule is racemic, which suggests that it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers at C3.

Wait, but in the metathesis reaction, would the configuration at C3 affect the product? Or would the reaction proceed in a way that the stereocenter is no longer present in the product?

Hmm, perhaps the ring closing would lead to different diastereomers because the configuration at C3 might influence the ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring closing would lead to a new stereocenter.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of what products are formed.

Assuming the reaction forms a ring, let's say a four-membered ring, what would the structure look like?

If the new double bond forms between C2 and C5, the ring would involve C2, C3, C4, and C5.

The structure would become a cyclobutene derivative.

But wait, let me write it out.

After ring closing, the structure would be:

If the new double bond is between C2 and C5, the ring would be a four-membered ring. So, the structure would be a cyclobutene ring, with substituents.

But how? Let me think: The original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Breaking the C1-C2 double bond, and forming a new double bond between C2 and C5.

So, the new structure would be a cyclobutene ring with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product would be 3-methylcyclobutene or something similar.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product could be a five-membered ring.

Wait, but how many different products would form? The question is about the number of possible products, excluding ethene.

So, if the ring can form in different ways, leading to different ring sizes, each with possible stereoisomers, then the number of products would increase.

But perhaps for each possible ring size, there are multiple stereoisomers.

But considering that the starting material is racemic, would that lead to different product enantiomers?

Wait, but after ring closure, perhaps the stereogenic center in the starting material is no longer present, as the ring formation might eliminate it.

Alternatively, the ring closure could create new stereogenic centers.

Hmm. Let's think about the possible products.

Let me try to think of the possible ring sizes.

1. Five-membered ring:

If the ring forms by connecting C1 and C5, the new double bond would be between C1 and C5, making a five-membered ring.

Wait, but that would require breaking the existing double bond and reforming a new one across the chain. Alternatively, perhaps the ring would involve C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5, forming a five-membered ring.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring forms between C2 and C5, creating a four-membered ring.

Another possibility is that the ring forms in more than one position.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule can form two different four-membered rings, depending on where the metathesis occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the ring can form a five-membered ring and a four-membered ring, each with different substituents.

Wait, but considering the structure, perhaps more than one ring size is possible. So, how many distinct ring products can form?

If the ring can form a four-membered and a five-membered ring, then that's two possibilities. But wait, perhaps more.

Wait, perhaps the ring can form in more than one way, leading to different structures.

Alternatively, perhaps each possible ring closure leads to different diastereomers. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that Grubbs catalyst will cause the olefin to undergo ring-closing metathesis, forming a cycloalkene. The possible cycloalkenes depend on which positions the metathesis occurs.

In this molecule, the possible ring sizes are four and five.

Wait, but let me think. After breaking the double bond between C1 and C2, the metathesis can form a new double bond between C2 and C5, forming a four-membered ring, or between C1 and C4, forming a four-membered ring as well.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible products.

In any case, the problem is asking for the number of possible products, excluding ethene. So, if each ring closure leads to a different product, and considering stereochemistry, perhaps the number is more than one.

Wait, but the question is about how many products, not the structures. So, perhaps for each possible ring size, there's a certain number of stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the racemic starting material leads to a certain number of diastereomers in the product.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to think about the possible products.

Assuming that the metathesis forms a five-membered ring, what would that look like? Let's say the new double bond is between C1 and C5. The structure would be a cyclopentene derivative. But I'm not sure about the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a bicyclic compound, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms different rings based on where the catalyst acts. So, if the metathesis can occur in two different ways, leading to different ring sizes, then each would be a different product.

So, if the possible ring sizes are four and five, that would give two products, but perhaps more.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products and their structures.

Another possibility is that the reaction produces a mixture of different ring sizes, such as four-membered and five-membered rings, each with their own stereochemistry.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo more than one metathesis pathway, leading to multiple products.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is that there are two possible products, so the answer is D) 2.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is racemic, so would that double the number of products?

Alternatively, perhaps each ring closure leads to a different diastereomer, and considering both R and S configurations, that would result in more products.

Wait, perhaps the number of possible products is 3 or 4.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, meaning it's a 50:50 mix of two enantiomers. Each enantiomer would have the same possible ring products, but the ring formation might involve the configuration at C3.

Wait, but perhaps when the ring forms, the configuration at C3 becomes part of the ring, leading to different diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring closure doesn't involve the stereogenic center, leading to the same product regardless of the starting enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps each possible ring size would result in two diastereomers, leading to more products.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each possible ring size would form only one product, so the number of ring sizes would be the number of products.

But earlier I thought that the possible ring sizes are four and five, leading to two products.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the possible ways the ring can form.

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the double bond breaks, and the two ends (CH2 and CH3) form a new double bond, but that would produce ethene and a larger molecule, which is not desired because the question says to exclude ethene.

Wait, but maybe the metathesis doesn't produce ethene but instead forms a ring.

So, perhaps the possible ring products are from different ring sizes.

Wait, perhaps the ring can form in two different ways, leading to two different ring sizes: four and five.

So, that would give two possible products.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in more than one way, leading to more products.

Wait, perhaps each possible ring size would result in two stereoisomers, but since the starting material is racemic, perhaps the products are also racemic, but the question is asking for the number of products, excluding ethene.

If the ring can form in two different ways (four and five-membered rings), each with their own stereochemistry, perhaps the total number of products is more.

Alternatively, perhaps each ring size can form two products due to stereoisomerism.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of an example.

If the ring is four-membered, the structure would be a cyclobutene derivative. The substituents would come from the chain.

In the starting molecule, the substituents are CH3 on C3.

After ring formation, the substituents would be in specific positions, leading to different diastereomers.

So, if the ring forms a four-membered ring, perhaps there are two possible diastereomers, leading to two products. Similarly, for a five-membered ring, perhaps another two products.

But that would make four products in total.

Alternatively, perhaps the four-membered ring forms in two different ways, leading to two products, and the five-membered ring forms in two different ways, leading to another two products. So, four products.

Wait, but perhaps each ring size can form one product due to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the four-membered ring forms in only one way, and the five-membered ring forms in another way, leading to two products.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: the metathesis of an allylic substituted alkene can lead to different products depending on where the ring forms.

In the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible products after ring-closing metathesis would be:

1. A four-membered ring (cyclobutene derivative).

2. A five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative).

Each of these would have their own substituents.

Now, considering the substituents, perhaps each ring size leads to a mono-substituted ring.

So, perhaps each ring size would be a single product.

So, two products in total.

But wait, the molecule has a methyl group on C3, so perhaps the substituents in the ring would be different for each ring size.

Wait, for a four-membered ring, the substituents would come from C3 and C5, perhaps leading to a methyl group in the ring.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct number of products is four. But why?

Wait, perhaps the ring can form in two different ways, each leading to a different diastereomer, and each ring size can have two stereoisomers. So, four products.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the racemic starting material leads to two stereoisomeric products, each for a different ring size.

So, two products in total.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: Grubbs catalyst can cause different types of ring-closing metathesis. In this case, the molecule can form either a four-membered or a five-membered ring. Each ring would have different substituents and thus be a different product.

So, two possible products.

Thus, the answer would be D) 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure **CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃**, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and there is a stereogenic center at C3 due to the presence of four different substituents (CH₂ from C2, CH₃, CH₂ from C4, and a hydrogen). The molecule exists as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers.

When treated with Grubbs catalyst, a ring-closing metathesis occurs. This reaction involves the breaking of the double bond and the formation of a new double bond between two carbons in the chain, resulting in the formation of a cyclic alkene. The possible products depend on the positions of the carbons that form the new double bond, which determines the size of the resulting ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Possible Ring Sizes**:
   - A **four-membered ring** can form if the new double bond is between C2 and C5.
   - A **five-membered ring** can form if the new double bond is between C1 and C5.

2. **Exclusion of Ethene**:
   The question specifies that ethene (a byproduct of cross-metathesis) should be excluded. Therefore, only the cyclic products are considered.

3. **Stereochemistry**:
   The starting material is racemic, meaning it contains both enantiomers of the stereogenic center at C3. However, the ring-closing metathesis eliminates the stereogenic center, as the resulting cyclic product does not retain the chirality of the starting material. Thus, the stereochemistry of the starting material does not lead to additional stereoisomeric products.

4. **Number of Products**:
   The reaction can produce two distinct cyclic products based on the ring size:
   - A four-membered ring.
   - A five-membered ring.

   These two products are structurally and chemically distinct, leading to a total of **two possible products**.

### Conclusion:
The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst results in two possible cyclic products, excluding ethene. 

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me visualize the molecule. 3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, no, wait. Pent means five carbons. 1-ene is double bond at the first position. So structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So positions 1 and 2 are double bond, then the third carbon has a methyl group.

Wait, maybe I should write it out. 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, the third carbon (the one connected to the second carbon from the double bond) has a methyl group. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think: pent means five carbons. 1-ene is the first and second carbons double bonded. So, the structure should be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count again.

The molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, no that can't be right because that would only be four carbons. Oh wait, the formula is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So it's (CH2)2CH on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh, wait, no. Wait, pent- is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, that's four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. No, that's four carbons as well. Wait, maybe I should draw it. The formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. 3-methyl would add another CH3, making it C6H12? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let's see, pent-1-ene is C5H10. If we have a methyl substituent on C3, I think the formula would be C6H12? Because adding a CH3.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let me just write the structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that's six carbons. Because, wait, pent is five carbons. So the main chain is five carbons with double bond at 1-ene, and a methyl group on carbon 3.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is five carbons in the chain? Because the double bond is between 1 and 2, then 3 has a methyl, then 4 is CH2, and 5 is CH3. No, that's five in the main chain. So the structure is correct.

But perhaps I should focus on the reaction. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis or ring-opening metathesis. In this case, treating 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst would likely cause a ring-closing metathesis because the molecule has a terminal double bond, which is good for metathesis.

Wait, but Grubbs is also used for cross metathesis, but in this case, since it's a single alkene, perhaps it will undergo ring-closing. Wait, but 3-methylpent-1-ene is a straight chain molecule. So when Grubbs is used, which is a ring-closing catalyst, it would form a ring. So the reaction would form a cycloalkene.

So, the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let me count the carbons: the main chain is five carbons, with a methyl on C3. So, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in the main chain? Because the substituent is CH3 on C3.

Wait, no, wait: the formula would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? That's five carbons, but wait, no: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, the third carbon has a methyl group, so it's CH(CH3). Then, the fourth and fifth carbons are CH2 and CH3, respectively.

Wait, no, that would make the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's five carbons in the main chain, but the substituent is on C3.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the possible rings that can form. Grubbs catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of double bonds through metathesis. So, in ring-closing metathesis, the olefin (double bond) would react to form a ring.

So, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let's number the carbons as 1,2,3,4,5.

The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, if a ring forms, the other end of the molecule would need to connect somewhere to form a ring.

Wait, but for ring-closing, the catalyst would break the double bond and recombine with another part of the molecule to form a ring. So the molecule is a straight chain with a terminal double bond. So, the options for ring formation would be between the two ends.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about possible ring sizes. The molecule is 5 carbons, so possible rings could be 4-membered, 5-membered, etc.

Wait, but considering the structure, if the double bond is at C1-C2, then the possible sites for the other end are other double bonds or other positions. Wait, but the molecule is a single double bond. So, in metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond and rearrange.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's a case of cross-metathesis, but since it's a single molecule, perhaps it's a ring-closing.

Wait, I think I need to think about the possible products. The question is about how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene.

So, Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene, and in olefin metathesis, it breaks and reforms double bonds.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would cause the molecule to form a ring. So, the product would be a cyclic alkene.

But in this case, the starting molecule is a straight chain. So, the ring formed would depend on where the other end connects.

Wait, perhaps the molecule will undergo ring-closing to form a cyclic product. Let's think about possible ring sizes.

The molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the chain is 5 carbons long, but the substituent is on C3. So, from the double bond, how can the molecule form a ring?

Let me imagine the ends of the molecule. The double bond is at C1-C2. The other end of the molecule is at C5. So, perhaps the catalyst would facilitate a reaction where the end (C5) connects back to somewhere else, forming a ring.

Wait, but the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let me think about the possible ways to form a ring.

If the CH2 at C5 were to connect back to C2, that would form a 4-membered ring. Alternatively, connecting to C3 would give a 5-membered ring.

Wait, wait. Let me count the atoms between the two ends. For example, if the CH2 at C5 (which is the end of the chain) were to form a double bond with C2, then the ring would be formed between C2 and C5.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, and C5 is CH3.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is actually CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the fifth carbon is a CH3 group, attached to C4, which is CH2, which is attached to C3 (CH(CH3)), which is attached to C2 (CH2), which is attached to C1 (CH2), which is double bonded to C2.

Wait, no. Let me correct. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the main chain is five carbons. C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, connected by a double bond. C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, C5 is CH3.

So, the molecule is a straight chain with a methyl branch on C3.

So, in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond and form a new double bond by connecting two ends of the chain. So, the ends of the chain would form a ring.

So, the two ends are the CH2 group at C1 and the CH3 group at C5.

Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so if the catalyst causes a ring closure, perhaps the CH2 at C1 (which was part of the double bond) would connect to another part of the chain.

Wait, perhaps the ring size depends on which carbon the other end connects to.

Let me think about possible connections:

1. If the double bond breaks, and then the CH2 groups from C1 and C5 form a new double bond, but that would require the ends to meet, which might form a ring.

So, the possibilities are based on the possible ring sizes that can form.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible rings that can form.

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, the chain is:

1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3).

The double bond is between 1 and 2.

If the ring forms between C2 and C5, that would make a 4-membered ring (since 2 to 5 is 3 bonds apart, making a 4-membered ring).

Wait, no, because the number of atoms in the ring is the number of atoms between the two points plus one. So, from C2 to C5, the atoms in between are C3, C4, and C5. So that's 4 atoms, which would make a 5-membered ring. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the positions where the metathesis can occur. So, the Grubbs catalyst would cause the breaking of the double bond and form a new one with another part of the chain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction would result in the formation of a cyclopropane, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe a cycloalkene.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs is used with a monounsaturated alkene, the reaction can lead to ring formation by connecting two ends of the chain. The size of the ring depends on how far the ends are apart.

In this case, the alkyl chain is five carbons long. So, possible ring sizes would be 4, 5, or 6-membered rings.

Wait, but let's think: the double bond is at C1-C2. The other end is C5, which is a methyl group. So, if the catalyst causes the C5 (CH3) to connect back to, say, C2, that would form a ring. The number of atoms in the ring would be C2 to C5 plus the two ends. So, C2 to C5 is three carbons (C3, C4, C5), and the two ends (C1 and C2). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine that the double bond breaks, and the two ends (the CH2 from C1 and the CH3 from C5) form a new double bond.

Wait, but that would just produce ethene and a longer chain, but that's not applicable here because the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, no, wait. The molecule is racemic, which means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. So, perhaps the configuration around the stereogenic center (if any) affects the outcome.

Wait, but in this molecule, is there a stereogenic center? Let me see. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbon at position 3 is CH(CH3), attached to CH2 from C2 and CH2 from C4. Wait, so the groups attached to C3 are: CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), CH2 (from C4), and another CH2 (from C5? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, C3 is connected to CH2 (from C2), CH3 (the substituent), CH2CH3 (from C4), and another CH2 (from C5?), but I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps I should look for stereogenic centers. C3 is connected to four different groups: CH2 (from C2, which is connected to the double bond), CH3 (the substituent), CH2 (from C4, which is connected to C5), and another CH2 (from C5? Wait, no. Wait, C3 is in the middle, so it's connected to C2, C4, and the substituent. Let me think again.

The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write the structure properly:

Carbon 1: CH2=CH- (so C1 is CH2 connected by double bond to C2)
Carbon 2: CH- (connected to C1 and C3)
Carbon 3: CH(CH3) (connected to C2, C4, and two CH2 groups?)
Wait, no. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, Carbon 3 is connected to Carbon 2 (CH from the double bond), a CH3 group, Carbon 4 (CH2), and a hydrogen. So, four substituents: CH2 (from C2?), CH3, CH2 (from C4), and H. So, yes, C3 is a stereogenic center. So, the molecule has a chiral center at C3, making it a racemic mixture (so both enantiomers are present).

But how does this affect the metathesis reaction? Well, in olefin metathesis, the catalyst typically breaks the double bond and forms new ones. The configuration of the stereogenic center might influence where the metathesis occurs.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products, excluding ethene. So, perhaps the reaction forms multiple rings or different ring sizes, and the stereoisomerism could lead to different products.

Hmm, perhaps the racemic nature leads to different diastereomers as products. Or maybe the different positions of the ring closure would produce different products.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider the possible products in terms of ring sizes.

If the Grubbs catalyst causes ring-closing metathesis, the possible rings formed would depend on how the ends of the molecule connect.

Let me consider the possible ring sizes:

1. Connecting C1 and C5: that would form a 5-membered ring (since the chain is 5 carbons, but the ring would be 5-membered because the ends would connect to form a ring. Wait, but the double bond is at C1-C2, so if the metathesis connects C1 and C5, that's a 5-membered ring. Alternatively, connecting C2 and C5 would form a 4-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the end of the chain is C5. So, the distance between C2 and C5 is three bonds (C2-C3-C4-C5). So, if the catalyst causes the C2 and C5 to form a new double bond, the ring would be 4-membered (since it's C2, C3, C4, C5, and back to C2 via the new double bond).

Alternatively, if the catalyst causes the C1 and C5 to form a new double bond, that's a 5-membered ring (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and back to C1).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The double bond is at C1-C2. So, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The possible ring sizes would depend on which two carbons form the new double bond.

Possible connections:

a) C1 and C4: but wait, that would require a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible ring sizes.

Let me consider the possible new double bonds that can form:

- If the new double bond is between C1 and C5, then the ring would be 5-membered. But that's unlikely because connecting C1 and C5 would require a longer chain, maybe a six-membered ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the number of carbons in the ring.

The molecule has five carbons, so if a ring forms by connecting C1 and C5, that would form a five-membered ring (since the chain is five carbons, but the ring would be five, as it's a cyclic structure).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the possible ring sizes. For a five-carbon chain, the possible rings are 4-membered, 5-membered, etc.

Wait, but wait, when the catalyst breaks the double bond and forms a new one by connecting two ends, the ring size is determined by the positions of the two ends.

So, for example:

- If the new double bond forms between C1 and C4, that would create a four-membered ring (C1-C2-C3-C4, then back to C1 via the new double bond).

Wait, but the chain is longer than that. Alternatively, connecting C2 and C5 would form a four-membered ring, as that's the distance between those two carbons.

Alternatively, connecting C1 and C5 would form a five-membered ring.

So, the possible products would be the different ring sizes formed.

But wait, another possibility is that the metathesis could occur in such a way that a six-membered ring forms, but that's probably less likely.

But wait, the starting molecule is five carbons long. So, a ring would involve some of those carbons.

Another approach: the Grubbs catalyst can cause the molecule to undergo ring-closing metathesis, and the possible products would be different rings based on where the ring forms.

So, in 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is at C1-C2, and the substituent is at C3. So, the possible rings would be:

1. Connecting C1 and C5, forming a five-membered ring.

2. Connecting C2 and C5, forming a four-membered ring.

3. Connecting C1 and C4, forming a four-membered ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about this again.

The molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

The possible sites for ring closure would involve the breaking of the double bond and the formation of a new double bond between two other carbons in the chain.

For example, breaking the C1-C2 double bond and forming a new double bond between C2 and C5.

In that case, the product would be a four-membered ring: the new double bond is between C2 and C5.

Alternatively, the new double bond could form between C1 and C4, making a four-membered ring as well.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think about the structure again.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think of the possible rings formed and then count the stereoisomers.

But back to the problem: the molecule is racemic, which suggests that it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers at C3.

Wait, but in the metathesis reaction, would the configuration at C3 affect the product? Or would the reaction proceed in a way that the stereocenter is no longer present in the product?

Hmm, perhaps the ring closing would lead to different diastereomers because the configuration at C3 might influence the ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring closing would lead to a new stereocenter.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of what products are formed.

Assuming the reaction forms a ring, let's say a four-membered ring, what would the structure look like?

If the new double bond forms between C2 and C5, the ring would involve C2, C3, C4, and C5.

The structure would become a cyclobutene derivative.

But wait, let me write it out.

After ring closing, the structure would be:

If the new double bond is between C2 and C5, the ring would be a four-membered ring. So, the structure would be a cyclobutene ring, with substituents.

But how? Let me think: The original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Breaking the C1-C2 double bond, and forming a new double bond between C2 and C5.

So, the new structure would be a cyclobutene ring with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product would be 3-methylcyclobutene or something similar.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product could be a five-membered ring.

Wait, but how many different products would form? The question is about the number of possible products, excluding ethene.

So, if the ring can form in different ways, leading to different ring sizes, each with possible stereoisomers, then the number of products would increase.

But perhaps for each possible ring size, there are multiple stereoisomers.

But considering that the starting material is racemic, would that lead to different product enantiomers?

Wait, but after ring closure, perhaps the stereogenic center in the starting material is no longer present, as the ring formation might eliminate it.

Alternatively, the ring closure could create new stereogenic centers.

Hmm. Let's think about the possible products.

Let me try to think of the possible ring sizes.

1. Five-membered ring:

If the ring forms by connecting C1 and C5, the new double bond would be between C1 and C5, making a five-membered ring.

Wait, but that would require breaking the existing double bond and reforming a new one across the chain. Alternatively, perhaps the ring would involve C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5, forming a five-membered ring.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring forms between C2 and C5, creating a four-membered ring.

Another possibility is that the ring forms in more than one position.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule can form two different four-membered rings, depending on where the metathesis occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the ring can form a five-membered ring and a four-membered ring, each with different substituents.

Wait, but considering the structure, perhaps more than one ring size is possible. So, how many distinct ring products can form?

If the ring can form a four-membered and a five-membered ring, then that's two possibilities. But wait, perhaps more.

Wait, perhaps the ring can form in more than one way, leading to different structures.

Alternatively, perhaps each possible ring closure leads to different diastereomers. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that Grubbs catalyst will cause the olefin to undergo ring-closing metathesis, forming a cycloalkene. The possible cycloalkenes depend on which positions the metathesis occurs.

In this molecule, the possible ring sizes are four and five.

Wait, but let me think. After breaking the double bond between C1 and C2, the metathesis can form a new double bond between C2 and C5, forming a four-membered ring, or between C1 and C4, forming a four-membered ring as well.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible products.

In any case, the problem is asking for the number of possible products, excluding ethene. So, if each ring closure leads to a different product, and considering stereochemistry, perhaps the number is more than one.

Wait, but the question is about how many products, not the structures. So, perhaps for each possible ring size, there's a certain number of stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the racemic starting material leads to a certain number of diastereomers in the product.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to think about the possible products.

Assuming that the metathesis forms a five-membered ring, what would that look like? Let's say the new double bond is between C1 and C5. The structure would be a cyclopentene derivative. But I'm not sure about the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a bicyclic compound, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms different rings based on where the catalyst acts. So, if the metathesis can occur in two different ways, leading to different ring sizes, then each would be a different product.

So, if the possible ring sizes are four and five, that would give two products, but perhaps more.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products and their structures.

Another possibility is that the reaction produces a mixture of different ring sizes, such as four-membered and five-membered rings, each with their own stereochemistry.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo more than one metathesis pathway, leading to multiple products.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is that there are two possible products, so the answer is D) 2.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is racemic, so would that double the number of products?

Alternatively, perhaps each ring closure leads to a different diastereomer, and considering both R and S configurations, that would result in more products.

Wait, perhaps the number of possible products is 3 or 4.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, meaning it's a 50:50 mix of two enantiomers. Each enantiomer would have the same possible ring products, but the ring formation might involve the configuration at C3.

Wait, but perhaps when the ring forms, the configuration at C3 becomes part of the ring, leading to different diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring closure doesn't involve the stereogenic center, leading to the same product regardless of the starting enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps each possible ring size would result in two diastereomers, leading to more products.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each possible ring size would form only one product, so the number of ring sizes would be the number of products.

But earlier I thought that the possible ring sizes are four and five, leading to two products.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the possible ways the ring can form.

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the double bond breaks, and the two ends (CH2 and CH3) form a new double bond, but that would produce ethene and a larger molecule, which is not desired because the question says to exclude ethene.

Wait, but maybe the metathesis doesn't produce ethene but instead forms a ring.

So, perhaps the possible ring products are from different ring sizes.

Wait, perhaps the ring can form in two different ways, leading to two different ring sizes: four and five.

So, that would give two possible products.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in more than one way, leading to more products.

Wait, perhaps each possible ring size would result in two stereoisomers, but since the starting material is racemic, perhaps the products are also racemic, but the question is asking for the number of products, excluding ethene.

If the ring can form in two different ways (four and five-membered rings), each with their own stereochemistry, perhaps the total number of products is more.

Alternatively, perhaps each ring size can form two products due to stereoisomerism.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of an example.

If the ring is four-membered, the structure would be a cyclobutene derivative. The substituents would come from the chain.

In the starting molecule, the substituents are CH3 on C3.

After ring formation, the substituents would be in specific positions, leading to different diastereomers.

So, if the ring forms a four-membered ring, perhaps there are two possible diastereomers, leading to two products. Similarly, for a five-membered ring, perhaps another two products.

But that would make four products in total.

Alternatively, perhaps the four-membered ring forms in two different ways, leading to two products, and the five-membered ring forms in two different ways, leading to another two products. So, four products.

Wait, but perhaps each ring size can form one product due to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the four-membered ring forms in only one way, and the five-membered ring forms in another way, leading to two products.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: the metathesis of an allylic substituted alkene can lead to different products depending on where the ring forms.

In the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible products after ring-closing metathesis would be:

1. A four-membered ring (cyclobutene derivative).

2. A five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative).

Each of these would have their own substituents.

Now, considering the substituents, perhaps each ring size leads to a mono-substituted ring.

So, perhaps each ring size would be a single product.

So, two products in total.

But wait, the molecule has a methyl group on C3, so perhaps the substituents in the ring would be different for each ring size.

Wait, for a four-membered ring, the substituents would come from C3 and C5, perhaps leading to a methyl group in the ring.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct number of products is four. But why?

Wait, perhaps the ring can form in two different ways, each leading to a different diastereomer, and each ring size can have two stereoisomers. So, four products.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the racemic starting material leads to two stereoisomeric products, each for a different ring size.

So, two products in total.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: Grubbs catalyst can cause different types of ring-closing metathesis. In this case, the molecule can form either a four-membered or a five-membered ring. Each ring would have different substituents and thus be a different product.

So, two possible products.

Thus, the answer would be D) 2.


Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure **CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃**, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and there is a stereogenic center at C3 due to the presence of four different substituents (CH₂ from C2, CH₃, CH₂ from C4, and a hydrogen). The molecule exists as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers.

When treated with Grubbs catalyst, a ring-closing metathesis occurs. This reaction involves the breaking of the double bond and the formation of a new double bond between two carbons in the chain, resulting in the formation of a cyclic alkene. The possible products depend on the positions of the carbons that form the new double bond, which determines the size of the resulting ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Possible Ring Sizes**:
   - A **four-membered ring** can form if the new double bond is between C2 and C5.
   - A **five-membered ring** can form if the new double bond is between C1 and C5.

2. **Exclusion of Ethene**:
   The question specifies that ethene (a byproduct of cross-metathesis) should be excluded. Therefore, only the cyclic products are considered.

3. **Stereochemistry**:
   The starting material is racemic, meaning it contains both enantiomers of the stereogenic center at C3. However, the ring-closing metathesis eliminates the stereogenic center, as the resulting cyclic product does not retain the chirality of the starting material. Thus, the stereochemistry of the starting material does not lead to additional stereoisomeric products.

4. **Number of Products**:
   The reaction can produce two distinct cyclic products based on the ring size:
   - A four-membered ring.
   - A five-membered ring.

   These two products are structurally and chemically distinct, leading to a total of **two possible products**.

### Conclusion:
The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst results in two possible cyclic products, excluding ethene.
