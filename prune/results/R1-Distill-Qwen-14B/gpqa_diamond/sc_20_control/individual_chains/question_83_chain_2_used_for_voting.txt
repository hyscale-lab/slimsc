Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. First, I think I should start by understanding what's happening in each step of the process. 

So, the first part is diluting acetic acid with water. Let me calculate the concentration after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases. But wait, since it's a weak acid, dilution should increase the dissociation, but for the initial concentration after dilution, I can use the dilution formula.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration (C2) can be found using C1V1 = C2V2.

C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 = (0.05 M * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, 0.05 M *20 cm³ is 1 mmol (since 1M is 1 mmol/cm³). Diluting to 40 cm³ makes it 0.025 M. Right.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, the equivalence point will be when all the acetic acid is neutralized. But before that, at 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Wait, but wait. First, let's find out how much NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point. For that, I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles of acetic acid = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH is 0.1 M. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration. So volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the equivalent point, so 25% of the required NaOH. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But I think another approach is to compute how much acetic acid has been neutralized at 25% titration. Let me think: the total moles of acetic acid is 0.001. 25% of that is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added, which would neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid. So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but wait. The total volume at 25% titration is the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So 42.5 cm³ total volume.

Hmm, that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent everything in terms of moles and concentrations.

So, first part: pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So using the buffer solution equation, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be useful here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

So, [A^-] is the concentration of acetate ions, [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.

At 25% titration, the amount of acetate formed is 25% of the original acetic acid. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.25)/(0.75) = 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3).

Wait, but wait. The pKa is given from the Ka. Let me compute pKa first.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, no. pKa = -log(Ka). Right. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5).

Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So, back to pH at 25% titration: pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, so approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A says pH 4.26 as the first value, and option D has 4.57 as the first, which is higher.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, but when we add NaOH, the total volume changes, affecting the concentrations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the concentrations more precisely. Let me detail it.

Original volume after dilution: 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So moles of NaOH added: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

So, in the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

The moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

So, concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So, the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. So 1/3. Same as before.

So, pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26. So the pH at 25% is 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, and option D is 4.57. So A and D are possible, but let's see the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

So, the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point needs to be calculated.

Total moles of acetate at equivalence point is 0.001 mol. The total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³). So 50 cm³ total, 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The pH can be found using the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] concentration:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 /0.02 (since Kb is very small).

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. Hmm, but none of the options have a pH near 9.02. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, the volume at equivalence point is 40 cm³ (original diluted solution) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ total. So 0.05 L.

Molarity of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Right.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. Let's denote the concentration of OH^- as x.

So Kb = x^2 / (0.02) → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let's compute that.

Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 +0.017 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983 → pH = 14 -4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have equivalence pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option B:3.17;6.73

Option C:4.73;7.00

Option D:4.57;6.92

Hmm, the equivalence point is around 9, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the dilution. Let me recheck my initial steps.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M, which we did right.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 mol CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO^-.

So the concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

What's the pH of 0.02 M acetate?

Wait, another approach is to calculate the pH using the formula for a weak base solution:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - log C )

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for acetate as a base.

Wait, the Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

Another way is to use the formula:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

Which is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH ≈4.98, pH≈9.02, as before.

But none of the options have pH near 9. So perhaps I'm wrong about something.

Wait, wait a minute. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid after dilution was 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added must be 0.001 mol. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Correct.

So the volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 cm³, correct.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M. So that's correct.

Hmm, why none of the options have pH near 9? Let's check all options.

Option A: Equivalence pH 8.52.

Option D: 6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I forgot that the solution is a buffer because of the dilution and the way the NaOH is added. No, wait, at equivalence point, all the acid has been neutralized, so it's just the conjugate base. So shouldn't the pH be basic?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in Kb.

Wait, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, another way: perhaps the solution is assuming that the solution is not in a buffer but a strong base.

Wait, no, because acetate is a weak base, so the solution will be basic, but not strongly basic.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH^-].

Wait, let's compute [OH^-] more accurately.

x^2 = Kb * C → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) → let's compute this accurately.

What's the square root of 1.081e-11?

Well, sqrt(1.081) is approximately 1.04. Then sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.16e-6? Wait, no.

Wait, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5= 3.16e-6. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6 M.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, 1e-11 is 1e-11 → sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5= 3.16e-6.

So sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) → 1.04 *3.16e-6 → approx 3.29e-6 M.

Wait, that's [OH^-] = 3.29e-6 → pOH= -log(3.29e-6)=5.48 → pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Ah, wait, that's different from before. Wait why?

Because earlier I thought x was 1.04e-5, but now I'm getting 3.29e-6. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) → 1.04 * 3.16e-6 → 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6 M.

So pOH = -log(3.29e-6) → let's compute log(3.29e-6).

Log(3.29)=0.517, so log(3.29e-6)=0.517 -6 =-5.483 → pOH=5.483.

pH=14-5.483=8.517, approximately 8.52.

Ah, now that makes sense. So the pH at equivalence point is 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. So option A seems correct.

Wait, but earlier when I thought x was 1.04e-5, which gave pOH of about 4.98, pH ~9.02. But that's incorrect because I think I made a mistake in the calculation of x.

Wait, perhaps I confused Kb with Ka or made a miscalculation when computing x.

Wait, let me recompute x: x^2 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02.

5.405e-10 *0.02 = (5.405 * 0.02) e-10 → 0.1081e-10 → 1.081e-11.

So x^2 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) → let me compute this accurately.

What's sqrt(1.081e-11)?

Well, sqrt(1.081)=1.04 approximately. So sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.5?

Wait, no. Let's think in exponents: 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. Because 5.5 *2=11.

So sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5=3.16e-6.

So 1.04 *3.16e-6 = 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.29e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is 8.52.

Thus, the pH at 25% is 4.26 and at equivalence is 8.52. So option A is correct.

Wait, but what about the other option? Let me look at the options again:

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Yes. So option A is the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( C_1V_1 = C_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The diluted solution contains 0.001 moles of acetic acid (calculated as \( 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} \)).

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. This means:

- Moles of acetic acid remaining: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of acetate ions formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is \( 40.00 + 2.5 = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, (\text{rounded to } 4.26).
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total moles of acetate are \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \), and the total volume is \( 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0500 \, \text{L} \). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.0200 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is \( 8.52 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. First, I think I should start by understanding what's happening in each step of the process. 

So, the first part is diluting acetic acid with water. Let me calculate the concentration after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases. But wait, since it's a weak acid, dilution should increase the dissociation, but for the initial concentration after dilution, I can use the dilution formula.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration (C2) can be found using C1V1 = C2V2.

C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 = (0.05 M * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, 0.05 M *20 cm³ is 1 mmol (since 1M is 1 mmol/cm³). Diluting to 40 cm³ makes it 0.025 M. Right.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, the equivalence point will be when all the acetic acid is neutralized. But before that, at 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Wait, but wait. First, let's find out how much NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point. For that, I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles of acetic acid = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH is 0.1 M. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration. So volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the equivalent point, so 25% of the required NaOH. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But I think another approach is to compute how much acetic acid has been neutralized at 25% titration. Let me think: the total moles of acetic acid is 0.001. 25% of that is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added, which would neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid. So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but wait. The total volume at 25% titration is the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So 42.5 cm³ total volume.

Hmm, that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent everything in terms of moles and concentrations.

So, first part: pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So using the buffer solution equation, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be useful here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

So, [A^-] is the concentration of acetate ions, [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.

At 25% titration, the amount of acetate formed is 25% of the original acetic acid. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.25)/(0.75) = 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3).

Wait, but wait. The pKa is given from the Ka. Let me compute pKa first.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, no. pKa = -log(Ka). Right. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5).

Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So, back to pH at 25% titration: pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, so approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A says pH 4.26 as the first value, and option D has 4.57 as the first, which is higher.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, but when we add NaOH, the total volume changes, affecting the concentrations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the concentrations more precisely. Let me detail it.

Original volume after dilution: 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So moles of NaOH added: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

So, in the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

The moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

So, concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So, the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. So 1/3. Same as before.

So, pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26. So the pH at 25% is 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, and option D is 4.57. So A and D are possible, but let's see the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

So, the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point needs to be calculated.

Total moles of acetate at equivalence point is 0.001 mol. The total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³). So 50 cm³ total, 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The pH can be found using the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] concentration:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 /0.02 (since Kb is very small).

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. Hmm, but none of the options have a pH near 9.02. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, the volume at equivalence point is 40 cm³ (original diluted solution) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ total. So 0.05 L.

Molarity of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Right.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. Let's denote the concentration of OH^- as x.

So Kb = x^2 / (0.02) → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let's compute that.

Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 +0.017 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983 → pH = 14 -4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have equivalence pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option B:3.17;6.73

Option C:4.73;7.00

Option D:4.57;6.92

Hmm, the equivalence point is around 9, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the dilution. Let me recheck my initial steps.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M, which we did right.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 mol CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO^-.

So the concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

What's the pH of 0.02 M acetate?

Wait, another approach is to calculate the pH using the formula for a weak base solution:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - log C )

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for acetate as a base.

Wait, the Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

Another way is to use the formula:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

Which is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH ≈4.98, pH≈9.02, as before.

But none of the options have pH near 9. So perhaps I'm wrong about something.

Wait, wait a minute. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid after dilution was 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added must be 0.001 mol. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Correct.

So the volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 cm³, correct.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M. So that's correct.

Hmm, why none of the options have pH near 9? Let's check all options.

Option A: Equivalence pH 8.52.

Option D: 6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I forgot that the solution is a buffer because of the dilution and the way the NaOH is added. No, wait, at equivalence point, all the acid has been neutralized, so it's just the conjugate base. So shouldn't the pH be basic?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in Kb.

Wait, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, another way: perhaps the solution is assuming that the solution is not in a buffer but a strong base.

Wait, no, because acetate is a weak base, so the solution will be basic, but not strongly basic.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH^-].

Wait, let's compute [OH^-] more accurately.

x^2 = Kb * C → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) → let's compute this accurately.

What's the square root of 1.081e-11?

Well, sqrt(1.081) is approximately 1.04. Then sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.16e-6? Wait, no.

Wait, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5= 3.16e-6. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6 M.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, 1e-11 is 1e-11 → sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5= 3.16e-6.

So sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) → 1.04 *3.16e-6 → approx 3.29e-6 M.

Wait, that's [OH^-] = 3.29e-6 → pOH= -log(3.29e-6)=5.48 → pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Ah, wait, that's different from before. Wait why?

Because earlier I thought x was 1.04e-5, but now I'm getting 3.29e-6. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) → 1.04 * 3.16e-6 → 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6 M.

So pOH = -log(3.29e-6) → let's compute log(3.29e-6).

Log(3.29)=0.517, so log(3.29e-6)=0.517 -6 =-5.483 → pOH=5.483.

pH=14-5.483=8.517, approximately 8.52.

Ah, now that makes sense. So the pH at equivalence point is 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. So option A seems correct.

Wait, but earlier when I thought x was 1.04e-5, which gave pOH of about 4.98, pH ~9.02. But that's incorrect because I think I made a mistake in the calculation of x.

Wait, perhaps I confused Kb with Ka or made a miscalculation when computing x.

Wait, let me recompute x: x^2 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02.

5.405e-10 *0.02 = (5.405 * 0.02) e-10 → 0.1081e-10 → 1.081e-11.

So x^2 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) → let me compute this accurately.

What's sqrt(1.081e-11)?

Well, sqrt(1.081)=1.04 approximately. So sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.5?

Wait, no. Let's think in exponents: 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. Because 5.5 *2=11.

So sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5=3.16e-6.

So 1.04 *3.16e-6 = 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.29e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is 8.52.

Thus, the pH at 25% is 4.26 and at equivalence is 8.52. So option A is correct.

Wait, but what about the other option? Let me look at the options again:

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Yes. So option A is the correct choice.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( C_1V_1 = C_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The diluted solution contains 0.001 moles of acetic acid (calculated as \( 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} \)).

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. This means:

- Moles of acetic acid remaining: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of acetate ions formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is \( 40.00 + 2.5 = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, (\text{rounded to } 4.26).
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total moles of acetate are \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \), and the total volume is \( 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0500 \, \text{L} \). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.0200 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is \( 8.52 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
