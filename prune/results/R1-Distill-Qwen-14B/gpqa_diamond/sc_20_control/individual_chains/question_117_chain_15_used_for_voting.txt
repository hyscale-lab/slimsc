Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, right? I remember that stereoisomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. Optical isomers are a type of stereoisomer that are not mirror images of each other, which leads to them being non-superimposable.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. I think optical isomerism refers to compounds that have chiral centers, which make them have enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images, which means they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. So if a molecule has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Let me look at each of the given compounds and see if they have any chiral centers or if they can exhibit stereoisomerism.

The compounds are:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

Let me go one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the structure is a biphenyl group (two benzene rings connected by a single bond), with substituents at positions 2 and 2' (the dicarboxylate groups) and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. The substituents are at the 2 and 2' positions. Since it's a biphenyl, the single bond between the two benzene rings can allow for rotation, but wait, in some cases, steric hindrance can lead to restricted rotation, causing the possibility of cis and trans isomers. But is the molecule chiral?

Wait, let me think. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs to have a chiral center. Or, perhaps in this case, the biphenyl system can have axial chirality, but that's more about the arrangement around the central bond.

Alternatively, does this compound have any stereogenic centers? Let's see. The substituents on each benzene ring are at the 2 and 6 positions. The 2 and 2' positions have OCO2Me groups, and the 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups.

Wait, the substituents on each benzene ring are all at the same positions. So each benzene ring has two substituents, but are they in a way that any of the carbons are chiral? No, because each ring is attached to two groups in the same positions. Wait, but are the substituents arranged symmetrically?

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each phenyl ring are in such a way that the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. No, because the substituents are in 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, but the 2,2' and 6,6' substituents... Would that create any chiral centers? Let me think: the central bond is between two benzene rings. The substituents are on each ring, but are any of the carbons attached to four different groups?

Wait, in the structure, each benzene ring is attached to two substituents (a nitro and a dicarboxylate group). So let me consider each carbon in the rings. Each ring has two substituents. Are any of the carbons in the rings attached to four different groups?

Wait, the carbons in the rings are each attached to the ring, a methyl ester (from the dicarboxylate), a nitro group, and another ring? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. 

Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carbonyl group (as part of the ester) at position 2. So each ring has two substituents. Now, the central bond is between the two rings, so each ring is attached to the other at the 1 position.

I'm not sure if this leads to a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Maybe the molecule is symmetrical, hence no chiral centers. Or perhaps the central bond allows for free rotation, making any stereoisomerism impossible.

Wait, but sometimes when you have substituents on a biphenyl, especially in certain positions, the molecule can have axial chirality, which is a type of stereoisomerism where the two rings are connected in a way that their substituents are not mirror images. But for that, the substituents on each ring need to be arranged in such a way that they create non-superimposable mirror images.

Alternatively, maybe this molecule has a center of symmetry. If it does, then it wouldn't have optical isomerism because the molecule would be achiral.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this one. Let me move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH.

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, so in the structure, the hydroxyl group is on the second carbon, which is adjacent to the carbonyl group. So the structure is O

So, the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH2 group? Wait, wait. Let me draw it.

The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (middle)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and what else? Wait, the central carbon is the second carbon. Let me count: the carboxylic acid is the third carbon. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH(OH)- connected to Carbon 1 and 3.
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- OH
- and another hydrogen?

Wait, no. Wait, no. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (Carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (Carbon 3)
- OH
- and another group? Hmm, wait. Wait, the central carbon is CH(OH), so it has four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen. So wait, does that mean it's a chiral center?

Yes! Because the four substituents are all different: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that carbon is a chiral center, which means the molecule has optical isomerism. So compound 2 can exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is the phenyl group. So the structure is two benzene rings connected to a ketone group (C=O).

In this case, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (but one is double-bonded in the ketone). Wait, no. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the carbon in the middle is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and another single bond to an oxygen? No, wait, no. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups (each Ph), a carbonyl group (double-bonded to O), and what's the fourth group? Wait, the central carbon is part of the ketone. So it's:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the carbon has double bond to O, and single bonds to two Ph groups. Wait, that's three substituents. So, no, it's actually:

The structure is Ar–C(=O)–Ar, where Ar is aryl group (phenyl). So the ketone carbon has a double bond to O, and two aryl groups attached. So the central carbon would have three substituents: two Ph groups and a double-bonded O.

Wait, no, in a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to two R groups. So in this case, two phenyl groups. That's three substituents. So, the central carbon would have two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and what else? Oh wait, no, the central carbon is in the middle, so it's connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. So, it's connected to three groups, which makes it trigonal, not tetrahedral. Hence, no chiral center.

Wait, but wait, carbon in a ketone is sp2 hybridized. So it can't have four substituents. So in this case, the molecule is symmetric, so it doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a diacid with two double bonds. When made into an ester, like dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
     |
     O

Wait, no, more accurately, fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. Wait, no, actually, wait. Maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid, and fumaric acid is the (E) isomer. But wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the cis isomer. No, actually, wait. Fumarate is the (E) isomer, while maleate is the (Z) isomer. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the structure.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the diester where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Wait, no, the structure of fumarate is actually (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. It's more like:

       O
       ||
O-C-OCH3   O-C-OCH3
       \     /
        C=C

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

The molecule is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So the dimethyl ester would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me.

So the structure is:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me ?

No, wait, no. Wait, fumarate would have the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

But that's not possible, because each end of the double bond can only have one COOCH3 group. Wait, no. Let me correct.

The correct structure is: 

The molecule has a central double bond (C=C), with each carbon of the double bond attached to a carbonyl group (COOCH3). So, it's MeO2C–CH2–CH2–CO2Me? No, wait, no. The actual structure is MeO2C–CH=CH–CO2Me, but arranged in a way that the two ester groups are on opposite sides (E configuration).

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of fumarate is that the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making it a trans configuration. So each carbon of the double bond is connected to a carbonyl group (COOCH3). So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

But wait, that would imply that each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, which isn't correct. Each carbon can only have one.

Wait, perhaps the structure is MeO2C–CH2–CH2–CO2Me, but that's just a single bond. No, no, fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans (E) diacid. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and each of those carbons has a COOCH3 group on opposite sides.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|     |
COOCH3

No, that's not right. Each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So it's like:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But since it's E, the groups are on opposite sides. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, so each carbon of the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one CH3 group? No, wait, in fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, each end of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group. So each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and another substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

The key point is that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides, making it a trans configuration. Now, can this compound exhibit optical isomerism?

Wait, optical isomerism is about chirality, which requires a chiral center. But this molecule has a double bond, which can have geometric isomerism (cis-trans), but that's not optical isomerism.

Alternatively, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule might be symmetrical. Wait, no. Because if the molecule has a center of symmetry, then it would be achiral.

Wait, the structure of fumarate is such that each COOCH3 is on opposite sides. So, imagine looking at the double bond, the OCH3 groups are on opposite sides. If the molecule has a center of symmetry, it would not be chiral. For example, if for every atom on one side, there's an equivalent on the other, then it's symmetrical.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each COOCH3 is on opposite sides, but are the two substituents the same? If both substituents are COOCH3, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the two groups on each end are identical, like (CH2CH3), then the molecule might be symmetrical. But in this case, both substituents are the same (COOCH3), so the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait, if both substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. So for example, if the structure is (CH3OOC)CH=CH(COOCH3), but arranged in the trans configuration, then each end is the same, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, in the E configuration.

Wait, but even if the substituents are the same on each end, like both COOCH3, the molecule can still have a plane of symmetry. So, if you have a double bond with two identical groups on either side, the molecule is symmetrical, so it won't be chiral.

Wait, but in that case, dimethyl fumarate wouldn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should consider if the molecule can have any chiral centers. Are there any carbons attached to four different groups?

Looking at the structure, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group, a hydrogen (maybe?), and two other substituents. Wait, no. Let me think: each carbon in the double bond (the two carbons in the center) are each attached to a COOCH3 group and are connected via a double bond. So, each has two COOCH3 groups? No, each has one COOCH3, and is connected via a double bond to the other.

Wait, each carbon in the double bond is attached to:

- COOCH3 group
- The other carbon (double bond)
- And what else?

Ah, wait, each of those carbons is also attached to another substituent. In the case of fumarate, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. No, wait, no. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

But that's not correct because each carbon in the double bond can't have two COOCH3 groups attached. Each must have only one, and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

But that's not possible. Each COOCH3 is on a separate carbon, each connected via a double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3, a double bond to the other carbon, and two hydrogens.

Wait, so each of those carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- Double bond to the other carbon
- Two H's

So, each of those carbons is attached to four groups: COOCH3, two H's, and the double bond. Wait, no, wait. A double bond doesn't count as a substituent for the purpose of tetrahedral centers. So, each carbon in the double bond is sp² hybridized, with three substituents: COOCH3, another double-bonded carbon, and two H's.

Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to three groups: COOCH3, the double bond (so another carbon attached by a double bond), and one H (maybe). Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. For a double bond structure like CH2=CH2, each carbon is connected to two H's and the other carbon via a double bond. So in the case of fumarate, each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3
- One CH2 group (from the other end)
- One H
- And the double bond.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon is connected to:

- COOCH3
- Two H's
- And a double bond to the other carbon.

So, each of those carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, two H's, and the double bond. So, each is sp² hybridized, not sp³, so no chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let me think of the structure of fumarate. It's (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. The dimethyl ester would be MeO₂CCH=CHCO₂Me. So, the structure is:

MeO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂Me?

No, no, that's a single bond. Wait, no, the structure is MeO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂Me? No, wait, no. No, no, the structure is MeO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂Me would be succinic acid dimethyl ester, but fumarate has a double bond.

Wait, correct structure is MeO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂Me, but in the trans configuration.

So the four substituents around each double bond carbon are:

- COOCH3
- CH2 (from the adjacent COOCH3)
- H
- Double bond.

Wait, no, each carbon is connected to:

- COOCH3 group
- The other carbon in the double bond
- Two H atoms.

So each carbon in the double bond has three substituents: COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond to the other carbon. Hence, each is sp² hybridized, no chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, am I missing any other substituents? Are there any other groups attached?

No, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

But each C in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group? No, perhaps each is connected to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, no, each C in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 group on each. So, the carbons are each attached to:

- COOCH3
- Double bond to the other C
- And two H's.

So, each has three substituents, making them trigonal (sp²), not tetrahedral. So, no chiral centers. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, sometimes in some structures, even if there's no chiral center, there can be a plane of symmetry that makes the molecule achiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, making it achiral.

So, so far, the only compound that definitely shows optical isomerism is compound 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but I'm not sure about compound 1. Let me go back to that.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Biphenyl structure: two benzene rings connected by a single bond between the 1 positions. The substituents are at 2 and 2' (dicarboxylate) and 6 and 6' (dinitro).

So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester group at position 2.

Wait, the positions are numbered such that the two benzene rings are connected at position 1. So, on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6.

In such a case, each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Now, the question is whether the molecule has any chiral centers.

Wait, the central single bond between the two benzene rings allows for rotation, but in some cases, particularly when the substituents are in positions that restrict rotation, the molecule can adopt a certain configuration.

But in this case, with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, I'm wondering if the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical, then it wouldn't be chiral. Alternatively, the substituents could be arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a dicarboxylate at 2. So if you look at the structure, each ring's substituents are in positions that are para to each other.

Wait, the substituents on each benzene ring in compound 1 are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the point of attachment to the other ring (position 1). So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2.

Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the substituents on each ring are in positions that could lead to a chiral arrangement. But wait, each ring's substituents are in the same positions relative to the point of attachment. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are 1,3,5 positions relative to the connecting point.

Wait, maybe this setup leads to the molecule being symmetrical. For instance, if the two rings each have substituents in positions that mirror each other, the entire molecule might be symmetrical, hence not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers. Each benzene ring's carbon atoms are part of the aromatic ring, so they're sp² hybridized. The only possible chiral centers would be on the benzene rings, which aren't possible because they're part of a planar structure.

Wait, but maybe the central single bond is a point of stereoisomerism. In biphenyls, when the substituents are in certain positions, the molecule can have axial chirality, which is a form of stereoisomerism where the two rings are connected in such a way that their substituents are not mirror images.

Axial chirality occurs when the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that cannot be superimposed on their mirror images. For this to happen, each ring must have at least one substituent, and those substituents must be arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate group. If these substituents are arranged in a way that their positions on each ring are not mirror images, the molecule could have axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If looking from the central bond, each ring's substituents could be arranged in a way that their positions create non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, for example, if on the first ring, the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate is at 2, and on the second ring, the nitro is at 6' and the carboxylate is at 2', then the substituents could be on the same side or opposite sides relative to the central bond.

Wait, but in that case, if they're on the same side, the molecule would be symmetrical, but if they're on opposite sides, it would not.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure.

The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6 (relative to the connecting point at position 1).

So, for each ring, substituent positions are at 2 and 6. Now, if the substituents on both rings are arranged in a way that they are on the same face or opposite faces, the molecule can exhibit axial chirality.

Wait, perhaps it's analogous to tartaric acid, where the central axis is the line between the two chiral centers, and the substituents on each end create the chirality.

In this case, the two benzene rings could rotate around the central bond. If the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions relative to each other create a chiral axis, then the molecule would exhibit axial chirality and hence optical isomerism.

But how can I determine if that's the case?

Axial chirality typically arises when the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not mirrored when looking along the central bond. For example, for each ring, substituents in the 2 and 6 positions could be arranged such that their positions lead to a chiral axis.

In compound 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, the nitro at 6 and the carboxylate at 2, perhaps on the same side relative to the central bond.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions are mirror images, then the molecule would be symmetrical and not chiral. But if they are not mirror images, then the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that they are not mirror images, leading to axial chirality.

But without a clear way to visualize, I'm not entirely sure. However, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate sounds familiar as a compound that has axial chirality, hence exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, I've heard that compounds like biphenyl with substituents in the 2 and 6 positions can have axial chirality. For example, binaphthyl compounds are known for axial chirality.

Therefore, I think compound 1 can exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

So, the compounds that can exhibit optical isomerism are:

1. Yes, due to axial chirality.

2. Yes, due to a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 didn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. So, the correct options would be 1 and 2.

Looking back at the options:

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, according to my analysis, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, which corresponds to option D.

Wait, but let me confirm. Compound 1: axial chirality. Compound 2: chiral center.

Yes, so D is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which can arise from chiral centers or axial chirality.

### Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond at the 1 positions, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents include nitro groups at 6 and carboxylate ester groups at 2. The central single bond allows for rotation, but the substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring can create axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that they are not mirror images, leading to non-superimposable stereoisomers. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is attached to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exist as non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### Compound 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. This carbon is sp² hybridized and trigonal planar, not tetrahedral, and therefore cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Hence, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂ in the (E)-configuration. The double bond between the two carbons is geometrically rigid, and the substituents on each carbon are identical (one COOCH₃ group and one CH₂ group). The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Additionally, there are no chiral centers in the molecule. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality and a chiral center, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism as they lack chirality. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
