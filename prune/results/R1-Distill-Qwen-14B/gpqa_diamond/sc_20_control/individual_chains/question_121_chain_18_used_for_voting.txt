Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down. The question is about reacting a specific epoxide with an organocuprate, and figuring out the product. Hmm, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically add to epoxides in specific ways.

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, bicyclo structures can be tricky. Let me try to visualize this. The 7-oxabicyclo implies that the epoxide oxygen is at position 7. The bicyclo [4.1.0] means it's a norbornene-like structure. So, the molecule has three rings: a five-membered and a two-membered ring, but wait, noâ€”bicyclo[m.n.p] is the notation where m, n, p are the number of carbons in each bridge. So [4.1.0] would have bridges of 4, 1, and 0? Wait, no, I think the numbers represent the number of carbons between the bridgeheads. So for a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, there are three bridgeheads. The structure is norbornane, I think. So in norbornane, the bicyclo structure is two bridgeheads connected by a four-carbon bridge, another bridge of one carbon, and another bridge (the bridge with the oxygen in this case) of zero? Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the formula for bicyclo[m.n.p] is C(m+n+p+1). So for [4.1.0], m=4, n=1, p=0, so C(4+1+0+1)=6? But the compound is heptane, which is 7 carbons. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo is [4.1.0] which would have two bridgeheads connected via three bridges: one with four carbons, another with one, and another with zero (so that's just a single bond, meaning it's a bridge, but perhaps the oxygen is part of that). 

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine the structure. The compound is 7-oxabicyclo, so the oxygen is at position 7. So the structure would have a bridge with the oxygen. Let me draw it mentally: the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have two bridgeheads, say, positions 1 and 6. The bridge between them would have four carbons (positions 1-2-3-4-6?), one carbon (like 1-5-6), and another bridge that's just a single bond? Or perhaps the bridges are 4, 1, and 0, meaning that the third bridge is not there, meaning the two bridgeheads are connected by a single bond, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the oxygen is in the bridge.

Wait, perhaps the structure is similar to norbornene. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, which has two rings. Our compound is different, but perhaps it's a bicyclo with a smaller bridge. Let's think, the substituents are 1R, 3R, 4R, and 6S. So the molecule has three methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4, and the oxygen is at 7. Wait, that's a bit confusing.

So, the molecule is a bicyclo structure with an epoxide oxygen. The reaction is with Me2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile. Organocuprates add to epoxides in a specific way. I remember that when epoxides react with organocuprates, the nucleophile adds to the less hindered carbon. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration when the nucleophile attacks.

Wait, the question says that when saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. So the organocuprate (Me2CuLi) acts as a nucleophile, and the methyl group will add to the less hindered carbon.

But wait, in disubstituted epoxides, when the nucleophile adds, the configuration at the carbon where the Nu adds inverts. So, if the original epoxide has a certain configuration, the product will have the opposite configuration at that carbon.

Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclo structure with multiple substituents. So I need to figure out which carbon is more hindered and which is less, and then where the methyl group will add.

First, I need to determine the structure of the starting epoxide. Let me try to imagine it. The bicyclo system is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So the molecule is a seven-membered ring, but arranged as a bicyclo, meaning it's actually a norbornane-like structure but with a different bridge. Let's think: the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have bridgehead carbons connected by bridges of 4, 1, and 0 carbons. So, the bridge with 4 carbons would be the largest. So, positions 1 and 6 are the bridgeheads. The bridge between them with four carbons would go through positions 1-2-3-4-6. The bridge from 1 to 6 via one carbon would go through position 5. And the bridge via zero carbons would just be a single bond (the bridge is nonexistent, perhaps, making it a fused ring). Hmm, maybe it's a structure with two fused rings: a five-membered and a two-membered? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as a bicyclo structure where the oxygen is part of one of the bridges.

Wait, the compound is 7-oxabicyclo, so the oxygen is at position 7. So the epoxide ring is between carbons 7 and another carbon. So positions 7 and perhaps 1?

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 7. Wait, in bicyclo structures, the numbering starts at a bridgehead and proceeds around the ring. So, perhaps the epoxide is between the bridgehead and another carbon.

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me instead think about the reaction. The key points are:

1. The organocuprate adds to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.
2. In disubstituted epoxides, inversion occurs at the carbon where the Nu adds.

But the starting epoxide is a bicyclo structure, which is probably a norbornene-like compound with an epoxide. So, the epoxide is part of a bridge. Let's imagine the epoxide is a ring with two carbons connected by an oxygen. So, the two carbons that are part of the epoxide are, say, carbons 1 and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 7. Let's say the epoxide is between C1 and C7. So, the two carbons in the epoxide are 1 and 7.

Now, the substituents are at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The configuration is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So, the methyl groups are at C1, C3, C4, and C6 (but wait, wait, the compound is 1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo... so only three methyl groups: 1,3,4. Hmm, the formula says 1,3,4-trimethyl, so methyl groups at 1,3,4. The 6 is S configuration, but I don't know if that's a methyl or part of the bicyclo.

Wait, the compound is 1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo. So, the methyl groups are on C1, C3, and C4. The 7-oxa part is the epoxide oxygen, so C7 is the oxygen. So the structure is a bicyclo ring with an epoxide (O) at C7, and methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.

Now, the reaction is with Me2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile. The organocuprate will add a methyl group to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. So, the two carbons in the epoxide (let's say C1 and C7) will each have a certain level of hindrance. The one that's less hindered is the site where the methyl will add.

But wait, in a bicyclo structure, each carbon is connected to other bridgeheads and has substituents. So, for the epoxide carbons (probably C1 and C7), which of these is less hindered?

In the bicyclo system, C1 is a bridgehead, likely to be more substituted. If the epoxide is between C1 and another carbon (like C7), then C1 is a bridgehead and has more substituents, meaning it's more hindered. On the other hand, C7 is connected to the oxygen and perhaps has fewer substituents. So the methyl group from the cuprate would add to the less hindered carbon, which is C7, but wait, the epoxide is between C1 and C7, but in the structure, what are the substituents?

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between two non-bridgehead carbons. Wait, perhaps in the bicyclo structure, the epoxide is between C7 and another carbon, say, C5. So, in that case, perhaps the two epoxide carbons are C5 and C7. Let's think if that makes sense.

Wait, maybe it's easier to draw the structure. Let me consider the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So, the bridgeheads are at positions 1 and 6. The bridge between them with four carbons would go from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 6. The bridge from 1 to 6 via one carbon would be through position 5. The bridge via zero carbons would be between 1 and 6 directly, but that's already the two bridges.

So, the structure would look like this: two bridgeheads at 1 and 6. From 1, a chain goes to 2,3,4,6. From 1, another bridge goes through 5 to 6. So, the structure is a bicyclo with two bridges: one is the 4-carbon bridge (1-2-3-4-6) and the other is a single carbon bridge (1-5-6). So, the oxygen is at position 7. Wait, but the molecule is 7-oxabicyclo, meaning position 7 is the oxygen. So perhaps the oxygen is in another position.

Wait, perhaps the bicyclo has three bridges. The [4.1.0] implies the three bridges: 4, 1, 0. So, the bridges are between 1 and 6 via 4 carbons, 1 and 6 via 1 carbon, and 1 and 6 via 0 carbons (meaning a single bond). Wait, but how would that form a structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is connected to two bridgehead carbons. So, the two carbons in the epoxide are 1 and 6, each being bridgeheads. Then, the epoxide is between 1 and 6, which are the two bridgeheads. So, in that case, where would the methyl group add?

The methyl groups in the starting material are at C1, C3, and C4. So, C1 is a bridgehead with a methyl group. When the organocuprate attacks, it would add to the less hindered of the two epoxide carbons.

So, in the epoxide between C1 and C6 (if that's where the oxygen is), C1 has a methyl group and is a bridgehead, which is likely more hindered. C6, the other bridgehead, has no methyl group (since the substituents are only at 1,3,4). So, the methyl group from the cuprate would add to the less hindered carbon, which is C6.

Wait, but the starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So, C6 is S configuration. So, when the methyl adds to C6, which is less hindered, what happens to the configuration?

Since the nucleophile adds to the less hindered carbon (C6), and in disubstituted epoxides, inversion occurs at the carbon where Nu adds. So, the configuration at C6 would invert.

Wait, but in the epoxide, the two carbons are C1 and C6. The organocuprate adds a methyl group to C6. Let's think about the mechanism. The epoxide ring will open, and the methyl from the cuprate will add to C6, while the oxygen will attack the other carbon (C1). But wait, in organocuprate addition, the mechanism is a ring-opening via a cyclic transition state, with the nucleophile adding to one carbon and the other oxygen attacking the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should recall: when an organocuprate adds to an epoxide, the nucleophile (like Me-) attacks the less hindered carbon, which then leads to the ring opening. The mechanism typically involves the cuprate abstracting a proton, then the nucleophilic attack happens. But in some cases, the attack is more of a concerted process.

Alternatively, I think the ring opens with the nucleophile attacking the less hindered carbon, leading to the formation of an alkoxide, which then gets protonated.

But in any case, the configuration at the carbon where the methyl adds will invert if it's a disubstituted epoxide. So, in this case, the epoxide is between C1 and C6. Let's say the methyl adds to C6, which is the less hindered. The configuration at C6 will invert.

So, the starting configuration at C6 is S. After inversion, it becomes R.

Wait, but wait, the starting material's configuration is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So, if the methyl adds to C6, which is S, the configuration inverts to R.

But then, what about the other carbon (C1) in the epoxide? It would get the oxygen, but which configuration?

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the stereochemistry more carefully. When the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, the addition occurs with inversion of configuration. So, if the original epoxide carbon (C6) is S, after attack, it becomes R.

But wait, in this case, the epoxide is part of a bicyclo structure. The configuration of the starting material is 1R,3R,4R,6S. So, when the methyl adds to C6, which was S, the configuration there becomes R.

But how does the addition affect the rest of the molecule? The bicyclo structure will open up, and the product will be a cyclohexanol derivative.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol with substituents from the bicyclo.

Wait, the starting molecule is a bicyclo epoxide, and upon opening with Me2CuLi, the product would be a cyclohexanol derivative with the methyl groups from the original bicyclo and the added methyl.

Let me think about the possible product structures. The options are all tetramethylcyclohexanol derivatives. So, the product will have four methyl groups: the three from the starting material and the added methyl from the cuprate.

Wait, no: the starting material is 1,3,4-trimethyl, and the cuprate adds a methyl. So, the product will have four methyl groups, as in the options.

So, the product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.

Wait, but wait: when the epoxide opens, does the ring expand? Because the bicyclo structure is opening into a cyclohexane.

Let me think. The starting material is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane epoxide. So, when the epoxide opens, it becomes a six-membered ring. So perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.

So, the product's structure is a cyclohexanol with methyl groups at 1,2,4,5 positions, perhaps.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Option D is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Hmm. So the product's configuration depends on the attack of the methyl group and the inversion.

Wait, the key here is that the attack occurs at the less hindered carbon (C6), leading to inversion of configuration there.

But let's think about the original structure. The original substituents are at 1R,3R,4R,6S. So, when the methyl adds to C6, which is S, it becomes R. Then, the rest of the substituents would determine the configuration of the other carbons.

Wait, perhaps the numbering in the product is different because the ring has expanded. So, the original C1 is now perhaps C1 or C2 in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering shifts when the ring opens. Let me try to imagine the ring opening. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an epoxide at C7 (assuming that's between C1 and C6) would open to form a cyclohexanol where the substituents are from the original bridgeheads.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the chair conformation or the ring expansion. When the epoxide opens, the bridge between C1 and C6 is broken, and the ring expands to form a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo structure is such that when the epoxide opens, a new ring is formed with substituents in specific positions.

Wait, perhaps the addition of methyl to C6 would lead to the formation of a cyclohexanol with the following substituents:

- The original methyl groups at C1, C3, C4 would now be at certain positions in the cyclohexane.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the product structure.

The product is cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. The options have substituents at positions 1,2,4,5.

So, the alcohol is at position 1, and methyl groups are at 2,4,5, and 1 (wait, no, 1 is the OH, so the methyl groups are at 2,4,5, and another position? Wait, options say tetramethyl, so 4 methyl groups in total, including the OH at 1.

Wait, the product is a cyclohexanol, which has an -OH group at a certain position. The other substituents are methyl groups.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol

So, the OH is at position 1. The methyl groups are at 2,2 (so two at 2), 4, and 5.

Option B: 1R,4R,5R, with methyl groups at 2,2,4,5.

Option C: 1R,2R,4R,5R, methyl groups at 1,2,4,5 (but wait, the OH is at 1, so methyl at 1 would be the same as the OH? No, the OH is at position 1, which is an -OH group, not a methyl. Hmm, perhaps the numbering is different.

Wait, perhaps the numbering in the product is such that the OH is at position 1, and the other substituents are at 2,4,5, and another position.

Alternatively, maybe the product has the OH at position 1, and methyl groups at 2,4,5, and another position.

But regardless, what's important is the configuration at each carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack on the less hindered carbon (C6) leads to the inversion of configuration at that carbon. So, the original configuration at C6 was S. After attack, it becomes R.

But in the product, the position that was C6 in the epoxide would correspond to which position in the cyclohexane?

Hmm, maybe it's getting too complicated. Another approach: in the epoxide addition, the methyl adds to the less hindered carbon, which leads to inversion. This would affect the configuration.

In the starting material, the configuration is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So, after adding the methyl to C6 (inverting S to R), the configuration at C6 becomes R.

But in the product, the positions may have shifted.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has methyl groups at positions that were the original substituents plus the new methyl from the cuprate.

Wait, the starting material has methyl groups at 1,3,4. The cuprate adds a methyl to, say, position 5. So, the product has methyl at 1,3,4, and 5. But looking at the options, some have methyl at 2,4,5, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the bicyclo structure again. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has seven atoms in total. The epoxide is between two of them, let's say C1 and C7. When the epoxide opens, the bridge between them is broken, and the ring expands into a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol with substituents at positions 1,2,4,5. Let me think about the attack.

The methyl adds to the less hindered carbon, which is C7 (if C1 is more hindered). So, the methyl is added to C7, leading to inversion at that position.

Wait, but the product is a cyclohexanol, so the position where the methyl adds becomes the OH group? No, the organocuprate adds a methyl, and the oxygen becomes an alcohol.

Wait, the mechanism is that the cuprate (Me-) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, leading to ring opening. The oxygen then gets a negative charge and picks up a proton (from the workup) to become an -OH group.

So, in the starting epoxide, each carbon is connected via an oxygen bridge. The methyl adds to one carbon, and the other becomes the -OH group.

So, in our case, if the methyl adds to C6, then C6 becomes CH2-O-... Wait, no, the attack would break the epoxide ring. Let me think: the epoxide is between C1 and C6. The methyl adds to C6, so C6 now has a methyl group and it becomes CH2-Me. The other carbon (C1) becomes connected to the oxygen, which then becomes the -OH group after protonation.

Wait, but the initial molecule is a bicyclo, so when the epoxide opens, the ring expands. So, the product would be a cyclohexanol with substituents from the original bicyclo.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to imagine the transition. The bicyclo structure has two bridgeheads (C1 and C6), with substituents at C3 and C4.

When the epoxide opens, the bridge between C1 and C6 is broken, and the ring expands. The methyl group adds to C6, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group on C1.

So, the product would have methyl groups at C1 (from the cuprate?), C3, C4, and possibly another position.

Wait, perhaps the original substituents are at C1 (R), C3 (R), C4 (R), and C6 (S). The methyl adds to C6, making it R configuration, and the oxygen becomes attached to C1.

But when the ring opens, the positions shift. Let me consider that the product is a cyclohexanol where the OH is at position 1, and the methyl groups are at positions 2, 4, 5, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups in the product are at 2,2,4,5. Looking at the options, option A has methyl groups at 2,2,4,5, and the OH at position 1.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product has four methyl groups: the three from the starting material (1,3,4) plus the added methyl at position 5 (from C6). So, the product would have methyl at 1,3,4,5. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

A) ...2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...

B) ...2,2,4,5...

C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl...

D) 1,2,4,5...

Wait, the starting material's methyl groups are at 1,3,4. So, after adding a methyl at position 2 or 5, the product would have four methyl groups.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry.

In the starting material, the configuration at C6 is S. After the methyl adds, it becomes R. So, in the product, what position corresponds to C6?

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration at position 5 is R, based on the inversion.

Wait, perhaps the product will have the configuration at the site of addition being R.

Looking at the options, option C has all R configurations (1R,2R,4R,5R), and option D has one S (2S).

Hmm. Since the methyl adds to the less hindered carbon, which would be the one with the S configuration in the starting material, leading to inversion to R. So, in the product, that position would be R.

Now, considering the positions in the product, if the attack is at position 2, which was the less hindered, then that position would be R.

Wait, perhaps the attack is at position 2, leading to inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's C6 is position 5 in the product. So, in the product, the configuration at position 5 is R.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)

Option D: (1R,2S,4R,5R)

So, if the configuration at the site of addition is R, then in the product, the configuration would match option C or D based on which position it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has the OH group at position 1, and the methyl groups at 2,4,5, and another position (like 1, but that's the OH).

Wait, the product is a cyclohexanol, which has an -OH at a specific position. The other substituents are methyl groups.

Given that the starting material's methyl groups are at 1,3,4, after the reaction, which of these become substituents in the product?

Hmm, perhaps the methyl groups at 1,3,4 of the bicyclo become substituents at positions 1,2,4, and 5 in the cyclohexanol.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's methyl groups are at 2,2,4,5. So that would match option A or B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the options, option D is (1R,2S,4R,5R).

Since the addition occurs with inversion, the configuration at the site of addition (say, position 2) would go from S to R? Or wait, noâ€”the original configuration is S in the starting material. After inversion, it's R.

Wait, if the attack is at the S position, which inverts to R, then in the product, that position would be R.

Looking at option C, all positions are R, but option D has S at position 2.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option C or D.

Wait, perhaps the product's configuration depends on the original structure. Let me think about the chair conformation.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that in the product, the configuration at the position where the methyl was added (originally S) is now R. So, in the product, that position is R.

Looking at the options, position 5 in options C and D are R. So maybe the added methyl is at position 5.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: when the organocuprate adds to the epoxide, the methyl adds to the less hindered carbon. If the starting epoxide has more substituents on one carbon (like C1), then the methyl adds to the other (C6). Since C6 is S, after inversion, it's R. The original substituents (methyl) at C1, C3, C4 would translate to specific positions in the product.

If the product is a cyclohexanol with methyl groups at 1,2,4,5, perhaps the positions are arranged such that the added methyl is at position 5, which in the product is R.

So, in the product, the configurations would be:

- 1: R

- 2: ?

- 4: R

- 5: R

Looking at the options, option C is (1R,2R,4R,5R), which would fit if all these positions are R. But why would position 2 be R?

Alternatively, perhaps the original substituents determine the positions. The original methyl at C3 and C4 would end up as substituents at positions 2 and 4 in the product. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's best to look for the correct answer by process of elimination.

Wait, another thought: the product's configuration must have inversion at the attack site. So, if the attack was at a carbon that was S, it becomes R. So, in the product, that position is R.

Looking at the options, which have R in the positions that were originally S.

Original: 6S â†’ after attack, becomes R.

But in the product, the positions have shifted. For example, if the attack was at position 5, which was S, then in the product, position 5 is R.

So, looking at the options:

Option C: 5R

Option D: 5R

So, both options C and D have 5R.

But the other configurations matter too. The original substituents at C1, C3, C4 are R. So, in the product, where are these substituents?

Perhaps the product has the OH at position 1, and methyl groups at 2,4,5 (from the original substituents and the added methyl). So, the methyl groups are at 2,4,5 and another position.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option D, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: the starting material has (1R,3R,4R,6S). The methyl adds to the less hindered carbon, which is C6 (S). The attack leads to inversion, making C6 R.

In the product, the OH would be at C1, and the methyl groups would be at the original positions (1,3,4) and the new methyl at C6.

But when the epoxide opens, the structure expands. So, the bicyclo ring becomes a cyclohexane. Thus, some substituents may shift positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has methyl groups at 2,4,5, and 1 (the OH), but that's not possible since the OH is an -OH group, not a methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol with methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. So, the starting material's methyl at 1 remains, the methyl at 3 becomes 2, the methyl at 4 remains, and the added methyl is at 5.

So, the product would be (1R,2R,4R,5R), which is option C.

But wait, the original methyl at 3: if position 3 in the bicyclo becomes position 2 in the cyclohexane, then the configuration would change. For example, if the bridgehead C3 becomes position 2 in the product, its configuration might change.

Alternatively, maybe the configuration remains the same, so the R configuration at C3 becomes R at position 2 in the product.

Thus, the product would have R configurations at positions 1,2,4,5.

Which is option C.

So, the product is option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves the reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with Meâ‚‚CuLi, an organocuprate. Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles that add to epoxides by attacking the less hindered carbon, leading to inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon in disubstituted epoxides. The starting material is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane derivative with an epoxide oxygen at position 7 and methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4. The configuration of the starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane system has two bridgeheads at positions 1 and 6. The epoxide oxygen is at position 7, forming a bridge between positions 1 and 7. The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 3, and 4, with the configuration at position 6 being S.

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   - The organocuprate (Meâ‚‚CuLi) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. In this case, position 7 (the carbon with the epoxide oxygen) is less hindered compared to position 1 (a bridgehead with a methyl group).  
   - The methyl group from the cuprate adds to position 7, leading to inversion of configuration at this carbon. Since the starting configuration at position 7 is S, it becomes R after the attack.

3. **Product Formation**:  
   - The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane ring opens, forming a cyclohexane derivative. The methyl groups from the starting material (positions 1, 3, and 4) remain in the product.  
   - The methyl group added by the cuprate is at position 5 in the product.  
   - The hydroxyl group (-OH) forms at position 1, where the epoxide oxygen was originally located.

4. **Stereochemistry of the Product**:  
   - The original configuration at position 1 (R), position 3 (R), and position 4 (R) remains unchanged.  
   - The configuration at position 5 (formerly position 7) inverts from S to R due to the nucleophilic attack.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  
     This is incorrect because the configuration at position 1 is S, which contradicts the original R configuration at position 1.  
   - **Option B**: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  
     This is incorrect because the methyl groups are at positions 2,2,4,5, which does not match the expected distribution of substituents.  
   - **Option C**: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  
     This is correct. The methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5, and the configurations at all positions match the expected stereochemistry after the reaction.  
   - **Option D**: (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  
     This is incorrect because the configuration at position 2 is S, which contradicts the expected R configuration.

### Conclusion:
The correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. 

Answer: C
