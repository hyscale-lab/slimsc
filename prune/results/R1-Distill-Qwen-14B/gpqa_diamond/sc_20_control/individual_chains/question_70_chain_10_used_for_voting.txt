Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again to understand the reactions and what each product is. The problem gives a series of reactions and some properties of the products. I need to figure out what each of these substances is, especially focusing on E, because that's what the question is about.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. What could this be? I'm thinking about elements or compounds that react in such a way. 8 equivalents is a lot, so maybe B is something that bonds in a way that requires multiple atoms. Like, perhaps B is a diatomic gas, like Cl2 or O2, but 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. Wait, another thought: maybe B is a halogen. Let's think about the bright red product. Oh, maybe C is something like sulfur hexafluoride? No, that's colorless. Alternatively, think about transition metals. Oh, wait, maybe A is a metal reacting with a halogen.

Wait, another thought: if C is a compound with a lot of B atoms, perhaps B is a diatomic molecule, and each molecule contributes two atoms. So 8 equivalents of B would mean 16 B atoms? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where B is a diatomic gas, and 8 equivalents would mean 8 molecules. So each molecule of B contributes two atoms, so 8 × 2 = 16 B atoms per A molecule.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the other reactions to see if that helps. The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A, and two acids. One strong (like HCl?), one weak (like H2SO4, but that's strong too... wait, maybe HNO2? No. Or perhaps H3PO4, which is a weak acid.)

Wait, but let's think about the third reaction. C + H2O → A + F + G. So, C must be some compound that when it reacts with water, breaks down into A, an acid, and another acid. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, but maybe C is a metal fluoride. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again about the first reaction. If A reacts with B (a gas) 8 times to make C, and then C reacts with D to make E. Let's think about possible compounds.

Wait, what if B is Cl2? Because in some reactions, metals react with Cl2 in large amounts. For example, aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a burning reaction, but not sure about the product. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe, and B is Cl2. But FeCl3 is a possible product. But FeCl3 is not bright red.

Wait, another thought: the bright red product. Could it be something like PbO2? No, that's dark brown. Maybe it's a transition metal sulfide? Or perhaps a compound with a high symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like SO3 or something else.

Wait, another angle: The second reaction is C + 2D → E, which is extremely hazardous. D is a gas. So, what gases could react with C? Let's say D is O2. Then, C reacting with O2 would produce something. But E is extremely hazardous. Alternatively, D could be a halogen like Cl2 again. But let me think about another possibility.

Wait, let's look at the last reaction: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, H is a solvent, which suggests something like HCl, but HCl is a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O. No, because B is a gas, D is a gas, so their combination could be something like HCl if B is Cl2 and D is H2. Wait, but D and B react in 1:1 ratio. HCl is formed from H2 and Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio. So, H would be HCl. But wait, HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, unless H is another solvent, like perhaps H2O. Wait, but D and B are gases.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, in a 1:1 ratio, they form HCl (H is HCl), which is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is Cl2, but then H would be ClO2 or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is something else. Maybe D is another gas like NH3? No, that's a gas, but what reaction would that have with B, another gas, in 1:1 ratio? Maybe B is O2 and D is H2, forming H2O. But H2O is a liquid, so that's a possibility. So H is H2O, a solvent. That could make sense.

So, if D is H2 and B is O2, then their reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio is 1:1, so H2 and O2 in 1:1 ratio would produce H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So H is H2O.

Now, let me think about the first reaction again. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2?), but wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule. So, 8 equivalents of O2 would be 8 moles. So, A + 8 O2 → C (bright red). What solid reacts with O2 in such a way?

Wait, maybe A is a metal. Let's think about metals reacting with O2. For example, aluminum reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. But Al2O3 is white, not red. Iron can form FeO (which is black), Fe3O4 (black), Fe2O3 (red). Oh! Fe2O3 is commonly known as rust, and it's a reddish color. So, if A is Fe, and B is O2, then Fe + O2 → Fe2O3? Let's see the stoichiometry.

The reaction is: 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So, 4 moles of Fe react with 3 moles of O2. But the problem states that A reacts with 8 equivalents of B. So, if 3 moles of O2 are used per 4 moles of Fe, then in the problem, 8 moles of O2 would react with (4/3)*8 = 10.666... moles of Fe. That's possible, but I'm not sure if the problem is implying that it's an 8:1 ratio.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is Fe reacting with Cl2. Fe burns in Cl2 to form FeCl3. Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So, 2 moles Fe react with 3 moles Cl2. If in the problem, A is Fe and B is Cl2, then 8 moles Cl2 would require (2/3)*8 = 5.333 moles Fe. But the product in that case is FeCl3, which is a yellowish solid, not bright red. So that's probably not it.

Wait, but the product C is bright red. So perhaps it's not Fe2O3. Another possibility for a bright red product is something like mercury(II) oxide, but that's red. Or maybe it's a different metal oxide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is a bright green solid, but maybe another form? Or maybe it's a sulfide? Not sure. Alternatively, could C be a compound of another element?

Wait, maybe A is sulfur and B is something else. But sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3, which are colorless or pungent but not bright red.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a bright red compound. For example, manganese(II,III) oxide is black, but maybe a different oxidation state.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, CuS is black, but perhaps another sulfide. Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the hydrolysis reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, when C is reacted with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, but in hydrolysis, if C is a salt of a strong base and a weak acid, it would hydrolyze to produce a weak acid and a strong base. But in this case, the products are A, F (strong acid), G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, releases two different acids. That sounds a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water forms two different acids.

Wait, but A is the original solid. So, if C is a salt (like a metal sulfate), and when it reacts with water, it decomposes back into A and releases two different acids. Hmm, not common. Alternatively, perhaps C is a complex compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride that when hydrolyzed gives back the metal hydroxide (A) and two acids. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking at the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. If D is H2 (since in the earlier thought, D and B (O2) react to form H2O as H), then C + 2 H2 → E. That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Wait, but earlier I thought D could be H2 if B was O2.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2. Then, C + 2 Cl2 → E. Maybe E is something like SO2 or another dangerous gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the D and B reaction. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is a solvent, like water or ethanol. But D and B are both gases. So H could be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is H2O, which is a solvent. So D and B must be H2 and O2. Because 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2. But the problem states that D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, so that would require H2 and O2 in 1:1 ratio. Hmm. Wait, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So for 1 mole H2 and 0.5 mole O2, 1:0.5 ratio. But the problem says 1:1. So maybe the reaction is H2 + O2 → H2O, but it's an incomplete reaction because typically 2 H2 + O2 is needed. So perhaps the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, but in a 2:1 ratio. Therefore, for a 1:1 ratio, perhaps it's H2 and O2 in a 1:1 ratio, but that would mean 0.5 moles of O2 reacting with 1 mole H2 to form 1 mole H2O. But I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, maybe H is not water. Maybe it's another solvent like ethanol, but ethanol is not formed from two gases reacting in 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, H would be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the other reactions first. Let's think about product E. It's extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous compounds? Maybe sarin gas, or something like phosgene, or perhaps something else. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but that's formed from reacting C with D.

Wait, maybe D is something like Cl2. Because Cl2 is a common gas in such reactions. So, if C reacts with Cl2 to form E, which is hazardous. Let me think about possible reactions.

Wait, another approach: The first reaction gives C as a bright red product. Let me think about some bright red compounds. One that comes to mind is Fe(OH)3, but that's a reddish-brown gelatinous precipitate. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, what about the compound As2O3 (arsenic trioxide)? It's a bright red solid. But I'm not sure about the reactions here.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Let me think about the hydrolysis reaction again. C + H2O → A + F + G. So, if C is a metal oxide, when it reacts with water, it would form a metal hydroxide and an acid. Wait, but F and G are acids. So, maybe C is a salt that releases two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate salt. For example, if C is Na2SO4, then hydrolysis would produce NaOH (a strong base) and H2SO4 (a strong acid), but in the problem, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, hydrolysis would produce Ca(OH)2 and HNO3. Ca(OH)2 is a base, so F and G would be HNO3 (strong acid) and maybe another acid. Wait, no, because hydrolysis of a nitrate salt would produce nitric acid, which is strong, and a metal hydroxide, which is a base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite salt. For instance, if C is Na2SO3, then hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). So F would be NaOH (a strong base), but the problem says F is a strong acid. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. If C is Na2CO3, hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2CO3 (which is a weak acid). Again, F is a strong acid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is a metal sulfide, like FeS, then hydrolysis would produce the metal hydroxide and H2S gas (a weak acid). But then F and G would both be weak acids, which doesn't fit since F is a strong acid.

Hmm, maybe C is a different kind of compound. Let me think of the possible reactions again.

Wait, another approach: What if C is a transition metal chloride? For example, if A is Al, and B is Cl2. Then, Al reacts with Cl2 to form AlCl3. But AlCl3 is a white solid, not bright red. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a transition metal in a higher oxidation state, like Fe^3+? Fe2(SO4)3 is yellow, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a mixed oxide.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the possible products and their properties.

From the reactions, when C reacts with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that contains both a strong acid anion and a weak acid anion. For example, if C is NH4HSO4, which contains both HSO4- (acts as a weak acid) and NH4+ (which hydrolyzes to produce a weak base, NH3, but that would give a weak base, not an acid). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a metal sulfite? Let's say C is FeSO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into Fe(OH)2 and H2SO3. Fe(OH)2 is a weak base, but H2SO3 is a weak acid. But then F would have to be a strong acid, which it's not. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrite, like Fe(NO2)2. Hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)2 and HNO2. HNO2 is a weak acid, so again, only a weak acid is produced. But the problem says F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt containing both Cl- and another anion.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate or something similar. Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about E again.

E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. E is extremely hazardous. So, what are possible E compounds?

Wait, if E is a highly toxic gas, possibilities include HCN (hydrogen cyanide), but that's more of a toxic liquid. Or perhaps phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Or sarin gas, but that's an organophosphorus compound. Alternatively, chlorine gas is dangerous, but C and D would have to be something that produces Cl2. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: E is a highly toxic metal, like mercury or arsenic compounds. But E is produced via a reaction involving C and D. Hmm.

Alternatively, E could be a product of a redox reaction. For example, if C is Fe2O3 and D is H2, then E could be Fe metal and water. But that's not dangerous. Alternatively, if C is FeCl3 and D is H2, then E would be Fe and HCl, which again isn't dangerous.

Wait, perhaps E is something like NO or NO2. NO is a toxic gas. So, let's think about that. If C is a metal oxide and D is something that can reduce it. For example, if C is Fe2O3 and D is CO (carbon monoxide), but CO is a gas. Alternatively, D could be H2. Fe2O3 + H2 → Fe + H2O. That's a reaction, but E would be Fe and H2O, which isn't dangerous. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of a reaction between C and D that involves oxidation or reduction. For example, if C is a metal sulfide and D is O2, then E could be SO2, which is a toxic gas. So, let's see: if C is FeS and D is O2, then 4 FeS + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3 + 2 SO2. SO2 is a toxic gas, so E would be SO2. That could fit. But then what about the first reaction?

Wait, if C is FeS, then the first reaction would be A + 8 B → FeS. FeS is a black solid, not bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different sulfide. Wait, maybe something like CuS is black too. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is PbO2, but that's dark brown. Hmm.

Another angle: The hydrolysis of C produces two acids. So, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is sodium bisulfate (NaHSO4), which when dissolved in water would dissociate into Na+, HSO4^- (which can donate a proton to form H+ and SO4^2-). But that's not two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts, but the problem states it's a product, so maybe a single compound.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfonic acid. But that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a hydrate. No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about what each reaction could be, step by step.

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent), in a 1:1 ratio.

Let me try to assign possible chemicals to each.

Assuming H is a solvent, let's think of H as H2O. So, D and B must combine to form H2O. So, D and B must be H2 and O2. Because 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So, the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. Therefore, D is H2, B is O2. So their reaction is in a 2:1 ratio, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe the reaction is H2 + O2 → H2O under specific conditions, but in reality, the stoichiometric ratio is 2:1.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something else. For example, if H is NH3, but NH3 is a gas and a solvent? Wait, NH3 is a gas at room temperature but can act as a solvent in its liquid form. But how would D and B form NH3? That would require N and H, but D and B are both gases. Let me think: If D is NH3 and B is H2, but that doesn't make sense because the reaction would need nitrogen, which isn't present.

Alternatively, maybe D is CO2 and B is H2O, but that's not a gas. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let me assume that B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl, which is a gas but not a solvent. So that doesn't fit. So H would need to be a solvent, which suggests H is H2O.

So, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then, H is H2O, formed in a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2. But the problem states that D and B react in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So, 2 moles H2 react with 1 mole O2. So, the ratio is 2:1, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, this is a problem. Unless the reaction is adjusted to 1:1, perhaps in a different condition or with a different stoichiometry. Maybe using a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O3 (ozone), but that's a stretch.

Wait, another thought: Maybe D is O2 and B is something else. Let me think: If D is O2 and B is another gas, but their reaction forms H which is a solvent. Hmm, but what reaction between O2 and another gas would form a solvent?

Wait, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O, but both are gases. Their reaction would produce something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is H2, but then their reaction would produce CO and H2O under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of a different approach. Let me consider possible E compounds and backtrack.

E is extremely hazardous. Let me think of possible E compounds:

- Phosgene (COCl2): toxic gas.
- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN): toxic gas.
- Sulfur dioxide (SO2): toxic gas.
- Nitrogen dioxide (NO2): toxic gas.
- Chlorine gas (Cl2): itself有毒, but the product E is from reaction of C and D.

Wait, if E is SO2, then perhaps C reacts with D (maybe O2) to produce SO2. So, C could be a sulfide, like FeS. But FeS is black, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, if E is NO2, then perhaps C is a nitrate and D is something that reduces it. For example, if C is AgNO3 and D is Zn metal, but D is a gas, so that's not possible.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide and D is another gas. Let's think: If C is Fe2O3 and D is CO (carbon monoxide), then Fe2O3 + CO → Fe + CO2. But that's a redox reaction, and CO is a gas. But the product would be Fe and CO2, which aren't dangerous. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is FeO and D is Cl2, then FeO + Cl2 → FeCl2 + O2. Not sure if that's dangerous.

Hmm, perhaps E is a product like HCN. So, how would that form? Maybe from a reaction between C (a cyanide salt) and D (a strong acid). But D is a gas, so perhaps D is H2O or H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a liquid, not a gas. So, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C contains cyanide ions, and D is a strong acid like H2SO4 (but that's a liquid). Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2, and C is KCN. Then, KCN + Cl2 → KCl + HCN. HCN is a toxic gas. So in this case, E would be HCN. But then, what's C? KCN is a salt, and when it reacts with water, it would produce K+ and CN- which hydrolyzes to produce HCN and KOH. So, that would fit the third reaction: C (KCN) + H2O → K (metallic potassium?) No, because KCN hydrolyzes into HCN and KOH. But then F would be HCN (weak acid) and G would be KOH (strong base, which doesn't fit because the problem says G is a weak acid). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem says that when C reacts with water, it produces A (the original solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives back A (the metal), a strong acid, and a weak acid. For example, if C is a nitrate and a sulfate salt.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which is sodium bisulfate. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^- ions. The HSO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to form H+ and SO4^2-. So, HSO4^- is a weak acid. But then where does the strong acid come from? Hmm, perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a metal bicarbonate? For example, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+, HCO3^- → which can hydrolyze into H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, that gives a base, not an acid. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide. Wait, but C is a product of a reaction between A and B, which are solid and gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much, but under certain conditions, it can produce some CO2 and some hydroxide. But that doesn't fit the problem.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. For example, Al(NO3)3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to produce Al(OH)3 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid, which would be F. So, F is strong acid, and Al(OH)3 is a weak base, but the problem states that G is a weak acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, CuSO4. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Cu^2+ and SO4^2- ions. Cu^2+ can hydrolyze to form Cu(OH)2 and H+ ions. So, SO4^2- is a weak acid (HSO4^- is a weak acid). So, F would be H+ (from water), but that's not a real acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal sulfite. Let's say Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into 2 NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, but then F would be NaOH (a strong base), which doesn't fit because F is a strong acid. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chlorate, like KClO3. Hydrolysis would produce KCl (a neutral salt) and HClO3 (a strong acid). But then, where does the weak acid come from? Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. For example, a salt that contains both a nitrate and a sulfate. But that's complicated, and I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reactions again.

In the first reaction, A + 8 B → C (bright red). If B is O2, then perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. For example, Chromium forms Cr2O3, which is green, but maybe another metal. Wait, manganese can form MnO2, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. Let's say A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3. But those are colorless. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a transition metal oxide with a high spin state, giving it a red color. For example, perhaps it's a cobalt oxide. Cobalt(II,III) oxide is black, but maybe another form. Alternatively, perhaps it's a copper oxide. CuO is black, Cu2O is reddish. Oh! Cu2O is a bright red or orange solid. So, if C is Cu2O, that fits the bright red color.

So, if C is Cu2O, then let's see what reactions would imply.

First reaction: A + 8 B → Cu2O. So, what is A and B? If B is O2, then A would be Cu. Because copper reacts with O2 to form CuO (black) or Cu2O (red). The reaction is 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. But if it's Cu2O, perhaps it's formed under different conditions. Let me check: The reaction of copper with O2 can form CuO, but under certain conditions, like in the presence of moisture, it might form Cu2O. Alternatively, perhaps B isn't O2 but another gas.

Wait, but in this scenario, let's proceed. Let's say B is O2, A is Cu, and C is Cu2O. Then, in the second reaction, C (Cu2O) reacts with 2 equivalents of D (gas) to form E (extremely hazardous). So, what reacts with Cu2O?

Wait, in this scenario, D is a gas that reacts with Cu2O. Also, D and B (O2) react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D would be a gas that, when reacted with O2 in 1:1 ratio, forms H (a solvent). Hmm.

If D is a gas that reacts with O2 in a 1:1 ratio to form H as a solvent. Let's think about possible reactions. For example, H could be H2O, which is formed from H2 and O2. So, D would be H2. Because H2 + O2 → H2O. The ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2, but the problem says 1:1. So perhaps the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio. But the problem states 1:1, which is a bit conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is under different conditions where it's a 1:1 ratio.

Assuming D is H2 and B is O2, then D and B react to form H2O (H is H2O, a solvent). Now, the second reaction is C (Cu2O) reacting with 2 D (H2) → E. So, Cu2O + 2 H2 → E. What would E be?

The reaction of Cu2O with H2 could be a reduction. Cu2O + H2 → 2 Cu + H2O. So, E would be H2O and Cu. But Cu is a solid, and H2O is a liquid. Neither is extremely hazardous. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a toxic gas. So maybe the reaction is different. If D is Cl2 instead of H2, then C (Cu2O) + Cl2 → CuCl2 + OCl2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is CO, which is a gas. Cu2O + CO → Cu + CO2. Again, not dangerous.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe B isn't O2. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another approach: If C is Cu2O, then when it reacts with water, it produces Cu, and two acids. Let's check:

Cu2O + H2O → 2 Cu + H2O + 2 OH- ? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's a reaction like Cu2O + H2O → 2 Cu(OH) + H2. No, that's not a standard reaction.

Wait, another possibility: Cu2O is a basic oxide and reacts with water to produce Cu(OH)2 and H2. Let me think about the reaction. Cu2O + H2O → 2 Cu(OH) + H2↑. If that's the case, then when C (Cu2O) reacts with water, it produces A (Cu), and H2 (a strong acid?), but that doesn't fit. Because H2 is a gas, not an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps Cu2O reacts with water under acidic conditions. Suppose C (Cu2O) is treated with H2O and an acid. But the problem states that C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So, without any added acid, perhaps it's a simple hydrolysis.

I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that C is Cu2O, and see where that leads.

So, C is Cu2O. Then, when it reacts with water, it produces Cu (A), and two acids F and G.

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis of Cu2O produces two different acids. Let me think: Cu2O is a basic oxide. When it reacts with water, perhaps it hydrolyzes to form Cu(OH)2 and H2O, but that doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Cu2O reacts with water and O2 to form Cu(OH)2 and another product. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Cu2O is treated with an acid. But according to the problem, the reaction is with water only, so no added acid.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about C being Cu2O. Let me think of another possibility.

Another bright red compound is mercuric sulfide (HgS), but that's usually black. Wait, no, HgS is actually red, called cinnabar. So C could be HgS.

So, if A is Hg and B is S (but S is a solid, not a gas), so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is another gas that reacts with Hg to form HgS. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Wait, another bright red compound is PbO2, but that's dark brown. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of another element entirely. Let me think of other bright red solids.

Oh, maybe it's Mn2O7 (manganese heptoxide), which is a bright red solid. Mn2O7 is a powerful oxidizing agent and is highly toxic. That could fit with E being extremely hazardous.

So, let's consider C as Mn2O7. Then, the first reaction would be A + 8 B → Mn2O7.

Mn2O7 is a solid, and it's bright red. What reacts to form Mn2O7? Typically, Mn2O7 is formed from the oxidation of MnO2 with strong oxidizing agents like H2O2 or other strong acids.

But in this case, A is a solid, B is a gas. So, perhaps A is MnO2, and B is a strong oxidizing gas, like Cl2. The reaction would be MnO2 + 2 Cl2 → MnCl4 + 2 O2. But MnCl4 isn't Mn2O7.

Wait, perhaps A is MnO and B is O2. But MnO reacts with O2 to form MnO2: 2 MnO + O2 → 2 MnO2. But that's not Mn2O7.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Mn metal and B is O2. The reaction would be 4 Mn + 3 O2 → 2 Mn2O3. Mn2O3 is a pinkish solid. Not bright red.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path. Let me think again.

Wait, another bright red solid is Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), but it's usually reddish-brown. Maybe in a different form it's bright red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different oxidation state.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the symmetry group of E, which is the main question. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Wait, but symmetry groups depend on the structure of the molecule. Let me think about possible E compounds and their symmetry.

If E is SO2, its molecule is bent, with a C2v symmetry. So, the symmetry group would be C2v. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, it's diatomic with D∞h symmetry. If E is HCN, it's linear, so D∞h. Phosgene (COCl2) has a trigonal planar structure with C2v symmetry. SO2 is bent, C2v. NO2 has a bent structure, C2v. HCN is linear, D∞h. Cl2 is diatomic, D∞h.

So, if E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2 or O2, the symmetry group would be D∞h. If it's a bent molecule like SO2, then C2v.

Now, looking back at the options, the choices are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

So, if E is a diatomic gas like Cl2, symmetry group is D∞h (option C). If E is SO2, then C2v (option D).

But which one is the correct E?

Earlier, I thought E might be SO2. Let's see: If C is a sulfide, like FeS, and D is O2, then FeS + O2 → FeO + SO2. SO2 is a toxic gas, which would fit the description. But then C would be FeS, which is black, not bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfate, like CuSO4, and D is something that reduces it to produce SO2. For example, CuSO4 + H2S → CuS + H2SO4. Not sure, but that doesn't directly give SO2.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. Reacting with HCl (if D is HCl, but D is a gas), but D is not necessarily HCl. Alternatively, if D is CO2, but that's a stretch.

Hmm. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the symmetry options. Let's think about the options again.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2, Cl2, or another similar gas, the symmetry would be D∞h (option C). If E is a bent molecule like SO2 or NO2, the symmetry would be C2v (option D).

Given that E is extremely hazardous, SO2 and NO2 are possibilities. SO2 has C2v symmetry, NO2 (which has resonance structures and a bent shape) also has C2v symmetry.

Another possibility: If E is HCN (linear), D∞h. But I don't know which one fits the reactions better.

Wait, let's think about the reaction of C with D to form E. If D is O2 and C is a sulfide, then E would be SO2. So, perhaps E is SO2 with C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, then symmetry is D∞h.

But without knowing exactly what E is, it's hard to choose. However, considering the options, SO2 is a common toxic gas that might fit.

So, if E is SO2, the symmetry is C2v, which is option D.

But wait, another point: the first reaction produces C as a bright red solid. If C is Cu2O, which is red, and then reacts with O2 (D) to form CuO and SO2? No, wait, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that upon reaction with O2 produces SO2. Wait, for example, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, and reacts with O2 to form FeO and SO2. FeS + 2 O2 → FeO + SO2. That's a possible reaction. But as I said earlier, FeS is black, not red. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me make a guess based on the options. The possible symmetry groups for E are C2v (option D) and D∞h (option C). Considering SO2 is a common toxic gas with C2v symmetry, I'll go with option D. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, it's D∞h.

But the problem states that E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. If E is Cl2, that would require D to be something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. The structure of phosgene is a trigonal planar with a central carbon, so its symmetry is D∞h? No, wait, COCl2 has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is planar with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, leading to D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's D2h or C2v.

Wait, the structure of COCl2 is similar to SO2, which is bent with a C2v symmetry. So, I think COCl2 (phosgene) would also have C2v symmetry.

So, if E is phosgene (COCl2), its symmetry group is C2v (option D).

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, symmetry is D∞h (option C). But I'm not certain.

Another point: the reaction between C and D produces E. If E is Cl2, then D would have to be something that produces Cl2, but that doesn't fit with earlier reactions.

Alternatively, if D is H2 and B is O2, then E might be H2O, which is not extremely hazardous. So that doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options, I'll have to make a guess. Between C (D∞h) and D (C2v), I'll go with C2v, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E, based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like Cu₂O (copper(I,II) oxide), which is reddish-orange, or Mn₂O₇ (manganese heptoxide), which is bright red.  
   - If C is Cu₂O, it is a basic oxide and could react with water to produce Cu (A), and potentially two acids (F and G).  
   - If C is Mn₂O₇, it is a highly oxidizing agent and could react with gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product.  
   - Examples of extremely hazardous compounds include SO₂ (toxic gas), NO₂ (toxic gas), HCN (toxic gas), or phosgene (COCl₂, a toxic gas).  
   - If C is Cu₂O and D is O₂, the reaction could produce Cu and H₂O, but these are not hazardous.  
   - If C is Mn₂O₇ and D is a reducing agent like H₂, the reaction could produce MnO₂ and O₂, but O₂ is not hazardous.  
   - If C is a sulfide like FeS and D is O₂, the reaction could produce FeO and SO₂, where SO₂ is a toxic gas with C₂v symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A, and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid).  
   - For Cu₂O, hydrolysis could produce Cu(OH)₂ and H₂O, but this does not fit the description of producing two acids.  
   - For Mn₂O₇, hydrolysis could produce MnO₂ and H₂O, but again, this does not fit the acid production description.  
   - If C is a sulfide like FeS, hydrolysis could produce H₂S (a weak acid) and a metal hydroxide, but this does not fit the strong acid requirement.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.  
   - If H is H₂O, D and B could be H₂ and O₂, respectively, with the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O.  
   - This aligns with D being H₂ and B being O₂, making H₂O a solvent.

5. **Symmetry of E**:  
   - If E is SO₂, it is a bent molecule with C₂v symmetry.  
   - If E is phosgene (COCl₂), it is a trigonal planar molecule with D∞h symmetry.  
   - If E is Cl₂ or HCN, it is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.  
   - Based on the reactions and the description of E as extremely hazardous, SO₂ (C₂v symmetry) or phosgene (D∞h symmetry) are plausible candidates.  
   - However, considering the hydrolysis reaction and the production of two acids, SO₂ (C₂v symmetry) is more likely.

**Conclusion**: The molecular symmetry group of E is **C₂v**.  
Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again to understand the reactions and what each product is. The problem gives a series of reactions and some properties of the products. I need to figure out what each of these substances is, especially focusing on E, because that's what the question is about.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. What could this be? I'm thinking about elements or compounds that react in such a way. 8 equivalents is a lot, so maybe B is something that bonds in a way that requires multiple atoms. Like, perhaps B is a diatomic gas, like Cl2 or O2, but 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. Wait, another thought: maybe B is a halogen. Let's think about the bright red product. Oh, maybe C is something like sulfur hexafluoride? No, that's colorless. Alternatively, think about transition metals. Oh, wait, maybe A is a metal reacting with a halogen.

Wait, another thought: if C is a compound with a lot of B atoms, perhaps B is a diatomic molecule, and each molecule contributes two atoms. So 8 equivalents of B would mean 16 B atoms? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where B is a diatomic gas, and 8 equivalents would mean 8 molecules. So each molecule of B contributes two atoms, so 8 × 2 = 16 B atoms per A molecule.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the other reactions to see if that helps. The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A, and two acids. One strong (like HCl?), one weak (like H2SO4, but that's strong too... wait, maybe HNO2? No. Or perhaps H3PO4, which is a weak acid.)

Wait, but let's think about the third reaction. C + H2O → A + F + G. So, C must be some compound that when it reacts with water, breaks down into A, an acid, and another acid. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, but maybe C is a metal fluoride. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again about the first reaction. If A reacts with B (a gas) 8 times to make C, and then C reacts with D to make E. Let's think about possible compounds.

Wait, what if B is Cl2? Because in some reactions, metals react with Cl2 in large amounts. For example, aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a burning reaction, but not sure about the product. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe, and B is Cl2. But FeCl3 is a possible product. But FeCl3 is not bright red.

Wait, another thought: the bright red product. Could it be something like PbO2? No, that's dark brown. Maybe it's a transition metal sulfide? Or perhaps a compound with a high symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like SO3 or something else.

Wait, another angle: The second reaction is C + 2D → E, which is extremely hazardous. D is a gas. So, what gases could react with C? Let's say D is O2. Then, C reacting with O2 would produce something. But E is extremely hazardous. Alternatively, D could be a halogen like Cl2 again. But let me think about another possibility.

Wait, let's look at the last reaction: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, H is a solvent, which suggests something like HCl, but HCl is a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O. No, because B is a gas, D is a gas, so their combination could be something like HCl if B is Cl2 and D is H2. Wait, but D and B react in 1:1 ratio. HCl is formed from H2 and Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio. So, H would be HCl. But wait, HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, unless H is another solvent, like perhaps H2O. Wait, but D and B are gases.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, in a 1:1 ratio, they form HCl (H is HCl), which is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is Cl2, but then H would be ClO2 or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is something else. Maybe D is another gas like NH3? No, that's a gas, but what reaction would that have with B, another gas, in 1:1 ratio? Maybe B is O2 and D is H2, forming H2O. But H2O is a liquid, so that's a possibility. So H is H2O, a solvent. That could make sense.

So, if D is H2 and B is O2, then their reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio is 1:1, so H2 and O2 in 1:1 ratio would produce H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So H is H2O.

Now, let me think about the first reaction again. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2?), but wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule. So, 8 equivalents of O2 would be 8 moles. So, A + 8 O2 → C (bright red). What solid reacts with O2 in such a way?

Wait, maybe A is a metal. Let's think about metals reacting with O2. For example, aluminum reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. But Al2O3 is white, not red. Iron can form FeO (which is black), Fe3O4 (black), Fe2O3 (red). Oh! Fe2O3 is commonly known as rust, and it's a reddish color. So, if A is Fe, and B is O2, then Fe + O2 → Fe2O3? Let's see the stoichiometry.

The reaction is: 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So, 4 moles of Fe react with 3 moles of O2. But the problem states that A reacts with 8 equivalents of B. So, if 3 moles of O2 are used per 4 moles of Fe, then in the problem, 8 moles of O2 would react with (4/3)*8 = 10.666... moles of Fe. That's possible, but I'm not sure if the problem is implying that it's an 8:1 ratio.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is Fe reacting with Cl2. Fe burns in Cl2 to form FeCl3. Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So, 2 moles Fe react with 3 moles Cl2. If in the problem, A is Fe and B is Cl2, then 8 moles Cl2 would require (2/3)*8 = 5.333 moles Fe. But the product in that case is FeCl3, which is a yellowish solid, not bright red. So that's probably not it.

Wait, but the product C is bright red. So perhaps it's not Fe2O3. Another possibility for a bright red product is something like mercury(II) oxide, but that's red. Or maybe it's a different metal oxide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is a bright green solid, but maybe another form? Or maybe it's a sulfide? Not sure. Alternatively, could C be a compound of another element?

Wait, maybe A is sulfur and B is something else. But sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3, which are colorless or pungent but not bright red.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a bright red compound. For example, manganese(II,III) oxide is black, but maybe a different oxidation state.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, CuS is black, but perhaps another sulfide. Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the hydrolysis reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, when C is reacted with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, but in hydrolysis, if C is a salt of a strong base and a weak acid, it would hydrolyze to produce a weak acid and a strong base. But in this case, the products are A, F (strong acid), G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, releases two different acids. That sounds a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water forms two different acids.

Wait, but A is the original solid. So, if C is a salt (like a metal sulfate), and when it reacts with water, it decomposes back into A and releases two different acids. Hmm, not common. Alternatively, perhaps C is a complex compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride that when hydrolyzed gives back the metal hydroxide (A) and two acids. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking at the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. If D is H2 (since in the earlier thought, D and B (O2) react to form H2O as H), then C + 2 H2 → E. That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Wait, but earlier I thought D could be H2 if B was O2.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2. Then, C + 2 Cl2 → E. Maybe E is something like SO2 or another dangerous gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the D and B reaction. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is a solvent, like water or ethanol. But D and B are both gases. So H could be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is H2O, which is a solvent. So D and B must be H2 and O2. Because 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2. But the problem states that D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, so that would require H2 and O2 in 1:1 ratio. Hmm. Wait, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So for 1 mole H2 and 0.5 mole O2, 1:0.5 ratio. But the problem says 1:1. So maybe the reaction is H2 + O2 → H2O, but it's an incomplete reaction because typically 2 H2 + O2 is needed. So perhaps the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, but in a 2:1 ratio. Therefore, for a 1:1 ratio, perhaps it's H2 and O2 in a 1:1 ratio, but that would mean 0.5 moles of O2 reacting with 1 mole H2 to form 1 mole H2O. But I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, maybe H is not water. Maybe it's another solvent like ethanol, but ethanol is not formed from two gases reacting in 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, H would be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the other reactions first. Let's think about product E. It's extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous compounds? Maybe sarin gas, or something like phosgene, or perhaps something else. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but that's formed from reacting C with D.

Wait, maybe D is something like Cl2. Because Cl2 is a common gas in such reactions. So, if C reacts with Cl2 to form E, which is hazardous. Let me think about possible reactions.

Wait, another approach: The first reaction gives C as a bright red product. Let me think about some bright red compounds. One that comes to mind is Fe(OH)3, but that's a reddish-brown gelatinous precipitate. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, what about the compound As2O3 (arsenic trioxide)? It's a bright red solid. But I'm not sure about the reactions here.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Let me think about the hydrolysis reaction again. C + H2O → A + F + G. So, if C is a metal oxide, when it reacts with water, it would form a metal hydroxide and an acid. Wait, but F and G are acids. So, maybe C is a salt that releases two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate salt. For example, if C is Na2SO4, then hydrolysis would produce NaOH (a strong base) and H2SO4 (a strong acid), but in the problem, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, hydrolysis would produce Ca(OH)2 and HNO3. Ca(OH)2 is a base, so F and G would be HNO3 (strong acid) and maybe another acid. Wait, no, because hydrolysis of a nitrate salt would produce nitric acid, which is strong, and a metal hydroxide, which is a base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite salt. For instance, if C is Na2SO3, then hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). So F would be NaOH (a strong base), but the problem says F is a strong acid. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. If C is Na2CO3, hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2CO3 (which is a weak acid). Again, F is a strong acid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is a metal sulfide, like FeS, then hydrolysis would produce the metal hydroxide and H2S gas (a weak acid). But then F and G would both be weak acids, which doesn't fit since F is a strong acid.

Hmm, maybe C is a different kind of compound. Let me think of the possible reactions again.

Wait, another approach: What if C is a transition metal chloride? For example, if A is Al, and B is Cl2. Then, Al reacts with Cl2 to form AlCl3. But AlCl3 is a white solid, not bright red. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a transition metal in a higher oxidation state, like Fe^3+? Fe2(SO4)3 is yellow, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a mixed oxide.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the possible products and their properties.

From the reactions, when C reacts with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that contains both a strong acid anion and a weak acid anion. For example, if C is NH4HSO4, which contains both HSO4- (acts as a weak acid) and NH4+ (which hydrolyzes to produce a weak base, NH3, but that would give a weak base, not an acid). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a metal sulfite? Let's say C is FeSO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into Fe(OH)2 and H2SO3. Fe(OH)2 is a weak base, but H2SO3 is a weak acid. But then F would have to be a strong acid, which it's not. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrite, like Fe(NO2)2. Hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)2 and HNO2. HNO2 is a weak acid, so again, only a weak acid is produced. But the problem says F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt containing both Cl- and another anion.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate or something similar. Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about E again.

E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. E is extremely hazardous. So, what are possible E compounds?

Wait, if E is a highly toxic gas, possibilities include HCN (hydrogen cyanide), but that's more of a toxic liquid. Or perhaps phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Or sarin gas, but that's an organophosphorus compound. Alternatively, chlorine gas is dangerous, but C and D would have to be something that produces Cl2. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: E is a highly toxic metal, like mercury or arsenic compounds. But E is produced via a reaction involving C and D. Hmm.

Alternatively, E could be a product of a redox reaction. For example, if C is Fe2O3 and D is H2, then E could be Fe metal and water. But that's not dangerous. Alternatively, if C is FeCl3 and D is H2, then E would be Fe and HCl, which again isn't dangerous.

Wait, perhaps E is something like NO or NO2. NO is a toxic gas. So, let's think about that. If C is a metal oxide and D is something that can reduce it. For example, if C is Fe2O3 and D is CO (carbon monoxide), but CO is a gas. Alternatively, D could be H2. Fe2O3 + H2 → Fe + H2O. That's a reaction, but E would be Fe and H2O, which isn't dangerous. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of a reaction between C and D that involves oxidation or reduction. For example, if C is a metal sulfide and D is O2, then E could be SO2, which is a toxic gas. So, let's see: if C is FeS and D is O2, then 4 FeS + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3 + 2 SO2. SO2 is a toxic gas, so E would be SO2. That could fit. But then what about the first reaction?

Wait, if C is FeS, then the first reaction would be A + 8 B → FeS. FeS is a black solid, not bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different sulfide. Wait, maybe something like CuS is black too. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is PbO2, but that's dark brown. Hmm.

Another angle: The hydrolysis of C produces two acids. So, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is sodium bisulfate (NaHSO4), which when dissolved in water would dissociate into Na+, HSO4^- (which can donate a proton to form H+ and SO4^2-). But that's not two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts, but the problem states it's a product, so maybe a single compound.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfonic acid. But that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a hydrate. No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about what each reaction could be, step by step.

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent), in a 1:1 ratio.

Let me try to assign possible chemicals to each.

Assuming H is a solvent, let's think of H as H2O. So, D and B must combine to form H2O. So, D and B must be H2 and O2. Because 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So, the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. Therefore, D is H2, B is O2. So their reaction is in a 2:1 ratio, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe the reaction is H2 + O2 → H2O under specific conditions, but in reality, the stoichiometric ratio is 2:1.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something else. For example, if H is NH3, but NH3 is a gas and a solvent? Wait, NH3 is a gas at room temperature but can act as a solvent in its liquid form. But how would D and B form NH3? That would require N and H, but D and B are both gases. Let me think: If D is NH3 and B is H2, but that doesn't make sense because the reaction would need nitrogen, which isn't present.

Alternatively, maybe D is CO2 and B is H2O, but that's not a gas. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let me assume that B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl, which is a gas but not a solvent. So that doesn't fit. So H would need to be a solvent, which suggests H is H2O.

So, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then, H is H2O, formed in a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2. But the problem states that D and B react in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So, 2 moles H2 react with 1 mole O2. So, the ratio is 2:1, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, this is a problem. Unless the reaction is adjusted to 1:1, perhaps in a different condition or with a different stoichiometry. Maybe using a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O3 (ozone), but that's a stretch.

Wait, another thought: Maybe D is O2 and B is something else. Let me think: If D is O2 and B is another gas, but their reaction forms H which is a solvent. Hmm, but what reaction between O2 and another gas would form a solvent?

Wait, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O, but both are gases. Their reaction would produce something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is H2, but then their reaction would produce CO and H2O under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of a different approach. Let me consider possible E compounds and backtrack.

E is extremely hazardous. Let me think of possible E compounds:

- Phosgene (COCl2): toxic gas.
- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN): toxic gas.
- Sulfur dioxide (SO2): toxic gas.
- Nitrogen dioxide (NO2): toxic gas.
- Chlorine gas (Cl2): itself有毒, but the product E is from reaction of C and D.

Wait, if E is SO2, then perhaps C reacts with D (maybe O2) to produce SO2. So, C could be a sulfide, like FeS. But FeS is black, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, if E is NO2, then perhaps C is a nitrate and D is something that reduces it. For example, if C is AgNO3 and D is Zn metal, but D is a gas, so that's not possible.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide and D is another gas. Let's think: If C is Fe2O3 and D is CO (carbon monoxide), then Fe2O3 + CO → Fe + CO2. But that's a redox reaction, and CO is a gas. But the product would be Fe and CO2, which aren't dangerous. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is FeO and D is Cl2, then FeO + Cl2 → FeCl2 + O2. Not sure if that's dangerous.

Hmm, perhaps E is a product like HCN. So, how would that form? Maybe from a reaction between C (a cyanide salt) and D (a strong acid). But D is a gas, so perhaps D is H2O or H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a liquid, not a gas. So, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C contains cyanide ions, and D is a strong acid like H2SO4 (but that's a liquid). Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2, and C is KCN. Then, KCN + Cl2 → KCl + HCN. HCN is a toxic gas. So in this case, E would be HCN. But then, what's C? KCN is a salt, and when it reacts with water, it would produce K+ and CN- which hydrolyzes to produce HCN and KOH. So, that would fit the third reaction: C (KCN) + H2O → K (metallic potassium?) No, because KCN hydrolyzes into HCN and KOH. But then F would be HCN (weak acid) and G would be KOH (strong base, which doesn't fit because the problem says G is a weak acid). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem says that when C reacts with water, it produces A (the original solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives back A (the metal), a strong acid, and a weak acid. For example, if C is a nitrate and a sulfate salt.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which is sodium bisulfate. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^- ions. The HSO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to form H+ and SO4^2-. So, HSO4^- is a weak acid. But then where does the strong acid come from? Hmm, perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a metal bicarbonate? For example, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+, HCO3^- → which can hydrolyze into H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, that gives a base, not an acid. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide. Wait, but C is a product of a reaction between A and B, which are solid and gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much, but under certain conditions, it can produce some CO2 and some hydroxide. But that doesn't fit the problem.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. For example, Al(NO3)3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to produce Al(OH)3 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid, which would be F. So, F is strong acid, and Al(OH)3 is a weak base, but the problem states that G is a weak acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, CuSO4. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Cu^2+ and SO4^2- ions. Cu^2+ can hydrolyze to form Cu(OH)2 and H+ ions. So, SO4^2- is a weak acid (HSO4^- is a weak acid). So, F would be H+ (from water), but that's not a real acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal sulfite. Let's say Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into 2 NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, but then F would be NaOH (a strong base), which doesn't fit because F is a strong acid. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chlorate, like KClO3. Hydrolysis would produce KCl (a neutral salt) and HClO3 (a strong acid). But then, where does the weak acid come from? Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. For example, a salt that contains both a nitrate and a sulfate. But that's complicated, and I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reactions again.

In the first reaction, A + 8 B → C (bright red). If B is O2, then perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. For example, Chromium forms Cr2O3, which is green, but maybe another metal. Wait, manganese can form MnO2, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. Let's say A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3. But those are colorless. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a transition metal oxide with a high spin state, giving it a red color. For example, perhaps it's a cobalt oxide. Cobalt(II,III) oxide is black, but maybe another form. Alternatively, perhaps it's a copper oxide. CuO is black, Cu2O is reddish. Oh! Cu2O is a bright red or orange solid. So, if C is Cu2O, that fits the bright red color.

So, if C is Cu2O, then let's see what reactions would imply.

First reaction: A + 8 B → Cu2O. So, what is A and B? If B is O2, then A would be Cu. Because copper reacts with O2 to form CuO (black) or Cu2O (red). The reaction is 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. But if it's Cu2O, perhaps it's formed under different conditions. Let me check: The reaction of copper with O2 can form CuO, but under certain conditions, like in the presence of moisture, it might form Cu2O. Alternatively, perhaps B isn't O2 but another gas.

Wait, but in this scenario, let's proceed. Let's say B is O2, A is Cu, and C is Cu2O. Then, in the second reaction, C (Cu2O) reacts with 2 equivalents of D (gas) to form E (extremely hazardous). So, what reacts with Cu2O?

Wait, in this scenario, D is a gas that reacts with Cu2O. Also, D and B (O2) react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D would be a gas that, when reacted with O2 in 1:1 ratio, forms H (a solvent). Hmm.

If D is a gas that reacts with O2 in a 1:1 ratio to form H as a solvent. Let's think about possible reactions. For example, H could be H2O, which is formed from H2 and O2. So, D would be H2. Because H2 + O2 → H2O. The ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2, but the problem says 1:1. So perhaps the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio. But the problem states 1:1, which is a bit conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is under different conditions where it's a 1:1 ratio.

Assuming D is H2 and B is O2, then D and B react to form H2O (H is H2O, a solvent). Now, the second reaction is C (Cu2O) reacting with 2 D (H2) → E. So, Cu2O + 2 H2 → E. What would E be?

The reaction of Cu2O with H2 could be a reduction. Cu2O + H2 → 2 Cu + H2O. So, E would be H2O and Cu. But Cu is a solid, and H2O is a liquid. Neither is extremely hazardous. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a toxic gas. So maybe the reaction is different. If D is Cl2 instead of H2, then C (Cu2O) + Cl2 → CuCl2 + OCl2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is CO, which is a gas. Cu2O + CO → Cu + CO2. Again, not dangerous.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe B isn't O2. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another approach: If C is Cu2O, then when it reacts with water, it produces Cu, and two acids. Let's check:

Cu2O + H2O → 2 Cu + H2O + 2 OH- ? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's a reaction like Cu2O + H2O → 2 Cu(OH) + H2. No, that's not a standard reaction.

Wait, another possibility: Cu2O is a basic oxide and reacts with water to produce Cu(OH)2 and H2. Let me think about the reaction. Cu2O + H2O → 2 Cu(OH) + H2↑. If that's the case, then when C (Cu2O) reacts with water, it produces A (Cu), and H2 (a strong acid?), but that doesn't fit. Because H2 is a gas, not an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps Cu2O reacts with water under acidic conditions. Suppose C (Cu2O) is treated with H2O and an acid. But the problem states that C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So, without any added acid, perhaps it's a simple hydrolysis.

I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that C is Cu2O, and see where that leads.

So, C is Cu2O. Then, when it reacts with water, it produces Cu (A), and two acids F and G.

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis of Cu2O produces two different acids. Let me think: Cu2O is a basic oxide. When it reacts with water, perhaps it hydrolyzes to form Cu(OH)2 and H2O, but that doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Cu2O reacts with water and O2 to form Cu(OH)2 and another product. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Cu2O is treated with an acid. But according to the problem, the reaction is with water only, so no added acid.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about C being Cu2O. Let me think of another possibility.

Another bright red compound is mercuric sulfide (HgS), but that's usually black. Wait, no, HgS is actually red, called cinnabar. So C could be HgS.

So, if A is Hg and B is S (but S is a solid, not a gas), so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is another gas that reacts with Hg to form HgS. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Wait, another bright red compound is PbO2, but that's dark brown. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of another element entirely. Let me think of other bright red solids.

Oh, maybe it's Mn2O7 (manganese heptoxide), which is a bright red solid. Mn2O7 is a powerful oxidizing agent and is highly toxic. That could fit with E being extremely hazardous.

So, let's consider C as Mn2O7. Then, the first reaction would be A + 8 B → Mn2O7.

Mn2O7 is a solid, and it's bright red. What reacts to form Mn2O7? Typically, Mn2O7 is formed from the oxidation of MnO2 with strong oxidizing agents like H2O2 or other strong acids.

But in this case, A is a solid, B is a gas. So, perhaps A is MnO2, and B is a strong oxidizing gas, like Cl2. The reaction would be MnO2 + 2 Cl2 → MnCl4 + 2 O2. But MnCl4 isn't Mn2O7.

Wait, perhaps A is MnO and B is O2. But MnO reacts with O2 to form MnO2: 2 MnO + O2 → 2 MnO2. But that's not Mn2O7.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Mn metal and B is O2. The reaction would be 4 Mn + 3 O2 → 2 Mn2O3. Mn2O3 is a pinkish solid. Not bright red.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path. Let me think again.

Wait, another bright red solid is Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), but it's usually reddish-brown. Maybe in a different form it's bright red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different oxidation state.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the symmetry group of E, which is the main question. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Wait, but symmetry groups depend on the structure of the molecule. Let me think about possible E compounds and their symmetry.

If E is SO2, its molecule is bent, with a C2v symmetry. So, the symmetry group would be C2v. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, it's diatomic with D∞h symmetry. If E is HCN, it's linear, so D∞h. Phosgene (COCl2) has a trigonal planar structure with C2v symmetry. SO2 is bent, C2v. NO2 has a bent structure, C2v. HCN is linear, D∞h. Cl2 is diatomic, D∞h.

So, if E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2 or O2, the symmetry group would be D∞h. If it's a bent molecule like SO2, then C2v.

Now, looking back at the options, the choices are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

So, if E is a diatomic gas like Cl2, symmetry group is D∞h (option C). If E is SO2, then C2v (option D).

But which one is the correct E?

Earlier, I thought E might be SO2. Let's see: If C is a sulfide, like FeS, and D is O2, then FeS + O2 → FeO + SO2. SO2 is a toxic gas, which would fit the description. But then C would be FeS, which is black, not bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfate, like CuSO4, and D is something that reduces it to produce SO2. For example, CuSO4 + H2S → CuS + H2SO4. Not sure, but that doesn't directly give SO2.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. Reacting with HCl (if D is HCl, but D is a gas), but D is not necessarily HCl. Alternatively, if D is CO2, but that's a stretch.

Hmm. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the symmetry options. Let's think about the options again.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2, Cl2, or another similar gas, the symmetry would be D∞h (option C). If E is a bent molecule like SO2 or NO2, the symmetry would be C2v (option D).

Given that E is extremely hazardous, SO2 and NO2 are possibilities. SO2 has C2v symmetry, NO2 (which has resonance structures and a bent shape) also has C2v symmetry.

Another possibility: If E is HCN (linear), D∞h. But I don't know which one fits the reactions better.

Wait, let's think about the reaction of C with D to form E. If D is O2 and C is a sulfide, then E would be SO2. So, perhaps E is SO2 with C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, then symmetry is D∞h.

But without knowing exactly what E is, it's hard to choose. However, considering the options, SO2 is a common toxic gas that might fit.

So, if E is SO2, the symmetry is C2v, which is option D.

But wait, another point: the first reaction produces C as a bright red solid. If C is Cu2O, which is red, and then reacts with O2 (D) to form CuO and SO2? No, wait, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that upon reaction with O2 produces SO2. Wait, for example, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, and reacts with O2 to form FeO and SO2. FeS + 2 O2 → FeO + SO2. That's a possible reaction. But as I said earlier, FeS is black, not red. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me make a guess based on the options. The possible symmetry groups for E are C2v (option D) and D∞h (option C). Considering SO2 is a common toxic gas with C2v symmetry, I'll go with option D. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, it's D∞h.

But the problem states that E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. If E is Cl2, that would require D to be something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. The structure of phosgene is a trigonal planar with a central carbon, so its symmetry is D∞h? No, wait, COCl2 has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is planar with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, leading to D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's D2h or C2v.

Wait, the structure of COCl2 is similar to SO2, which is bent with a C2v symmetry. So, I think COCl2 (phosgene) would also have C2v symmetry.

So, if E is phosgene (COCl2), its symmetry group is C2v (option D).

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, symmetry is D∞h (option C). But I'm not certain.

Another point: the reaction between C and D produces E. If E is Cl2, then D would have to be something that produces Cl2, but that doesn't fit with earlier reactions.

Alternatively, if D is H2 and B is O2, then E might be H2O, which is not extremely hazardous. So that doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options, I'll have to make a guess. Between C (D∞h) and D (C2v), I'll go with C2v, which is option D.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E, based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like Cu₂O (copper(I,II) oxide), which is reddish-orange, or Mn₂O₇ (manganese heptoxide), which is bright red.  
   - If C is Cu₂O, it is a basic oxide and could react with water to produce Cu (A), and potentially two acids (F and G).  
   - If C is Mn₂O₇, it is a highly oxidizing agent and could react with gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product.  
   - Examples of extremely hazardous compounds include SO₂ (toxic gas), NO₂ (toxic gas), HCN (toxic gas), or phosgene (COCl₂, a toxic gas).  
   - If C is Cu₂O and D is O₂, the reaction could produce Cu and H₂O, but these are not hazardous.  
   - If C is Mn₂O₇ and D is a reducing agent like H₂, the reaction could produce MnO₂ and O₂, but O₂ is not hazardous.  
   - If C is a sulfide like FeS and D is O₂, the reaction could produce FeO and SO₂, where SO₂ is a toxic gas with C₂v symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A, and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid).  
   - For Cu₂O, hydrolysis could produce Cu(OH)₂ and H₂O, but this does not fit the description of producing two acids.  
   - For Mn₂O₇, hydrolysis could produce MnO₂ and H₂O, but again, this does not fit the acid production description.  
   - If C is a sulfide like FeS, hydrolysis could produce H₂S (a weak acid) and a metal hydroxide, but this does not fit the strong acid requirement.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.  
   - If H is H₂O, D and B could be H₂ and O₂, respectively, with the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O.  
   - This aligns with D being H₂ and B being O₂, making H₂O a solvent.

5. **Symmetry of E**:  
   - If E is SO₂, it is a bent molecule with C₂v symmetry.  
   - If E is phosgene (COCl₂), it is a trigonal planar molecule with D∞h symmetry.  
   - If E is Cl₂ or HCN, it is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.  
   - Based on the reactions and the description of E as extremely hazardous, SO₂ (C₂v symmetry) or phosgene (D∞h symmetry) are plausible candidates.  
   - However, considering the hydrolysis reaction and the production of two acids, SO₂ (C₂v symmetry) is more likely.

**Conclusion**: The molecular symmetry group of E is **C₂v**.  
Answer: D
