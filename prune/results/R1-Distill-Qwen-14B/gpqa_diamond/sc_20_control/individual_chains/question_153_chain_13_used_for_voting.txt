Alright, so I have this organic chemistry question about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and product for each, then match them with the options given.

Let's start with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol).

From what I remember, the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile here is usually an enolate ion. Dimethyl malonate is a good source of an enolate because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. Under basic conditions (like NaOEt), it would deprotonate to form an enolate.

The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- so 3-(p-tolyl) would be substituent on the CH2 group? Or the middle carbon?

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the alpha position. No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or perhaps CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, the numbering might be off. Let me think again. If the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, then the carbonyl is at position 3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH2 group, which is on the same carbon as the carbonyl. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but wait, that would be more like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, the p-tolyl is on C2, and the ester is on C3. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but wait, that's the structure of methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So then, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 2.

So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, it should add to the beta position of the acrylate. The enolate is a strong nucleophile. The acrylate has the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2-CH-CO-OCH3, so the double bond is between CH2 and CH with the p-tolyl. So the beta carbon is the one next to the carbonyl, which is the CH2 group. Wait, no. The carbonyl is at the end. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. The carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the alpha-beta is between 1 and 2, with the carbonyl on 3.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(CO2Me)2-) would attack the beta position (carbon 2 of the acrylate). Wait, no, wait. The enolate has a negative charge on the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl). So the attack would be on the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the middle carbon in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The enolate is CH2(CO2Me)2^-. The enolate's alpha carbon (the one next to the two carbonyls) is deprotonated and attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, the acrylate's structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, C2 is C with p-tolyl, and C3 is the carbonyl. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is between C1 and C2, with the carbonyl on C3.

The enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. The beta position is C1. So the enolate attacks C1, leading to a new bond.

So the attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha carbon of the enolate and the beta carbon of the acrylate. So after the attack, the two molecules are connected.

The product after the attack would form a new carbon chain. The enolate is CH2(CO2Me)2^-. Upon attack, it would add to C1 of the acrylate. So the product would have the structure: CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no, because when the enolate attacks the double bond, it would add to the beta carbon (C1), resulting in a new single bond. Let me think again.

The enolate is a conjugate base, so when it attacks, it would add to the less substituted end (the less substituted in the double bond). In the acrylate, the double bond is CH2-CH(p-tolyl). So the enolate would attack the central carbon (C2?), which is the alpha position? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate attacks the beta position, which is the CH2 group. So the product would have the structure where the enolate adds to the acrylate's CH2 group, leading to a new carbon chain.

Wait, maybe the product is a substituted malonate ester. Since dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CHCH2COOCH3? No, wait, no. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. So when it forms an enolate, it's CH2- C(-O-)(CO2Me)2^-.

The attack would be on the CH2 of the acrylate, so adding the enolate's CH2 to the acrylate's CH2, leading to a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the product would be something like CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 connected to the p-tolyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is trimethyl something tricarboxylate. Because the enolate has two ester groups, and the acrylate has one. After the addition, the product would have three ester groups.

Looking at the options, option A says A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That structure would be (CO2Me)2CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. So the main chain is four carbons: two CO2Me on C1, then C2 with the p-tolyl, and C3 with CO2Me. Wait, no. Propene-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have three carbons, with two ester groups on C1 and one on C3. So structure would be O=C-OCH3, then another O=C-OCH3 on C1, then C2, then O=C-OCH3 on C3. But how does the p-tolyl fit in?

Alternatively, maybe it's (CO2Me)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. So the main chain is four carbons, with the p-tolyl on the second carbon.

Wait, the product would be a tricarboxylate because one of the ester groups comes from the acrylate and two from the dimethyl malonate. So the product would have three ester groups.

So for part A, the product would be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So looking at the options, A and B both have that as their A.

Moving on to part B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with MeOH and H3O+.

Hmm, the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Wait, but (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-Câ‰¡N. So the nitrile is on the end. So the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile is CH2=CH-CN. The reaction is between 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and this.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a cyclic amine with a cyclohexene ring attached. The structure is a six-membered ring (cyclohexene) connected to a piperidine (six-membered amine ring). So the piperidine is attached to the cyclohexene at position 1.

So the nucleophile in this case would be the enamine from the piperidine and cyclohexene. Wait, wait, how does this react? In the presence of MeOH and H3O+, perhaps it's a Michael addition where the enamine acts as the nucleophile.

Wait, Michael addition requires an enolate or enamine. Piperidine might form an enamine with the cyclohexene. Wait, no, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is already an enamine. Enamine structures are R2N-CR2-CR2, where one R is from the amine and the others are from the alkene.

Wait, but the structure given is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So the piperidine is connected to the cyclohexene at the 1 position, which is the same as the position where the double bond starts. So the structure would be cyclohexene ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a piperidine ring.

Wait, that might make the cyclohexene part conjugated with the piperidine. So the piperidine is connected to the cyclohexene, perhaps forming an enamine. Enamines are typically conjugated systems, so perhaps the structure is such that the piperidine's nitrogen is conjugated with the cyclohexene's double bond, making a strong base (enamine) that can act as a nucleophile.

In the presence of a Michael acceptor, which is the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Wait, nitrile is a good electron-withdrawing group, so CH2=CH-CN is an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. So it's a good Michael acceptor.

So the enamine (1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine) would act as the nucleophile, attacking the beta position of the nitrile's double bond.

Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN. The double bond is between C1 and C2, with the nitrile on C2.

So the Michael addition would have the nucleophile attacking the beta position (C1). So the enamine would add to the C1 of CH2=CHCN, leading to a new bond between them.

So the product after the addition would have a new carbon between the enamine and the nitrile.

Wait, the enamine is like a conjugated system, so perhaps it's more like a resonance-stabilized structure. So the attack would occur at the alpha position of the nitrile.

Wait, maybe the reaction proceeds as follows: the enamine (acting as a nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. So the enamine's carbon (from the cyclohexene part) adds to the CH2 group of the butenitrile.

After the attack, the structure would have the enamine connected to the CH2 group, and the nitrile on the adjacent carbon. Then, perhaps, the ring would open or undergo some rearrangement.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are MeOH and H3O+. So it's acidic conditions. Would that lead to any proton transfers or ring openings?

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Wait, the options have B as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Wait, let's think about the structure. After the Michael addition, the enamine (which is a conjugated amine) adds to the but-2-enenitrile. The enamine is a strong base, so it would deprotonate and form a nucleophilic species.

So the enamine attacks the beta position (CH2) of the but-2-enenitrile.

The product would have a new carbon chain: the enamine's cyclohexene part connected to the CH2 group, which is next to the nitrile.

Wait, but in the product, would the cyclohexene ring remain as is, or would it open up? Or perhaps the ring would undergo some change.

Alternatively, considering the piperidine and cyclohexene, after opening, perhaps the product is a substituted butanenitrile.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident here. Let me think about the options. Option A and B for part B have 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Option C and D have something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That would imply a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 2, connected to the butanenitrile at position 3.

Wait, but how would that form? The enamine attacking the butenitrile would add a cyclohexyl group to the CH2, which is adjacent to the nitrile. So the product would have a CH2 connected to the cyclohexane ring (with a ketone, perhaps) and the nitrile.

Wait, but the enamine is formed from the piperidine and cyclohexene. When the enamine reacts, perhaps it forms a new bond, and then the ring might open? Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene remains as a cyclohexane ring with a substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So the butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but with a substituent on the third carbon.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the structure. The but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN. After the Michael addition, the enamine attacks the CH2 part, adding the cyclohexene-piperidine structure to that carbon. So the product would be CH2(cyclohexyl group)-CH2-CN. But where's the cyclohexyl group?

Wait, the enamine is the nucleophile, so the addition would form a new bond between the enamine's carbon and the CH2 of the butenitrile. So the product would have the structure: cyclohexyl group attached to the CH2, which is next to another CH2 connected to the CN.

So the chain would be something like cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CN. But wait, the butenitrile becomes butanenitrile after addition.

Wait, no, but but-2-enenitrile has four carbons: CH2-CH2-CN. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCN, which is three carbons in total.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. But-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN. So during the Michael addition, the enamine attacks the beta carbon (CH2), leading to the formation of CH2-CH2-CN, but with the enamine attached to the CH2.

So the product would be CH2-enamine-CH2-CN. But that's not possible, because the enamine is a six-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps the enamine is a conjugated system, so when it attacks, it forms a bond between the cyclohexene carbon and the CH2.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-cyclohexylbutanenitrile. But the options have 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Alternatively, maybe after the addition, the ring opens, forming a ketone. Since the reaction is under acidic conditions, perhaps the enamine is protonated, leading to the opening of the ring and the formation of a carbocation, which then forms a ketone.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Let's think about the possible products. Option A and B for B have 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and options C and D have similar but different structures.

If the product has a cyclohexyl group attached to the CH2, and that cyclohexyl has a ketone (oxo) at position 2, then the structure would be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

So the product would have the nitrile at the end, a CH2 group connected to the cyclohexyl at position 3, and a ketone at position 2 of the cyclohexane.

So for part B, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Moving on to part C: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O, to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the cyclohexane has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

Hmm, the starting material is but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. But-3-en-2-one is CH2=C-CH2-CO? No, wait. Let me think: but-3-en-2-one would have the double bond between C3 and C4, and the carbonyl at C2.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2-C=O with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's not possible because but would have four carbons. Wait, no: but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps it's structured as CH2=C-CH2-C(=O)-R? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

But-3-en-2-one: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but that would be beyond the fourth carbon if it's but. Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-one would have the double bond between C3 and C4? But that's not possible because four carbons would be 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond between 3 and 4 would put it beyond the chain. So I think I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH3. So the structure is: CH2-CH2-CO-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, that can't be because the carbonyl is at C2. So perhaps the structure is CH2=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, but-3-en-2-one would have the structure CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? But that would make it but-1-en-2-one, perhaps. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one: IUPAC name. The longest chain has four carbons (but), with a ketone at C2 (so structure is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond at position 3.

Wait, but the double bond can't be at position 3 in a four-carbon chain. Because position 3 would be the third carbon, which in four carbons is the third. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That doesn't make sense because after C4, there's no more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C-CH2-C(=O)-Me. Wait, that's but-1-en-2-one. So perhaps the question has a typo and it's but-2-en-1-one? Or but-1-en-2-one? Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, regardless, the important part is that but-3-en-2-one is an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. So it has a carbonyl group at C2 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

But wait, but-3-en-2-one would be: positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The ketone is at C2, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So structure is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, so CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2 becomes CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That would be CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but that's impossible. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2-C(=O)-CH=CH2. Wait, that would be but-3-en-2-one: CH2-C(=O)-CH=CH2.

Wait, yes, because the carbonyl is at position 2 and the double bond is between positions 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-C(=O)-CH=CH2.

So but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(=O)-CH=CH2.

Now, the reaction is with C in KOH and H2O to produce 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, the product is a cyclohexane with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

So the substituent is (3-oxobutyl), which is CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-? Wait, no: 3-oxobutyl is (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2-.

Wait, but butyl is four carbons. So 3-oxobutyl would be CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane at position 2.

So the reaction is a Michael addition where the nucleophile is from the cyclohexane dione (C), and the electrophile is the but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, no. The reactants are C and but-3-en-2-one. So C must be the enolate or enamine.

Wait, the product is formed when C (unknown) reacts with but-3-en-2-one in KOH and water.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Which suggests that the cyclohexane dione has a butyl group with a ketone at position 3 attached to it at position 2.

So perhaps C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Because when it forms an enolate, it would add to the but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3-dione is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. So the enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one) at the beta position.

So the enolate from cyclohexane-1,3-dione would attack the CH2 group of but-3-en-2-one, which is at position 3.

Wait, but the but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(=O)-CH=CH2. The alpha-beta unsaturated part is CH=CH2, with the carbonyl at position 2.

So the enolate would attack the beta position (the CH2 group) of the but-3-en-2-one.

After the attack, the product would have the cyclohexane dione attached to the CH2 group of the butenone, leading to the structure where the cyclohexane is connected to a CH2-C(=O)-CH2- chain.

Wait, but the product has 2-(3-oxobutyl), which is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at the third position. So the chain would be CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2 connected to the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the enolate adds to the CH2 group of but-3-en-2-one, leading to a new bond between the cyclohexane's alpha carbon and the CH2. Then, after protonation and possible ring closure, the product would have the substituent as described.

But in the reaction conditions, KOH and H2O, so it's a basic condition for the enolate formation.

So if C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, then the product would have the substituent added. But the options for C are:

Option A: C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option B: C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: same as A.

Option D: same as B.

So when C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, upon Michael addition, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. However, looking at the options, the product for part C is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but the possible C is either cyclohexane-1,3-dione (option B) or 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (option A).

Wait, but the question says C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O gives product 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So what is C?

If C is the Michael donor, which is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, then the product is formed by the addition of the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to but-3-en-2-one.

So for part C, C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: A is different, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So if part C's product is correct when C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, then looking at the options, either B or C or D has that.

Wait, the options for C are:

Option A: C=2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option B: C=cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: C=cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, no, looking back:

Options are:

Option A) A: trimethyl..., B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C: 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option B) A: same as A, B: same, C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C) A: different, C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D) A: different, C: 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, in our analysis, part C's C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Therefore, the correct options for C would be either B or C. Looking at the others:

Part A: The product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which is in options A and B.

Part B: The product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which is in options A and B.

So, if for part C, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, then the correct option is B or C. Wait, no. Looking again, option B for part C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the option would have C as that.

So the overall options are:

Looking at each part:

A: the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

B: the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

C: the reactant is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, leading to the product 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So looking at the options:

Option B: A=trimethyl..., B=3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C=cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

That matches our analysis.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing three Michael addition reactions and determining the reactants and products for each. Here's the breakdown:
