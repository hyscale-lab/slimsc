Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It mentions two parts, A and B, each dealing with different compounds and their properties.

First, let's break down part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? From what I remember, tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, typically in carbonyl compounds. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism. So, tautomerism occurs when a compound can exist in two different forms due to the movement of hydrogen and electrons, like between a ketone and an enol.

So, benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is an aromatic compound, right? It has two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic diene with two oxygen atoms. Or wait, no, quinones are cyclic diketones. So benzoquinone would have two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other, like in para positions.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each separated by a CH2 group. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketones, each at positions 1,3,5.

Now, does benzoquinone exhibit tautomerism? Well, if it's a diketone, maybe it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, in a benzene ring, the ring's conjugation might stabilize the enol form. Hmm, but in reality, quinones are usually resonance-stabilized and may not undergo the same kind of tautomerism as, say, a diketone in a straight chain.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the positions are such that they're already conjugated. Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think about another approach. Tautomerism usually requires a structure where a hydrogen can shift from an oxygen to a carbon, leading to different structures. So, in benzoquinone, each ketone is at a position where the hydrogen (if any) is on the ring. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a C=O group. Oh, wait, the ring is fully conjugated, so maybe the carbonyl groups are conjugated into the ring. So, perhaps the structure doesn't allow for enol formation because the adjacent protons are not available. Because the quinone structure is more like a fully conjugated system, maybe each carbonyl is adjacent to a carbon that's part of the aromatic ring. So maybe the carbonyl groups are in positions where they can't form enols because the adjacent hydrogen isn't present. Wait, in benzoquinone, each ketone is attached to a benzene ring, so the carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to two other ring carbons. So, for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. If the carbonyl is on a ring, like in o-, m-, or p-quinones, maybe the adjacent positions are ring carbons without hydrogens. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism because the structure is such that the necessary hydrogens aren't available. Let's compare it with cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on a carbon that's adjacent to other carbons with hydrogens. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketones, each at alternate positions. Each ketone is probably attached to CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl carbon is next to a CH2 group, which has hydrogens. So, this structure could potentially undergo tautomerism because the adjacent hydrogens can shift, causing enol formation. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone might not.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about benzoquinone. Let me think again. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups across the ring. Each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are part of the ring, hence, they don't have hydrogens attached (since they're double-bonded to the next carbon in the ring). Therefore, there's no hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group to allow for enol formation. So, benzoquinone can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

Wait, but the question is asking which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So part A is to choose which one doesn't. So, if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then for part A, A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me check: if a compound can't tautomerize, it's because it lacks the necessary hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group. Benzoquinone's carbonyl groups are in positions where the adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which is conjugated, so those adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens. So, no H's to shift, hence, no tautomerism possible.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: The carbonyl groups are on a cyclohexane ring, but each is attached to a CH2 group (like in a trione, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2- and then connected in a ring). So, each carbonyl has a CH2 next to it, meaning each has hydrogens available. So, these can undergo enol tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, while benzoquinone can't.

So, for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A = benzoquinone. Looking at the options, let's check.

Now, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, some compounds without a chiral center can show isomerism due to other factors, like cis-trans isomerism in alkenes, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. However, for a compound to have optical isomers, it must have a chiral center, a plane of symmetry, etc.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's write the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is the ester group. Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)COHCOOH? Wait, no. Let me think. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but that's 3-hydroxypropanoic acid? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Then, when it's methyl ester, it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So, the molecule is: 

CH3
|
C(OH)H
|
COOCH3

So, the central carbon (the one attached to OH and two CH3 groups?) Wait, no, wait: the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the single bond to the first carbon (which is CH3 again?), no. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, the structure is more accurately written as:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- One CH3 (from the first carbon)
- One OH group
- One COOCH3 group
- One CH2 group (connecting to the third carbon, which is COOCH3?)

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Let me think again. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3.

So, the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- and the rest is a single bond to the third carbon (which is a carbonyl group). Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is:

The carbon chain is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the central carbon (second) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- and the next carbon is the one attached to the COOCH3. Hmm, so the central carbon has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group? No, wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the actual structure. It's CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. So, the second carbon has:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- and the third carbon is connected via a single bond (so that's a CH2 group? Or is the third carbon a carbonyl? Wait, no, the structure is: 

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (from CH3-)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from -COOCH3)
- and the adjacent carbon (CH-), which is the same as the CH3 group? No, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The second carbon (middle one) has four different groups: a methyl (from the first carbon), an OH, a carbonyl ester group (from the third), and the third carbon is a carbonyl group. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the second carbon is attached to:

- the first carbon (CH3)
- OH
- the third carbon (another carbon)
- and the ester group (OCH3)

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the middle carbon is CH(OH), attached to CH3, COOCH3, and two more carbons: one from the CH3 and another from the COOCH3. Wait, that's not possible. Let me think again. The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon is the second carbon, which has:

- a methyl group (CH3)
- an OH group
- a carbonyl group (COOCH3)
- and a single bond to the third carbon, which is the carbonyl.

Wait, that can't be right because the third carbon is part of the carbonyl group. Hmm, maybe it's better to approach this differently.

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the formula would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3.

So, the second carbon (the hydroxy-bearing carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- and another CH group (from the third carbon?)

Wait, maybe the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (top)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and another CH (CH3?) No, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is attached to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3? No, that would be different. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm, but that would make the second carbon attached to:

- CH2OH (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3
- and two more CH2 groups? No, that doesn't sound right.

Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the possibility of a chiral center. For a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to four different groups, then it's chiral. Let me list the groups:

If the structure is CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3, then the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- and the third carbon, which is a carbonyl group. Wait, but that third carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl, meaning it's not a CH group. So, the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and a carbonyl group (which is a different substituent than the others).

Wait, so the substituents would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the carbonyl group (which is a double bond, so perhaps that substituent is a ketone group). Hmm, but in this case, the second carbon is connected to four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the carbonyl group? Wait, but the carbonyl group is a double bond, so it's not a substituent in the same way. Alternatively, perhaps the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and a CH2 group leading to the COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the molecule as CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, each substituent on the central carbon is:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH (on the same carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and a single bond to the next carbon, which is part of the carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In that case, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH2OH (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the third)
- and two H's? No, that can't be because the central carbon would have four substituents.

Wait, I'm getting too stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is (CH3)CO-OCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)CO-O-CH2CH(OH)2? No, not that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is the ester group attached to the third carbon, which is attached to the second carbon, which has an OH group and is connected to the first carbon (CH3).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as CH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3.

In this case, the second carbon (the one with OH) has four substituents:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- and a single bond to the third carbon (which is part of the carbonyl group).

Wait, but the third carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl group. So the substituents on the second carbon would be:

1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. a single bond to the third carbon (which is a carbonyl, so perhaps considered as a substituent of a different group than the others).

So, if the four substituents are all different, then the second carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe not. Let's think: the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single bond to the carbonyl group. So, the fourth group is the carbon connected to the carbonyl, which is a CH2 group? No, wait, the third carbon is the carbonyl, so the second carbon is attached to it. So, the substituents are:

1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. a CH (from the third carbon, which is a carbonyl group)

Wait, but the third carbon is a carbonyl, so it's a double bond, so it's a carbonyl (like a ketone). So, the substituent from the third carbon is a carbonyl. So, the four groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a carbonyl group. Are these four groups all different?

Yes, because CH3 is a methyl group, OH is a hydroxyl, COOCH3 is an ester group, and the carbonyl is a double bond. So, all four are different. Hence, the second carbon is a chiral center, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a dihydroxybutenedioic acid. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. Its diester with methanol would be (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, the structure is more accurately written as CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no. Let me think. Fumarate is the trans-diestereomer. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that would be if both esters are on the same carbon. Alternatively, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, so the di-ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=C-OOC-OCH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that fumarate has a double bond between the two carbons each bearing an ester group. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, the molecule is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Now, can this molecule have optical isomerism?

In general, fumarate is a trans-diestereomer. So, the double bond geometry is trans. Now, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center. Alternatively, some compounds with a plane of symmetry can't have optical isomers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. So, the molecule is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but each of the carbons on the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, each has the same substituents on either side.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure: each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and another CH3 group? No, wait, wait. Fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So, when you esterify both carboxylic acids with methanol, you get (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, that can't be right because each COOH would become a COOCH3.

So, the structure is (CH3O)2C=CHCOOCH3? No, that's not correct either. Alternatively, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two central carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So, the structure is:

           O
           ||
O-C-OCH3-C=C-C-O-C-OCH3
           |
           O

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the two carbons in the double bond each have two COOCH3 groups attached. No, wait, that can't be right because each would have two ester groups, which would make the molecule symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 and one CH3 group. No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. The molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is (CH2COOCH3)2C=C. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached, along with two CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, that would mean each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2?

Wait, that might not make sense because each carbon can only have four bonds. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-butenedioate. The structure of fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, the molecule has a double bond between the two middle carbons, each of which has two COOCH3 groups. So, each of the middle carbons has two COOCH3 substituents and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would require more substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

But that's not correct either. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. So, each of these carbons is attached to two identical groups (the COOCH3) and two CH2 groups. So, each of these carbons would have two identical substituents. Therefore, they can't be chiral centers because a chiral center requires four different substituents.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me imagine the structure again: the central double bond is between two carbons, each of which has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has:

- Two COOCH3 groups
- Two CH2 groups (from the double bond)

Wait, that can't be because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, each carbon would have:

- One double bond to the other carbon
- Two COOCH3 groups
- And one CH2 group.

Wait, but that would make four bonds. So, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and one CH2 group attached, plus the double bond. But that would mean each has two identical substituents (two COOCH3), so no chiral center.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of the molecule being meso? If the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, it can't have optical isomers. So, if dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso and doesn't show optical isomerism.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer, the structure would have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine: the double bond is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. This would make the molecule symmetrical, so it's a meso compound. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the two compounds in part B are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it has a chiral center (like we discussed earlier), would exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, earlier I thought that the central carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So, the ester would have enantiomers, leading to optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate, being a meso compound, doesn't show optical isomerism because it has an internal plane of symmetry, making the two enantiomers identical (the same as the meso form).

So, of the two, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3, then the central carbon (CHOH) is attached to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and the adjacent carbon (which is the COOCH3-bearing carbon, perhaps a CH group? Or maybe it's a carbonyl group.)

Wait, perhaps the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH group. If all four substituents are different, it's a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH (from the COOCH3 side, which is a carbonyl group, perhaps making it a different substituent).

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are:

1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. CH2COOCH3?

No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth substituent is another CH group, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the substituents:

If the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (top)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and a CH2 group leading to the carbonyl (but that would be a CH2 group).

Wait, but that's still four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2COOCH3? No, that might not be the case. Alternatively, the fourth substituent is a CH2 group connected to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

If that's the case, then methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate, being a meso compound, doesn't.

So, part B: among the two, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Because I might have made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it has a chiral center, does show optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but let me think again about the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon is the CH(OH) part. So, what are the four substituents attached to this carbon?

1. CH3 (from the left)
2. OH (attached to the carbon)
3. COOCH3 (from the right)
4. the adjacent carbon, which is the COOCH3's carbon. Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is the one after the COOCH3, which would be a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and the next carbon, which is a carbonyl group (but that's a double bond, not a substituent).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and the adjacent carbon (which is a carbon connected to the carbonyl group, so perhaps a CH2 group).

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is part of the carbonyl group, so it's a double bond, making it a substituent that's different from the others.

So, the four substituents would be: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a double bond (the carbonyl). Are these all different?

Yes. So, the central carbon has four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Part A:

Benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone).

Part B:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism (so B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate).

Looking at the options:

Option B says: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D says: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties as described in the question.

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can exist in two different forms due to the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a bond. Benzoquinone is a cyclic diketone with two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring, meaning they lack hydrogens necessary for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. Each carbonyl group is adjacent to a CH₂ group, which contains hydrogens. This allows for keto-enol tautomerism, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which requires a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to:
   - CH₃ (from the first carbon),
   - OH,
   - COOCH₃ (from the ester group),
   - and the adjacent carbon (part of the carbonyl group).
   Since all four substituents are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is (CH₃O)₂C=CHCOOCH₃, which is the trans (E) isomer. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans configuration of the double bond, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds do not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It mentions two parts, A and B, each dealing with different compounds and their properties.

First, let's break down part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? From what I remember, tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, typically in carbonyl compounds. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism. So, tautomerism occurs when a compound can exist in two different forms due to the movement of hydrogen and electrons, like between a ketone and an enol.

So, benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is an aromatic compound, right? It has two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic diene with two oxygen atoms. Or wait, no, quinones are cyclic diketones. So benzoquinone would have two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other, like in para positions.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each separated by a CH2 group. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketones, each at positions 1,3,5.

Now, does benzoquinone exhibit tautomerism? Well, if it's a diketone, maybe it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, in a benzene ring, the ring's conjugation might stabilize the enol form. Hmm, but in reality, quinones are usually resonance-stabilized and may not undergo the same kind of tautomerism as, say, a diketone in a straight chain.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the positions are such that they're already conjugated. Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think about another approach. Tautomerism usually requires a structure where a hydrogen can shift from an oxygen to a carbon, leading to different structures. So, in benzoquinone, each ketone is at a position where the hydrogen (if any) is on the ring. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a C=O group. Oh, wait, the ring is fully conjugated, so maybe the carbonyl groups are conjugated into the ring. So, perhaps the structure doesn't allow for enol formation because the adjacent protons are not available. Because the quinone structure is more like a fully conjugated system, maybe each carbonyl is adjacent to a carbon that's part of the aromatic ring. So maybe the carbonyl groups are in positions where they can't form enols because the adjacent hydrogen isn't present. Wait, in benzoquinone, each ketone is attached to a benzene ring, so the carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to two other ring carbons. So, for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. If the carbonyl is on a ring, like in o-, m-, or p-quinones, maybe the adjacent positions are ring carbons without hydrogens. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism because the structure is such that the necessary hydrogens aren't available. Let's compare it with cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on a carbon that's adjacent to other carbons with hydrogens. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketones, each at alternate positions. Each ketone is probably attached to CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl carbon is next to a CH2 group, which has hydrogens. So, this structure could potentially undergo tautomerism because the adjacent hydrogens can shift, causing enol formation. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone might not.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about benzoquinone. Let me think again. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups across the ring. Each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are part of the ring, hence, they don't have hydrogens attached (since they're double-bonded to the next carbon in the ring). Therefore, there's no hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group to allow for enol formation. So, benzoquinone can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

Wait, but the question is asking which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So part A is to choose which one doesn't. So, if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then for part A, A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me check: if a compound can't tautomerize, it's because it lacks the necessary hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group. Benzoquinone's carbonyl groups are in positions where the adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which is conjugated, so those adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens. So, no H's to shift, hence, no tautomerism possible.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: The carbonyl groups are on a cyclohexane ring, but each is attached to a CH2 group (like in a trione, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2- and then connected in a ring). So, each carbonyl has a CH2 next to it, meaning each has hydrogens available. So, these can undergo enol tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, while benzoquinone can't.

So, for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A = benzoquinone. Looking at the options, let's check.

Now, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, some compounds without a chiral center can show isomerism due to other factors, like cis-trans isomerism in alkenes, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. However, for a compound to have optical isomers, it must have a chiral center, a plane of symmetry, etc.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's write the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is the ester group. Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)COHCOOH? Wait, no. Let me think. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but that's 3-hydroxypropanoic acid? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Then, when it's methyl ester, it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So, the molecule is: 

CH3
|
C(OH)H
|
COOCH3

So, the central carbon (the one attached to OH and two CH3 groups?) Wait, no, wait: the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the single bond to the first carbon (which is CH3 again?), no. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, the structure is more accurately written as:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- One CH3 (from the first carbon)
- One OH group
- One COOCH3 group
- One CH2 group (connecting to the third carbon, which is COOCH3?)

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Let me think again. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3.

So, the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- and the rest is a single bond to the third carbon (which is a carbonyl group). Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is:

The carbon chain is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the central carbon (second) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- and the next carbon is the one attached to the COOCH3. Hmm, so the central carbon has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group? No, wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the actual structure. It's CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. So, the second carbon has:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- and the third carbon is connected via a single bond (so that's a CH2 group? Or is the third carbon a carbonyl? Wait, no, the structure is: 

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (from CH3-)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from -COOCH3)
- and the adjacent carbon (CH-), which is the same as the CH3 group? No, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The second carbon (middle one) has four different groups: a methyl (from the first carbon), an OH, a carbonyl ester group (from the third), and the third carbon is a carbonyl group. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the second carbon is attached to:

- the first carbon (CH3)
- OH
- the third carbon (another carbon)
- and the ester group (OCH3)

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the middle carbon is CH(OH), attached to CH3, COOCH3, and two more carbons: one from the CH3 and another from the COOCH3. Wait, that's not possible. Let me think again. The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon is the second carbon, which has:

- a methyl group (CH3)
- an OH group
- a carbonyl group (COOCH3)
- and a single bond to the third carbon, which is the carbonyl.

Wait, that can't be right because the third carbon is part of the carbonyl group. Hmm, maybe it's better to approach this differently.

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the formula would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3.

So, the second carbon (the hydroxy-bearing carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- and another CH group (from the third carbon?)

Wait, maybe the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (top)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and another CH (CH3?) No, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is attached to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3? No, that would be different. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm, but that would make the second carbon attached to:

- CH2OH (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3
- and two more CH2 groups? No, that doesn't sound right.

Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the possibility of a chiral center. For a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to four different groups, then it's chiral. Let me list the groups:

If the structure is CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3, then the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- and the third carbon, which is a carbonyl group. Wait, but that third carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl, meaning it's not a CH group. So, the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and a carbonyl group (which is a different substituent than the others).

Wait, so the substituents would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the carbonyl group (which is a double bond, so perhaps that substituent is a ketone group). Hmm, but in this case, the second carbon is connected to four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the carbonyl group? Wait, but the carbonyl group is a double bond, so it's not a substituent in the same way. Alternatively, perhaps the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and a CH2 group leading to the COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the molecule as CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, each substituent on the central carbon is:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH (on the same carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and a single bond to the next carbon, which is part of the carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In that case, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH2OH (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the third)
- and two H's? No, that can't be because the central carbon would have four substituents.

Wait, I'm getting too stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is (CH3)CO-OCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)CO-O-CH2CH(OH)2? No, not that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is the ester group attached to the third carbon, which is attached to the second carbon, which has an OH group and is connected to the first carbon (CH3).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as CH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3.

In this case, the second carbon (the one with OH) has four substituents:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- and a single bond to the third carbon (which is part of the carbonyl group).

Wait, but the third carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl group. So the substituents on the second carbon would be:

1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. a single bond to the third carbon (which is a carbonyl, so perhaps considered as a substituent of a different group than the others).

So, if the four substituents are all different, then the second carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe not. Let's think: the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single bond to the carbonyl group. So, the fourth group is the carbon connected to the carbonyl, which is a CH2 group? No, wait, the third carbon is the carbonyl, so the second carbon is attached to it. So, the substituents are:

1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. a CH (from the third carbon, which is a carbonyl group)

Wait, but the third carbon is a carbonyl, so it's a double bond, so it's a carbonyl (like a ketone). So, the substituent from the third carbon is a carbonyl. So, the four groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a carbonyl group. Are these four groups all different?

Yes, because CH3 is a methyl group, OH is a hydroxyl, COOCH3 is an ester group, and the carbonyl is a double bond. So, all four are different. Hence, the second carbon is a chiral center, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a dihydroxybutenedioic acid. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. Its diester with methanol would be (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, the structure is more accurately written as CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no. Let me think. Fumarate is the trans-diestereomer. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that would be if both esters are on the same carbon. Alternatively, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, so the di-ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=C-OOC-OCH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that fumarate has a double bond between the two carbons each bearing an ester group. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, the molecule is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Now, can this molecule have optical isomerism?

In general, fumarate is a trans-diestereomer. So, the double bond geometry is trans. Now, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center. Alternatively, some compounds with a plane of symmetry can't have optical isomers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. So, the molecule is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but each of the carbons on the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, each has the same substituents on either side.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure: each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and another CH3 group? No, wait, wait. Fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So, when you esterify both carboxylic acids with methanol, you get (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, that can't be right because each COOH would become a COOCH3.

So, the structure is (CH3O)2C=CHCOOCH3? No, that's not correct either. Alternatively, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two central carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So, the structure is:

           O
           ||
O-C-OCH3-C=C-C-O-C-OCH3
           |
           O

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the two carbons in the double bond each have two COOCH3 groups attached. No, wait, that can't be right because each would have two ester groups, which would make the molecule symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 and one CH3 group. No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. The molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is (CH2COOCH3)2C=C. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached, along with two CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, that would mean each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2?

Wait, that might not make sense because each carbon can only have four bonds. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-butenedioate. The structure of fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, the molecule has a double bond between the two middle carbons, each of which has two COOCH3 groups. So, each of the middle carbons has two COOCH3 substituents and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would require more substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

But that's not correct either. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. So, each of these carbons is attached to two identical groups (the COOCH3) and two CH2 groups. So, each of these carbons would have two identical substituents. Therefore, they can't be chiral centers because a chiral center requires four different substituents.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me imagine the structure again: the central double bond is between two carbons, each of which has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has:

- Two COOCH3 groups
- Two CH2 groups (from the double bond)

Wait, that can't be because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, each carbon would have:

- One double bond to the other carbon
- Two COOCH3 groups
- And one CH2 group.

Wait, but that would make four bonds. So, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and one CH2 group attached, plus the double bond. But that would mean each has two identical substituents (two COOCH3), so no chiral center.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of the molecule being meso? If the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, it can't have optical isomers. So, if dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso and doesn't show optical isomerism.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer, the structure would have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine: the double bond is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. This would make the molecule symmetrical, so it's a meso compound. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the two compounds in part B are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it has a chiral center (like we discussed earlier), would exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, earlier I thought that the central carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So, the ester would have enantiomers, leading to optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate, being a meso compound, doesn't show optical isomerism because it has an internal plane of symmetry, making the two enantiomers identical (the same as the meso form).

So, of the two, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3, then the central carbon (CHOH) is attached to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and the adjacent carbon (which is the COOCH3-bearing carbon, perhaps a CH group? Or maybe it's a carbonyl group.)

Wait, perhaps the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH group. If all four substituents are different, it's a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH (from the COOCH3 side, which is a carbonyl group, perhaps making it a different substituent).

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are:

1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. CH2COOCH3?

No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth substituent is another CH group, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the substituents:

If the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (top)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and a CH2 group leading to the carbonyl (but that would be a CH2 group).

Wait, but that's still four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2COOCH3? No, that might not be the case. Alternatively, the fourth substituent is a CH2 group connected to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

If that's the case, then methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate, being a meso compound, doesn't.

So, part B: among the two, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Because I might have made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it has a chiral center, does show optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but let me think again about the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon is the CH(OH) part. So, what are the four substituents attached to this carbon?

1. CH3 (from the left)
2. OH (attached to the carbon)
3. COOCH3 (from the right)
4. the adjacent carbon, which is the COOCH3's carbon. Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is the one after the COOCH3, which would be a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and the next carbon, which is a carbonyl group (but that's a double bond, not a substituent).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and the adjacent carbon (which is a carbon connected to the carbonyl group, so perhaps a CH2 group).

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is part of the carbonyl group, so it's a double bond, making it a substituent that's different from the others.

So, the four substituents would be: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a double bond (the carbonyl). Are these all different?

Yes. So, the central carbon has four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Part A:

Benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone).

Part B:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism (so B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate).

Looking at the options:

Option B says: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D says: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties as described in the question.

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can exist in two different forms due to the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a bond. Benzoquinone is a cyclic diketone with two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring, meaning they lack hydrogens necessary for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. Each carbonyl group is adjacent to a CH₂ group, which contains hydrogens. This allows for keto-enol tautomerism, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which requires a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to:
   - CH₃ (from the first carbon),
   - OH,
   - COOCH₃ (from the ester group),
   - and the adjacent carbon (part of the carbonyl group).
   Since all four substituents are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is (CH₃O)₂C=CHCOOCH₃, which is the trans (E) isomer. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans configuration of the double bond, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds do not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
