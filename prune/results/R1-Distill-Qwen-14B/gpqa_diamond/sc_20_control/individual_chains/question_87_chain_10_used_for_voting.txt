Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and figure out what it's asking.

The question says: I prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, the compound is a di-substituted benzene, meaning there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene itself is 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add up to 2 carbons. But wait, maybe the substituents are larger; maybe each is contributing more than one carbon. Let me think.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So each substituent could be a methyl group, but since it's di-substituted, maybe two groups each with one carbon. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and another is a halogen. Because IR shows a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Cl, Br attached to the ring).

Let me think about the possible structures. So the ring has two substituents. One is a halogen (since IR shows aromatic-halogen bond), and the other must be a carbonyl-containing group. But wait, the carbonyl could be part of a substituent like an acetyl group, perhaps.

Wait, but the substituents' carbons add up to 2. Let me calculate again. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. Two substituents: if each substituent is a single carbon, that's 2 carbons total. So each substituent is a single carbon. But wait, a halogen is an atom, not a carbon, right? So if one substituent is -X (like Cl), that's one substituent, and the other must be a group that has one carbon attached to the ring. So maybe the groups are -X and -COR, where R is a substituent.

Wait, but wait, the total carbons in the molecule are 8. Benzene (6 C) + substituents (2 C) = 8. So substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So each substituent is a single carbon, but one is a halogen (which doesn't add a carbon), so the other substituent must be a single carbon group. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. So if the benzene is 6, then the two substituents must be two groups each with one carbon. Because 6 + 2 = 8. So each substituent is a single carbon. But one substituent is a halogen; that's just an atom, no carbons. So the other substituent must be a group with one carbon. Which would be, for example, a methoxy group (OCH3) but that's not a carbonyl.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group. Like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester.

But in the substituents, only one substituent can be a carbonyl. So one substituent is -X (like Cl), and the other is a group with a carbonyl. But the carbonyl would require at least two carbons. Wait, is that possible? Let me think.

Wait, no—maybe the substituent is a carbonyl with one carbon attached. For example, an acetyl group is -COCH3, which is two carbons (the CO and the CH3). But that would add two carbons, which would bring the total to 8 (6+2=8). So that could work.

Wait, let's lay this out. The benzene ring has two substituents. One is a halogen (like Cl) and the other is an acetyl group (COCH3).

So the structure would be benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups attached. That would give a total of 6 (benzene) + 1 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 9? Wait no, wait. Wait, Cl is an atom, so the COCH3 is two carbons. So 6 + 2 =8. Oh right, because Cl is an atom, not a carbon. So substituents: Cl (no carbons) and COCH3 (two carbons, but in the substituent, the carbonyl is part of the COCH3 group) so the total would be 6 + 2 =8.

Wait, but wait, the substituent COCH3 is two carbons in the substituent, but the substituent is attached to the ring. So the ring has 6 C, substituent Cl has 0 C, substituent COCH3 has two C. So 6 + 0 + 2 =8. That matches.

So the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups. Alternatively, it could be another substitution pattern, but di-substituted.

Now, the IR spectrum shows a carbonyl (so the CO in the COCH3 group) and an aromatic-halogen bond (so Cl attached to the ring).

Now, the question is about the 1H NMR. Let's think about how the substituents would affect the NMR.

First, the aromatic ring. If the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Let's say Cl is at position 1 and COCH3 at position 3 (but that's meta), or position 4 (para). Wait, if they are para, then the ring would have two equivalent protons in each ortho position. Or let me think in terms of substitution patterns.

Wait, in para substitution, the substituents are across from each other, so substituents at positions 1 and 3? No, para is 1 and 4? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other (para). So substituents at 1 and 4.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the two ortho to Cl, and the two ortho to COCH3. But wait, para substitution would lead to equivalent sets. So if the ring has substituents at the para positions, the aromatic protons would split into two sets: the two H adjacent to Cl (which are equivalent) and the two H adjacent to COCH3 (equivalent). But wait, in a para-substituted di-substituted benzene, the ring should have two sets of equivalent H: each set being two H (if substituents are at para positions, the ring would have a certain symmetry).

Wait, let me think of para-dichlorobenzene. No, that's two Cl substituents. Alternatively, para-substituted with two different groups.

Actually, for a di-substituted benzene with two different substituents in para positions, the ring will have two sets of equivalent protons: each ortho to each substituent. So for each substituent, the adjacent (ortho) H would be equivalent. But in the case of substituents that are different, perhaps the two ortho protons to each substituent may not have the same chemical shift.

Wait, but in the case of para-substituted benzene with two different groups, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Let's say substituents A and B are at positions 1 and 4. Then, the H at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to A) would be equivalent, and the H at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to B) would be another set. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

But wait, that's only true if the substituents A and B are such that the ring's symmetry allows the ortho Hs to each substituent to be equivalent. For example, if substituent A is Cl and substituent B is COCH3, then the H ortho to Cl and ortho to COCH3 would likely have different chemical shifts because the substituents are different.

So in the aromatic region of the NMR, we would expect two doublets. One for the two H ortho to Cl, and another for the two H ortho to COCH3. So in the NMR, there would be two signals: each integrating to 2H, and each as a doublet.

Additionally, the COCH3 group would have a methyl group attached to the carbonyl. The CH3 group would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl (which doesn't have any H), so the CH3 would be deshielded and appear as a singlet around δ 2.1-2.3 ppm.

Wait, but wait, in the case of COCH3, the carbonyl is a ketone, so it's R-CO-CH3. The CH3 group would be next to the carbonyl, so it would be deshielded and appear around δ 2.1 ppm as a singlet because it's attached to the carbonyl group, which has no H, so no splitting.

Additionally, the CO group itself doesn't have any protons, so the only other protons would be the aromatic and any other groups. But wait, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the only H in the molecule would be the aromatic Hs and the CH3 in COCH3.

Wait, but what if the substituent is a carbonyl group with an adjacent O? Like an ester group? Or maybe an acetyl group. But the key is that the substituent has a carbonyl, so the CH3 next to it would show up as a singlet.

So in the NMR, aromatic region would have two doublets (each 2H), and a singlet around 2.3 ppm for the CH3.

Now, let's look at the options.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

This seems to have a singlet at 9.9, which might be an aldehyde proton. But the substituents are Cl and COCH3. Wait, unless the substituent is something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde would have a strong carbonyl, but in that case, the substituent would be -CHO. Let me think. But if the substituent is -CHO, that's one carbon (CHO), so the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (Cl) + 1 (CHO) = 8, but wait, benzene is 6, Cl is 0, CHO is 1, so total 7? No, wait, benzene has 6, substituents are Cl (0 C) and CHO (1 C), so 6 + 1 =7. But the question says 8. So that wouldn't add up. So substituent can't be CHO. So option A's singlet at 9.9 must be something else, maybe a phenol O-H, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So probably not.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).

This looks like a structure with two sets of -OCH2- groups, perhaps. Maybe something like a glyceryl group or an ether linkage. But I'm not sure. The 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are indicative of protons next to oxygen. Hmm, but in our case, substituents are Cl and COCH3. So this might not align.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).

So aromatic region: two doublets, each 2H. And a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating for 3H. That would fit with a COCH3 group (the singlet) and two sets of aromatic protons (each 2H, as doublets). Let's think about that.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. So in option C, aromatic signals are at 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that would correspond to two sets of two H each as doublets. The singlet at 2.3 is 3H, which is a CH3. So that would fit with a substituent like COCH3 (the CH3 would be a singlet). Wait, but wait, COCH3 has a CH3, but that's a singlet. So this matches.

But wait, why are the aromatic protons in two doublets? If substituents are para, then the ortho Hs to each substituent would be equivalent. So for para substitution of Cl and COCH3, the ortho Hs would each have the same shift. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of two H each, each as a doublet. That makes sense.

So in option C, that's exactly what we have. Two doublets each 2H, and a singlet for the CH3. So this looks promising.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).

The 6.9 singlet suggests an aromatic proton that's isolated. Maybe a meta substituent. The 4.8 and 4.6 with 2H each, and 1.3 singlet. Could this be a structure with an OCH2CH2O group or something? Not sure. But in our case, substituents are Cl and COCH3, so the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, not a singlet and a couple of other groups.

So, based on this, option C matches the expected NMR for a para-substituted benzene with substituents Cl and COCH3. The aromatic region shows two doublets (each 2H), and a singlet for the CH3 of the COCH3 group.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the substitution pattern again. If the substituents are para, then the ortho and para positions are occupied. So the aromatic Hs would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to the substituents. For example, in para substitution, each substituent has two ortho Hs. So each ortho set would show as a doublet because of coupling with adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, could the substituents be in the ortho positions? That is, the two groups are adjacent on the benzene ring. Then, the aromatic protons would have a different splitting pattern. But that's less likely because the question says di-substituted, but doesn't specify the positions. However, in the case of substituents being in the para position, the NMR would have two doublets, which is what option C shows.

So, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., COCH₃). This makes the structure a para-substituted benzene with one substituent as Cl and the other as COCH₃.

### Key Analysis of the ¹H NMR:
1. **Aromatic Region**:  
   - In a para-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons split into two sets of two equivalent protons each.  
   - The protons ortho to the carbonyl group (COCH₃) are more deshielded and appear as a doublet at a higher chemical shift (~7.8 ppm).  
   - The protons ortho to the halogen (Cl) are less deshielded and appear as a doublet at a lower chemical shift (~7.6 ppm).  

2. **Carbonyl-Substituted Methyl Group**:  
   - The CH₃ group attached to the carbonyl (COCH₃) is deshielded and appears as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm due to the absence of adjacent protons.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which suggests an aldehyde proton. However, the substituents are Cl and COCH₃, not an aldehyde group. This option is incorrect.  
- **Option B**: Shows signals indicative of protons near oxygen atoms (e.g., CH₂ groups), which are not consistent with the substituents Cl and COCH₃. This option is incorrect.  
- **Option C**: Matches the expected NMR for a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH₃. The aromatic region shows two doublets (2H each, at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), and the singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the CH₃ group of COCH₃. This option is correct.  
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which suggests an isolated aromatic proton, inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct ¹H NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH₃ as substituents.

No, wait, benzene has 6, substituents are Cl (0 C) and CHO (1 C), so 6 + 1 =7. But the question says 8. So that wouldn't add up. So substituent can't be CHO. So option A's singlet at 9.9 must be something else, maybe a phenol O-H, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So probably not.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).

This looks like a structure with two sets of -OCH2- groups, perhaps. Maybe something like a glyceryl group or an ether linkage. But I'm not sure. The 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are indicative of protons next to oxygen. Hmm, but in our case, substituents are Cl and COCH3. So this might not align.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).

So aromatic region: two doublets, each 2H. And a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating for 3H. That would fit with a COCH3 group (the singlet) and two sets of aromatic protons (each 2H, as doublets). Let's think about that.

Wait, but wait, COCH3 has a CH3, but that's a singlet. So this matches.

But wait, why are the aromatic protons in two doublets? If substituents are para, then the ortho Hs to each substituent would be equivalent. So for para substitution of Cl and COCH3, the ortho Hs would each have the same shift. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of two H each, each as a doublet. That makes sense.

So in option C, that's exactly what we have. Two doublets each 2H, and a singlet for the CH3. So this looks promising.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).

The 6.9 singlet suggests an aromatic proton that's isolated. Maybe a meta substituent. The 4.8 and 4.6 with 2H each, and 1.3 singlet. Could this be a structure with an OCH2CH2O group or something? Not sure. But in our case, substituents are Cl and COCH3, so the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, not a singlet and a couple of other groups.

So, based on this, option C matches the expected NMR for a para-substituted benzene with substituents Cl and COCH3. The aromatic region shows two doublets (each 2H), and a singlet for the CH3 of the COCH3 group.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the substitution pattern again. If the substituents are para, then the ortho and para positions are occupied. So the aromatic Hs would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to the substituents. For example, in para substitution, each substituent has two ortho Hs. So each ortho set would show as a doublet because of coupling with adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, could the substituents be in the ortho positions? That is, the two groups are adjacent on the benzene ring. Then, the aromatic protons would have a different splitting pattern. But that's less likely because the question says di-substituted, but doesn't specify the positions. However, in the case of substituents being in the para position, the NMR would have two doublets, which is what option C shows.

So, the correct answer is option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., COCH₃). This makes the structure a para-substituted benzene with one substituent as Cl and the other as COCH₃.

### Key Analysis of the ¹H NMR:
1. **Aromatic Region**:  
   - In a para-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons split into two sets of two equivalent protons each.  
   - The protons ortho to the carbonyl group (COCH₃) are more deshielded and appear as a doublet at a higher chemical shift (~7.8 ppm).  
   - The protons ortho to the halogen (Cl) are less deshielded and appear as a doublet at a lower chemical shift (~7.6 ppm).  

2. **Carbonyl-Substituted Methyl Group**:  
   - The CH₃ group attached to the carbonyl (COCH₃) is deshielded and appears as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm due to the absence of adjacent protons.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which suggests an aldehyde proton. However, the substituents are Cl and COCH₃, not an aldehyde group. This option is incorrect.  
- **Option B**: Shows signals indicative of protons near oxygen atoms (e.g., CH₂ groups), which are not consistent with the substituents Cl and COCH₃. This option is incorrect.  
- **Option C**: Matches the expected NMR for a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH₃. The aromatic region shows two doublets (2H each, at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), and the singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the CH₃ group of COCH₃. This option is correct.  
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which suggests an isolated aromatic proton, inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct ¹H NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH₃ as substituents.

Answer: C
