Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. Astronomers have determined their elemental abundances using the Equivalent Width (EW) method, which I think is a method to measure the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere by looking at absorption lines.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Hmm, okay. And the Sun's photosphere has specific values: the log of (nFe/nH) is 7.5, and the same for Mg is 7. Wait, no—wait the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So that log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5? Because 12 + log(...) =7.5 → log(...) = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, log(nMg/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -5? Because 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5. So nMg/nH is 10^(-5).

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 ].

Hmm. Let me think about the notation. The brackets [Element/Element] are the logarithmic abundance ratios relative to another element in the same star. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, more accurately, [X/Y]_star = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun = log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So that's the same as log(n_X/n_Y in star / n_X/n_Y in sun) = log( (n_X star / n_Y star) * (n_Y sun / n_X sun) ) ).

Wait, maybe it's better to write the equations for each star and then find the ratios.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So that means log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0. So log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

Wait, the Sun's n_Fe/n_H is given as log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5, right? Because Sun's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) in the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So n_Fe,n1 / n_H,n1 = same as in the Sun. So n_Fe,1 = (n_H,1) * (10^-4.5).

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2.

Let me think about Star_2. [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So log(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 - log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = 0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so log(n_Mg/n_H)_2 = log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun.

But n_Mg/n_H in Sun is 10^(-5) because 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5.

So for Star_2, n_Mg,2 / n_H,2 = 10^(-5) * (n_H,2 / n_H_sun)? Wait, no. Because [Mg/H]_2 is 0, which is log(n_Mg/n_H)_2 - log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun =0. So log(n_Mg,n2 / n_H,n2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) → n_Mg,n2 / n_H,n2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

Wait, but n_H here is the number density of hydrogen. So for Star_2, the ratio of Mg to H is the same as the Sun.

But I think I need to express the silicon abundance in each star in terms of hydrogen, then compute the ratio.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 ) = log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → n_Fe,1/n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.

Wait, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun = 0.3. So log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3 }.

But I also know n_Fe,1 = (n_H,1) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ), from the [Fe/H]_1 =0.

So substituting:

n_Si,1 = (n_H,1 * n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) + 0.3 }

Hmm. Let me compute n_Si,1/n_H,1.

n_Si,1/n_H,1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) + 0.3 }

Let me compute that.

log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) is log( (n_Si,n_sun) / (n_Fe,n_sun) )

Wait, what's the Sun's n_Si? Hmm. Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) - log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) =0. But wait, the question gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but perhaps in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is not given. But perhaps I can calculate it.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nFe? Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun is log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. So n_Si/n_Fe =10^[Si/Fe]_sun. But since the Sun's [X/Y] is zero unless stated, but wait the problem doesn't state [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm, this is a problem. Because to compute n_Si,1, I need to know the Sun's [Si/Fe].

Wait, but perhaps we can assume that in the Sun's photosphere, [Si/Fe] = 0? Because if [Fe/H] is zero in the Sun, and [Si/Fe] is zero, then n_Si/n_Fe would be the same as in the star. Wait, no, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, but [Si/Fe] is not given.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not zero. Hmmm. I need to find a way to express n_Si in terms of n_Fe, which in turn can be expressed in terms of n_H.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think for Star_1 first.

Star_1:

n_Fe,1/n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = (1e-4.5) [since n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun is 10^-4.5].

So n_Fe,1 = n_H,1 * 1e-4.5.

Then, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3 }.

But I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm. But perhaps I can find n_Si_sun in terms of n_Fe_sun and n_Mg_sun, but I don't think that's directly helpful.

Wait, maybe I can express n_Si,1 in terms of n_H,1:

n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3 }.

But n_Fe,1 = (n_H,1) * (1e-4.5).

So n_Si,1 = (n_H,1 * 1e-4.5 ) * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/(n_Fe_sun)) + 0.3 }.

But I still don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm. Maybe I can relate it through the other star.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate [Si/Fe]_sun?

Wait, in the Sun, [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) = log( (1e-4.5) ) = -4.5 → [Fe/H]_sun is -4.5. Wait, but no, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe/n_H) relative to the Sun's own value. Oh wait, no, [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun. But in the Sun's case, [X/H]_sun is zero for all elements, because it's the reference. So [Fe/H]_sun is zero, but the Sun's n_Fe/n_H is 1e-4.5.

Wait, but for the other elements, like Si, in the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. That's their ratio in the Sun. But I don't have that value.

Wait, perhaps I need to make an assumption. For example, perhaps in the Sun, the ratio of Si to Fe is the same as in some standard value. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate it through another element, like Mg.

Wait, the problem gives [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

But how does that help me with Star_1's [Si/Fe]?

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on each star separately, compute their n_Si in terms of n_H, and then take the ratio.

Let's try that.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe,1 = (n_H,1) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) = n_H,1 * (1e-4.5).

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

But n_Si_sun and n_Fe_sun are the solar values.

Wait, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of the Sun's [Si/Fe].

Let me denote [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

So, in Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/Fe]_sun + 0.3.

Because [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) - [Si/Fe]_sun =0.3 → log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) = [Si/Fe]_sun + 0.3.

Wait, no, [X/Y]_star = log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) =0.3 → log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) + 0.3 → n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) *10^0.3.

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe,1 is (n_H,1) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) → so substituting:

n_Si,1 = (n_H,1 * n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

Simplify:

n_Si,1 = n_H,1 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

So n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

Hmm, that's useful. So the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in Star_1 is the solar ratio multiplied by 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, let's compute n_Si,2 / n_H,2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(n_Mg,2/n_H,2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun ) → n_Mg,2/n_H,2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

So n_Mg,2 = n_H,2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun ) = n_H,2 * (1e-5).

From [Mg/Si]_2, we have:

log(n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 ) = log( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) ) + 0.3.

So n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

But n_Mg,2 = n_H,2 * 1e-5.

So,

(n_H,2 *1e-5 ) / n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

Rearranging:

n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 *1e-5 ) / ( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3} )

But n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun is the solar ratio of Mg to Si.

Wait, I know n_Mg_sun and n_H_sun, and n_Fe_sun, but I don't know n_Si_sun directly.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate n_Si_sun to n_Fe_sun and n_Mg_sun.

Wait, but that's probably not possible without more information. Alternatively, perhaps I can find n_Si_sun in terms of other elements.

Wait, in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun. So [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ). But the problem doesn't give this value for the Sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) and (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) and then find n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun.

Because the Sun's n_Mg/nH is 1e-5, and n_Si/nH is something else.

Wait, the Sun's n_Si/nH: 12 + log(n_Si/nH) = ?

The problem doesn't state it, so perhaps it's zero or some other value.

Wait, no. The problem only gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that in the Sun, [Si/H] is zero? No, that can't be, because the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, but [Si/H] could be different.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of n_Si/nH in the Sun using the given data.

Wait, let me think. For the Sun, n_Fe/nH is 1e-4.5, and n_Mg/nH is 1e-5. But we don't have n_Si/nH.

Hmm, perhaps I can ignore that and proceed, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can make use of the fact that in Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, let me think again.

For Star_2:

n_Mg,2 = n_H,2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) → n_Mg,2 = n_H,2 *1e-5.

And [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) + 0.3.

So,

n_Mg,2 /n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

Substituting n_Mg,2 =n_H,2 *1e-5,

(n_H,2 *1e-5 ) /n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 *1e-5 ) / ( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3} )

→ n_Si,2 = n_H,2 * (1e-5) * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) * 1e^{-0.3}.

So,

n_Si,2/n_H,2 = (1e-5) * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) * 1e^{-0.3}.

But I don't know n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun.

Wait, but in the Sun, n_Si/nH is something, and n_Mg/nH is 1e-5.

Wait, perhaps I can express (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) / (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) → which is (n_Si/nH)_sun / (1e-5).

But that's (n_Si/nH)_sun / (1e-5) → (n_Si/nH)_sun = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) = let's call this x. So (n_Si/nH)_sun =x, so n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun = x / (1e-5 ).

Wait, but I don't know x. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find x by using the fact that in the Sun, [Fe/H] is zero, but that's about Fe and H, not Si.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find n_Si_sun in terms of other solar abundances.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the abundances using the star's data.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me think about the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2.

So, the ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) → (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2/n_Si,2 ).

Wait, but both stars could have different n_H? No, because the problem states that the photospheric composition is for each star, so hydrogen density is different in each.

Wait, no, the ratio of Si to H in each star is what matters, right? Because the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2."

Assuming that the ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ).

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms" so perhaps it's n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

But wait, the question isn't clear on whether that's per unit H. Oh, but the options are numbers like ~3.9, ~12.6, etc. So perhaps the ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) → how many times more Si in Star_1 compared to Star_2.

Or, perhaps it's (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ), which would be the ratio of their silicon-to-hydrogen ratios.

Hmm, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2."

So perhaps it's (n_Si,1 ) / (n_Si,2 ), regardless of hydrogen. But that's a number density ratio, which would depend on the size of the photosphere. But perhaps since both stars are similar in some way (same method used), the ratio can be found without knowing the exact sizes.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of their silicon-to-hydrogen ratios, but I think the question is about the actual number of silicon atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2, which would be the same as (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2/n_H,2 ), which is the same as (n_Si,1/n_Si,2 ) * (n_H,2/n_H,1 ).

But without knowing the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2, this approach may not be helpful.

Wait, but perhaps the question is looking for the ratio of [Si/Fe] in each star, but no, the question is about silicon atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the ratio of [Si/H] in each star, which can be determined from the given data.

Wait, let's try to compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1 ) = (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si,1 = (n_Fe,1 ) * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe,1 =n_H,1 *1e-4.5. So,

n_Si,1 = n_H,1 *1e-4.5 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

Thus,

n_Si,1 /n_H,1 = (1e-4.5) * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

But, n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun is (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) / (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ) → (x) / (1e-4.5 ), where x is n_Si_sun/n_H_sun.

So,

n_Si,1 /n_H,1 = (1e-4.5) * (x / 1e-4.5 ) * 1e^0.3 → x *1e^0.3.

But I don't know x. Hmm.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (n_Mg,2 /n_Si,2 ) = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg,2 /n_H,2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun =1e-5.

So,

n_Mg,2 =n_H,2 *1e-5.

Thus,

(n_H,2 *1e-5 ) /n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

→ n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 *1e-5 ) / ( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3} )

→ n_Si,2 = n_H,2 *1e-5 * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) *1e^{-0.3}.

So,

n_Si,2 /n_H,2 = 1e-5 * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) *1e^{-0.3}.

Again, n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun is (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) / (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun ) → (x) / (1e-5 ), since n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun is 1e-5.

So,

n_Si,2 /n_H,2 = 1e-5 * (x/1e-5 ) *1e^{-0.3} → x *1e^{-0.3}.

Wait, so now for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) = log( x *1e^0.3 ) = log(x) +0.3 * log(10) = log(x) +0.3.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si,2/n_H,2 ) = log( x *1e^{-0.3} ) = log(x) -0.3.

Wait, but that's only if x is a number greater than zero, which it is.

So the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 would be (log(x) +0.3 ) - (log(x) -0.3 ) = 0.6 dex. So [Si/H]_1 is 0.6 dex higher than [Si/H]_2.

But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, not the abundance ratio. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ), which would be 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Because [Si/H] is the logarithm of n_Si/n_H. So if [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_2 +0.6, then n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2/n_Si,2 ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } / 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } } =10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3 → no, no, because [Si/H]_1 is log(n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) = 0.3 + log(x) - log(x) → no, because earlier I found that [Si/H]_1 = log(x *1e^{0.3}) → which is log(x) +0.3. But [Si/H]_sun is log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )=log(x).

So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si,2/n_H,2 ) = log( x *1e^{-0.3} ) → log(x) -0.3 → [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

So the difference between [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 is 0.6 dex.

So the ratio of their silicon abundances (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 4, which matches option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and solar photospheric compositions.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe},1}/n_{\text{H},1}) = \log(n_{\text{Fe},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{Fe},1}) = \log(n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{Fe},\odot}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg},2}/n_{\text{H},2}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg},2}/n_{\text{Si},2}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg},\odot}/n_{\text{Si},\odot}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe},1}/n_{\text{H},1} = n_{\text{Fe},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \).
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{Fe},1} = (n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{Fe},\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe},1} = n_{\text{H},1} \cdot 10^{-4.5} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{H},1} = (n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg},2}/n_{\text{H},2} = n_{\text{Mg},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot} = 10^{-5} \).
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Mg},2}/n_{\text{Si},2} = (n_{\text{Mg},\odot}/n_{\text{Si},\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg},2} = n_{\text{H},2} \cdot 10^{-5} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si},2}/n_{\text{H},2} = (n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{H},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}/n_{\text{H},2}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3}}{(n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
- \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. Astronomers have determined their elemental abundances using the Equivalent Width (EW) method, which I think is a method to measure the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere by looking at absorption lines.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Hmm, okay. And the Sun's photosphere has specific values: the log of (nFe/nH) is 7.5, and the same for Mg is 7. Wait, no—wait the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So that log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5? Because 12 + log(...) =7.5 → log(...) = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, log(nMg/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -5? Because 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5. So nMg/nH is 10^(-5).

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 ].

Hmm. Let me think about the notation. The brackets [Element/Element] are the logarithmic abundance ratios relative to another element in the same star. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, more accurately, [X/Y]_star = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun = log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So that's the same as log(n_X/n_Y in star / n_X/n_Y in sun) = log( (n_X star / n_Y star) * (n_Y sun / n_X sun) ) ).

Wait, maybe it's better to write the equations for each star and then find the ratios.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So that means log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0. So log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

Wait, the Sun's n_Fe/n_H is given as log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5, right? Because Sun's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) in the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So n_Fe,n1 / n_H,n1 = same as in the Sun. So n_Fe,1 = (n_H,1) * (10^-4.5).

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2.

Let me think about Star_2. [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So log(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 - log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = 0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so log(n_Mg/n_H)_2 = log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun.

But n_Mg/n_H in Sun is 10^(-5) because 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5.

So for Star_2, n_Mg,2 / n_H,2 = 10^(-5) * (n_H,2 / n_H_sun)? Wait, no. Because [Mg/H]_2 is 0, which is log(n_Mg/n_H)_2 - log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun =0. So log(n_Mg,n2 / n_H,n2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) → n_Mg,n2 / n_H,n2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

Wait, but n_H here is the number density of hydrogen. So for Star_2, the ratio of Mg to H is the same as the Sun.

But I think I need to express the silicon abundance in each star in terms of hydrogen, then compute the ratio.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 ) = log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → n_Fe,1/n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.

Wait, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun = 0.3. So log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3 }.

But I also know n_Fe,1 = (n_H,1) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ), from the [Fe/H]_1 =0.

So substituting:

n_Si,1 = (n_H,1 * n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) + 0.3 }

Hmm. Let me compute n_Si,1/n_H,1.

n_Si,1/n_H,1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) + 0.3 }

Let me compute that.

log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) is log( (n_Si,n_sun) / (n_Fe,n_sun) )

Wait, what's the Sun's n_Si? Hmm. Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) - log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) =0. But wait, the question gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but perhaps in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is not given. But perhaps I can calculate it.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nFe? Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun is log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. So n_Si/n_Fe =10^[Si/Fe]_sun. But since the Sun's [X/Y] is zero unless stated, but wait the problem doesn't state [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm, this is a problem. Because to compute n_Si,1, I need to know the Sun's [Si/Fe].

Wait, but perhaps we can assume that in the Sun's photosphere, [Si/Fe] = 0? Because if [Fe/H] is zero in the Sun, and [Si/Fe] is zero, then n_Si/n_Fe would be the same as in the star. Wait, no, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, but [Si/Fe] is not given.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not zero. Hmmm. I need to find a way to express n_Si in terms of n_Fe, which in turn can be expressed in terms of n_H.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think for Star_1 first.

Star_1:

n_Fe,1/n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = (1e-4.5) [since n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun is 10^-4.5].

So n_Fe,1 = n_H,1 * 1e-4.5.

Then, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3 }.

But I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm. But perhaps I can find n_Si_sun in terms of n_Fe_sun and n_Mg_sun, but I don't think that's directly helpful.

Wait, maybe I can express n_Si,1 in terms of n_H,1:

n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3 }.

But n_Fe,1 = (n_H,1) * (1e-4.5).

So n_Si,1 = (n_H,1 * 1e-4.5 ) * 10^{ log(n_Si_sun/(n_Fe_sun)) + 0.3 }.

But I still don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm. Maybe I can relate it through the other star.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate [Si/Fe]_sun?

Wait, in the Sun, [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) = log( (1e-4.5) ) = -4.5 → [Fe/H]_sun is -4.5. Wait, but no, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe/n_H) relative to the Sun's own value. Oh wait, no, [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun. But in the Sun's case, [X/H]_sun is zero for all elements, because it's the reference. So [Fe/H]_sun is zero, but the Sun's n_Fe/n_H is 1e-4.5.

Wait, but for the other elements, like Si, in the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. That's their ratio in the Sun. But I don't have that value.

Wait, perhaps I need to make an assumption. For example, perhaps in the Sun, the ratio of Si to Fe is the same as in some standard value. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate it through another element, like Mg.

Wait, the problem gives [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

But how does that help me with Star_1's [Si/Fe]?

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on each star separately, compute their n_Si in terms of n_H, and then take the ratio.

Let's try that.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe,1 = (n_H,1) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) = n_H,1 * (1e-4.5).

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

But n_Si_sun and n_Fe_sun are the solar values.

Wait, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of the Sun's [Si/Fe].

Let me denote [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

So, in Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/Fe]_sun + 0.3.

Because [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) - [Si/Fe]_sun =0.3 → log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) = [Si/Fe]_sun + 0.3.

Wait, no, [X/Y]_star = log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) =0.3 → log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) + 0.3 → n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) *10^0.3.

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe,1 is (n_H,1) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) → so substituting:

n_Si,1 = (n_H,1 * n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

Simplify:

n_Si,1 = n_H,1 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

So n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

Hmm, that's useful. So the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in Star_1 is the solar ratio multiplied by 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, let's compute n_Si,2 / n_H,2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(n_Mg,2/n_H,2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun ) → n_Mg,2/n_H,2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

So n_Mg,2 = n_H,2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun ) = n_H,2 * (1e-5).

From [Mg/Si]_2, we have:

log(n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 ) = log( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) ) + 0.3.

So n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

But n_Mg,2 = n_H,2 * 1e-5.

So,

(n_H,2 *1e-5 ) / n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

Rearranging:

n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 *1e-5 ) / ( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3} )

But n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun is the solar ratio of Mg to Si.

Wait, I know n_Mg_sun and n_H_sun, and n_Fe_sun, but I don't know n_Si_sun directly.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate n_Si_sun to n_Fe_sun and n_Mg_sun.

Wait, but that's probably not possible without more information. Alternatively, perhaps I can find n_Si_sun in terms of other elements.

Wait, in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun. So [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ). But the problem doesn't give this value for the Sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) and (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) and then find n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun.

Because the Sun's n_Mg/nH is 1e-5, and n_Si/nH is something else.

Wait, the Sun's n_Si/nH: 12 + log(n_Si/nH) = ?

The problem doesn't state it, so perhaps it's zero or some other value.

Wait, no. The problem only gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that in the Sun, [Si/H] is zero? No, that can't be, because the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, but [Si/H] could be different.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of n_Si/nH in the Sun using the given data.

Wait, let me think. For the Sun, n_Fe/nH is 1e-4.5, and n_Mg/nH is 1e-5. But we don't have n_Si/nH.

Hmm, perhaps I can ignore that and proceed, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can make use of the fact that in Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, let me think again.

For Star_2:

n_Mg,2 = n_H,2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) → n_Mg,2 = n_H,2 *1e-5.

And [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) + 0.3.

So,

n_Mg,2 /n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

Substituting n_Mg,2 =n_H,2 *1e-5,

(n_H,2 *1e-5 ) /n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 *1e-5 ) / ( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3} )

→ n_Si,2 = n_H,2 * (1e-5) * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) * 1e^{-0.3}.

So,

n_Si,2/n_H,2 = (1e-5) * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) * 1e^{-0.3}.

But I don't know n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun.

Wait, but in the Sun, n_Si/nH is something, and n_Mg/nH is 1e-5.

Wait, perhaps I can express (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) / (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) → which is (n_Si/nH)_sun / (1e-5).

But that's (n_Si/nH)_sun / (1e-5) → (n_Si/nH)_sun = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) = let's call this x. So (n_Si/nH)_sun =x, so n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun = x / (1e-5 ).

Wait, but I don't know x. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find x by using the fact that in the Sun, [Fe/H] is zero, but that's about Fe and H, not Si.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find n_Si_sun in terms of other solar abundances.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the abundances using the star's data.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me think about the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2.

So, the ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) → (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2/n_Si,2 ).

Wait, but both stars could have different n_H? No, because the problem states that the photospheric composition is for each star, so hydrogen density is different in each.

Wait, no, the ratio of Si to H in each star is what matters, right? Because the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2."

Assuming that the ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ).

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms" so perhaps it's n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

But wait, the question isn't clear on whether that's per unit H. Oh, but the options are numbers like ~3.9, ~12.6, etc. So perhaps the ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) → how many times more Si in Star_1 compared to Star_2.

Or, perhaps it's (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ), which would be the ratio of their silicon-to-hydrogen ratios.

Hmm, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2."

So perhaps it's (n_Si,1 ) / (n_Si,2 ), regardless of hydrogen. But that's a number density ratio, which would depend on the size of the photosphere. But perhaps since both stars are similar in some way (same method used), the ratio can be found without knowing the exact sizes.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of their silicon-to-hydrogen ratios, but I think the question is about the actual number of silicon atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2, which would be the same as (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2/n_H,2 ), which is the same as (n_Si,1/n_Si,2 ) * (n_H,2/n_H,1 ).

But without knowing the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2, this approach may not be helpful.

Wait, but perhaps the question is looking for the ratio of [Si/Fe] in each star, but no, the question is about silicon atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the ratio of [Si/H] in each star, which can be determined from the given data.

Wait, let's try to compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1 ) = (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si,1 = (n_Fe,1 ) * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe,1 =n_H,1 *1e-4.5. So,

n_Si,1 = n_H,1 *1e-4.5 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

Thus,

n_Si,1 /n_H,1 = (1e-4.5) * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

But, n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun is (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) / (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ) → (x) / (1e-4.5 ), where x is n_Si_sun/n_H_sun.

So,

n_Si,1 /n_H,1 = (1e-4.5) * (x / 1e-4.5 ) * 1e^0.3 → x *1e^0.3.

But I don't know x. Hmm.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (n_Mg,2 /n_Si,2 ) = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg,2 /n_H,2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun =1e-5.

So,

n_Mg,2 =n_H,2 *1e-5.

Thus,

(n_H,2 *1e-5 ) /n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3}.

→ n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 *1e-5 ) / ( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) *1e^{0.3} )

→ n_Si,2 = n_H,2 *1e-5 * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) *1e^{-0.3}.

So,

n_Si,2 /n_H,2 = 1e-5 * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) *1e^{-0.3}.

Again, n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun is (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) / (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun ) → (x) / (1e-5 ), since n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun is 1e-5.

So,

n_Si,2 /n_H,2 = 1e-5 * (x/1e-5 ) *1e^{-0.3} → x *1e^{-0.3}.

Wait, so now for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) = log( x *1e^0.3 ) = log(x) +0.3 * log(10) = log(x) +0.3.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si,2/n_H,2 ) = log( x *1e^{-0.3} ) = log(x) -0.3.

Wait, but that's only if x is a number greater than zero, which it is.

So the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 would be (log(x) +0.3 ) - (log(x) -0.3 ) = 0.6 dex. So [Si/H]_1 is 0.6 dex higher than [Si/H]_2.

But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, not the abundance ratio. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ), which would be 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Because [Si/H] is the logarithm of n_Si/n_H. So if [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_2 +0.6, then n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2/n_Si,2 ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } / 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } } =10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3 → no, no, because [Si/H]_1 is log(n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) = 0.3 + log(x) - log(x) → no, because earlier I found that [Si/H]_1 = log(x *1e^{0.3}) → which is log(x) +0.3. But [Si/H]_sun is log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )=log(x).

So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si,2/n_H,2 ) = log( x *1e^{-0.3} ) → log(x) -0.3 → [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

So the difference between [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 is 0.6 dex.

So the ratio of their silicon abundances (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 4, which matches option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and solar photospheric compositions.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe},1}/n_{\text{H},1}) = \log(n_{\text{Fe},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{Fe},1}) = \log(n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{Fe},\odot}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg},2}/n_{\text{H},2}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg},2}/n_{\text{Si},2}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg},\odot}/n_{\text{Si},\odot}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe},1}/n_{\text{H},1} = n_{\text{Fe},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \).
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{Fe},1} = (n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{Fe},\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe},1} = n_{\text{H},1} \cdot 10^{-4.5} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{H},1} = (n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg},2}/n_{\text{H},2} = n_{\text{Mg},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot} = 10^{-5} \).
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Mg},2}/n_{\text{Si},2} = (n_{\text{Mg},\odot}/n_{\text{Si},\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg},2} = n_{\text{H},2} \cdot 10^{-5} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si},2}/n_{\text{H},2} = (n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{H},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}/n_{\text{H},2}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3}}{(n_{\text{Si},\odot}/n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
- \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
