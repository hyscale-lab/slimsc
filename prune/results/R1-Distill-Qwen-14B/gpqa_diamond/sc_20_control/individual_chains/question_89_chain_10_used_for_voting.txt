Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me try to follow each step and see what's happening.

First, the compound is heated to 240°C with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The information given includes the 1H NMR and IR spectra of this product. 

Looking at the IR data, there's a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. I remember that this region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O), like ketones or esters. So, product 1 probably has a ketone group, maybe from an elimination reaction. 

Now, looking at the NMR of product 1: the peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or a carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but since the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's an ether or a ketone. Wait, no, the IR is 1720, which is more likely a ketone. 

Wait, another possibility: if it's an epoxide. Epoxides have protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm, often as a triplet or another split due to coupling. But in this case, the 4.79 ppm is a doublet? Or is it a quartet? Wait, the NMR is given as 4.79 (2H), so that's a singlet? No, wait, the notation is (2H), so maybe it's a singlet. Hmm, but then again, sometimes in epoxides, the protons are split. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to two protons, like an acetal or something else.

Wait, let me think about the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative with two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. Heating with KOH—probably an elimination reaction, since KOH is a strong base. So, if two adjacent bromides are present, maybe it's an E2 elimination, leading to a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if it's 1 and 3, the positions might not be adjacent. So, perhaps each Br is on a different bridgehead. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 would be on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is used, it could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the compound undergoes two elimination steps, leading to a ketone. Wait, how?

Wait, another possibility is that each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination, each Br leaves, and the electrons form a double bond. But wait, if two eliminations occur, maybe forming an allene or a conjugated diene. But wait, in adamantane, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that's probably not the case. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH is added, each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but I don't think that's elimination. More likely, it's an elimination leading to a carbonyl. Wait, could it be that each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge, and elimination leads to a ketone?

Wait, perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Let me think: if each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. So for each Br, perhaps a ketone is formed. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Brs on different bridgeheads.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. So, two E2 eliminations. Each elimination would form a double bond, but considering the structure, maybe the two eliminations lead to a conjugated diene, but adamantane is a rigid structure, so perhaps the two Brs are on the same bridge, allowing for a double bond to form somewhere else.

Wait, but if the product has a carbonyl, maybe the two eliminations result in a diketone. Or perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl group. Wait, if each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination occurs, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl, but that would require two carbonyl groups. Hmm, 1,3-diketone adamantane? But the NMR doesn't show that. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH treatment is probably an epoxide. Because when dibrominated compounds undergo elimination with a base, they can form epoxides. Wait, no, usually epoxides form from vicinal dihalides, like 1,2-dibromides, where elimination leads to an epoxide. So if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it's a 1,3-dibromide, so elimination would not form an epoxide. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the reaction again. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. If we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it's possible that each Br leaves in an SN2 reaction, but given the structure of adamantane, which is very rigid and the bridgehead carbons are tertiary, SN2 is unlikely. So elimination is more probable. So, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, perhaps leading to a conjugated diene, but again, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen? Let's say each Br undergoes elimination, but where does the carbonyl come from. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a secondary carbon, and elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane's structure—adamantane is a diamondoid, so each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three other carbons, right? So the bridgehead carbons are probably quaternary, meaning they can't lose a Br in an elimination because to eliminate, you need a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon. Wait, maybe the Brs are on bridgehead carbons, which are adjacent to bridge carbons that have Hs.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, but the adjacent bridge carbons have Hs. So when KOH abstracts a βH, each Br leaves, forming a double bond. But wait, if the two Brs are on bridgeheads, maybe the eliminations would form a double bond between two bridgeheads. But that's not possible due to Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead double bonds are highly strained and not allowed. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the product. The IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH is added, it leads to the formation of two ketones. But how? Wait, elimination and then something else. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would lead to a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So that's probably not it.

Wait another approach: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form two ketones. Let's say each Br is on a bridgehead, and when the base removes a β hydrogen, it leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. So each Br is replaced by a carbonyl, but how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination. So, two eliminations, each leading to a double bond, but that leads to a problem with bridgehead double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, and the elimination leads to the formation of a ring contraction or expansion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane derivative. No, I don't think so. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a downfield shift, possibly for an -OCH₂- group, like an ether, but then the IR is 1720, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl groups, and the OCH₂ would be around 4 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an adjacent CH₂ group. Wait, but 4.79 is a bit high for a CH₂ next to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the product is adamantanone. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. If one of them loses a Br and forms a ketone, perhaps the other Br is eliminated, leading to a double bond elsewhere. But again, the IR suggests a carbonyl, not a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylic acid or its potassium salt. But the IR would show a strong O-H stretch for the carboxylic acid, which isn't mentioned. So that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. So two carbonyl groups. But would that fit the NMR? Let me think: the 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which could be CH₂ groups attached to something. The 1.94 ppm is 2H, maybe a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Suppose each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a carbonyl group on each bridgehead. So now, the molecule would have two ketone groups. But then, looking at the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) would have to be something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is a single ketone with other substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But since product 1 is a ketone (based on IR), perhaps product 2 is a result of some kind of acylation. Or maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement? Or perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction?

Hmm, wait, but product 1 is a solid, and after treatment with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement. For example, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, maybe it undergoes ring-opening under acidic conditions. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diketone, perhaps it forms a more complex structure.

But wait, let me not get ahead of myself. Let's think about the third step: product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. But product 3 is formed, so the question is about the NMR of product 3.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So perhaps in product 3, there's a carbonyl group and some adjacent protons that are deshielded.

Putting it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with a ketone, based on IR)
2. Product 1 → product 2 (maybe a rearrangement or addition)
3. Product 2 → product 3 (ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds)

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone; if product 2 is formed by treating with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is a ketone, not an arene. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is a diene after some rearrangement (like a retro-Diels-Alder), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative. No, probably not.

Wait, another angle: the initial reaction is dehydrohalogenation. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH → dehydrohalogenation to form a diene or a carbonyl. But Bredt's rule says bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, so if the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, elimination would have to form a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure if that's possible in adamantane without bridgehead double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl, but how? Maybe each Br is replaced by a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, but the adjacent carbons have Hs. So, upon elimination, each Br is removed, and the adjacent C becomes a carbonyl. So, two carbonyls are formed. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylic acid? No, because KOH is a base, not a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane.

But would that structure be possible? Adamantane has four bridgeheads. If two of them (1 and 3) become ketones, then product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, the NMR would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyls.

Looking back at the NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the bridgehead CH₂ groups, and 1.94 (2H) perhaps another CH₂ group.

Wait, but in 1,3-diketone adamantane, the carbonyl carbons would be attached to the bridgeheads. So each bridgehead would have two CH₂ groups attached. So maybe each bridgehead is a C=O, and the adjacent bridge CH₂ groups would resonate around 2.2-2.4 ppm. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group connected to an oxygen, but wait, in a ketone, the adjacent CH₂ would be next to a carbonyl. So maybe that CH₂ is part of a six-membered ring or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible structures step by step.

First Reaction (Product 1):

1,3-dibromoadamantane → Product 1.

Assuming dehydrohalogenation (elimination) occurs, each Br leaves, and a double bond forms. But bridgehead double bonds aren't allowed, so perhaps the double bonds are elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene, but in adamantane, that's not possible without bridgehead double bonds. So perhaps the product is a single ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, and elimination of two HBr molecules leads to a single ketone.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Each elimination would form a double bond, but without bridgehead double bonds, perhaps it forms a cyclopropane ring or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single ketone and a double bond. But the IR of product 1 shows a strong carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone with some other substituent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single ketone with an adjacent CH₂ group. So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an acetal group. But then, why would the IR show a carbonyl? Acetals don't have a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is for an ether group, but then the carbonyl would have to come from somewhere else. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, maybe the initial product is an epoxide. But as I thought earlier, 1,3-dibromides don't form epoxides upon elimination. Vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromides) form epoxides. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring. But I don't see how that would explain the carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is a gem-diol. But that would require two -OH groups, and the IR would show O-H stretches, which aren't mentioned. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, each forming a carbonyl group. So product 1 is a diketone. Then, the NMR would have peaks corresponding to the CH₂ groups adjacent to the ketones.

In that case, the 4.79 ppm (2H) might not fit, because ketones adjacent CH₂ groups are usually around 2.1-2.3 ppm. So perhaps that peak is something else.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is for an -OCH₂CH₂- group, like in an ether or epoxide. But again, the carbonyl is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is for a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a hemiacetal or acetal. But that would require the presence of another oxygen, which might not be the case here.

Wait, maybe I should think of product 1 as an epoxide. Let me reconsider. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, could it form an epoxide? Wait, no, because vicinal dihalides form epoxides, not 1,3-dihalides. So probably not.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me think about what the product after KOH would look like.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a single elimination, leading to a mono-substituted product. But with two Brs, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but in different positions.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone, a single ketone. How? Maybe one of the bridgehead Brs is eliminated, forming a carbonyl, and the other Br remains or is eliminated elsewhere. But that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, each from different bridgeheads, and forms two carbonyl groups. So product 1 is a 1,3-diketone adamantane. That would fit the IR, which shows a strong carbonyl. The NMR would then show the adjacent CH₂ groups.

In the NMR, the 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) must be from the bridge CH₂ groups, and the 1.94 ppm (2H) could be from another set of CH₂ groups. The 4.79 ppm (2H) might be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 is from a CH₂ group next to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is from a -CH₂-O- group, but then how is that formed?

Alternatively, maybe the product is not a ketone. Maybe it's an epoxide. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should move on to the next step to see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst. For example, in Friedel-Crafts acylation, it helps generate acylium ions. But product 1 is a ketone, so unless product 1 is an aromatic compound, this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is a diene after some rearrangement.

Wait, but product 1 is a solid. Maybe it's a conjugated diene. Then, product 2 would be a more complex structure after acid treatment.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and product 2 undergoes some acid-catalyzed ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. But the IR suggests a ketone, not an ester. Esters have a carbonyl but also an O-R group, which might show up in NMR.

Wait, but earlier I thought product 1 is a ketone, so product 2 might be a cyclopropane derivative if it undergoes some [2+2] cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is a diene after losing a ketone group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a Diels-Alder reaction. If product 1 is a dienone, then in the presence of a Lewis acid, it could undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with another diene. But I'm not sure what the diene would be here. Alternatively, maybe product 1 itself is the dienophile.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let's think about the third step: ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The NMR of product 3 would then show protons adjacent to carbonyls, which are usually deshielded and appear downfield.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, in product 3, there's a hydrogen that's next to a carbonyl group. Its coupling depends on neighboring protons.

Wait, suppose that in product 3, the deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl and has neighboring protons. Let's say it's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. If each of these protons is coupled to two other protons, perhaps each has two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogen is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, and it's coupled to two different sets of protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each CH₂ proton is split by adjacent CH₂ groups. For example, if it's a CH₂ next to another CH₂, each proton would be a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent two protons.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be the one closest to the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the hydrogen in question is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. But that's unlikely because in such a case, the hydrogen would be between two carbonyls, which is possible but would have specific coupling patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of its protons is coupled to two other protons (like vicinal coupling), leading to a triplet.

Wait, let me think of specific structures. Suppose product 2 is a diene, and after ozonolysis, it's cleaved into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-butadiene, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde groups, but that's a simple case. But in our case, product 2 is a more complex molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene, and ozonolysis would break it into a diketone.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has a six-membered ring with a double bond, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two ketone groups. Then, product 3 would have two ketone groups, each with adjacent CH₂ groups.

In that case, each ketone would have adjacent CH₂ groups, and the protons in those CH₂ groups would be deshielded. Let's say the structure is something like:

O=C-R-CH₂-CH₂-C=O

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with each ketone adjacent to a CH₂ group. In that case, the CH₂ protons next to the carbonyl would be deshielded and split by neighboring protons.

If each CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, the coupling would be between the two CH₂ groups. For example, each proton in the first CH₂ is coupled with the two protons in the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a chain like:

CH₂-C(=O)-R

Or perhaps a cyclic structure with adjacent CH₂ groups.

Wait, perhaps the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl is next to another CH₂ group. For example, a structure like:

CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-

In this case, each proton in the first CH₂ would be coupled with the two protons in the adjacent CH₂. So each would have a triplet. But wait, that's for the first CH₂. The adjacent CH₂ would be coupled with the first CH₂ and maybe another group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which is the one closest to the carbonyl. So the first CH₂ group after the carbonyl.

In this scenario, each proton in the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would see the two protons in the adjacent CH₂. So each would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ groups are part of a larger system, perhaps each CH₂ is coupled with two different sets of protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is next to another CH₂, which is next to another CH₂. Then, each proton would couple with the two protons on either side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Let me try to think of the possible structures again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (a ketone, based on IR and NMR).

Assuming product 1 is a single ketone, perhaps 1-adamantanone. Then, product 1 would have a structure where one bridgehead has a carbonyl group.

Then, product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe this leads to a keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement to form product 2, which has a double bond.

If product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, forming product 3.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The NMR of product 3 would show the protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

Assuming that in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like:

CH₂-C(=O)-R

Where R is another group. The CH₂ group next to the carbonyl would have protons that are deshielded. If these protons are adjacent to another CH₂ group, their coupling would depend on the number of neighboring protons.

If the adjacent group is a CH₂, each proton in the first CH₂ would be coupled with two protons (from the adjacent CH₂), leading to a triplet. But wait, each proton in the first CH₂ would be split by the two protons in the adjacent CH₂, giving a triplet. However, if the adjacent group is something else, like a CH, the pattern would be different.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to another CH₂, and each has two protons, then each proton in the first CH₂ would be split into a triplet by the two protons in the adjacent CH₂. But if the adjacent CH₂ is further split by another group, the coupling could become more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a straight chain with two adjacent CH₂ groups next to a carbonyl. For example:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-...

In this case, the protons on the first CH₂ (next to the carbonyl) would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂, giving a triplet. Similarly, the protons on the second CH₂ would be split by the first and perhaps the third CH₂, but if there's no third, it's just a triplet.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would be in the first CH₂, appearing as a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the CH₂ is next to a CH group, leading to a different coupling pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is cyclic, and the CH₂ is adjacent to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH₂, leading to a more complex coupling.

Wait, another angle: the ozonolysis product would have carbonyl groups. Let's say product 2 is a diene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would have two carbonyl groups. The structure might look like:

R-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-R'

In this case, the CH₂ groups between the two carbonyls would have their protons split by adjacent groups.

Each CH₂ would have two neighboring groups—each other and perhaps others. So each CH₂'s protons would be split by two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if each CH₂ is between two carbonyls, the protons would be more deshielded and would couple with each other, leading to a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O

So, the two CH₂ groups are between the two carbonyls. Each of the CH₂ protons would be adjacent to two others. So the first CH₂ would be next to the carbonyl and the second CH₂. The protons in the first CH₂ would see the two protons in the second CH₂, leading to a triplet. The second CH₂ would see the first CH₂'s protons and perhaps others, but if it's in the middle, maybe it's a triplet as well.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. The protons closest to the carbonyl would be the most deshielded. So, their coupling would be determined by the adjacent group.

If the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, the first CH₂ (adjacent to the carbonyl) would have its protons split by the two protons in the second CH₂. So each proton would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, then the middle CH₂'s protons would be coupled with two CH₂ groups on either side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But in the given question, the product 3's NMR is what we're considering, and the most deshielded hydrogen is the one next to the carbonyl.

So, if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, the CH₂ groups would each have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But wait, perhaps the structure is more like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, leading to more CH₂ groups and thus more splitting.

But I think the simplest case is that the CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Wait, another thought: if the CH₂ is part of a ring, like a cyclopropane, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a straight chain with three CH₂ groups, where the middle CH₂ is between two others. In that case, each proton in the middle CH₂ would be coupled with four protons (two on each side), leading to a quintet. But that would be for the central CH₂.

But the question is about the most deshielded, which would be the CH₂ next to the carbonyl. If that CH₂ is only coupled with the next CH₂, it would be a triplet.

So, putting it all together, the most deshielded proton in product 3 would be part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, coupled with two protons from the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is to be determined.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Formation of Product 1**  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, likely undergoing elimination to form a ketone.  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, confirming the presence of a ketone.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and other CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction 2: Formation of Product 2**  
   - Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely induces a rearrangement or transformation, potentially forming a compound with a double bond.  
   - The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined but is inferred to contain a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step cleaves double bonds.

3. **Reaction 3: Formation of Product 3**  
   - Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is thus a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups where the double bond in product 2 was cleaved.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl, which is coupled to two protons from an adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - The coupling pattern for such a hydrogen is a **triplet**, as each proton in the CH₂ group interacts with two protons in the adjacent CH₂ group.

### Conclusion:
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a **triplet** coupling pattern due to its interaction with two protons in the adjacent CH₂ group.

Answer: A

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me try to follow each step and see what's happening.

First, the compound is heated to 240°C with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The information given includes the 1H NMR and IR spectra of this product. 

Looking at the IR data, there's a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. I remember that this region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O), like ketones or esters. So, product 1 probably has a ketone group, maybe from an elimination reaction. 

Now, looking at the NMR of product 1: the peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or a carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but since the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's an ether or a ketone. Wait, no, the IR is 1720, which is more likely a ketone. 

Wait, another possibility: if it's an epoxide. Epoxides have protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm, often as a triplet or another split due to coupling. But in this case, the 4.79 ppm is a doublet? Or is it a quartet? Wait, the NMR is given as 4.79 (2H), so that's a singlet? No, wait, the notation is (2H), so maybe it's a singlet. Hmm, but then again, sometimes in epoxides, the protons are split. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to two protons, like an acetal or something else.

Wait, let me think about the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative with two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. Heating with KOH—probably an elimination reaction, since KOH is a strong base. So, if two adjacent bromides are present, maybe it's an E2 elimination, leading to a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if it's 1 and 3, the positions might not be adjacent. So, perhaps each Br is on a different bridgehead. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 would be on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is used, it could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the compound undergoes two elimination steps, leading to a ketone. Wait, how?

Wait, another possibility is that each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination, each Br leaves, and the electrons form a double bond. But wait, if two eliminations occur, maybe forming an allene or a conjugated diene. But wait, in adamantane, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that's probably not the case. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH is added, each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but I don't think that's elimination. More likely, it's an elimination leading to a carbonyl. Wait, could it be that each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge, and elimination leads to a ketone?

Wait, perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Let me think: if each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. So for each Br, perhaps a ketone is formed. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Brs on different bridgeheads.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. So, two E2 eliminations. Each elimination would form a double bond, but considering the structure, maybe the two eliminations lead to a conjugated diene, but adamantane is a rigid structure, so perhaps the two Brs are on the same bridge, allowing for a double bond to form somewhere else.

Wait, but if the product has a carbonyl, maybe the two eliminations result in a diketone. Or perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl group. Wait, if each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination occurs, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl, but that would require two carbonyl groups. Hmm, 1,3-diketone adamantane? But the NMR doesn't show that. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH treatment is probably an epoxide. Because when dibrominated compounds undergo elimination with a base, they can form epoxides. Wait, no, usually epoxides form from vicinal dihalides, like 1,2-dibromides, where elimination leads to an epoxide. So if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it's a 1,3-dibromide, so elimination would not form an epoxide. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the reaction again. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. If we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it's possible that each Br leaves in an SN2 reaction, but given the structure of adamantane, which is very rigid and the bridgehead carbons are tertiary, SN2 is unlikely. So elimination is more probable. So, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, perhaps leading to a conjugated diene, but again, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen? Let's say each Br undergoes elimination, but where does the carbonyl come from. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a secondary carbon, and elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane's structure—adamantane is a diamondoid, so each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three other carbons, right? So the bridgehead carbons are probably quaternary, meaning they can't lose a Br in an elimination because to eliminate, you need a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon. Wait, maybe the Brs are on bridgehead carbons, which are adjacent to bridge carbons that have Hs.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, but the adjacent bridge carbons have Hs. So when KOH abstracts a βH, each Br leaves, forming a double bond. But wait, if the two Brs are on bridgeheads, maybe the eliminations would form a double bond between two bridgeheads. But that's not possible due to Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead double bonds are highly strained and not allowed. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the product. The IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH is added, it leads to the formation of two ketones. But how? Wait, elimination and then something else. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would lead to a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So that's probably not it.

Wait another approach: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form two ketones. Let's say each Br is on a bridgehead, and when the base removes a β hydrogen, it leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. So each Br is replaced by a carbonyl, but how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination. So, two eliminations, each leading to a double bond, but that leads to a problem with bridgehead double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, and the elimination leads to the formation of a ring contraction or expansion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane derivative. No, I don't think so. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a downfield shift, possibly for an -OCH₂- group, like an ether, but then the IR is 1720, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl groups, and the OCH₂ would be around 4 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an adjacent CH₂ group. Wait, but 4.79 is a bit high for a CH₂ next to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the product is adamantanone. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. If one of them loses a Br and forms a ketone, perhaps the other Br is eliminated, leading to a double bond elsewhere. But again, the IR suggests a carbonyl, not a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylic acid or its potassium salt. But the IR would show a strong O-H stretch for the carboxylic acid, which isn't mentioned. So that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. So two carbonyl groups. But would that fit the NMR? Let me think: the 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which could be CH₂ groups attached to something. The 1.94 ppm is 2H, maybe a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Suppose each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a carbonyl group on each bridgehead. So now, the molecule would have two ketone groups. But then, looking at the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) would have to be something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is a single ketone with other substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But since product 1 is a ketone (based on IR), perhaps product 2 is a result of some kind of acylation. Or maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement? Or perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction?

Hmm, wait, but product 1 is a solid, and after treatment with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement. For example, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, maybe it undergoes ring-opening under acidic conditions. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diketone, perhaps it forms a more complex structure.

But wait, let me not get ahead of myself. Let's think about the third step: product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. But product 3 is formed, so the question is about the NMR of product 3.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So perhaps in product 3, there's a carbonyl group and some adjacent protons that are deshielded.

Putting it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with a ketone, based on IR)
2. Product 1 → product 2 (maybe a rearrangement or addition)
3. Product 2 → product 3 (ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds)

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone; if product 2 is formed by treating with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is a ketone, not an arene. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is a diene after some rearrangement (like a retro-Diels-Alder), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative. No, probably not.

Wait, another angle: the initial reaction is dehydrohalogenation. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH → dehydrohalogenation to form a diene or a carbonyl. But Bredt's rule says bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, so if the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, elimination would have to form a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure if that's possible in adamantane without bridgehead double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl, but how? Maybe each Br is replaced by a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, but the adjacent carbons have Hs. So, upon elimination, each Br is removed, and the adjacent C becomes a carbonyl. So, two carbonyls are formed. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylic acid? No, because KOH is a base, not a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane.

But would that structure be possible? Adamantane has four bridgeheads. If two of them (1 and 3) become ketones, then product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, the NMR would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyls.

Looking back at the NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the bridgehead CH₂ groups, and 1.94 (2H) perhaps another CH₂ group.

Wait, but in 1,3-diketone adamantane, the carbonyl carbons would be attached to the bridgeheads. So each bridgehead would have two CH₂ groups attached. So maybe each bridgehead is a C=O, and the adjacent bridge CH₂ groups would resonate around 2.2-2.4 ppm. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group connected to an oxygen, but wait, in a ketone, the adjacent CH₂ would be next to a carbonyl. So maybe that CH₂ is part of a six-membered ring or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible structures step by step.

First Reaction (Product 1):

1,3-dibromoadamantane → Product 1.

Assuming dehydrohalogenation (elimination) occurs, each Br leaves, and a double bond forms. But bridgehead double bonds aren't allowed, so perhaps the double bonds are elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene, but in adamantane, that's not possible without bridgehead double bonds. So perhaps the product is a single ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, and elimination of two HBr molecules leads to a single ketone.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Each elimination would form a double bond, but without bridgehead double bonds, perhaps it forms a cyclopropane ring or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single ketone and a double bond. But the IR of product 1 shows a strong carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone with some other substituent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single ketone with an adjacent CH₂ group. So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an acetal group. But then, why would the IR show a carbonyl? Acetals don't have a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is for an ether group, but then the carbonyl would have to come from somewhere else. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, maybe the initial product is an epoxide. But as I thought earlier, 1,3-dibromides don't form epoxides upon elimination. Vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromides) form epoxides. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring. But I don't see how that would explain the carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is a gem-diol. But that would require two -OH groups, and the IR would show O-H stretches, which aren't mentioned. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, each forming a carbonyl group. So product 1 is a diketone. Then, the NMR would have peaks corresponding to the CH₂ groups adjacent to the ketones.

In that case, the 4.79 ppm (2H) might not fit, because ketones adjacent CH₂ groups are usually around 2.1-2.3 ppm. So perhaps that peak is something else.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is for an -OCH₂CH₂- group, like in an ether or epoxide. But again, the carbonyl is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is for a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a hemiacetal or acetal. But that would require the presence of another oxygen, which might not be the case here.

Wait, maybe I should think of product 1 as an epoxide. Let me reconsider. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, could it form an epoxide? Wait, no, because vicinal dihalides form epoxides, not 1,3-dihalides. So probably not.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me think about what the product after KOH would look like.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a single elimination, leading to a mono-substituted product. But with two Brs, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but in different positions.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone, a single ketone. How? Maybe one of the bridgehead Brs is eliminated, forming a carbonyl, and the other Br remains or is eliminated elsewhere. But that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, each from different bridgeheads, and forms two carbonyl groups. So product 1 is a 1,3-diketone adamantane. That would fit the IR, which shows a strong carbonyl. The NMR would then show the adjacent CH₂ groups.

In the NMR, the 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) must be from the bridge CH₂ groups, and the 1.94 ppm (2H) could be from another set of CH₂ groups. The 4.79 ppm (2H) might be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 is from a CH₂ group next to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is from a -CH₂-O- group, but then how is that formed?

Alternatively, maybe the product is not a ketone. Maybe it's an epoxide. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should move on to the next step to see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst. For example, in Friedel-Crafts acylation, it helps generate acylium ions. But product 1 is a ketone, so unless product 1 is an aromatic compound, this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is a diene after some rearrangement.

Wait, but product 1 is a solid. Maybe it's a conjugated diene. Then, product 2 would be a more complex structure after acid treatment.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and product 2 undergoes some acid-catalyzed ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. But the IR suggests a ketone, not an ester. Esters have a carbonyl but also an O-R group, which might show up in NMR.

Wait, but earlier I thought product 1 is a ketone, so product 2 might be a cyclopropane derivative if it undergoes some [2+2] cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is a diene after losing a ketone group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a Diels-Alder reaction. If product 1 is a dienone, then in the presence of a Lewis acid, it could undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with another diene. But I'm not sure what the diene would be here. Alternatively, maybe product 1 itself is the dienophile.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let's think about the third step: ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The NMR of product 3 would then show protons adjacent to carbonyls, which are usually deshielded and appear downfield.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, in product 3, there's a hydrogen that's next to a carbonyl group. Its coupling depends on neighboring protons.

Wait, suppose that in product 3, the deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl and has neighboring protons. Let's say it's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. If each of these protons is coupled to two other protons, perhaps each has two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogen is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, and it's coupled to two different sets of protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each CH₂ proton is split by adjacent CH₂ groups. For example, if it's a CH₂ next to another CH₂, each proton would be a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent two protons.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be the one closest to the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the hydrogen in question is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. But that's unlikely because in such a case, the hydrogen would be between two carbonyls, which is possible but would have specific coupling patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of its protons is coupled to two other protons (like vicinal coupling), leading to a triplet.

Wait, let me think of specific structures. Suppose product 2 is a diene, and after ozonolysis, it's cleaved into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-butadiene, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde groups, but that's a simple case. But in our case, product 2 is a more complex molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene, and ozonolysis would break it into a diketone.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has a six-membered ring with a double bond, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two ketone groups. Then, product 3 would have two ketone groups, each with adjacent CH₂ groups.

In that case, each ketone would have adjacent CH₂ groups, and the protons in those CH₂ groups would be deshielded. Let's say the structure is something like:

O=C-R-CH₂-CH₂-C=O

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with each ketone adjacent to a CH₂ group. In that case, the CH₂ protons next to the carbonyl would be deshielded and split by neighboring protons.

If each CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, the coupling would be between the two CH₂ groups. For example, each proton in the first CH₂ is coupled with the two protons in the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a chain like:

CH₂-C(=O)-R

Or perhaps a cyclic structure with adjacent CH₂ groups.

Wait, perhaps the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl is next to another CH₂ group. For example, a structure like:

CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-

In this case, each proton in the first CH₂ would be coupled with the two protons in the adjacent CH₂. So each would have a triplet. But wait, that's for the first CH₂. The adjacent CH₂ would be coupled with the first CH₂ and maybe another group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which is the one closest to the carbonyl. So the first CH₂ group after the carbonyl.

In this scenario, each proton in the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would see the two protons in the adjacent CH₂. So each would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ groups are part of a larger system, perhaps each CH₂ is coupled with two different sets of protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is next to another CH₂, which is next to another CH₂. Then, each proton would couple with the two protons on either side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Let me try to think of the possible structures again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (a ketone, based on IR and NMR).

Assuming product 1 is a single ketone, perhaps 1-adamantanone. Then, product 1 would have a structure where one bridgehead has a carbonyl group.

Then, product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe this leads to a keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement to form product 2, which has a double bond.

If product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, forming product 3.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The NMR of product 3 would show the protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

Assuming that in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like:

CH₂-C(=O)-R

Where R is another group. The CH₂ group next to the carbonyl would have protons that are deshielded. If these protons are adjacent to another CH₂ group, their coupling would depend on the number of neighboring protons.

If the adjacent group is a CH₂, each proton in the first CH₂ would be coupled with two protons (from the adjacent CH₂), leading to a triplet. But wait, each proton in the first CH₂ would be split by the two protons in the adjacent CH₂, giving a triplet. However, if the adjacent group is something else, like a CH, the pattern would be different.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to another CH₂, and each has two protons, then each proton in the first CH₂ would be split into a triplet by the two protons in the adjacent CH₂. But if the adjacent CH₂ is further split by another group, the coupling could become more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a straight chain with two adjacent CH₂ groups next to a carbonyl. For example:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-...

In this case, the protons on the first CH₂ (next to the carbonyl) would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂, giving a triplet. Similarly, the protons on the second CH₂ would be split by the first and perhaps the third CH₂, but if there's no third, it's just a triplet.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would be in the first CH₂, appearing as a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the CH₂ is next to a CH group, leading to a different coupling pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is cyclic, and the CH₂ is adjacent to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH₂, leading to a more complex coupling.

Wait, another angle: the ozonolysis product would have carbonyl groups. Let's say product 2 is a diene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would have two carbonyl groups. The structure might look like:

R-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-R'

In this case, the CH₂ groups between the two carbonyls would have their protons split by adjacent groups.

Each CH₂ would have two neighboring groups—each other and perhaps others. So each CH₂'s protons would be split by two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if each CH₂ is between two carbonyls, the protons would be more deshielded and would couple with each other, leading to a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O

So, the two CH₂ groups are between the two carbonyls. Each of the CH₂ protons would be adjacent to two others. So the first CH₂ would be next to the carbonyl and the second CH₂. The protons in the first CH₂ would see the two protons in the second CH₂, leading to a triplet. The second CH₂ would see the first CH₂'s protons and perhaps others, but if it's in the middle, maybe it's a triplet as well.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. The protons closest to the carbonyl would be the most deshielded. So, their coupling would be determined by the adjacent group.

If the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, the first CH₂ (adjacent to the carbonyl) would have its protons split by the two protons in the second CH₂. So each proton would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, then the middle CH₂'s protons would be coupled with two CH₂ groups on either side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But in the given question, the product 3's NMR is what we're considering, and the most deshielded hydrogen is the one next to the carbonyl.

So, if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, the CH₂ groups would each have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But wait, perhaps the structure is more like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, leading to more CH₂ groups and thus more splitting.

But I think the simplest case is that the CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Wait, another thought: if the CH₂ is part of a ring, like a cyclopropane, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a straight chain with three CH₂ groups, where the middle CH₂ is between two others. In that case, each proton in the middle CH₂ would be coupled with four protons (two on each side), leading to a quintet. But that would be for the central CH₂.

But the question is about the most deshielded, which would be the CH₂ next to the carbonyl. If that CH₂ is only coupled with the next CH₂, it would be a triplet.

So, putting it all together, the most deshielded proton in product 3 would be part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, coupled with two protons from the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is to be determined.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Formation of Product 1**  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, likely undergoing elimination to form a ketone.  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, confirming the presence of a ketone.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and other CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction 2: Formation of Product 2**  
   - Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely induces a rearrangement or transformation, potentially forming a compound with a double bond.  
   - The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined but is inferred to contain a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step cleaves double bonds.

3. **Reaction 3: Formation of Product 3**  
   - Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is thus a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups where the double bond in product 2 was cleaved.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl, which is coupled to two protons from an adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - The coupling pattern for such a hydrogen is a **triplet**, as each proton in the CH₂ group interacts with two protons in the adjacent CH₂ group.

### Conclusion:
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a **triplet** coupling pattern due to its interaction with two protons in the adjacent CH₂ group.

Answer: A
