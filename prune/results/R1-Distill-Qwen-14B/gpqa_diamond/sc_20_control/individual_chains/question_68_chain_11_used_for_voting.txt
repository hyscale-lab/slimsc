Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field is switched. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that initially, the particle is in a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So, mu = γ S_z. Since the magnetic field is along +Z, the particle's spin will align with it, right? So I think the initial state is the spin-up state in the z-direction. That would be the eigenstate of S_z, |+z⟩, with eigenvalue ħ/2, but wait, spin-1/2 particles have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Oh wait, S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2) |+z⟩.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. Wait, but when the field is off, what's the Hamiltonian like? Without a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is zero, so the state doesn't change, right? Because the system is isolated, the state remains the same. But wait, the magnetic field is turned off and then another one is applied along Y. So the initial state is |+z⟩ before the field change.

But after the field is changed to Y, the particle is now under a magnetic field along Y. So the Hamiltonian changes. Let me think about the Hamiltonian in terms of spin. The magnetic moment is mu = γ S. So the energy is -mu · B. Since here the B is in Y direction, the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. So H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, I think the correct expression is H = -μ·B. Since the magnetic moment μ is given as γ S. So μ = γ S, and B is along Y, so μ·B = γ B S_y. Hence, H = -γ B S_y.

But wait, the sign might depend on the direction. Let me get that right. The energy is E = -μ·B. Since B is along +Y, and the particle's moment μ is aligned with B when it's in that direction. So when the field is along Y, the energy levels will depend on the expectation value of S_y.

Wait, the initial state is |+z⟩. After the field is changed, the system is now under H = -γ B S_y. So the state of the system is still |+z⟩, but the Hamiltonian is now time-dependent because the field changed suddenly. So the state doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.

So the question is about the time evolution of the expectation value of S_z. Because the average of the z-component of the moment is ⟨mu_z⟩ = γ ⟨S_z⟩. So if I can find ⟨S_z⟩ as a function of time, multiply by gamma to get the oscillation.

So the system starts in state |+z⟩, and under H = -γ B S_y. Let me find the time evolution of S_z.

The time evolution of an observable is given by the Heisenberg picture. So the expectation value of S_z(t) is ⟨ψ| S_z(t) |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the initial state (which doesn't change, because in the Schrödinger picture, the state evolves, but in the Heisenberg picture, the operators do. Hmm, maybe it's easier to work in the Schrödinger picture here.)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the Hamiltonian, find the energy eigenstates, and then express the initial state in that basis to find the time evolution.

The Hamiltonian H = -γ B S_y. Let me write S_y in terms of Pauli matrices. Remember, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix. So H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, or is H = -γ B S_y? Because the spin magnetic moment is μ = γ S. So the energy is H = -μ · B = - (γ S · B). Since B is along Y, H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but in terms of the Pauli matrices, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write H in terms of angular frequency. Let's think about the energy levels. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energies would be E = -γ B (± ħ/2) → E = ± ( - γ B ħ/2 ). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the time evolution operator.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ).

So H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y. So H = ( - γ B ħ / 2 ) σ_y.

So H can be written as H = ω (σ_y / 2 ), where ω is the Larmor frequency, which is γ B. Wait no, I think the Larmor frequency is ω = γ B. Wait, but in this case, the factor might be different because S is in terms of ħ.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the energy eigenvalues. So H |ψ⟩ = E |ψ⟩.

H is proportional to σ_y. The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of H are E_± = (- γ B ħ / 2 ) * (±1) → E_± = ± ( - γ B ħ / 2 ). Wait, that would give E_+ = - γ B ħ / 2 and E_- = γ B ħ / 2. Wait, no, because σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, so H would have eigenvalues E_± = (- γ B ħ/2) * (±1) → E_+ = (- γ B ħ/2) * (+1) = - γ B ħ / 2, and E_- = (- γ B ħ/2) * (-1) ) = + γ B ħ / 2.

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should write H in terms of ω, where ω is the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is typically ω = γ B. So H = -ω S_y. Wait, but S is in units of ħ/2, so S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. Then, H = - ω (ħ/2) σ_y. Hmm.

But perhaps a better approach is to write the time evolution operator U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ). Let me plug in H.

H = - γ B S_y. S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So H = - γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

So U(t) = exp( [i γ B (ħ/2) σ_y t ] / ħ ) = exp( i γ B t σ_y / 2 ).

Because the denominator's ħ cancels with the numerator's ħ. So U(t) = exp( i (γ B t / 2 ) σ_y ).

Now, the initial state is |+z⟩. Let me express this in terms of the eigenstates of σ_y. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value ⟨S_z(t)⟩.

In the Heisenberg picture, the operator S_z(t) evolves as S_z(t) = U†(t) S_z U(t).

So the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_z(t) |ψ⟩ = Tr( ρ S_z(t) ), where ρ is the density matrix. Since the state is |+z⟩⟨+z|, ρ = |+z⟩⟨+z|.

So ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| U†(t) S_z U(t) |+z⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps compute S_z(t) in the Heisenberg picture.

Hmm, but maybe a better approach is to compute the time evolution using the expansion in energy eigenstates.

The initial state |+z⟩ can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of H. So let's find the eigenstates of H.

The Hamiltonian is H = - γ B S_y. Let me write S_y in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩.

S_y = (|+z⟩⟨−z| - |−z⟩⟨+z| ) * ħ/2.

So H = - γ B (ħ/2) (|+z⟩⟨−z| - |−z⟩⟨+z| ) = - (γ B ħ /2 ) (|+z⟩⟨−z| - |−z⟩⟨+z| )

The eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

Wait, because H is proportional to S_y, so the eigenstates are the same as S_y's.

So |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are the eigenstates of H. Let me write |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

The eigenstates |±y⟩ can be written in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩ as:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ − |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, I think the exact expressions are:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ − i |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check. The spin states in different directions are related by rotation. S_y eigenstates can be written in terms of S_z eigenstates.

The eigenvectors for S_y are (1, 0) and (0,1) rotated by 90 degrees. Wait, no, S_y is the Pauli matrix σ_y multiplied by ħ/2.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. The eigenvectors for σ_y = +1 are (1, i)/sqrt(2), and for σ_y = -1 are (1, -i)/sqrt(2).

So, in terms of the spin-up and spin-down in z, |+z⟩ is (1,0), |−z⟩ is (0,1).

So the eigenstate |+y⟩ is (1, i)/sqrt(2) in the (|+z⟩, |−z⟩) basis. Similarly, |−y⟩ is (1, -i)/sqrt(2).

So, the initial state |+z⟩ is (1, 0). Let me express this in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

So, |+z⟩ = [ |+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, let me compute:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ − i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

If I add |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

( |+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ + |+z⟩ - i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) = ( 2 |+z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z⟩.

So |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, let me compute:

Wait, |+z⟩ = a |+y⟩ + b |−y⟩.

We can compute a and b by taking inner products. Let's compute ⟨+y|+z⟩.

⟨+y| is (1/sqrt(2)) (1, -i ), because |+y⟩ is (1, i)/sqrt(2), so the bra is the conjugate transpose.

⟨+y| +z ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [1 * 1 + (-i) * 0 ] = 1/sqrt(2).

So a = ⟨+y|+z⟩ = 1/sqrt(2).

Similarly, ⟨−y|+z⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [1 *1 + i *0 ] = 1/sqrt(2), so b = 1/sqrt(2).

So |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Because both a and b are 1/sqrt(2).

So, now the initial state can be written as |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

So when the Hamiltonian is H, which has eigenstates |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ with eigenvalues E_+ and E_-, the state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩ = (|+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} + |−y⟩ e^{-i E_- t / ħ} ) / sqrt(2).

We can compute E_+ and E_-.

Earlier, H is given by H = - γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of H are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2) * 1 = - gamma B ħ / 2,

E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2) * (-1 ) = gamma B ħ / 2.

So E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2,

E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2.

So, the time evolution of |+z⟩ is:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ |+y⟩ e^{ -i E_+ t / ħ } + |−y⟩ e^{ -i E_- t / ħ } ] / sqrt(2 )

Substitute E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2 → -i E_+ t / ħ = i (gamma B ħ / 2) t / ħ = i gamma B t / 2 (since ħ cancels).

Similarly, E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2 → -i E_- t / ħ = -i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ = -i gamma B t / 2.

So,

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ |+y⟩ e^{ i gamma B t / 2 } + |−y⟩ e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } ] / sqrt(2 )

Now, we need to find the expectation value of S_z(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

Wait, but in the state |ψ(t)⟩, which is a combination of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, we can compute ⟨S_z⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩.

Wait, because S_z is diagonal in the |+z⟩, |−z⟩ basis. Let me express |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩.

As established earlier,

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2),

|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

So substituting into |ψ(t)⟩:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ [ (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ] e^{i gamma B t / 2 } + [ (|+z⟩ - i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ] e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } ] / sqrt(2 )

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ |+z⟩ e^{i gamma B t / 2} (1) + |+z⟩ e^{-i gamma B t /2} (1) + i |−z⟩ e^{i gamma B t /2} (1) - i |−z⟩ e^{-i gamma B t /2} (1) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))

Which is:

= [ |+z⟩ ( e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) + i |−z⟩ ( e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ] / 2

Simplify using Euler's formula:

e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cos θ,

e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sin θ.

So,

= [ |+z⟩ ( 2 cos(gamma B t/2) ) + i |−z⟩ ( 2i sin(gamma B t/2) ) ] / 2

Simplify each term:

2 cos(...) / 2 = cos(...),

i * 2i sin(...) → i*2i = 2i^2 = 2 (-1) = -2. So [i |−z⟩ (2i sin(...)) ] → [ |−z⟩ ( -2 sin(...) ) ] / 2 → - sin(...) |−z⟩.

Putting it all together:

|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z⟩ - sin(gamma B t/2) |−z⟩.

So the state at time t is a superposition of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩ with coefficients cos(θ) and -sin(θ), where θ = (gamma B t)/2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is:

⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2) |+z⟩,

S_z |−z⟩ = (-ħ/2) |−z⟩.

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = [ cos(theta) ⟨+z| - sin(theta) ⟨-z| ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z⟩ - sin(theta) |−z⟩ ]

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

Because when you multiply it out,

cos(theta) cos(theta) ⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ 

+ cos(theta) (- sin(theta)) ⟨+z| S_z |−z⟩ 

+ (- sin(theta)) cos(theta) ⟨−z| S_z |+z⟩ 

+ (- sin(theta)) (- sin(theta)) ⟨−z| S_z |−z⟩ 

But ⟨+z| S_z |−z⟩ is 0 because S_z is diagonal in this basis.

So,

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

= (1/2) ħ [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Because cos^2θ - sin^2θ = cos(2θ).

So,

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

But theta is gamma B t / 2.

So,

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( 2 * (gamma B t /2) ) = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Thus, the expectation value oscillates as cos(gamma B t) multiplied by ħ/2.

But the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So,

⟨ mu_z ⟩ = gamma ⟨ S_z ⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. So the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the amplitude and the frequency. The oscillation is in cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. The actual frequency (cycles per second) would be gamma B / (2π), but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which in such contexts usually refers to the angular frequency, which is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the answer should be B.

But wait, I thought that when you have a spin in a magnetic field, the frequency is gamma B. So that makes sense here.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me recap.

The state is initially |+z⟩. After the field is applied along Y, the time evolution leads to oscillations in ⟨ S_z ⟩ with frequency gamma B. So the average mu_z oscillates with the same frequency.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: consider the Hamiltonian. H = -gamma B S_y. The energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ ) / 2 and E_- = -(gamma B ħ ) / 2.

The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillation in transition probabilities is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = gamma B.

Which matches what we found earlier. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s moment after the magnetic field is switched, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Initial State**: The particle is initially in a magnetic field along the +Z direction, aligning its spin with the field. The initial state is therefore the eigenstate of \( S_z \), \(|+z\rangle\), with eigenvalue \( \hbar/2 \).

2. **Field Change**: The magnetic field is suddenly turned off and reactivated along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude \( B \). The Hamiltonian after the field change is \( H = -\gamma B S_y \), where \( S_y \) is the spin operator in the y-direction.

3. **Time Evolution**: The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state \(|+z\rangle\) can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of \( H \), which are \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\) (the eigenstates of \( S_y \)):
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} + |-y\rangle e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} \right),
   \]
   where \( E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \) and \( E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \) are the eigenvalues of \( H \).

4. **Expression for \(|\psi(t)\rangle\)**: Substituting the eigenvalues, the time-evolved state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|+z\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|-z\rangle.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**: The expectation value of \( S_z \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]
   Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta = \cos(2\theta) \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**: The z-component of the magnetic moment is \( \mu_z = \gamma S_z \). Thus:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of \( t \) inside the cosine, which is \( \gamma B \).

7. **Conclusion**: The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s moment is \( \gamma B \).

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field is switched. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that initially, the particle is in a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So, mu = γ S_z. Since the magnetic field is along +Z, the particle's spin will align with it, right? So I think the initial state is the spin-up state in the z-direction. That would be the eigenstate of S_z, |+z⟩, with eigenvalue ħ/2, but wait, spin-1/2 particles have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Oh wait, S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2) |+z⟩.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. Wait, but when the field is off, what's the Hamiltonian like? Without a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is zero, so the state doesn't change, right? Because the system is isolated, the state remains the same. But wait, the magnetic field is turned off and then another one is applied along Y. So the initial state is |+z⟩ before the field change.

But after the field is changed to Y, the particle is now under a magnetic field along Y. So the Hamiltonian changes. Let me think about the Hamiltonian in terms of spin. The magnetic moment is mu = γ S. So the energy is -mu · B. Since here the B is in Y direction, the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. So H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, I think the correct expression is H = -μ·B. Since the magnetic moment μ is given as γ S. So μ = γ S, and B is along Y, so μ·B = γ B S_y. Hence, H = -γ B S_y.

But wait, the sign might depend on the direction. Let me get that right. The energy is E = -μ·B. Since B is along +Y, and the particle's moment μ is aligned with B when it's in that direction. So when the field is along Y, the energy levels will depend on the expectation value of S_y.

Wait, the initial state is |+z⟩. After the field is changed, the system is now under H = -γ B S_y. So the state of the system is still |+z⟩, but the Hamiltonian is now time-dependent because the field changed suddenly. So the state doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.

So the question is about the time evolution of the expectation value of S_z. Because the average of the z-component of the moment is ⟨mu_z⟩ = γ ⟨S_z⟩. So if I can find ⟨S_z⟩ as a function of time, multiply by gamma to get the oscillation.

So the system starts in state |+z⟩, and under H = -γ B S_y. Let me find the time evolution of S_z.

The time evolution of an observable is given by the Heisenberg picture. So the expectation value of S_z(t) is ⟨ψ| S_z(t) |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the initial state (which doesn't change, because in the Schrödinger picture, the state evolves, but in the Heisenberg picture, the operators do. Hmm, maybe it's easier to work in the Schrödinger picture here.)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the Hamiltonian, find the energy eigenstates, and then express the initial state in that basis to find the time evolution.

The Hamiltonian H = -γ B S_y. Let me write S_y in terms of Pauli matrices. Remember, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix. So H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, or is H = -γ B S_y? Because the spin magnetic moment is μ = γ S. So the energy is H = -μ · B = - (γ S · B). Since B is along Y, H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but in terms of the Pauli matrices, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write H in terms of angular frequency. Let's think about the energy levels. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energies would be E = -γ B (± ħ/2) → E = ± ( - γ B ħ/2 ). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the time evolution operator.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ).

So H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y. So H = ( - γ B ħ / 2 ) σ_y.

So H can be written as H = ω (σ_y / 2 ), where ω is the Larmor frequency, which is γ B. Wait no, I think the Larmor frequency is ω = γ B. Wait, but in this case, the factor might be different because S is in terms of ħ.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the energy eigenvalues. So H |ψ⟩ = E |ψ⟩.

H is proportional to σ_y. The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of H are E_± = (- γ B ħ / 2 ) * (±1) → E_± = ± ( - γ B ħ / 2 ). Wait, that would give E_+ = - γ B ħ / 2 and E_- = γ B ħ / 2. Wait, no, because σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, so H would have eigenvalues E_± = (- γ B ħ/2) * (±1) → E_+ = (- γ B ħ/2) * (+1) = - γ B ħ / 2, and E_- = (- γ B ħ/2) * (-1) ) = + γ B ħ / 2.

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should write H in terms of ω, where ω is the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is typically ω = γ B. So H = -ω S_y. Wait, but S is in units of ħ/2, so S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. Then, H = - ω (ħ/2) σ_y. Hmm.

But perhaps a better approach is to write the time evolution operator U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ). Let me plug in H.

H = - γ B S_y. S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So H = - γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

So U(t) = exp( [i γ B (ħ/2) σ_y t ] / ħ ) = exp( i γ B t σ_y / 2 ).

Because the denominator's ħ cancels with the numerator's ħ. So U(t) = exp( i (γ B t / 2 ) σ_y ).

Now, the initial state is |+z⟩. Let me express this in terms of the eigenstates of σ_y. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value ⟨S_z(t)⟩.

In the Heisenberg picture, the operator S_z(t) evolves as S_z(t) = U†(t) S_z U(t).

So the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_z(t) |ψ⟩ = Tr( ρ S_z(t) ), where ρ is the density matrix. Since the state is |+z⟩⟨+z|, ρ = |+z⟩⟨+z|.

So ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| U†(t) S_z U(t) |+z⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps compute S_z(t) in the Heisenberg picture.

Hmm, but maybe a better approach is to compute the time evolution using the expansion in energy eigenstates.

The initial state |+z⟩ can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of H. So let's find the eigenstates of H.

The Hamiltonian is H = - γ B S_y. Let me write S_y in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩.

S_y = (|+z⟩⟨−z| - |−z⟩⟨+z| ) * ħ/2.

So H = - γ B (ħ/2) (|+z⟩⟨−z| - |−z⟩⟨+z| ) = - (γ B ħ /2 ) (|+z⟩⟨−z| - |−z⟩⟨+z| )

The eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

Wait, because H is proportional to S_y, so the eigenstates are the same as S_y's.

So |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are the eigenstates of H. Let me write |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

The eigenstates |±y⟩ can be written in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩ as:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ − |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, I think the exact expressions are:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ − i |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check. The spin states in different directions are related by rotation. S_y eigenstates can be written in terms of S_z eigenstates.

The eigenvectors for S_y are (1, 0) and (0,1) rotated by 90 degrees. Wait, no, S_y is the Pauli matrix σ_y multiplied by ħ/2.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. The eigenvectors for σ_y = +1 are (1, i)/sqrt(2), and for σ_y = -1 are (1, -i)/sqrt(2).

So, in terms of the spin-up and spin-down in z, |+z⟩ is (1,0), |−z⟩ is (0,1).

So the eigenstate |+y⟩ is (1, i)/sqrt(2) in the (|+z⟩, |−z⟩) basis. Similarly, |−y⟩ is (1, -i)/sqrt(2).

So, the initial state |+z⟩ is (1, 0). Let me express this in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

So, |+z⟩ = [ |+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, let me compute:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ − i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

If I add |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

( |+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ + |+z⟩ - i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) = ( 2 |+z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z⟩.

So |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, let me compute:

Wait, |+z⟩ = a |+y⟩ + b |−y⟩.

We can compute a and b by taking inner products. Let's compute ⟨+y|+z⟩.

⟨+y| is (1/sqrt(2)) (1, -i ), because |+y⟩ is (1, i)/sqrt(2), so the bra is the conjugate transpose.

⟨+y| +z ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [1 * 1 + (-i) * 0 ] = 1/sqrt(2).

So a = ⟨+y|+z⟩ = 1/sqrt(2).

Similarly, ⟨−y|+z⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [1 *1 + i *0 ] = 1/sqrt(2), so b = 1/sqrt(2).

So |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Because both a and b are 1/sqrt(2).

So, now the initial state can be written as |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

So when the Hamiltonian is H, which has eigenstates |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ with eigenvalues E_+ and E_-, the state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩ = (|+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} + |−y⟩ e^{-i E_- t / ħ} ) / sqrt(2).

We can compute E_+ and E_-.

Earlier, H is given by H = - γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of H are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2) * 1 = - gamma B ħ / 2,

E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2) * (-1 ) = gamma B ħ / 2.

So E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2,

E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2.

So, the time evolution of |+z⟩ is:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ |+y⟩ e^{ -i E_+ t / ħ } + |−y⟩ e^{ -i E_- t / ħ } ] / sqrt(2 )

Substitute E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2 → -i E_+ t / ħ = i (gamma B ħ / 2) t / ħ = i gamma B t / 2 (since ħ cancels).

Similarly, E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2 → -i E_- t / ħ = -i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ = -i gamma B t / 2.

So,

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ |+y⟩ e^{ i gamma B t / 2 } + |−y⟩ e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } ] / sqrt(2 )

Now, we need to find the expectation value of S_z(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

Wait, but in the state |ψ(t)⟩, which is a combination of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, we can compute ⟨S_z⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩.

Wait, because S_z is diagonal in the |+z⟩, |−z⟩ basis. Let me express |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩.

As established earlier,

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2),

|−y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

So substituting into |ψ(t)⟩:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ [ (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ] e^{i gamma B t / 2 } + [ (|+z⟩ - i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ] e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } ] / sqrt(2 )

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ |+z⟩ e^{i gamma B t / 2} (1) + |+z⟩ e^{-i gamma B t /2} (1) + i |−z⟩ e^{i gamma B t /2} (1) - i |−z⟩ e^{-i gamma B t /2} (1) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))

Which is:

= [ |+z⟩ ( e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) + i |−z⟩ ( e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ] / 2

Simplify using Euler's formula:

e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cos θ,

e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sin θ.

So,

= [ |+z⟩ ( 2 cos(gamma B t/2) ) + i |−z⟩ ( 2i sin(gamma B t/2) ) ] / 2

Simplify each term:

2 cos(...) / 2 = cos(...),

i * 2i sin(...) → i*2i = 2i^2 = 2 (-1) = -2. So [i |−z⟩ (2i sin(...)) ] → [ |−z⟩ ( -2 sin(...) ) ] / 2 → - sin(...) |−z⟩.

Putting it all together:

|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z⟩ - sin(gamma B t/2) |−z⟩.

So the state at time t is a superposition of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩ with coefficients cos(θ) and -sin(θ), where θ = (gamma B t)/2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is:

⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2) |+z⟩,

S_z |−z⟩ = (-ħ/2) |−z⟩.

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = [ cos(theta) ⟨+z| - sin(theta) ⟨-z| ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z⟩ - sin(theta) |−z⟩ ]

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

Because when you multiply it out,

cos(theta) cos(theta) ⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ 

+ cos(theta) (- sin(theta)) ⟨+z| S_z |−z⟩ 

+ (- sin(theta)) cos(theta) ⟨−z| S_z |+z⟩ 

+ (- sin(theta)) (- sin(theta)) ⟨−z| S_z |−z⟩ 

But ⟨+z| S_z |−z⟩ is 0 because S_z is diagonal in this basis.

So,

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

= (1/2) ħ [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Because cos^2θ - sin^2θ = cos(2θ).

So,

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

But theta is gamma B t / 2.

So,

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( 2 * (gamma B t /2) ) = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Thus, the expectation value oscillates as cos(gamma B t) multiplied by ħ/2.

But the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So,

⟨ mu_z ⟩ = gamma ⟨ S_z ⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. So the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the amplitude and the frequency. The oscillation is in cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. The actual frequency (cycles per second) would be gamma B / (2π), but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which in such contexts usually refers to the angular frequency, which is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the answer should be B.

But wait, I thought that when you have a spin in a magnetic field, the frequency is gamma B. So that makes sense here.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me recap.

The state is initially |+z⟩. After the field is applied along Y, the time evolution leads to oscillations in ⟨ S_z ⟩ with frequency gamma B. So the average mu_z oscillates with the same frequency.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: consider the Hamiltonian. H = -gamma B S_y. The energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ ) / 2 and E_- = -(gamma B ħ ) / 2.

The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillation in transition probabilities is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = gamma B.

Which matches what we found earlier. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.


To determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s moment after the magnetic field is switched, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Initial State**: The particle is initially in a magnetic field along the +Z direction, aligning its spin with the field. The initial state is therefore the eigenstate of \( S_z \), \(|+z\rangle\), with eigenvalue \( \hbar/2 \).

2. **Field Change**: The magnetic field is suddenly turned off and reactivated along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude \( B \). The Hamiltonian after the field change is \( H = -\gamma B S_y \), where \( S_y \) is the spin operator in the y-direction.

3. **Time Evolution**: The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state \(|+z\rangle\) can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of \( H \), which are \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\) (the eigenstates of \( S_y \)):
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} + |-y\rangle e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} \right),
   \]
   where \( E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \) and \( E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \) are the eigenvalues of \( H \).

4. **Expression for \(|\psi(t)\rangle\)**: Substituting the eigenvalues, the time-evolved state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|+z\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|-z\rangle.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**: The expectation value of \( S_z \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]
   Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta = \cos(2\theta) \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**: The z-component of the magnetic moment is \( \mu_z = \gamma S_z \). Thus:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of \( t \) inside the cosine, which is \( \gamma B \).

7. **Conclusion**: The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s moment is \( \gamma B \).
