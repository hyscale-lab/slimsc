Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is present. The given data is 0.02 M concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, ideal pH, temperature at 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant K is given. The formation constant, Kf, represents the equilibrium between the metal ion, EDTA, and the complex.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but in this case, the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA = 5x10^10. I think that's the same as Kf here.

The solution is stoichiometric, which probably means that all the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA, right? So, the concentration of free calcium ions would be very low because it's all tied up in the complex.

Wait, no, actually, in a stoichiometric solution, the ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1. But if all the Ca²+ is complexed, then the free [Ca²+] would be really small. So the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. So, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M.

But wait, the formation constant equation is:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, but in a solution where Ca²+ and EDTA are present, the complex forms. But if the solution is at stoichiometric proportions, meaning [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-], because each Ca²+ binds one EDTA^4-.

Wait, no. Wait, the stoichiometric point in a titration is when the moles of EDTA equal the moles of Ca²+. But in this problem, it's a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, which is already the complex. So the initial [Ca²+] is zero because all the Ca²+ is in the complex form.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because in solution, some of the Ca-EDTA complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the concentration of free Ca²+ is determined by the Kf value.

So, let me think. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's say the complex dissociates as follows:

Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

At equilibrium, the concentration of Ca-EDTA will be approximately 0.02 minus x, but since x is probably very small compared to 0.02, we can approximate [Ca-EDTA] ≈ 0.02.

So the expression becomes:

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA]

But wait, in this case, [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are the same because each complex dissociation releases one of each. So [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.

So substituting:

Kf = (x)(x) / 0.02

So Kf = x² / 0.02 = 5e10.

Wait, Kf is 5e10, so:

x² = (5e10) * 0.02

0.02 is 2e-2. So 5e10 * 2e-2 = (5*2) * 1e8 = 10e8 = 1e9.

Wait, 5e10 * 2e-2 = 5 * 2 * 1e(10-2) )=10 *1e8 = 1e9.

So x² =1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M. Wait, that can't be right because that's way higher than the initial concentration of the complex.

Wait, wait a minute, I must have messed up the calculation. Let me redo it.

Wait, Kf is 5e10. So:

x² = 5e10 * 0.02

0.02 is 2e-2.

So 5e10 * 2e-2 = (5*2) * 10^(10-2) )= 10 * 1e8 = 1e9.

x² =1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4 M. That's 31,623 M, which is impossible because the initial concentration is 0.02 M. That can't be right. So perhaps I inverted the equation.

Wait, maybe the equation is [Ca-EDTA] = Kf [Ca²+][EDTA^4-].

Wait, no, the formation constant is for the reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ Ca-EDTA²− 

So Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So in that case, if Kf is 5e10, then [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M.

Assuming that [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.

So 0.02 = Kf * x^2 → x^2 = 0.02 / Kf → x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate.

Wait, 4e-13 = 4 * 1e-13. sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 (since (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13).

So x≈ 2e-6.5 M. Let me compute that. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.5 is halfway between 6 and 7, so 3.16e-7.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7. So x≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but why did I get such a low concentration? Because the formation constant Kf is very high, meaning the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the free Ca²+ is very low, which makes sense.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given:
- \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \),
- \([\text{Ca-EDTA}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\),
- At equilibrium, \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{K_f}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

0.02 is 2e-2. So 5e10 * 2e-2 = (5*2) * 1e8 = 10e8 = 1e9.

Wait, 5e10 * 2e-2 = 5 * 2 * 1e(10-2) )=10 *1e8 = 1e9.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate.
