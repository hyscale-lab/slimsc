Okay, so I have this question about cosmology and redshift. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So the question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength. The wavelength given is about 1216 Angstroms. They're asking for the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, redshift and detecting objects... I remember that redshift affects the wavelength we observe. So if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, but the quasar's light is being absorbed, the absorption line would be at a different wavelength depending on the redshift.

Right, when a quasar emits light that passes through a cloud of hydrogen, the hydrogen will absorb certain wavelengths. The Lyman alpha emission line from hydrogen is at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. So the quasar emits this, but the cloud absorbs it. But wait, actually, the quasar emits at Lyman alpha, and the cloud in front of it (or behind, depending on perspective) would absorb that specific wavelength. Or maybe it's the other way around? Oh, wait, no. If the cloud is in between us and the quasar, then it's the quasar's light that passes through the cloud, and the cloud's hydrogen would absorb the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha photons. But since the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength we observe would be redshifted.

So the key here is that the absorption line (Lyman alpha) is observed at a longer wavelength than emitted. The formula is observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So, for the cloud, the absorption occurs at 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z_cloud). But wait, no, wait: the quasar's emission is at 1216, but when it's absorbed by the cloud, the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, right? Or wait, no, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Wait, no, the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is at a higher redshift. Hmm, maybe I should clarify this.

Wait, the quasar is a bright object, and the cloud is in the line of sight, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is farther away. So when the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, the cloud's hydrogen absorbs at the rest wavelength, but because the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the absorption line would be redshifted. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line would be 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). Or wait, wait. The cloud's own emission would have a redshift, but the absorption is of the quasar's light. So if the quasar is at redshift z_quasar, and the cloud is at z_cloud, then the absorption line in the quasar's spectrum will be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. 

But wait, the question is about the cloud being detected. So the cloud itself isn't emitting; it's absorbing the quasar's light. So we can see the absorption line in the quasar's spectrum. So the question is probably about the maximum redshift where this absorption line is still in the optical range, because beyond that, it would be in the infrared, which might not be detectable by optical telescopes.

Wait, the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of the object (the cloud) such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So the absorption line must be in the optical range for us to see it. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption line must be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. What's the typical optical range? I think it's roughly 300 nm to about 1000 nm (near-infrared is longer, like 1000+ nm). So, for ground-based optical telescopes, maybe up to around 800 or 900 nm?

Wait, but wait: optical is usually considered to be about 400-700 nm. Wait, no, I remember that optical wavelengths are roughly from 380 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red). But some ground-based telescopes can go a bit beyond that into the near-infrared, but perhaps the question is considering optical as up to around 800 nm or so.

So the Lyman alpha absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z) Angstroms. Converting that to nanometers, since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. We want the observed wavelength to be less than the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe. Let's say the maximum is, for example, 900 nm (which is 9000 Angstroms). Then:

1216 * (1 + z) <= 9000 Angstroms.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the observed wavelength is 1216 (1 + z) Angstroms. Let me compute that. 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. If the observed wavelength is larger than that, then it's redshifted.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So what's the smallest redshift that the cloud can have so that the absorption line is still in the optical range. Because if the cloud is too close (low redshift), the absorption line would be at a wavelength longer than optical, making it undetectable.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The rest wavelength of Lyman alpha is 121.6 nm. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the absorption line is observed at 121.6*(1+z) nm. For this to be in the optical range, which is up to about 700 nm, so:

121.6*(1 + z) <= 700 nm.

Wait, but optical telescopes can't see beyond 700-800 nm, right? So if the observed wavelength is beyond that, it's in the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can see, but maybe the question is only considering the optical part. Or perhaps, the maximum wavelength they can observe is higher. Hmm, maybe it's 800 nm or so.

Alternatively, perhaps the cutoff is that the observed wavelength must be less than 900 nm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line must be in the observed frame within the optical window. So let's set up the equation.

We have:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z)

We want lambda_obs <= lambda_max, where lambda_max is the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. Let's say lambda_max is 900 nm (but I'm not certain about this number; some telescopes can go into the near-IR, but perhaps for this question, it's 700 nm as the limit of optical).

So, for the observed wavelength to be in the optical, z must satisfy:

121.6*(1 + z) <= 700 nm.

Wait, wait, 121.6 nm is the rest wavelength. So, solving for z:

(1 + z) <= 700 / 121.6

So 700 / 121.6 is approximately 5.755.

So 1 + z <= 5.755 → z <= 4.755.

Wait, but that's the maximum redshift where the observed wavelength is 700 nm. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, no. Wait, the absorption line must be in the optical range to be detected. So if the cloud has a redshift z_cloud, the observed wavelength is 121.6*(1+z_cloud) nm. If this is too long (like beyond optical), then the absorption line is not detectable in optical. So the lower limit on z would be the smallest z where the observed wavelength is within the optical.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The cloud is at a redshift z. The Lyman alpha absorption line is observed at 121.6*(1+z) Angstroms. Wait, no, wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So, 121.6 nm * (1 + z) is the observed wavelength in nm.

What's the upper limit for optical? Let's say the optical range is up to 900 nm. Then:

121.6*(1 + z) <= 900

So 1 + z <= 900 / 121.6 ≈ 7.40.

So z <= 6.40.

But that's the maximum redshift. But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the object (the cloud) such that they can be detected. So, for the cloud to be detected, the absorption line must be in the optical. So the observed wavelength must be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that the optical telescope can observe. So, if the cloud is at a lower redshift, the absorption line is at a shorter wavelength. Wait, no—wait, the redshift increases, the observed wavelength increases. So, for the absorption line to be observable in optical, the cloud's redshift must be high enough that the absorption line is in the optical range.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If the cloud is at a higher redshift, the absorption line is redshifted more. So, the observed wavelength would be longer, moving into the infrared. If the cloud is at a lower redshift, the absorption line is less redshifted, so the observed wavelength is shorter.

Wait, but the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud. So, the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar. So, the quasar's light has to pass through the cloud, which is at a lower redshift. Oh, but wait, that depends on whether the cloud is between us and the quasar. If the cloud is in the line of sight, then the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar.

But in this problem, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud, which is in the foreground. So the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar.

Wait, but the question is about the redshift of the cloud. So, the cloud's redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha absorption line is within the optical range. So, the observed wavelength is 121.6*(1 + z_cloud) nm.

We need this to be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. Let's say the maximum is 900 nm.

So,

121.6 * (1 + z_cloud) <= 900 nm

→ (1 + z_cloud) <= 900 / 121.6 ≈ 7.40

→ z_cloud <= 6.40

But that's the maximum redshift. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimum redshift where the cloud can be detected. Wait, that doesn't make sense because at lower redshifts, the observed wavelength is shorter, which is more in the UV. But optical is longer than UV.

Wait, no. Wait, the Lyman alpha line is in the UV for the rest frame. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 121.6*(1 + z) nm.

If z is small, the observed wavelength is just a bit longer than 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the observed Lyman alpha line must be in the optical range for the absorption to be detectable from the ground.

So for the observed wavelength to be in the optical (say, 300-800 nm), we have:

300 nm <= 121.6*(1 + z) <= 800 nm

So, let's compute the lower and upper bounds for (1 + z).

Lower bound: 300 / 121.6 ≈ 2.468 → 1 + z >= 2.468 → z >= 1.468

Upper bound: 800 / 121.6 ≈ 6.585 → 1 + z <=6.585 → z <=5.585

So the redshift z must be between approximately 1.47 and 5.58.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimum redshift is around 1.47. But wait, the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Looking at the options, the closest lower limit is B)1.2, but that's below 1.47. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the maximum wavelength that optical can observe is higher. Let me think again. Maybe the cutoff is not 800 nm but 900 or even 1000 nm, as some ground telescopes can go a bit into the near-infrared.

Alternatively, maybe the optical range is considered up to about 1 micrometer (1000 nm). So let's reevaluate.

If the maximum wavelength is 1000 nm:

121.6 * (1 + z) <= 1000

So (1 + z) <= 8.222 → z <= 7.222.

But again, the lower limit. Wait, the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is at the minimum of optical, which is perhaps 300 nm.

So, 121.6*(1 + z) >= 300 nm.

Wait, no. Wait, the optical range starts at around 400 nm (violet light), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify.

Visible light is roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). But ground-based optical telescopes can sometimes observe a bit beyond that into the near-infrared, say up to 800 or 1000 nm. But for the purpose of this question, perhaps the optical range is considered as starting at about 300 nm (ultraviolet) and going up to, say, 900 nm.

Wait, but the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So for the observed wavelength to be in the optical, it must be redshifted into the optical range.

So, the minimum redshift where the observed wavelength is just within the optical (say, 300 nm) is:

121.6*(1 + z) = 300 nm → 1 + z = 300 / 121.6 ≈ 2.468 → z ≈ 1.468.

So the lower limit is about z=1.47. But the options given are B)1.2 and D)1.9.

Wait, but in the options, the closest higher value is D)1.9, which is approximately 1.9. That would be higher than 1.47, so the minimum redshift is 1.47, so any cloud with z >=1.47 would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical. So the lower limit on the redshift is around 1.47. So the question is to find the lower limit such that they can be detected. So the minimum z is 1.47, so any cloud with z >=1.47 can be detected.

Looking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the question is about the quasar's redshift or the cloud's. Wait, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. But the question says the redshift of the objects (the clouds). So the cloud's redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical.

So, the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is approximately 1.47. So any cloud with z >=1.47 would have the absorption line in the optical. So the lower limit is about 1.47.

Looking at the options, the closest is D)1.9, which is higher, but another option is B)1.2, which is lower than 1.47. So, perhaps the correct answer is B)1.2 is too low, so the minimum is higher than that.

Wait, but the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the objects such that they can be detected. So if the cloud's redshift is below a certain value, the absorption line is in the UV, which can't be detected by optical telescopes. So the lower limit is the minimum redshift where the absorption line is at the edge of the optical (say, 300 nm). So, the minimum redshift is around 1.47, so any cloud with a higher redshift than that can be detected.

But the options don't have 1.47. The closest higher option is D)1.9, which is 1.9, but the question is to find the lower limit. So perhaps the correct answer is when the observed wavelength is at the upper limit of the optical, say 700 nm.

Wait, let's recalculate with 700 nm as the maximum.

So:

121.6*(1 + z) <= 700 → 1 + z <= 700/121.6 ≈5.755 → z <=4.755.

But that's the maximum redshift. The lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is at the lower end of the optical, like 300 nm. So:

121.6*(1 + z) >= 300 → 1 + z >= 300/121.6≈2.468 → z >=1.468.

So the lower limit is about 1.47.

So the options are D)1.9, which is higher than 1.47, and B)1.2, which is lower. So the correct lower limit is 1.47. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is B)1.2, but that doesn't make sense because 1.2 is lower than 1.47, so the Lyman alpha line would be at 121.6*(1+1.2)= 121.6*2.2=267.52 nm, which is still in the UV, not optical. So perhaps the correct lower limit is higher.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the quasar's emission is at a wavelength that is redshifted to the Lyman alpha of the cloud. Wait, maybe I'm getting the redshifts mixed up. Let me think again.

The cloud is at redshift z, so the Lyman alpha absorption line is observed at 121.6*(1+z) nm. For this to be in the optical range (say, 400-700 nm), the equation becomes:

400 <= 121.6*(1 + z) <=700.

So 400/121.6 ≈3.29 → 1 + z >=3.29 → z >=2.29.

700/121.6≈5.755 → z <=4.755.

So the cloud must have a redshift between approximately 2.29 and 4.755 for the Lyman alpha line to be in the visible range (400-700 nm). So the lower limit is about z=2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)2.4 and D)1.9. So 2.4 is higher than 2.29, so perhaps that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the optical range is considered up to 800 nm. So maximum lambda is 800 nm.

So,

121.6*(1 + z) <=800 →1 + z <= 800/121.6≈6.588 → z <=5.588.

And the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is 300 nm (UV-optical boundary):

121.6*(1 + z) >= 300 → z >= (300/121.6)-1 ≈2.468-1=1.468.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 300/121.6 is about 2.468. So 1+z >=2.468 → z >=1.468.

But according to the visible range (400-700), the lower limit is 2.29.

But the options don't have that. Let's see the options again.

Options are:

A)3

B)1.2

C)2.4

D)1.9.

So if the lower limit is about 2.29, the closest option is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the observed wavelength must be in the near-infrared, but that's probably not, as the question specifies optical telescopes.

Wait, but perhaps the optical telescopes can actually detect up to about 900 nm. Let me recalculate with 900 nm as the upper limit.

121.6*(1 + z) <=900 →1 + z <=900/121.6≈7.40 →z<=6.4.

The lower limit is when the observed wavelength is 300 nm as before, so z>=1.47.

But the options again don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light is observed in the optical, but the Lyman alpha absorption is in the near-infrared. Wait, no, the question states that the clouds absorb the light from the quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength. So the absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame, but in our frame, it's redshifted.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cloud's redshift is z, and the quasar is at a higher redshift. The observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption would be 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z_cloud). We need this to be within the optical range of the telescope. So, the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe is say, 900 nm (9000 Angstroms).

So, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) <=9000 →1 + z_cloud <= 7.40 → z_cloud <=6.40.

But again, the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is at the minimum of the optical, say 300 nm:

1216*(1 + z_cloud) >=3000 Angstroms (300 nm) →1 + z_cloud >= 3000/1216 ≈2.467 → z_cloud >=1.467.

So the lower limit is about 1.467. So any cloud with z_cloud >=1.467 would have the absorption line in the optical. Now, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the lower limit is about 1.47. The options that are above this would be D)1.9 and C)2.4.

But the question is asking for the lower limit, so the highest lower limit possible. Wait, no. The lower limit is the minimum redshift needed for detection. So any cloud with z_cloud >=1.47 can be detected. So the lower limit is 1.47.

In the options, the closest higher is D)1.9, which is above 1.47. So the lower limit is that the cloud must be at a redshift of at least approximately 1.47.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is B)1.2, but wait, that would be lower than 1.47, so the Lyman alpha line would be at 121.6*(1+1.2)=267.5 nm, which is still in the UV. So ground-based optical telescopes can't see that.

Therefore, perhaps the correct lower limit is when the observed wavelength is at the edge of what optical telescopes can observe. If optical can go up to about 900 nm, then the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is 900 nm.

So,

121.6*(1 + z_cloud) =900 →1 + z_cloud=900/121.6≈7.4 →z_cloud≈6.4.

Wait, that's the maximum redshift, not the lower limit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the question is about the quasar's redshift, not the cloud's. Wait, no, the question states the redshift of the objects (the clouds), so I think I'm correct in considering the cloud's redshift.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done differently. Let me think.

The Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 Angstroms. For the cloud, which is at redshift z, the absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z) Angstroms. The quasar's light, being from a higher redshift, would have its own emission lines, but the cloud's absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength for the cloud's frame.

Wait, but the quasar's emission is being absorbed by the cloud. So the quasar's light is at a longer wavelength due to the quasar's redshift. But the cloud is at a lower redshift, so the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms.

So, for the absorption line to be in the optical part of the spectrum (assuming the quasar's light is observed in the optical), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the quasar's redshift. But the question says the clouds are absorbing the quasar's light at Lyman alpha, so the cloud's redshift is what determines where the absorption line appears.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of the problem differently. Suppose the cloud is at a redshift z. Then the Lyman alpha absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z) Angstroms. For this to be in the optical range, which is up to about 900 nm (9000 Angstroms), we have:

1216*(1 + z) <=9000 →1 + z <=7.406 →z <=6.406.

But we're looking for the lower limit of z such that the absorption is detectable. But if z is too low, 1216*(1 + z) is too small (in the UV), which we can't detect. So the minimum z is when the observed wavelength is at the lower end of the optical range. Let's say the optical starts at 300 nm (3000 Angstroms).

So,

1216*(1 + z) >=3000 →1 + z >=3000/1216 ≈2.468 →z >=1.468.

So the lower limit is approximately 1.47. So any cloud with a redshift above this can be detected.

Looking back at the options, the closest higher value is D)1.9 (which is about 1.9), but that's higher than 1.47. So the lower limit is 1.47, but since the options don't have it, perhaps the intended answer is B)1.2, but that's lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the observed wavelength must be in the optical window of the telescope, which is up to about 800 nm.

So,

1216*(1 + z) <=8000 Angstroms →1 + z <=8000/1216 ≈6.585 →z <=5.585.

The lower limit when observed wavelength is at 3000 Angstroms (300 nm):

1 + z >=3000/1216 ≈2.468 →z >=1.468.

So the lower limit is 1.47. Again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum wavelength is 700 nm (7000 Angstroms).

So,

1216*(1 + z) <=7000 →1 + z <=5.755 →z <=4.755.

Lower limit at 300 nm: z >=1.468.

Hmm. So the options don't have 1.47. The next possible is D)1.9 (1.9) which is 1.9 >1.47.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that the Lyman-alpha forest is observable. The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines seen in quasar spectra, typically from neutral hydrogen clouds with redshifts lower than the quasar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rest wavelength of the quasar's emission and the cloud's absorption. If the quasar's emission is redshifted, so the observed wavelength is longer, but the cloud's absorption is at a specific wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the quasar's emission line. The quasar emits light, including Lyman alpha at 121.6 nm. The cloud, which is at redshift z, will absorb this quasar's light. So the absorption line is observed at 121.6*(1 + z) nm.

But the quasar itself is at a higher redshift, say z_quasar. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is observed at 121.6*(1 + z_quasar) nm, but the cloud, at z_cloud < z_quasar, absorbs it at 121.6*(1 + z_cloud) nm. So the absorption line appears in the quasar's spectrum at that wavelength.

So the observed absorption line from the cloud is at 121.6*(1 + z_cloud) nm.

We want this to be in the optical range. So, let's say the optical range is 300-900 nm.

Thus, 300 nm <= 121.6*(1 + z_cloud) <=900 nm.

So,

300/121.6 ≈2.468 <= 1 + z_cloud <=900/121.6≈7.406.

→ z_cloud >=1.468 and z_cloud <=6.406.

So the lower limit is approximately 1.47. So the minimum redshift for the cloud is about 1.47.

Looking at the options, the closest higher is D)1.9, which is approximately 1.9. So that could be the answer, but why isn't 1.47 an option?

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the observed wavelength must be less than 900 nm to be in the optical. So the maximum redshift is 6.406, but the question is about the lower limit, so the minimum is 1.47.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, the choices are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

If the lower limit is 1.47, then any cloud with z >=1.47 can be detected. So the lower limit would be 1.47, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D)1.9, but that's higher than necessary. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) and the optical range up to 900 nm.

So,

1216*(1 + z) =9000 Angstroms →1 +z =9000/1216≈7.406 →z≈6.406.

But that's the maximum. The lower limit is when the observed wavelength is at the start of the optical, say 300 nm (3000 Angstroms).

So,

1216*(1 + z) =3000 →1 +z=3000/1216≈2.468 →z≈1.468.

Again, the same result.

Since none of the options match this precisely, perhaps the intended answer is B)1.2, but that would imply the observed wavelength is 121.6*(1+1.2)=267.5 nm, which is still in the UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.

Alternatively, perhaps the optical range is considered to start at 400 nm.

So,

121.6*(1 + z) >=400 →1 +z >=400/121.6≈3.29 →z >=2.29.

So the lower limit is about 2.29. The closest option is C)2.4.

So perhaps the intended answer is C)2.4.

But why would the optical range be considered as starting at 400 nm? Well, visible light starts at around 400 nm, but some optical telescopes can observe into the near-UV, say down to 300 nm.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of it another way. The Lyman-alpha wavelength is 121.6 nm. For the absorption to be in the optical, which is about 400-700 nm, the cloud's redshift must satisfy:

(1 + z) = 400 / 121.6 ≈3.29 →z≈2.29.

So the lower limit is approximately 2.29. So the cloud's redshift must be at least around 2.3 to have the absorption line in the visible range.

Looking at the options, C)2.4 is the closest higher option. So perhaps the intended answer is C)2.4.

But wait, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So that would imply that the observed wavelength is at 121.6*(1+1.9)= 121.6 *2.9≈353 nm, which is in the UV. So ground-based telescopes can't see that. So the correct lower limit is higher than 2.29.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the redshift where the Lyman-alpha line is at 400 nm, which is the start of the visible spectrum.

So,

121.6*(1 + z) =400 nm →1 + z=400/121.6≈3.29 →z≈2.29.

So, the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is approximately 2.29. So the cloud must be at least at z=2.29 for the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be in the optical.

Looking at the options, C)2.4 is the only option higher than 2.29. So perhaps the intended answer is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum wavelength is 800 nm, in which case:

121.6*(1 + z) =800 →1 +z=800/121.6≈6.585 →z≈5.585.

But that's the maximum, not the lower limit. So the lower limit remains around 2.29.

So I think the correct answer is C)2.4.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman-alpha absorption lines are detectable with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the relationship between the observed wavelength of the absorption line and the redshift. The Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen is emitted at a rest wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \) (or \( 1216 \, \text{Å} \)). When redshifted, the observed wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must fall within the range of typical optical telescopes. Assuming the optical range extends from \( 300 \, \text{nm} \) (near-UV) to \( 900 \, \text{nm} \) (near-infrared), the redshift \( z \) must satisfy:

\[
300 \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 900
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z) \), we find:

\[
300 \leq 121.6 \cdot (1 + z) \leq 900
\]

Dividing through by \( 121.6 \), we calculate the bounds for \( 1 + z \):

\[
\frac{300}{121.6} \leq 1 + z \leq \frac{900}{121.6}
\]

\[
2.468 \leq 1 + z \leq 7.406
\]

Subtracting 1 from all parts:

\[
1.468 \leq z \leq 6.406
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \geq 1.47 \). This means that clouds with redshifts below \( z = 1.47 \) would have their Lyman-alpha absorption lines in the far-UV, which is not detectable by optical telescopes. For detection, the cloud's redshift must be at least \( z \approx 1.47 \).

Among the given options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit and is valid but not the minimum.
- **B) 1.2**: This is below the calculated lower limit of \( z = 1.47 \), so it is invalid.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than the calculated lower limit and is valid.
- **D) 1.9**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit and is valid.

Since the question asks for the lower limit, the smallest value that satisfies the condition is \( z \approx 1.47 \). However, this exact value is not among the options. The closest valid option is **C) 2.4**, which is slightly above the calculated lower limit and ensures the Lyman-alpha absorption line is within the optical range.
