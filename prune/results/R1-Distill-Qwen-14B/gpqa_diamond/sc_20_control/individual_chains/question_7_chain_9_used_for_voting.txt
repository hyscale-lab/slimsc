Okay, so I have this physics problem about the interaction of high-energy gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The question is about finding the energy of gamma rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process where they annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, right, the reaction is gamma plus gamma giving e+ and e-. 

I remember that this process is a photon-photon interaction. The CMB is made of low-energy photons, so one of the gammas in the reaction would be the high-energy gamma, and the other would be a CMB photon. The average energy of CMB photons is given as 1e-3 eV. 

Wait, I think the process is called photon-photon pair production. The cross-section for this process is probably a factor here. The idea is that for a gamma-ray with energy E, the probability of it interacting with a CMB photon to produce electrons increases as E increases. So, at some point, the gamma's lifetime is so short because it interacts so often that we can't detect it anymore. Hence, the energy threshold where this interaction becomes significant would determine the limiting energy.

I recall that the mean free path of a particle is the average distance it travels before interacting. The mean free time is related to the inverse of the interaction rate. So, the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited by this interaction if the mean free path is shorter than the size of the universe or something like that.

But wait, the question is phrased as "from what energy would their lifetimes in the universe be limited by this process?" So, perhaps the gamma's lifetime is inversely proportional to the interaction probability times the photon density.

The interaction rate (Gamma) would be the product of the cross-section (σ), the relative velocity (v), and the number density of the target photons (n). So, Gamma ≈ σ * n * v. 

Hmm, since the CMB is isotropic and the gamma is a high-energy photon moving through space, the relative velocity would be approximately c, the speed of light. So v ≈ c.

The cross-section for photon-photon pair production is given by the formula σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (E_photon^2) / (E_gamma^2), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression. Wait, I think the cross-section for two photons of energy E1 and E2 is proportional to (E1 E2)/(m_e^2 c^4), but I might need to double-check that.

Wait, another approach: the photon-photon cross-section for pair production is known, and it depends on the product of the photon energies. For two photons, the cross-section σ is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (4π^2)) (E1 E2)/(m_e^2 c^4) ) ... Wait, perhaps I should look for the specific expression.

Alternatively, the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (4π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) (E1 E2). Wait, I'm a bit shaky on this. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is given by σ ≈ 64π^3/(3 m_e^4 c^8) * E1 E2 (E1 + E2), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the threshold condition.

Wait, the reaction γ + γ → e+ + e- can only proceed if the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c^2. The center-of-mass energy squared s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since both photons are moving in opposite directions in the lab frame (assuming head-on collision), their momenta are in opposite directions. So, p1 = E1/(c), p2 = E2/(c). Wait, for photons, E = pc, so for each photon, p = E/(c).

So, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/c) - (E2/c) )^2 c^2. Wait, because in the lab frame, the photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta are in opposite directions, so when computing the invariant s, it's (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

Wait, let's compute s:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - (- p2 c))^2. Wait, no, the four-momentum is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). So for two photons moving in opposite directions, say along the x-axis, their four-momenta would be (E1/c, E1/c, 0,0) and (E2/c, -E2/c, 0, 0). So when you add them, the total four-momentum is (E1 + E2)/c, (E1 - E2)/c, 0,0.

Then s is the square of the total four-momentum, multiplied by c^4:

s = ( (E1+E2)/c )^2 c^4 - ( (E1 - E2)/c )^2 c^4 * (direction squared, which is positive)
= (E1 + E2)^2 c^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 c^2
= [ (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 ] c^2
= [ (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ] c^2
= [4 E1 E2] c^2.

So s = 4 E1 E2 c^2. So the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2 c^2) = 2 c sqrt(E1 E2).

For the reaction to occur, the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2 m_e c^2. So:

2 c sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ 2 m_e c^2

Divide both sides by 2 c:

sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ m_e c^2

Square both sides:

E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Here, E1 is the gamma-ray energy, which is high, and E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is around 1e-3 eV.

Wait, but wait, I thought E1 was the gamma-ray photon, and E2 is the CMB photon. So in the problem, the gamma is high-energy, and the CMB photon is low-energy.

So substituting E2 as the CMB average energy, E_avg = 1e-3 eV.

So for the reaction to be possible, E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, but m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² ≈ 0.26e12 eV².

So E1 * E2 >= 0.26e12 eV².

Given that E2 is 1e-3 eV, solving for E1:

E1 >= (0.26e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.26e15 eV = 2.6e14 eV.

Wait, because 0.26e12 / 1e-3 = 0.26e15.

Wait, 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e8 GeV, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Wait no, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e5 GeV. Because 2.6e14 eV divided by 1e9 eV/GeV is 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, so E1 should be about 2.6e5 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

Hmm, so is that the answer? But wait, I think I might have missed a factor of 2 or so. Because wait, in the condition, we said that E1 E2 must be >= (m_e c^2)^2. So with E2 = 1e-3 eV, E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = (0.261e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV. So that's about 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

But wait, another point: in the calculation, I considered the threshold condition, so for the process to be possible, the energy product must be at least (m_e c^2)^2.

But the question is about the energy at which the gamma's lifetime is limited by this process. So perhaps it's not just the threshold, but the interaction rate.

Because the lifetime would be limited when the interaction probability is high enough that the gamma cannot travel far without interacting.

The mean free time τ is the inverse of the interaction rate Γ. So τ = 1/Γ.

The interaction rate Γ is given by the cross-section σ multiplied by the number density of the target photons n, multiplied by the relative velocity v.

In this case, the target photons are the CMB photons. The number density of CMB photons today is about n ≈ 400 cm^-3, or about 4e8 m^-3. Wait, let me think. The CMB photon density is approximately 411 photons per cm^3, which is about 4e8 photons per cubic meter. Because 1 cm^3 is 1e-6 m^3, so 411 photons/cm^3 = 411e6 photons/m^3.

So n ≈ 4e8 m^-3.

The cross-section for photon-photon pair production is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) (E1 E2) ), where α is the fine-structure constant (~1/137), and E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons. 

Wait, let me get the exact formula. The cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is approximately σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) (E1 E2) (something about their directions, but perhaps in the worst case, it's isotropic, so we can take the average).

So σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2.

But wait, I think the cross-section formula is dependent on the product of the photon energies. So, σ ≈ (8 π / 3) (α^2 / m_e^2 c^4) (E1 E2) (something else?), maybe a factor of (1 + cos^2(theta)) or something, but perhaps for an isotropic distribution, we can consider an average, which would involve a factor of 3/8 or similar. Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the formula.

But perhaps to get the interaction rate, I can write Γ = σ * n * v.

Since the gamma is moving at speed v ≈ c, and the CMB is isotropic, the relative velocity would be c.

So, Γ ≈ σ * n * c.

Substituting the σ expression:

Γ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2 ) * n * c.

Simplify:

Γ ≈ (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ) / (3 m_e^2 c^3 ).

Now, the lifetime τ is the inverse of Γ: τ = 1/Γ.

We can write τ = (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ).

But we need to find the gamma energy E1 where τ becomes comparable to the age of the universe. Because if τ is smaller than the age, the gamma would have time to annihilate.

Wait, the age of the universe is roughly t ≈ 1e10 years. Let's convert that into seconds: 1e10 * 3.15e7 ≈ 3e17 seconds.

So, setting τ ≈ t_universe, we have:

3 m_e^2 c^3 / (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ) ≈ 3e17 s.

We can solve for E1:

E1 ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 * 3e17 ) ) 

Wait, let's plug in the numbers:

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c² → 0.511e6 eV/c².

c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

n ≈ 4e8 photons/m^3.

E2 = 1e-3 eV.

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

So let's compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator: 3 m_e^2 c^3.

m_e^2 = (0.511e6 eV/c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2 / c^4.

Wait, but when multiplied by c^3, we have eV² c^−1.

Wait, let's compute the units later.

m_e^2 c^3 = ( (0.511e6 eV/c² )^2 ) * (3e8 m/s)^3.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV and meters.

But let's compute the actual value.

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c².

m_e^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² / c^4.

Multiply by c^3: m_e^2 c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² c^{-1}.

So m_e^2 c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 * (3e8 m/s) )^{-1} ?

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the value numerically.

Compute numerator:

3 m_e^2 c^3 = 3 * (0.511e6 eV/c²)^2 * (3e8 m/s)^3.

But perhaps I should express everything in eV and seconds.

Wait, eV is energy. c is in m/s.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using natural units where c=1 and eV is energy, but maybe not. Let me instead compute each part step by step.

Compute m_e^2 c^3:

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c².

m_e^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² / c^4.

Multiply by c^3: m_e^2 * c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 eV^2 / c.

So that's (0.511e6)^2 / (3e8 m/s) ) eV².

But perhaps I should compute this numerically in eV.

Wait, let me compute:

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c².

c = 3e8 m/s.

So m_e^2 c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 (eV^2) / c^4 * c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 eV^2 / c.

So, substituting c=3e8 m/s:

= (0.511e6)^2 / 3e8 m^{-1} eV^2.

Compute 0.511e6: 0.511e6 = 511,000 eV.

So (511,000)^2 = approximately (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

Divided by 3e8: 2.61e11 / 3e8 ≈ 8.7e2.

So m_e^2 c^3 = 8.7e2 eV^2 m^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, 0.511e6 is 511,000 eV.

(511,000)^2 = 511^2 * 1e6 * 1e6 = 261,121 * 1e12 = 2.61121e17 eV².

Wait, wait, 511,000 is 5.11e5. Squaring that is (5.11)^2 = ~26.11, times (1e5)^2 = 1e10. So 26.11e10 = 2.611e11 eV².

Ah, yes, so (511,000)^2 = 2.611e11 eV².

So m_e^2 c^3 = (2.611e11 eV²) / (3e8 m/s) ) = (2.611e11 / 3e8) eV² m^{-1}.

2.611e11 / 3e8 ≈ (2.611/3) * 1e3 = 0.87 * 1e3 ≈ 870.

So m_e^2 c^3 ≈ 870 eV² m^{-1}.

Now, the denominator: 8 π α^2 n E2.

Compute each term:

8 π ≈ 25.1327.

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729, so α^2 ≈ 0.000053.

n = 4e8 photons/m³.

E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So denominator = 25.1327 * (0.000053) * (4e8) * (1e-3).

Compute step by step:

25.1327 * 0.000053 ≈ 0.001332.

Then, 0.001332 * 4e8 = 0.001332 * 4e8 ≈ 5.328e5.

Then, 5.328e5 * 1e-3 = 532.8.

So denominator ≈ 532.8.

Putting it all together:

E1 ≈ (3 * 870 eV² m^{-1} ) / (532.8 * 3e17 s ).

Wait, wait the equation earlier was:

E1 ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 * 3e17 ) )

Wait, no, wait the equation after setting τ = t_universe is:

E1 ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 * 3e17 )

Wait, let me re-express:

E1 ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 * t_universe )

Where t_universe ≈ 3e17 s.

So substituting the numbers:

E1 ≈ (3 * 870 eV² m^{-1} ) / (532.8 * 3e17 s )

Wait, 3 * 870 = 2610.

Denominator: 532.8 * 3e17 ≈ 1.5984e20.

So E1 ≈ 2610 / 1.5984e20 eV² m^{-1} * eV^{-1} s.

Wait, units: eV² m^{-1} divided by eV gives eV m^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I should carry units more carefully.

Alternatively, let me compute the numerator and denominator as numbers.

Numerator: 3 * m_e^2 c^3 = 3 * 870 ≈ 2610 eV^2 m^{-1}.

Denominator: 8 π α^2 n E2 * t_universe = 532.8 * 3e17 = 1.5984e20.

So E1 ≈ 2610 / (1.5984e20) eV^2 m^{-1} * (s)^{-1}.

Wait, the units are getting a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the value numerically.

So,

E1 ≈ 2610 / (1.5984e20) = approximately 1.63e-17 eV^{-1} m s^{-1} ?

Hmm, this doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation.

The equation for Γ is:

Γ = σ * n * v.

σ is in cm², but let's think in m².

Wait, let me recompute the cross-section.

Wait, m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

α ≈ 1/137.

σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2.

Wait, let's compute σ in m².

E1 in eV, E2 in eV.

Wait, but let me express everything in SI units.

m_e = 9.11e-31 kg.

c = 3e8 m/s.

E_photon = h f, but perhaps better to use eV for energies.

But perhaps I can find a formula that relates E in eV to the cross-section in m².

But this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a standard expression for the photon-photon cross-section.

Wait, I found a reference that the cross-section for photon-photon pair production is given by σ ≈ 64 π^3 (E1 E2) / (m_e^4 c^8) * (1/(1 + cosθ))^2, but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, another source says that the cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is approximately σ = (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) (E1 E2), which is similar to what I had earlier.

So, let's proceed with that.

So, Γ ≈ σ n v.

v is the relative velocity. For photons moving in opposite directions, their relative velocity is approximately 2c, but perhaps in the lab frame where one photon is from the CMB and the other is the gamma, moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is 2c. But for calculation purposes, perhaps I should use v ≈ c.

No, wait, for two photons moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is actually not 2c; it's a bit tricky because in the center-of-momentum frame, but perhaps for order-of-magnitude estimates, we can take v ≈ c.

So, Γ = σ n c.

So now, σ = (8π/3) (α² / (m_e² c^4)) E1 E2.

So,

Γ = (8π/3) (α² / (m_e² c^4)) E1 E2 * n * c.

Simplify:

Γ = (8 π α² n E1 E2 c ) / (3 m_e² c^4 )

= (8 π α² n E1 E2 ) / (3 m_e² c^3 )

Then, the mean free time τ is 1/Γ:

τ = (3 m_e² c^3 ) / (8 π α² n E1 E2 )

We set τ equal to the age of the universe, t_universe ≈ 1e10 years.

Convert t_universe to seconds: 1e10 * 3.15e7 ≈ 3.15e17 s.

So,

(3 m_e² c^3 ) / (8 π α² n E1 E2 ) = 3.15e17 s

Solving for E1:

E1 = (3 m_e² c^3 ) / (8 π α² n E2 * 3.15e17 )

E1 = (3 m_e² c^3 ) / (8 π α² n E2 * 3.15e17 )

Now, plug in the numbers:

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c² = 0.511e6 * 1.602e-19 J/c².

Wait, perhaps better to compute m_e in kg.

m_e = 9.11e-31 kg.

c = 3e8 m/s.

n = 4e8 photons/m³.

E2 = 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 * 1.602e-19 J.

t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

Compute numerator: 3 m_e² c^3.

m_e² = (9.11e-31 kg)^2 ≈ 8.29e-61 kg².

c^3 = (3e8 m/s)^3 = 2.7e24 m³/s³.

So, numerator = 3 * 8.29e-61 kg² * 2.7e24 m³/s³ ≈ 3 * 8.29e-61 * 2.7e24 ≈ 3 * 2.2383e-36 kg² m³ / s³.

Wait, 8.29e-61 *2.7e24 = (8.29 * 2.7 )e(-61+24) = 22.383e-37 = 2.2383e-36.

Multiply by 3: 6.7149e-36 kg² m³/s³.

Denominator: 8 π α² n E2 * t_universe.

Compute each term:

8 π ≈25.1327.

α² ≈ (0.00729)^2 ≈ 5.31e-5.

n =4e8 photons/m³.

E2 =1e-3 eV = 1.602e-22 J (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1e-3 eV = 1.602e-22 J).

t_universe =3.15e17 s.

So,

Denominator = 25.1327 * 5.31e-5 *4e8 *1.602e-22 *3.15e17.

Let's compute step by step:

25.1327 *5.31e-5 ≈ 0.001333.

0.001333 *4e8 = 5.332e5.

5.332e5 *1.602e-22 ≈ 8.54e-17.

8.54e-17 *3.15e17 ≈ 26.92.

So denominator ≈26.92.

So,

E1 = numerator / denominator = 6.7149e-36 kg² m³/s³ / 26.92.

Wait, units may be getting complicated. Let's compute numerically.

E1 ≈ (6.7149e-36) / 26.92 ≈ 2.5e-37 kg² m³ / (s³ * ... ) Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of eV and compute E1 in eV.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use all units in eV and natural units.

Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute m_e² c^3 in eV² * (eV/c^2)^2 * c^3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute E1 in terms of known constants.

But perhaps I should recall that the energy E1 is given by the condition where the mean free path λ is about the size of the universe.

The mean free path λ = c τ.

And τ is the mean free time.

But perhaps I should compute the mean free path λ = 1/(n σ).

So, λ = 1/(n σ).

The condition for the mean free path to be comparable to the size of the universe is λ ≈ R_universe.

But the size of the universe is roughly c * t_universe.

So,

1/(n σ) ≈ c t_universe.

So,

σ ≈ 1/(n c t_universe).

But σ is also given by σ ≈ (8 π/3) (α²/(m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2.

So,

(8 π/3) (α²/(m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2 ≈ 1/(n c t_universe).

Solving for E1:

E1 ≈ (3/(8 π)) (m_e^2 c^4) / (α^2 E2) ) * (1/(n c t_universe)).

Hmm, let me plug in the numbers.

Compute each term:

3/(8 π) ≈ 0.119.

m_e^2 = (0.511e6 eV/c²)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² / c^4 = 2.61e11 eV² / c^4.

c^4 = (3e8 m/s)^4 = 8.1e32 m^4 / s^4.

n =4e8 photons/m³.

t_universe =3.15e17 s.

E2 =1e-3 eV.

So,

E1 ≈ 0.119 * (2.61e11 eV² / c^4) * c^4 / ( (1/137)^2 * 1e-3 eV ) ) * (1/(4e8 *3e8 *3.15e17)).

Wait, this might get a bit messy, but let me try to compute each part.

Wait, actually:

E1 = [ (3/(8 π)) * m_e^2 c^4 * 1/(α^2 E2) ) ] / (n c t_universe )

So,

= [ (3/(8 π)) * (m_e^2 c^4) ) / ( α^2 E2 ) ] / (n c t_universe )

Plugging in the numbers:

(3/(8 π)) ≈ 0.119.

m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV/c²)^2 * (3e8 m/s)^4.

Wait, but m_e^2 c^4 would have units (eV^2 c^0) because (m_e c^2)^2 is (eV)^2.

Wait, since m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, m_e^2 c^4 is (0.511 MeV)^2 = ~0.26 MeV².

So,

E1 ≈ (0.119 * 0.26e6 eV²) / ( (1/137)^2 * 1e-3 eV ) ) / (4e8 *3e8 *3.15e17 )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

0.119 * 0.26e6 eV² = 0.119 * 2.6e5 eV² ≈ 3.094e4 eV².

Denominator:

( (1/137)^2 ) * 1e-3 eV ) = (1.37e-4) * 1e-3 eV = 1.37e-7 eV.

So,

Numerator / denominator part: 3.094e4 eV² / 1.37e-7 eV = 3.094e4 / 1.37e-7 * eV.

3.094e4 / 1.37e-7 = (3.094 / 1.37 )e11 ≈ 2.258e11.

So, 2.258e11 eV.

Now, the other part of the denominator is n c t_universe = 4e8 *3e8 *3.15e17.

4e8 *3e8 = 1.2e17.

1.2e17 *3.15e17 = 3.78e34.

So,

E1 ≈ 2.258e11 eV / 3.78e34 ≈ 6.0e-24 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. That's way too low. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation E1 E2 ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 (t_universe n σ )^{-1}.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the GZK limit.

Wait! The Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit is about high-energy cosmic protons interacting with CMB photons. The GZK limit predicts that protons with energy above a certain threshold will interact with CMB photons to produce pions, limiting their flux from distant sources.

But in this problem, it's about gamma rays, but perhaps the approach is similar. The GZK cutoff is around 1e20 eV, but this problem is about gamma rays and pair production, so the energy threshold is different.

Wait, but perhaps the formula for the GZK limit can be adapted. The GZK energy is E ≈ 1e20 eV, which comes from E^2 ≈ (m_pi c^2)^2 ( t_universe c n_photon )^{-1}.

But in our case, it's E1 E2 ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 * (something involving the number density and time).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the photon-photon cross-section and the number density to find the energy where the interaction rate is high enough to limit the gamma's lifetime.

Let me try a different approach using the formula for the photon-photon cross-section and the interaction rate.

The cross-section is:

σ = (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e c^2)^2 ) (E1 E2) / c^4.

Wait, but I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, after some research, the cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e c^2 )^2 ) (E1 E2) / c^4.

Which simplifies to:

σ ≈ (8π α^2 E1 E2 )/(3 m_e^2 c^6).

But perhaps I should look for a standard expression.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the interaction probability as a function of energy.

The optical depth τ is given by τ = n σ λ, where λ is the mean free path. But in this case, τ is the probability of interaction in a certain distance.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, using the standard formula for the interaction length of a gamma ray.

The interaction length (X0) is given by X0 = 1/(n σ).

The interaction probability after traveling a distance L is P = 1 - e^{-L/X0} ≈ L/X0 for L ≈ X0.

The mean free time is τ = X0 / c.

So, for the gamma to have a significant chance of interacting (like P ≈ 1), L ≈ X0 ≈ c τ.

So, setting X0 ≈ c τ.

X0 = 1/(n σ) = c τ.

So,

n σ = 1/(c τ).

We can rearrange to find σ = 1/(n c τ).

But from the cross-section expression,

σ = (8π/3) (α^2/(m_e c^2)^2 ) E1 E2 / c^4.

Wait, perhaps I should plug in all the constants.

Let me compute sigma using the formula:

σ = (8π/3) * (α^2 / (m_e c^2)^2 ) * (E1 E2) / c^4.

Wait, but m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So,

σ = (8π/3) * (α^2) * E1 E2 / ( (0.511e6 eV)^2 ) / c^4.

Wait, but the units are getting confusing. Perhaps I should convert everything into SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use natural units where c=1 and eV is the energy unit.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to find the energy E1 where the interaction rate Γ is such that τ ≈ t_universe.

Earlier, we had:

τ ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ) = t_universe.

So,

E1 = (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 t_universe )

Plugging in the numbers:

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c².

c = 3e8 m/s.

n =4e8 photons/m³.

E2 =1e-3 eV.

t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute m_e^2 c^3:

m_e^2 = (0.511e6 eV/c² )^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² / c^4.

c^3 = (3e8 m/s )^3 = 2.7e24 m^3/s^3.

Multiply m_e^2 * c^3: (0.511e6)^2 * (2.7e24) (eV² m^3)/(c^4 s^3).

But perhaps I should compute the numerical value.

0.511e6 =5.11e5 eV.

(5.11e5)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

Multiply by 2.7e24 m^3/s^3: 2.61e11 * 2.7e24 = 6.047e35 eV² m^3/s^3.

So,

3 m_e² c^3 = 3 *6.047e35 ≈ 1.814e36 eV² m^3/s^3.

Denominator: 8 π α^2 n E2 t_universe.

Compute each term:

8 π ≈25.13.

α ≈1/137, so α²≈5.3e-5.

n=4e8.

E2=1e-3 eV.

t_universe=3.15e17 s.

Multiply them all:

25.13 *5.3e-5 =1.333e-3.

1.333e-3 *4e8 =5.333e5.

5.333e5 *1e-3 =533.3.

533.3 *3.15e17 =1.677e20.

So denominator ≈1.677e20.

So,

E1 = 1.814e36 / 1.677e20 ≈1.082e16 eV.

Convert eV to GeV: 1e9 eV =1 GeV.

So 1.082e16 eV =1.082e7 GeV.

Wait, but this is way lower than the options given. The options are around 1e5 GeV.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Let's recalculate.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations for the denominator.

Denominator =8 π α^2 n E2 t_universe.

8 π ≈25.13.

α^2≈5.3e-5.

n=4e8.

E2=1e-3 eV.

t_universe=3.15e17 s.

So,

25.13 *5.3e-5 = 0.001333.

0.001333 *4e8 = 5.333e5.

5.333e5 *1e-3 =533.3.

533.3 *3.15e17 =533.3 *3.15e17 = 1.677e20.

Yes, that's correct.

Numerator:1.814e36 eV² m^3/s^3.

Denominator:1.677e20.

So,

E1 =1.814e36 /1.677e20 ≈1.082e16 eV.

Which is 1.082e16 eV =1.082e7 GeV.

But the options are around 1e5 GeV.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for τ.

Wait, let's go back. Earlier, we had:

τ = (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ) = t_universe.

So, solving for E1:

E1 = (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 t_universe )

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of c in the denominator.

Wait, in the formula for τ, perhaps I should have included another c factor.

Wait, let's rederive the formula.

The interaction rate Γ is given by:

Γ = σ * n * v.

v is the relative velocity, which for photons moving in opposite directions is about c. But perhaps in natural units where c=1, this is easier.

But perhaps I should re-express the cross-section in terms of eV and other units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the mean free path.

The mean free path λ = 1/(n σ ).

In natural units (c=1), λ has units of eV^{-1}.

The energy of the gamma must be such that the mean free path is comparable to the size of the universe.

The size of the universe is approximately c * t_universe ≈ 3e8 m/s * 3e17 s =9e25 m.

But let me compute it in natural units (eV and inverse eV).

Wait, c in eV is about 1.97e23 eV m^{-1}.

So, c * t_universe = (1.97e23 eV m^{-1}) * (3e17 s ) * (1 m/s) ) → Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, the size of the universe in natural units (where c=1 and ℏ=1) is approximately t_universe in eV^{-1}.

Wait, since t_universe is 3e17 seconds, and 1 eV^{-1} is about 6.58e-16 seconds (since ℏ c ≈ 197 MeV fm, but perhaps using ℏ c ≈ 197.3e6 eV fm, and 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so 1 eV^{-1} ≈ 6.58e-16 s).

So,

t_universe ≈3e17 s = 3e17 /6.58e-16 eV^{-1} ≈4.56e32 eV^{-1}.

So, λ ≈ t_universe ≈4.56e32 eV^{-1}.

But λ =1/(n σ) in natural units.

So,

1/(n σ) ≈4.56e32 eV^{-1}.

So,

σ ≈1/(n *4.56e32 eV^{-1}) ) = (1/(4e8 m^{-3}) )^{-1} * 4.56e32 eV.

Wait, no, in natural units, n is in eV^3 (since 1 m^{-3} ≈ 1.2e48 eV^3, because in natural units, 1 m^{-1} ≈ 5.07e28 eV, so 1 m^{-3} = (5.07e28 eV)^3 ≈1.32e86 eV^3. So n=4e8 photons/m³ ≈4e8 *1.32e86 eV^3 = 5.28e94 eV^3.

So, n=5.28e94 eV^3.

Thus,

σ ≈1/(5.28e94 eV^3 *4.56e32 eV^{-1}) ) =1/(5.28e94 *4.56e32 ) eV^{-2}.

Wait, but 1/(eV^3 * eV^{-1}) )= eV^{-2}.

So,

σ ≈1/(2.4e127 ) eV^{-2} ≈4.16e-128 eV^{-2}.

But the cross-section for gamma-gamma pair production is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e c^2 )^2 ) (E1 E2 ) / c^4.

In natural units (c=1), this becomes:

σ ≈ (8π/3) α^2 (E1 E2 ) / (m_e^2 ).

Now, plugging in the numbers:

E1 E2 = E1 * 1e-3 eV.

So,

σ = (8π/3) * (1/137)^2 * (E1 * 1e-3 eV) / ( (0.511e6 eV )^2 )

= (8π/3) * 5.3e-5 * (E1 * 1e-3 ) / (0.261e12 ) eV^{-1}.

Compute the constants:

(8π/3) ≈8.37758.

8.37758 *5.3e-5 ≈4.44e-4.

Divided by 0.261e12 →4.44e-4 / 2.61e11 ≈1.70e-15.

So,

σ ≈1.70e-15 * E1 * 1e-3 eV^{-1}.

σ ≈1.70e-18 E1 eV^{-1}.

Set this equal to 4.16e-128 eV^{-2}.

So,

1.70e-18 E1 eV^{-1} =4.16e-128 eV^{-2}.

Multiply both sides by eV^2:

1.70e-18 E1 eV =4.16e-128.

Solve for E1:

E1 = (4.16e-128 ) / (1.70e-18 ) eV ≈2.45e-110 eV.

Wait, that's way too low. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should abandon this approach and think back to the cross-section expression.

Earlier, when I thought about the threshold condition, I found that E1 must be about 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C. But when I tried the detailed calculation, I got an E1 of around 1e7 GeV, which doesn't match the options. So likely, I made an error in the detailed calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interaction rate Γ is given by σ n v, but perhaps the correct expression for the cross-section is different.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the photon-photon cross-section as follows: σ = (4π/3) (α^2/m_e^4 c^8) (E1 E2).

Wait, let's proceed with this.

So, σ = (4π α² E1 E2) / (3 m_e^4 c^8).

Then,

Γ = σ n v.

v=c.

So,

Γ = (4 π α² E1 E2 )/(3 m_e^4 c^8 ) * n * c.

Γ = (4 π α² E1 E2 n )/(3 m_e^4 c^7 ).

The mean free time τ is 1/Γ.

So,

τ = 3 m_e^4 c^7 / (4 π α² E1 E2 n ).

Set τ = t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

So,

3 m_e^4 c^7 =4 π α² E1 E2 n t_universe.

Solving for E1:

E1 = 3 m_e^4 c^7 / (4 π α² E2 n t_universe ).

Now, plugging in the numbers:

m_e =0.511e6 eV.

c=3e8 m/s.

E2=1e-3 eV.

n=4e8 photons/m³.

t_universe=3.15e17 s.

Compute numerator:3 (0.511e6 eV )^4 (3e8 m/s )^7.

Let me compute each part step by step.

(0.511e6 eV)^4 = (0.511)^4 * (1e6)^4 eV^4.

0.511^4 ≈ (0.511)^2 =0.261, then squared is ~0.068.

So 0.068 * (1e6)^4 =0.068e24 eV^4.

(3e8 m/s )^7 =3^7 *1e56 m^7/s^7.

3^7=2187.

So 2187e56 m^7/s^7.

Multiply by 0.068e24 eV^4:

0.068e24 *2187e56 =0.068 *2187e80 eV^4 m^7/s^7.

0.068 *2187 ≈148. So 148e80 ≈1.48e82 eV^4 m^7/s^7.

Multiply by 3:3 *1.48e82 =4.44e82.

Denominator:4 π α² E2 n t_universe.

Compute each term:

4 π ≈12.566.

α²≈5.3e-5.

E2=1e-3 eV.

n=4e8.

t_universe=3.15e17 s.

So,

12.566 *5.3e-5 =6.657e-4.

6.657e-4 *1e-3=6.657e-7.

6.657e-7 *4e8=2.663e2.

2.663e2 *3.15e17=8.39e19.

So denominator ≈8.39e19.

Thus,

E1 =4.44e82 /8.39e19 =5.3e63 eV.

Wait, that's way too high. Clearly, I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I should realize that the correct approach is to use the threshold condition, which gave me E1≈2.6e5 GeV, which matches option C.

But when I tried the detailed rate approach, I got a different result. But perhaps the threshold calculation is sufficient, as the problem refers to the energy where the lifetime is limited by the process, implying that the interaction becomes significant at that energy.

Therefore, given that the product E1 E2 must be at least (m_e c^2 )^2, which gives E1= (m_e c^2 )^2 / E2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV )= (0.261e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV = 2.61e14 eV =2.61e5 GeV.

So the correct answer is C) 2.6e5 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the interaction of gamma rays with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Condition for Pair Production**:  
   The reaction $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ requires the center-of-mass energy to be at least $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass. For two photons with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$, the center-of-mass energy squared is given by:  
   \[
   s = 4E_1E_2.
   \]  
   The threshold condition is:  
   \[
   E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
   \]  
   Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, we find:  
   \[
   (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 \, \text{eV}^2 = 2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2.
   \]

2. **Solving for $E_1$**:  
   The energy of the CMB photon is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Using the threshold condition:  
   \[
   E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   E_1 \geq \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11}}{10^{-3}} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):  
   \[
   E_1 \geq 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

3. **Interpretation**:  
   The calculated energy corresponds to the threshold where the gamma-ray lifetime is limited by the interaction with CMB photons. This matches the energy scale of the process and aligns with the given options.

4. **Critical Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A ($9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$)**: Too low, as it does not satisfy the threshold condition.  
   - **Option B ($1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$)**: Close but slightly below the calculated threshold.  
   - **Option C ($2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$)**: Matches the calculated threshold energy.  
   - **Option D ($3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$)**: Exceeds the threshold unnecessarily.

Thus, the energy of gamma rays whose lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process is **$2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem about the interaction of high-energy gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The question is about finding the energy of gamma rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process where they annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, right, the reaction is gamma plus gamma giving e+ and e-. 

I remember that this process is a photon-photon interaction. The CMB is made of low-energy photons, so one of the gammas in the reaction would be the high-energy gamma, and the other would be a CMB photon. The average energy of CMB photons is given as 1e-3 eV. 

Wait, I think the process is called photon-photon pair production. The cross-section for this process is probably a factor here. The idea is that for a gamma-ray with energy E, the probability of it interacting with a CMB photon to produce electrons increases as E increases. So, at some point, the gamma's lifetime is so short because it interacts so often that we can't detect it anymore. Hence, the energy threshold where this interaction becomes significant would determine the limiting energy.

I recall that the mean free path of a particle is the average distance it travels before interacting. The mean free time is related to the inverse of the interaction rate. So, the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited by this interaction if the mean free path is shorter than the size of the universe or something like that.

But wait, the question is phrased as "from what energy would their lifetimes in the universe be limited by this process?" So, perhaps the gamma's lifetime is inversely proportional to the interaction probability times the photon density.

The interaction rate (Gamma) would be the product of the cross-section (σ), the relative velocity (v), and the number density of the target photons (n). So, Gamma ≈ σ * n * v. 

Hmm, since the CMB is isotropic and the gamma is a high-energy photon moving through space, the relative velocity would be approximately c, the speed of light. So v ≈ c.

The cross-section for photon-photon pair production is given by the formula σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (E_photon^2) / (E_gamma^2), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression. Wait, I think the cross-section for two photons of energy E1 and E2 is proportional to (E1 E2)/(m_e^2 c^4), but I might need to double-check that.

Wait, another approach: the photon-photon cross-section for pair production is known, and it depends on the product of the photon energies. For two photons, the cross-section σ is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (4π^2)) (E1 E2)/(m_e^2 c^4) ) ... Wait, perhaps I should look for the specific expression.

Alternatively, the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (4π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) (E1 E2). Wait, I'm a bit shaky on this. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is given by σ ≈ 64π^3/(3 m_e^4 c^8) * E1 E2 (E1 + E2), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the threshold condition.

Wait, the reaction γ + γ → e+ + e- can only proceed if the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c^2. The center-of-mass energy squared s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since both photons are moving in opposite directions in the lab frame (assuming head-on collision), their momenta are in opposite directions. So, p1 = E1/(c), p2 = E2/(c). Wait, for photons, E = pc, so for each photon, p = E/(c).

So, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/c) - (E2/c) )^2 c^2. Wait, because in the lab frame, the photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta are in opposite directions, so when computing the invariant s, it's (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

Wait, let's compute s:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - (- p2 c))^2. Wait, no, the four-momentum is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). So for two photons moving in opposite directions, say along the x-axis, their four-momenta would be (E1/c, E1/c, 0,0) and (E2/c, -E2/c, 0, 0). So when you add them, the total four-momentum is (E1 + E2)/c, (E1 - E2)/c, 0,0.

Then s is the square of the total four-momentum, multiplied by c^4:

s = ( (E1+E2)/c )^2 c^4 - ( (E1 - E2)/c )^2 c^4 * (direction squared, which is positive)
= (E1 + E2)^2 c^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 c^2
= [ (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 ] c^2
= [ (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ] c^2
= [4 E1 E2] c^2.

So s = 4 E1 E2 c^2. So the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2 c^2) = 2 c sqrt(E1 E2).

For the reaction to occur, the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2 m_e c^2. So:

2 c sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ 2 m_e c^2

Divide both sides by 2 c:

sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ m_e c^2

Square both sides:

E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Here, E1 is the gamma-ray energy, which is high, and E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is around 1e-3 eV.

Wait, but wait, I thought E1 was the gamma-ray photon, and E2 is the CMB photon. So in the problem, the gamma is high-energy, and the CMB photon is low-energy.

So substituting E2 as the CMB average energy, E_avg = 1e-3 eV.

So for the reaction to be possible, E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, but m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² ≈ 0.26e12 eV².

So E1 * E2 >= 0.26e12 eV².

Given that E2 is 1e-3 eV, solving for E1:

E1 >= (0.26e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.26e15 eV = 2.6e14 eV.

Wait, because 0.26e12 / 1e-3 = 0.26e15.

Wait, 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e8 GeV, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Wait no, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e5 GeV. Because 2.6e14 eV divided by 1e9 eV/GeV is 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, so E1 should be about 2.6e5 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

Hmm, so is that the answer? But wait, I think I might have missed a factor of 2 or so. Because wait, in the condition, we said that E1 E2 must be >= (m_e c^2)^2. So with E2 = 1e-3 eV, E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = (0.261e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV. So that's about 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

But wait, another point: in the calculation, I considered the threshold condition, so for the process to be possible, the energy product must be at least (m_e c^2)^2.

But the question is about the energy at which the gamma's lifetime is limited by this process. So perhaps it's not just the threshold, but the interaction rate.

Because the lifetime would be limited when the interaction probability is high enough that the gamma cannot travel far without interacting.

The mean free time τ is the inverse of the interaction rate Γ. So τ = 1/Γ.

The interaction rate Γ is given by the cross-section σ multiplied by the number density of the target photons n, multiplied by the relative velocity v.

In this case, the target photons are the CMB photons. The number density of CMB photons today is about n ≈ 400 cm^-3, or about 4e8 m^-3. Wait, let me think. The CMB photon density is approximately 411 photons per cm^3, which is about 4e8 photons per cubic meter. Because 1 cm^3 is 1e-6 m^3, so 411 photons/cm^3 = 411e6 photons/m^3.

So n ≈ 4e8 m^-3.

The cross-section for photon-photon pair production is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) (E1 E2) ), where α is the fine-structure constant (~1/137), and E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons. 

Wait, let me get the exact formula. The cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is approximately σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) (E1 E2) (something about their directions, but perhaps in the worst case, it's isotropic, so we can take the average).

So σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2.

But wait, I think the cross-section formula is dependent on the product of the photon energies. So, σ ≈ (8 π / 3) (α^2 / m_e^2 c^4) (E1 E2) (something else?), maybe a factor of (1 + cos^2(theta)) or something, but perhaps for an isotropic distribution, we can consider an average, which would involve a factor of 3/8 or similar. Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the formula.

But perhaps to get the interaction rate, I can write Γ = σ * n * v.

Since the gamma is moving at speed v ≈ c, and the CMB is isotropic, the relative velocity would be c.

So, Γ ≈ σ * n * c.

Substituting the σ expression:

Γ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2 ) * n * c.

Simplify:

Γ ≈ (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ) / (3 m_e^2 c^3 ).

Now, the lifetime τ is the inverse of Γ: τ = 1/Γ.

We can write τ = (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ).

But we need to find the gamma energy E1 where τ becomes comparable to the age of the universe. Because if τ is smaller than the age, the gamma would have time to annihilate.

Wait, the age of the universe is roughly t ≈ 1e10 years. Let's convert that into seconds: 1e10 * 3.15e7 ≈ 3e17 seconds.

So, setting τ ≈ t_universe, we have:

3 m_e^2 c^3 / (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ) ≈ 3e17 s.

We can solve for E1:

E1 ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 * 3e17 ) ) 

Wait, let's plug in the numbers:

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c² → 0.511e6 eV/c².

c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

n ≈ 4e8 photons/m^3.

E2 = 1e-3 eV.

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

So let's compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator: 3 m_e^2 c^3.

m_e^2 = (0.511e6 eV/c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2 / c^4.

Wait, but when multiplied by c^3, we have eV² c^−1.

Wait, let's compute the units later.

m_e^2 c^3 = ( (0.511e6 eV/c² )^2 ) * (3e8 m/s)^3.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV and meters.

But let's compute the actual value.

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c².

m_e^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² / c^4.

Multiply by c^3: m_e^2 c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² c^{-1}.

So m_e^2 c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 * (3e8 m/s) )^{-1} ?

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the value numerically.

Compute numerator:

3 m_e^2 c^3 = 3 * (0.511e6 eV/c²)^2 * (3e8 m/s)^3.

But perhaps I should express everything in eV and seconds.

Wait, eV is energy. c is in m/s.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using natural units where c=1 and eV is energy, but maybe not. Let me instead compute each part step by step.

Compute m_e^2 c^3:

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c².

m_e^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² / c^4.

Multiply by c^3: m_e^2 * c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 eV^2 / c.

So that's (0.511e6)^2 / (3e8 m/s) ) eV².

But perhaps I should compute this numerically in eV.

Wait, let me compute:

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c².

c = 3e8 m/s.

So m_e^2 c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 (eV^2) / c^4 * c^3 = (0.511e6)^2 eV^2 / c.

So, substituting c=3e8 m/s:

= (0.511e6)^2 / 3e8 m^{-1} eV^2.

Compute 0.511e6: 0.511e6 = 511,000 eV.

So (511,000)^2 = approximately (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

Divided by 3e8: 2.61e11 / 3e8 ≈ 8.7e2.

So m_e^2 c^3 = 8.7e2 eV^2 m^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, 0.511e6 is 511,000 eV.

(511,000)^2 = 511^2 * 1e6 * 1e6 = 261,121 * 1e12 = 2.61121e17 eV².

Wait, wait, 511,000 is 5.11e5. Squaring that is (5.11)^2 = ~26.11, times (1e5)^2 = 1e10. So 26.11e10 = 2.611e11 eV².

Ah, yes, so (511,000)^2 = 2.611e11 eV².

So m_e^2 c^3 = (2.611e11 eV²) / (3e8 m/s) ) = (2.611e11 / 3e8) eV² m^{-1}.

2.611e11 / 3e8 ≈ (2.611/3) * 1e3 = 0.87 * 1e3 ≈ 870.

So m_e^2 c^3 ≈ 870 eV² m^{-1}.

Now, the denominator: 8 π α^2 n E2.

Compute each term:

8 π ≈ 25.1327.

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729, so α^2 ≈ 0.000053.

n = 4e8 photons/m³.

E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So denominator = 25.1327 * (0.000053) * (4e8) * (1e-3).

Compute step by step:

25.1327 * 0.000053 ≈ 0.001332.

Then, 0.001332 * 4e8 = 0.001332 * 4e8 ≈ 5.328e5.

Then, 5.328e5 * 1e-3 = 532.8.

So denominator ≈ 532.8.

Putting it all together:

E1 ≈ (3 * 870 eV² m^{-1} ) / (532.8 * 3e17 s ).

Wait, wait the equation earlier was:

E1 ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 * 3e17 ) )

Wait, no, wait the equation after setting τ = t_universe is:

E1 ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 * 3e17 )

Wait, let me re-express:

E1 ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 * t_universe )

Where t_universe ≈ 3e17 s.

So substituting the numbers:

E1 ≈ (3 * 870 eV² m^{-1} ) / (532.8 * 3e17 s )

Wait, 3 * 870 = 2610.

Denominator: 532.8 * 3e17 ≈ 1.5984e20.

So E1 ≈ 2610 / 1.5984e20 eV² m^{-1} * eV^{-1} s.

Wait, units: eV² m^{-1} divided by eV gives eV m^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I should carry units more carefully.

Alternatively, let me compute the numerator and denominator as numbers.

Numerator: 3 * m_e^2 c^3 = 3 * 870 ≈ 2610 eV^2 m^{-1}.

Denominator: 8 π α^2 n E2 * t_universe = 532.8 * 3e17 = 1.5984e20.

So E1 ≈ 2610 / (1.5984e20) eV^2 m^{-1} * (s)^{-1}.

Wait, the units are getting a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the value numerically.

So,

E1 ≈ 2610 / (1.5984e20) = approximately 1.63e-17 eV^{-1} m s^{-1} ?

Hmm, this doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation.

The equation for Γ is:

Γ = σ * n * v.

σ is in cm², but let's think in m².

Wait, let me recompute the cross-section.

Wait, m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

α ≈ 1/137.

σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2.

Wait, let's compute σ in m².

E1 in eV, E2 in eV.

Wait, but let me express everything in SI units.

m_e = 9.11e-31 kg.

c = 3e8 m/s.

E_photon = h f, but perhaps better to use eV for energies.

But perhaps I can find a formula that relates E in eV to the cross-section in m².

But this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a standard expression for the photon-photon cross-section.

Wait, I found a reference that the cross-section for photon-photon pair production is given by σ ≈ 64 π^3 (E1 E2) / (m_e^4 c^8) * (1/(1 + cosθ))^2, but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, another source says that the cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is approximately σ = (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) (E1 E2), which is similar to what I had earlier.

So, let's proceed with that.

So, Γ ≈ σ n v.

v is the relative velocity. For photons moving in opposite directions, their relative velocity is approximately 2c, but perhaps in the lab frame where one photon is from the CMB and the other is the gamma, moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is 2c. But for calculation purposes, perhaps I should use v ≈ c.

No, wait, for two photons moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is actually not 2c; it's a bit tricky because in the center-of-momentum frame, but perhaps for order-of-magnitude estimates, we can take v ≈ c.

So, Γ = σ n c.

So now, σ = (8π/3) (α² / (m_e² c^4)) E1 E2.

So,

Γ = (8π/3) (α² / (m_e² c^4)) E1 E2 * n * c.

Simplify:

Γ = (8 π α² n E1 E2 c ) / (3 m_e² c^4 )

= (8 π α² n E1 E2 ) / (3 m_e² c^3 )

Then, the mean free time τ is 1/Γ:

τ = (3 m_e² c^3 ) / (8 π α² n E1 E2 )

We set τ equal to the age of the universe, t_universe ≈ 1e10 years.

Convert t_universe to seconds: 1e10 * 3.15e7 ≈ 3.15e17 s.

So,

(3 m_e² c^3 ) / (8 π α² n E1 E2 ) = 3.15e17 s

Solving for E1:

E1 = (3 m_e² c^3 ) / (8 π α² n E2 * 3.15e17 )

E1 = (3 m_e² c^3 ) / (8 π α² n E2 * 3.15e17 )

Now, plug in the numbers:

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c² = 0.511e6 * 1.602e-19 J/c².

Wait, perhaps better to compute m_e in kg.

m_e = 9.11e-31 kg.

c = 3e8 m/s.

n = 4e8 photons/m³.

E2 = 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 * 1.602e-19 J.

t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

Compute numerator: 3 m_e² c^3.

m_e² = (9.11e-31 kg)^2 ≈ 8.29e-61 kg².

c^3 = (3e8 m/s)^3 = 2.7e24 m³/s³.

So, numerator = 3 * 8.29e-61 kg² * 2.7e24 m³/s³ ≈ 3 * 8.29e-61 * 2.7e24 ≈ 3 * 2.2383e-36 kg² m³ / s³.

Wait, 8.29e-61 *2.7e24 = (8.29 * 2.7 )e(-61+24) = 22.383e-37 = 2.2383e-36.

Multiply by 3: 6.7149e-36 kg² m³/s³.

Denominator: 8 π α² n E2 * t_universe.

Compute each term:

8 π ≈25.1327.

α² ≈ (0.00729)^2 ≈ 5.31e-5.

n =4e8 photons/m³.

E2 =1e-3 eV = 1.602e-22 J (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1e-3 eV = 1.602e-22 J).

t_universe =3.15e17 s.

So,

Denominator = 25.1327 * 5.31e-5 *4e8 *1.602e-22 *3.15e17.

Let's compute step by step:

25.1327 *5.31e-5 ≈ 0.001333.

0.001333 *4e8 = 5.332e5.

5.332e5 *1.602e-22 ≈ 8.54e-17.

8.54e-17 *3.15e17 ≈ 26.92.

So denominator ≈26.92.

So,

E1 = numerator / denominator = 6.7149e-36 kg² m³/s³ / 26.92.

Wait, units may be getting complicated. Let's compute numerically.

E1 ≈ (6.7149e-36) / 26.92 ≈ 2.5e-37 kg² m³ / (s³ * ... ) Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of eV and compute E1 in eV.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use all units in eV and natural units.

Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute m_e² c^3 in eV² * (eV/c^2)^2 * c^3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute E1 in terms of known constants.

But perhaps I should recall that the energy E1 is given by the condition where the mean free path λ is about the size of the universe.

The mean free path λ = c τ.

And τ is the mean free time.

But perhaps I should compute the mean free path λ = 1/(n σ).

So, λ = 1/(n σ).

The condition for the mean free path to be comparable to the size of the universe is λ ≈ R_universe.

But the size of the universe is roughly c * t_universe.

So,

1/(n σ) ≈ c t_universe.

So,

σ ≈ 1/(n c t_universe).

But σ is also given by σ ≈ (8 π/3) (α²/(m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2.

So,

(8 π/3) (α²/(m_e^2 c^4)) E1 E2 ≈ 1/(n c t_universe).

Solving for E1:

E1 ≈ (3/(8 π)) (m_e^2 c^4) / (α^2 E2) ) * (1/(n c t_universe)).

Hmm, let me plug in the numbers.

Compute each term:

3/(8 π) ≈ 0.119.

m_e^2 = (0.511e6 eV/c²)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² / c^4 = 2.61e11 eV² / c^4.

c^4 = (3e8 m/s)^4 = 8.1e32 m^4 / s^4.

n =4e8 photons/m³.

t_universe =3.15e17 s.

E2 =1e-3 eV.

So,

E1 ≈ 0.119 * (2.61e11 eV² / c^4) * c^4 / ( (1/137)^2 * 1e-3 eV ) ) * (1/(4e8 *3e8 *3.15e17)).

Wait, this might get a bit messy, but let me try to compute each part.

Wait, actually:

E1 = [ (3/(8 π)) * m_e^2 c^4 * 1/(α^2 E2) ) ] / (n c t_universe )

So,

= [ (3/(8 π)) * (m_e^2 c^4) ) / ( α^2 E2 ) ] / (n c t_universe )

Plugging in the numbers:

(3/(8 π)) ≈ 0.119.

m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV/c²)^2 * (3e8 m/s)^4.

Wait, but m_e^2 c^4 would have units (eV^2 c^0) because (m_e c^2)^2 is (eV)^2.

Wait, since m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, m_e^2 c^4 is (0.511 MeV)^2 = ~0.26 MeV².

So,

E1 ≈ (0.119 * 0.26e6 eV²) / ( (1/137)^2 * 1e-3 eV ) ) / (4e8 *3e8 *3.15e17 )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

0.119 * 0.26e6 eV² = 0.119 * 2.6e5 eV² ≈ 3.094e4 eV².

Denominator:

( (1/137)^2 ) * 1e-3 eV ) = (1.37e-4) * 1e-3 eV = 1.37e-7 eV.

So,

Numerator / denominator part: 3.094e4 eV² / 1.37e-7 eV = 3.094e4 / 1.37e-7 * eV.

3.094e4 / 1.37e-7 = (3.094 / 1.37 )e11 ≈ 2.258e11.

So, 2.258e11 eV.

Now, the other part of the denominator is n c t_universe = 4e8 *3e8 *3.15e17.

4e8 *3e8 = 1.2e17.

1.2e17 *3.15e17 = 3.78e34.

So,

E1 ≈ 2.258e11 eV / 3.78e34 ≈ 6.0e-24 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. That's way too low. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation E1 E2 ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 (t_universe n σ )^{-1}.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the GZK limit.

Wait! The Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit is about high-energy cosmic protons interacting with CMB photons. The GZK limit predicts that protons with energy above a certain threshold will interact with CMB photons to produce pions, limiting their flux from distant sources.

But in this problem, it's about gamma rays, but perhaps the approach is similar. The GZK cutoff is around 1e20 eV, but this problem is about gamma rays and pair production, so the energy threshold is different.

Wait, but perhaps the formula for the GZK limit can be adapted. The GZK energy is E ≈ 1e20 eV, which comes from E^2 ≈ (m_pi c^2)^2 ( t_universe c n_photon )^{-1}.

But in our case, it's E1 E2 ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 * (something involving the number density and time).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the photon-photon cross-section and the number density to find the energy where the interaction rate is high enough to limit the gamma's lifetime.

Let me try a different approach using the formula for the photon-photon cross-section and the interaction rate.

The cross-section is:

σ = (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e c^2)^2 ) (E1 E2) / c^4.

Wait, but I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, after some research, the cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e c^2 )^2 ) (E1 E2) / c^4.

Which simplifies to:

σ ≈ (8π α^2 E1 E2 )/(3 m_e^2 c^6).

But perhaps I should look for a standard expression.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the interaction probability as a function of energy.

The optical depth τ is given by τ = n σ λ, where λ is the mean free path. But in this case, τ is the probability of interaction in a certain distance.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, using the standard formula for the interaction length of a gamma ray.

The interaction length (X0) is given by X0 = 1/(n σ).

The interaction probability after traveling a distance L is P = 1 - e^{-L/X0} ≈ L/X0 for L ≈ X0.

The mean free time is τ = X0 / c.

So, for the gamma to have a significant chance of interacting (like P ≈ 1), L ≈ X0 ≈ c τ.

So, setting X0 ≈ c τ.

X0 = 1/(n σ) = c τ.

So,

n σ = 1/(c τ).

We can rearrange to find σ = 1/(n c τ).

But from the cross-section expression,

σ = (8π/3) (α^2/(m_e c^2)^2 ) E1 E2 / c^4.

Wait, perhaps I should plug in all the constants.

Let me compute sigma using the formula:

σ = (8π/3) * (α^2 / (m_e c^2)^2 ) * (E1 E2) / c^4.

Wait, but m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So,

σ = (8π/3) * (α^2) * E1 E2 / ( (0.511e6 eV)^2 ) / c^4.

Wait, but the units are getting confusing. Perhaps I should convert everything into SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use natural units where c=1 and eV is the energy unit.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to find the energy E1 where the interaction rate Γ is such that τ ≈ t_universe.

Earlier, we had:

τ ≈ (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ) = t_universe.

So,

E1 = (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 t_universe )

Plugging in the numbers:

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c².

c = 3e8 m/s.

n =4e8 photons/m³.

E2 =1e-3 eV.

t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute m_e^2 c^3:

m_e^2 = (0.511e6 eV/c² )^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² / c^4.

c^3 = (3e8 m/s )^3 = 2.7e24 m^3/s^3.

Multiply m_e^2 * c^3: (0.511e6)^2 * (2.7e24) (eV² m^3)/(c^4 s^3).

But perhaps I should compute the numerical value.

0.511e6 =5.11e5 eV.

(5.11e5)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

Multiply by 2.7e24 m^3/s^3: 2.61e11 * 2.7e24 = 6.047e35 eV² m^3/s^3.

So,

3 m_e² c^3 = 3 *6.047e35 ≈ 1.814e36 eV² m^3/s^3.

Denominator: 8 π α^2 n E2 t_universe.

Compute each term:

8 π ≈25.13.

α ≈1/137, so α²≈5.3e-5.

n=4e8.

E2=1e-3 eV.

t_universe=3.15e17 s.

Multiply them all:

25.13 *5.3e-5 =1.333e-3.

1.333e-3 *4e8 =5.333e5.

5.333e5 *1e-3 =533.3.

533.3 *3.15e17 =1.677e20.

So denominator ≈1.677e20.

So,

E1 = 1.814e36 / 1.677e20 ≈1.082e16 eV.

Convert eV to GeV: 1e9 eV =1 GeV.

So 1.082e16 eV =1.082e7 GeV.

Wait, but this is way lower than the options given. The options are around 1e5 GeV.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Let's recalculate.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations for the denominator.

Denominator =8 π α^2 n E2 t_universe.

8 π ≈25.13.

α^2≈5.3e-5.

n=4e8.

E2=1e-3 eV.

t_universe=3.15e17 s.

So,

25.13 *5.3e-5 = 0.001333.

0.001333 *4e8 = 5.333e5.

5.333e5 *1e-3 =533.3.

533.3 *3.15e17 =533.3 *3.15e17 = 1.677e20.

Yes, that's correct.

Numerator:1.814e36 eV² m^3/s^3.

Denominator:1.677e20.

So,

E1 =1.814e36 /1.677e20 ≈1.082e16 eV.

Which is 1.082e16 eV =1.082e7 GeV.

But the options are around 1e5 GeV.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for τ.

Wait, let's go back. Earlier, we had:

τ = (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E1 E2 ) = t_universe.

So, solving for E1:

E1 = (3 m_e^2 c^3 ) / (8 π α^2 n E2 t_universe )

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of c in the denominator.

Wait, in the formula for τ, perhaps I should have included another c factor.

Wait, let's rederive the formula.

The interaction rate Γ is given by:

Γ = σ * n * v.

v is the relative velocity, which for photons moving in opposite directions is about c. But perhaps in natural units where c=1, this is easier.

But perhaps I should re-express the cross-section in terms of eV and other units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the mean free path.

The mean free path λ = 1/(n σ ).

In natural units (c=1), λ has units of eV^{-1}.

The energy of the gamma must be such that the mean free path is comparable to the size of the universe.

The size of the universe is approximately c * t_universe ≈ 3e8 m/s * 3e17 s =9e25 m.

But let me compute it in natural units (eV and inverse eV).

Wait, c in eV is about 1.97e23 eV m^{-1}.

So, c * t_universe = (1.97e23 eV m^{-1}) * (3e17 s ) * (1 m/s) ) → Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, the size of the universe in natural units (where c=1 and ℏ=1) is approximately t_universe in eV^{-1}.

Wait, since t_universe is 3e17 seconds, and 1 eV^{-1} is about 6.58e-16 seconds (since ℏ c ≈ 197 MeV fm, but perhaps using ℏ c ≈ 197.3e6 eV fm, and 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so 1 eV^{-1} ≈ 6.58e-16 s).

So,

t_universe ≈3e17 s = 3e17 /6.58e-16 eV^{-1} ≈4.56e32 eV^{-1}.

So, λ ≈ t_universe ≈4.56e32 eV^{-1}.

But λ =1/(n σ) in natural units.

So,

1/(n σ) ≈4.56e32 eV^{-1}.

So,

σ ≈1/(n *4.56e32 eV^{-1}) ) = (1/(4e8 m^{-3}) )^{-1} * 4.56e32 eV.

Wait, no, in natural units, n is in eV^3 (since 1 m^{-3} ≈ 1.2e48 eV^3, because in natural units, 1 m^{-1} ≈ 5.07e28 eV, so 1 m^{-3} = (5.07e28 eV)^3 ≈1.32e86 eV^3. So n=4e8 photons/m³ ≈4e8 *1.32e86 eV^3 = 5.28e94 eV^3.

So, n=5.28e94 eV^3.

Thus,

σ ≈1/(5.28e94 eV^3 *4.56e32 eV^{-1}) ) =1/(5.28e94 *4.56e32 ) eV^{-2}.

Wait, but 1/(eV^3 * eV^{-1}) )= eV^{-2}.

So,

σ ≈1/(2.4e127 ) eV^{-2} ≈4.16e-128 eV^{-2}.

But the cross-section for gamma-gamma pair production is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (m_e c^2 )^2 ) (E1 E2 ) / c^4.

In natural units (c=1), this becomes:

σ ≈ (8π/3) α^2 (E1 E2 ) / (m_e^2 ).

Now, plugging in the numbers:

E1 E2 = E1 * 1e-3 eV.

So,

σ = (8π/3) * (1/137)^2 * (E1 * 1e-3 eV) / ( (0.511e6 eV )^2 )

= (8π/3) * 5.3e-5 * (E1 * 1e-3 ) / (0.261e12 ) eV^{-1}.

Compute the constants:

(8π/3) ≈8.37758.

8.37758 *5.3e-5 ≈4.44e-4.

Divided by 0.261e12 →4.44e-4 / 2.61e11 ≈1.70e-15.

So,

σ ≈1.70e-15 * E1 * 1e-3 eV^{-1}.

σ ≈1.70e-18 E1 eV^{-1}.

Set this equal to 4.16e-128 eV^{-2}.

So,

1.70e-18 E1 eV^{-1} =4.16e-128 eV^{-2}.

Multiply both sides by eV^2:

1.70e-18 E1 eV =4.16e-128.

Solve for E1:

E1 = (4.16e-128 ) / (1.70e-18 ) eV ≈2.45e-110 eV.

Wait, that's way too low. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should abandon this approach and think back to the cross-section expression.

Earlier, when I thought about the threshold condition, I found that E1 must be about 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C. But when I tried the detailed calculation, I got an E1 of around 1e7 GeV, which doesn't match the options. So likely, I made an error in the detailed calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interaction rate Γ is given by σ n v, but perhaps the correct expression for the cross-section is different.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the photon-photon cross-section as follows: σ = (4π/3) (α^2/m_e^4 c^8) (E1 E2).

Wait, let's proceed with this.

So, σ = (4π α² E1 E2) / (3 m_e^4 c^8).

Then,

Γ = σ n v.

v=c.

So,

Γ = (4 π α² E1 E2 )/(3 m_e^4 c^8 ) * n * c.

Γ = (4 π α² E1 E2 n )/(3 m_e^4 c^7 ).

The mean free time τ is 1/Γ.

So,

τ = 3 m_e^4 c^7 / (4 π α² E1 E2 n ).

Set τ = t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

So,

3 m_e^4 c^7 =4 π α² E1 E2 n t_universe.

Solving for E1:

E1 = 3 m_e^4 c^7 / (4 π α² E2 n t_universe ).

Now, plugging in the numbers:

m_e =0.511e6 eV.

c=3e8 m/s.

E2=1e-3 eV.

n=4e8 photons/m³.

t_universe=3.15e17 s.

Compute numerator:3 (0.511e6 eV )^4 (3e8 m/s )^7.

Let me compute each part step by step.

(0.511e6 eV)^4 = (0.511)^4 * (1e6)^4 eV^4.

0.511^4 ≈ (0.511)^2 =0.261, then squared is ~0.068.

So 0.068 * (1e6)^4 =0.068e24 eV^4.

(3e8 m/s )^7 =3^7 *1e56 m^7/s^7.

3^7=2187.

So 2187e56 m^7/s^7.

Multiply by 0.068e24 eV^4:

0.068e24 *2187e56 =0.068 *2187e80 eV^4 m^7/s^7.

0.068 *2187 ≈148. So 148e80 ≈1.48e82 eV^4 m^7/s^7.

Multiply by 3:3 *1.48e82 =4.44e82.

Denominator:4 π α² E2 n t_universe.

Compute each term:

4 π ≈12.566.

α²≈5.3e-5.

E2=1e-3 eV.

n=4e8.

t_universe=3.15e17 s.

So,

12.566 *5.3e-5 =6.657e-4.

6.657e-4 *1e-3=6.657e-7.

6.657e-7 *4e8=2.663e2.

2.663e2 *3.15e17=8.39e19.

So denominator ≈8.39e19.

Thus,

E1 =4.44e82 /8.39e19 =5.3e63 eV.

Wait, that's way too high. Clearly, I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I should realize that the correct approach is to use the threshold condition, which gave me E1≈2.6e5 GeV, which matches option C.

But when I tried the detailed rate approach, I got a different result. But perhaps the threshold calculation is sufficient, as the problem refers to the energy where the lifetime is limited by the process, implying that the interaction becomes significant at that energy.

Therefore, given that the product E1 E2 must be at least (m_e c^2 )^2, which gives E1= (m_e c^2 )^2 / E2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV )= (0.261e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV = 2.61e14 eV =2.61e5 GeV.

So the correct answer is C) 2.6e5 GeV.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the interaction of gamma rays with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Condition for Pair Production**:  
   The reaction $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ requires the center-of-mass energy to be at least $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass. For two photons with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$, the center-of-mass energy squared is given by:  
   \[
   s = 4E_1E_2.
   \]  
   The threshold condition is:  
   \[
   E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
   \]  
   Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, we find:  
   \[
   (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 \, \text{eV}^2 = 2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2.
   \]

2. **Solving for $E_1$**:  
   The energy of the CMB photon is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Using the threshold condition:  
   \[
   E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   E_1 \geq \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11}}{10^{-3}} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):  
   \[
   E_1 \geq 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

3. **Interpretation**:  
   The calculated energy corresponds to the threshold where the gamma-ray lifetime is limited by the interaction with CMB photons. This matches the energy scale of the process and aligns with the given options.

4. **Critical Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A ($9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$)**: Too low, as it does not satisfy the threshold condition.  
   - **Option B ($1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$)**: Close but slightly below the calculated threshold.  
   - **Option C ($2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$)**: Matches the calculated threshold energy.  
   - **Option D ($3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$)**: Exceeds the threshold unnecessarily.

Thus, the energy of gamma rays whose lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process is **$2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.
