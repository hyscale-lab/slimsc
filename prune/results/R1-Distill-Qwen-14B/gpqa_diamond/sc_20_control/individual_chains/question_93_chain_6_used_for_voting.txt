Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the question says that a scientist is setting up a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers, diluted it in serial dilutions, and ran three technical replicates each time. The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means that each cycle doubles the target. The R² is 1, so the data fits perfectly, and the slope is -3.3.

The data shows that as the copy number decreases (from 100,000 down to 10), the Ct values increase. Wait, no, actually, when you have more copies, you reach the threshold faster, so lower Ct. Oh right, higher copy number means lower Ct. Like, if you have a million copies, it takes fewer cycles to detect it than if you have a thousand.

Looking at the results: at 100,000 copies, the Ct is around 34. At 10,000, it's about 30.6, and so on. Each tenfold dilution (like from 100,000 to 10,000 is a tenfold decrease) increases the Ct by about 3.3. Let me check: 33.9 minus 30.6 is about 3.3. Oh wait, the slope is -3.3. I think the formula for a qPCR calibration curve is something like Ct = slope * log(copy number) + intercept. So the slope being -3.3 makes sense because each tenfold increase in copies would decrease Ct by 3.3.

But wait, the question is about the discrepancies in the results. The options are A to D. Let me read them again.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. No, that's not right because the data looks consistent and qPCR is used for quantification.

Option B: Ct values don't agree with target nucleic acid amounts. But in the data, each dilution step (10-fold) leads to an increase in Ct by about 3.3, which is what's expected. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, the slope is -3.3, which aligns with a 10-fold dilution corresponding to a 3.3 increase in Ct. So this option seems to suggest that the dilution is causing more cycles than expected, but here it's exactly matching. So maybe this isn't the right answer.

Option D: The deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3. Looking at the data, each replicate's Ct values vary by about 0.3 (like 33.9, 34.2, 34.5: max difference is 0.6). So the deviation is within 0.6, which is more than 0.3. But wait, is that a problem? I think technical replicates should have a small variation, but I'm not sure about the exact cutoff. Oh, but the options are explaining the discrepancies. So if the replicates have high variation, that could indicate an issue.

Wait, but the question is asking which option explains the discrepancies in his results. So what are the discrepancies? The results are as expected based on the dilutions, but perhaps the within-replicate variation is an issue.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the Ct values are too variable between replicates. For example, looking at the 100,000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The range is 0.6. Is that too much? I think for technical replicates, the Ct values should be very close, like within 0.3 cycles. Because technical variability is usually low. So if the replicates vary more than that, it could indicate a problem.

So in this case, the deviation between some replicates is more than 0.3. Each set has a variation of about 0.3-0.6, which is more than 0.3. So that's a discrepancy. So option D says the deviation is more than 0.3, which is correct.

Wait, but what about option C? The slope is -3.3, which is correct for 10-fold dilutions. Oh wait, the slope in the equation is (−3.322) * log10 (DNA copies/μL) + 34.489, or something like that? No, wait, the slope is the change in Ct per log change in copy number. So a slope of -3.3 means that a 10-fold increase in copies (log10(10)=1) causes a decrease of 3.3 in Ct. Which is correct. So option C is incorrect because the ten-fold dilution is exactly 3.3 cycles, which matches the slope.

So the problem must be in the technical replicates' variability. So the correct answer is D because the deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results." So the scientist's results are showing that each dilution's Ct is increasing by about 3.3, which is correct. The efficiency is 100%, so each cycle doubles the DNA. So his data is correct, but the options are about why there are discrepancies.

Wait, maybe the 'discrepancies' refer to the variation between technical replicates. Oh, looking at the data, each set has three replicates. Let's calculate the standard deviation or the range. For 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The range is 0.6, which is more than 0.3. So option D says the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates, which is the case here. So yes, that's a problem. High variability between technical replicates indicates possible issues with the qPCR setup, like inconsistent sample addition or instrument variability.

So the correct answer is D.

The question involves analyzing discrepancies in qPCR results where the scientist used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran serially diluted samples in three technical replicates. The qPCR efficiency was 100%, with an R² of 1 and a slope of -3.3. The Ct values increased as the copy number decreased, consistent with a 10-fold dilution corresponding to a 3.3 increase in Ct. However, the technical replicates showed deviations in Ct values.

Key points of analysis:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. qPCR is a valid method for quantifying nucleic acids, and the data appears consistent with expected trends.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The Ct values align with the expected relationship to the amount of target nucleic acid, as shown by the perfect R² and the slope of -3.3.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The slope of -3.3 indicates that a 10-fold dilution corresponds to a 3.3 increase in Ct, which is consistent with expectations. There is no discrepancy here.
- **Option D**: Correct. The deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3 cycles. For example, at 100,000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, and 34.5, with a range of 0.6. Such variability is higher than the expected 0.3 cycles for technical replicates, indicating a potential issue with the qPCR setup or sample handling.

The correct explanation for the discrepancies in the results is the variability between technical replicates exceeding 0.3 cycles.
