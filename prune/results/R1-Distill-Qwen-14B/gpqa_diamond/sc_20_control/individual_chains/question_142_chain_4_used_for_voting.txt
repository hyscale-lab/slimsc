Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that the density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, ρ is a density matrix, which should be a Hermitian positive semi-definite matrix with trace equal to 1.

Wait, what's the structure of a qubit's density matrix? Oh right, a qubit is a two-level system. So any density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in three-dimensional space (the Bloch vector). So the Bloch vector r=(x,y,z) determines where the state is located on the Bloch sphere.

Right, so in this case, ρ is given as (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute this. Let's expand |0><0| and |1><1|. |0> is the vector [1; 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these together gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives ρ = [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]]. Oh, wait, that's the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5 because I + something else? Wait, the identity matrix for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]], so multiplying by 0.5 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2.

So comparing this to the general form: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. If I subtract I/2 from both sides, I get (r·σ)/2 = ρ - I/2. But since ρ is I/2, subtracting I/2 gives zero. So r·σ = 0. The only way this is possible is if r is the zero vector. Because if r is zero, then the equation holds.

Wait, let me make sure. The equation is (I + r·σ)/2 = ρ. So substituting ρ as given, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 = I/2. So (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I + r·σ = I. Subtract I: r·σ = 0. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The only way their linear combination equals zero is if all coefficients are zero. So r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So r is (0,0,0).

So the Bloch vector is at the origin. Which would correspond to the completely mixed state, meaning it's equally likely to be in state |0> or |1>. That makes sense because the density matrix ρ has equal probabilities for both states.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer is C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

For a qubit, the general form of a density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), we note that \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), as \(\rho\) simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). The only solution to this equation is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, where the qubit is equally likely to be in either state \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\).

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to option C.
