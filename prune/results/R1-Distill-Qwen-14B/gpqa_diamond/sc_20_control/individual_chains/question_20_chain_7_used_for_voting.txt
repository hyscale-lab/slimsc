Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation, where nucleons are treated as free particles. The options are four statements, and I need to pick the right combination.

First, let me recall what the impulse approximation entails. From what I remember, the impulse approximation is used in nuclear physics when considering interactions like the electroweak force. The basic idea is that each nucleon in the nucleus behaves as if it's free, unaffected by the others except for a brief, strong interaction. So the other nucleons are treated as part of a sort of "mean field" that doesn't significantly influence the interacting nucleon during the interaction.

Now, the question lists four assumptions, and I need to determine which three together imply this approximation. Let's look at each statement one by one.

Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. That sounds right because in the impulse approximation, each nucleon interacts individually, not collectively. So if the current only interacts with each nucleon separately, that fits with the approximation.

Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this. Transparency usually refers to whether other particles can pass through without being affected. If the nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon, that might imply that other nucleons don't affect the interaction, which would support the idea of treating them as free. So this statement could be part of the assumptions.

Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, quarks are confined within nucleons, and their motion is relativistic in the nucleon. But if they were non-relativistic, maybe that simplifies the treatment. But how does this relate to the impulse approximation? The impulse approximation is more about the interaction with the nucleus as a whole. If quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps it's a separate assumption about the internal structure of the nucleon, not directly about their interaction with others. I'm not sure if this is part of the impulse approximation assumptions.

Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh yeah, that makes sense. In the impulse approximation, the binding forces between nucleons are ignored during the interaction. So the nucleon is treated as if it's free—no binding forces are acting on it during the interaction. So statement 4 is definitely part of the assumptions.

Now, the question is which three of these four are needed. Let's think about each option.

Option A is 1,2,4. So that includes statements about the current acting on individual nucleons, the nucleus being transparent except for one, and no binding forces. That seems to fit: each nucleon is individually hit, others don't contribute, and the nucleon isn't bound during the interaction.

Option B is 2,3,4. This includes the transparency, quarks non-relativistic, and no binding. I don't think the quarks being non-relativistic is part of the impulse approximation's assumptions; that seems more like a separate approximation about the nucleon's internal state, not about their interactions with others.

Option C is 1,2,3. So individual interaction, nucleus transparent, quarks non-relativ. Not sure why quarks would matter here. Maybe not.

Option D is 1,3,4. So individual interaction, quarks non-relativistic, no binding. Again, the quarks part doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, but why would statement 3 be included in any option? Because the impulse approximation is about the behavior of nucleons in interactions, not about their internal quark dynamics. So I think statement 3 isn't part of the assumptions for the impulse approximation.

So the correct combination would include statements 1, 2, and 4. That's option A.

Let me check again. 

Impulse approximation assumes:

- Each nucleon interacts individually (statement 1).
- Other nucleons don't affect the interaction—so the nucleus is transparent except for the selected one (statement 2).
- The nucleon is treated as free, so no binding forces (statement 4).

Statement 3 is about quarks, which isn't directly related. So the correct option is A.

The impulse approximation in nuclear physics assumes that nucleons behave as free particles during interactions, neglecting their binding forces and treating the nucleus as a transparent medium except for the interacting nucleon. Let us analyze the given assumptions:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This aligns with the impulse approximation, as each nucleon is treated as interacting independently.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This supports the approximation, as it implies that other nucleons do not significantly influence the interaction.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: This assumption pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon and is unrelated to the impulse approximation, which focuses on the interaction dynamics rather than the nucleon's internal quark dynamics.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This is a key assumption of the impulse approximation, as it neglects the binding forces between nucleons during the interaction.

From this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are statements 1, 2, and 4. Statement 3 is not relevant to the impulse approximation and can be excluded.

**Conclusion**: The correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4, which corresponds to option A.
