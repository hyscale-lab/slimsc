Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember from my electromagnetism class that divergence and Gauss's law are involved in these kinds of problems. 

The question says that the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. So the field is directed outward (I think) and its magnitude is f(r) = 1/r². I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, the volume integral of the divergence is essentially applying the divergence theorem. Oh right, the divergence theorem relates the flux through a closed surface to the volume integral of the divergence inside that surface. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

Wait, but the problem asks for the integral of the divergence, which by Gauss's law is the same as the flux through the surface. But wait, isn't Gauss's law specifically for electric fields and charge distributions? Maybe the same principle applies here regardless of what the field is.

Let me think about the divergence of this field. Since the field is only radial, in spherical coordinates, the divergence might be easier to compute. I remember that for a vector field A(r) with only a radial component, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r). So in this case, A_r is 1/r², right?

So let's compute ∇·f. Let f(r) be the vector field. Since it's radial and only has a radial component, f = f_r r̂. So the divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Plugging in f_r = 1/r²:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ] = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = (1/r²)(0) = 0.

Wait, that's zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin? Because when r approaches zero, the field might not be defined properly. But the problem says the field falls off as 1/r² from the origin, which implies that at r=0, it's not defined. But the integral is over the volume inside radius R. If the divergence is zero except possibly at r=0, then the integral would be zero except for a point. But in volume integrals, a single point contributes nothing because it's measure zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because I remember Gauss's law, which says the flux through a closed surface is Q_enc / ε0. If the divergence is zero, then the flux would be zero, meaning there's no enclosed charge, for example. But wait, in this problem, the vector field isn't necessarily an electric field, but the divergence calculation seems to lead to zero.

Hmm, but wait. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the divergence. Let me go through the steps again.

f = (1/r²) r̂. So A_r = 1/r².

The divergence in spherical coordinates for a purely radial field is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r). So substituting:

(1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

Yes, that's correct. So the divergence of f is zero everywhere except at r=0.

So the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere would be zero, because the divergence is zero inside the volume except at a single point (r=0). But in a volume integral, the value at a single point doesn't contribute anything. So the integral is zero.

Wait, but what if the origin is included? Like, if the field behaves like an electric field of a point charge, then the divergence would be non-zero only at the origin, and the flux through a surface would be proportional to the charge enclosed. But in this case, the divergence is zero everywhere else, so the integral is zero.

Wait, but let me think about the flux. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the flux through the surface would be equal to any possible sources at the origin. But if the divergence is zero, then the flux would be zero, meaning no net flow out of the surface, which would imply that the enclosed 'charge' (or whatever the field represents) is zero.

But wait, the field here is f(r) = 1/r² r̂. Let me think about the flux through the surface of a sphere of radius R. The flux is the integral of f · dA over the surface. Since f is radial and dA is also radial, the dot product is just f(r) times the area.

So flux Φ = ∫ f · dA = ∫ f(r) r² sinθ dθ dφ. But wait, f(r) is 1/r², so:

Φ = ∫ (1/r²) * r² sinθ dθ dφ (over θ from 0 to π, φ from 0 to 2π) )

The r² cancels with 1/r², so we have:

Φ = ∫ sinθ dθ ∫ dφ = [ -cosθ ] from 0 to π * [φ from 0 to 2π]

Which is [ (-cos π) + cos 0 ] * (2π) = [ (1 + 1) ] * 2π = 2 * 2π = 4π.

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the flux equals the volume integral of the divergence. But earlier I found that the divergence is zero, so ∫ (∇·f) dV = 0. But the flux as I calculated is 4π. That's a contradiction.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in calculating the divergence. Because according to the divergence theorem, those two should be equal. If the flux is 4π, then ∫ (∇·f) dV must be 4π. But earlier I thought the divergence was zero, which would make the integral zero. What's wrong here?

Ah, wait. Let me recompute the divergence. Let me think again. For a vector field F(r) = F_r r̂, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r). So in this case, F_r is 1/r², so:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

So the divergence is zero, but the flux is 4π. That can't be. There's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the divergence isn't zero. Let me think again. Oh wait! If the field is F(r) = (1/r²) r̂, then F_r is proportional to 1/r². Let me plug into the divergence formula correctly.

Wait, F(r) = (1/r²) r̂, so F_r = 1/r².

∇·F = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r) = (1/(r²)) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr (1) ) = 0. So divergence is zero.

But the flux is 4π. So according to divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence is equal to the flux. Which would imply that 0 equals 4π, which is impossible. So where am I wrong?

Ah, perhaps the divergence isn't zero at all. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. The divergence formula in spherical coordinates for a purely radial field is:

∇·F = (1/(r²)) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r.

So F_r = 1/r². So, r² F_r = r² (1/r²) = 1.

So the derivative d/dr (1) is 0. So ∇·F = 0. So the divergence is zero.

But then why is the flux 4π? That's a contradiction. So perhaps the divergence theorem doesn't apply here because the field isn't differentiable at the origin? Because the field has a singularity at r=0.

Wait, so the divergence theorem requires the vector field to be continuously differentiable inside and on the surface of the volume. If the field has a singularity at the origin, which is within the volume (if R > 0), then the divergence theorem as stated may not apply correctly. So in that case, the integral of the divergence over the volume (excluding the origin) would be zero, but the flux would be non-zero due to the singularity.

Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So the volume integral would be zero. But the flux through the surface is 4π, not zero. So according to the divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence is equal to the flux. But in this case, the integral is zero, and the flux is 4π. That's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the divergence isn't zero. Let me reevaluate. Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the flux of f through a sphere of radius R. Flux is ∫ f · dA.

f is radial, so the dot product is f(r)*r² sinθ dθ dφ. f(r)=1/r², so:

Flux = ∫ (1/r²) * r² sinθ dθ dφ = ∫ sinθ dθ ∫ dφ.

Which is [ ∫ sinθ dθ from 0 to π ] * [ ∫ dφ from 0 to 2π ]

The theta integral is 2, and phi integral is 2π. So 2 * 2π = 4π.

So flux is 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, flux = ∫ (div f) dV.

So if flux is 4π, then the integral of div f over the volume is 4π. But earlier I thought div f is zero. So I must have made a mistake in calculating the divergence.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include something in the divergence. Let me recheck.

Wait, another formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial field is:

div F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

So F_r = 1/r².

So r² F_r = 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is 0. So div F is 0.

Hmm, so this leads me back to the same conclusion.

But the flux is 4π. So according to the divergence theorem, the integral should be 4π. But according to the divergence calculation, it's zero. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the divergence isn't zero because the field isn't defined at the origin. So in reality, the divergence is a delta function at the origin. But in that case, the divergence would be ∇·f = 4π δ³(r), so the integral over any volume containing the origin would be 4π.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for the electric field of a point charge, the divergence is proportional to the charge density, which is a delta function. So maybe in this problem, even though the field is given as 1/r², it's actually similar to the electric field of a charge, which would have a delta function divergence.

Wait, let me think again. The electric field of a point charge Q is E(r) = (1/(4πε0)) (Q/r²) r̂. The divergence of E is (1/(ε0)) ρ(r), where ρ(r) is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ(r) is (Q/(4πε0)) δ³(r), so ∇·E = (Q/(ε0^2)) δ³(r). But wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Gauss's law without the constants.

In any case, if the field here is f(r) = 1/r² r̂, then perhaps the divergence is a delta function. So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). Then, the integral over the volume would be 4π times the volume that includes the origin. Since the sphere of radius R includes the origin, the integral would be 4π.

So that would mean the volume integral is 4π, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the divergence, I found it zero. So why the delta function? Oh, because the field is singular at r=0, so the function isn't differentiable there, and the divergence includes a delta function representing the source.

So the correct approach is to realize that the divergence isn't zero in the distributional sense. So the integral is 4π.

Wait, but why does the divergence come out as a delta function? Let me think. The divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, but because the field behaves in a certain way near the origin, the divergence includes a Dirac delta function.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f(r) is such that its divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, and the integral over any volume that includes the origin gives a non-zero value.

So, going back to the problem, the volume integral of the divergence is 4π, so the answer should be A) 4π.

But wait, the options are A)4π, B)1, etc.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the divergence using the limit definition. The divergence of a vector field at a point is the limit as the volume around the point goes to zero of the flux through the surface enclosing that volume divided by the volume.

If the field is f(r) = 1/r² r̂, then for a small sphere of radius a around the origin, the flux is 4π as calculated earlier (since f · dA = (1/a²) * a² sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ, so flux is 4π). The volume of the small sphere is (4/3)π a³. So the divergence would be flux / volume = 4π / (4/3 π a³) ) * a → 0 as a → 0. Because as a approaches zero, the denominator goes to zero, but the numerator is finite. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the Dirac delta function. The divergence ∇·f is 4π δ³(r). So the integral over any volume that includes the origin would be 4π ∫ δ³(r) dV =4π *1 =4π.

So in this case, the volume is a sphere of radius R which includes the origin (since R>0). So the integral is 4π.

So the correct answer is A)4π.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin, we proceed as follows:

The vector field is given as **f(r)** = (1/r²) **r̂**, which is purely radial and falls off as 1/r². The divergence of a radial vector field in spherical coordinates is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right),
\]

where \( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \). Substituting \( f_r \) into the formula:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence of **f(r)** is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field has a singularity. In the context of distribution theory, the divergence can be interpreted as a Dirac delta function centered at the origin:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(\mathbf{r}).
\]

The volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius \( R \) is then:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_V 4\pi \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) \, dV.
\]

Since the delta function integrates to 1 over any volume that includes the origin, and the sphere of radius \( R \) certainly includes the origin (as \( R > 0 \)), the integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

This result is consistent with the divergence theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the surface of the sphere. The flux calculation confirms that the flux through the sphere is \( 4\pi \), matching the volume integral of the divergence.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
