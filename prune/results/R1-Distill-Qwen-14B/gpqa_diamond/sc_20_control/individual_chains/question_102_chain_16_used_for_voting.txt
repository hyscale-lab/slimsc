Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair and some genetic constructs. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with 8 alpha helices, 4 extracellular helices, and 3 beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices. So, both are membrane proteins, it seems.

They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the vector has both ligand and receptor genes. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, right? And upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry sites, so the receptor can be translated as a separate mRNA. So, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES, which is probably a weaker promoter but allows for separate expression.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh wait, loxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants. When Cre is present, it recognizes these sites and deletes the stop cassette, allowing the downstream reporter (mCherry or eGFP) to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. So, they transfected primary astrocytes with the plasmid and checked for the proteins. But when they breed mice and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see a green signal under the confocal. Green would come from eGFP, which is linked to the receptor.

So why no green signal? Let's look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct expression is about whether the eGFP is expressed. The setup in the vector is about whether both ligand and receptor are expressed, but in this case, the issue is whether the eGFP is being expressed. Maybe if the ligand and receptor are paracrine, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed in the same cell, but I'm not sure how that relates here. Hmm, not sure about this one yet.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is a reporter, so if it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be on the cell surface. But the question says they used primary astrocytes, and when they transfected, they probably checked Western blot. If they used antibodies, maybe they saw the eGFP in the blot. But the question says after plasmid transfection, they did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin. Wait, but the problem is when they look in the mouse offspring, which uses SOX10-Cre, they don't see green. Maybe the construct isn't being expressed in the right cells.

Option C: enhancer missing. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES. So maybe the problem is that the enhancer for expression is missing, so neither ligand nor receptor is expressed. But the question says the mouse is homozygous for the construct in wt background. If the enhancer was missing, perhaps neither reporter would be expressed. But wait, in the vector, ligand is under CBA, which is constitutive. So maybe the enhancer isn't the issue here.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. The eGFP is fused to the C-terminus of the receptor. If they're not in frame, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed correctly. Wait, but the vector is designed so that the receptor is in frame with eGFP. If the stop cassettes are using lox2272, which requires Cre to excise, then when Cre is present, the stop is removed, and the receptor-eGFP is expressed. So perhaps the Cre is not working correctly.

Wait, they crossed the mice to SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. The construct is a lox-Cre vector, so SOX10-Cre would activate the Cre in neural crest-derived cells. The vector probably has lox sites around the stop cassettes. So in the mice, the Cre would excise the stops, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the question, when they look, there's no green signal. So why? Let's think about how the vector is set up.

The vector is bicistronic: ligand (CBA promoter) and receptor (IRES). The ligand is fused to mCherry, but the ligand is under CBA, so when it's expressed, it's ligand-mCherry. But between ligand and mCherry is a loxP stop cassette. So normally, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the mCherry wouldn't because the stop is in place. Cre would remove the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed in the same transcript, but that's a read-through. Wait, no, the stop cassette is between ligand ORF and mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry is not. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the transcript can go through ligand and then mCherry, but since mCherry is after the stop, perhaps it's under the same promoter as ligand. Hmm, but in the vector, the ligand is first, under CBA, then the stop, then mCherry. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, and the mCherry is expressed in the same direction.

Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES. So the receptor is a separate ORF after the IRES, which is under the same promoter as the ligand? Or is the IRES allowing for a separate translation from the same mRNA? I think the IRES allows for internal initiation, so the mRNA is for ligand and the IRES allows for receptor translation.

Wait, the vector is ligand (CBA), followed by IRES, receptor, and then eGFP with a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, the lox2272 stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed. So in the presence of Cre, both mCherry (from ligand) and eGFP (from receptor) should be expressed.

But in the mouse, they're using SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So the Cre should delete the stops, allowing both reporters to be expressed. But the result is no green signal. So why?

Looking at the options again. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, if the lox2272 stop is not excised correctly, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the presence of Cre should excise it. So why isn't Cre working? Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 site is not correctly recognized by Cre.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different. The loxP is the original site, and lox2272 is a variant with a different sequence. Cre can recombine loxP sites but not lox2272 unless it's a variant Cre, like Dre or another recombinase. Wait, but in this case, the vector has loxP in one stop and lox2272 in the other. So the Cre would only recognize the loxP site. So when Cre is introduced, it would excise the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, but not the lox2272 one. Because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272.

Wait, but the vector has two stops: one between ligand and mCherry (loxP), and one between receptor and eGFP (lox2272). So without Cre, the ligand is expressed (since CBA is active), but mCherry is blocked. The receptor is expressed via IRES, but the eGFP is blocked by the lox2272 stop.

When Cre is present (like in the mouse with SOX10-Cre), it would only act on the loxP site, not the lox2272. So the stop between ligand and mCherry would be excised, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the stop between receptor and eGFP is lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the eGFP remains under stop, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse, the receptor would be expressed (because IRES is active without the stop), but the eGFP isn't. So when they look for eGFP under the microscope, there's no green signal.

Wait, but the question says that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Oh wait, perhaps the construct is designed that the loxP sites are for Cre-mediated recombination. So the first stop (ligand-mCherry) is under loxP-stop-loxP, and the second (receptor-eGFP) is under lox2272-stop-lox2272. So Cre will only delete the first stop, not the second. Therefore, the mCherry is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, because the second stop remains.

But the question says they look for the eGFP. So they don't see it because the stop isn't removed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed. So why?

Looking back at the options, which one explains that.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. No, that's about the ORF. If they're not in frame, the eGFP would be truncated or not expressed. But if the lox2272 stop isn't excised, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the problem is that the Cre can't excise the second stop.

Wait, but the vector is designed with loxP and lox2272. So Cre, which recognizes loxP, would only delete the first stop. The second stop (with lox2272) would remain. Therefore, the eGFP is not expressed because the stop is still there.

But why is the second stop using lox2272? Because the Cre can't act on it. So the design is that only the first stop is removed, the second isn't. So in the mouse, mCherry would be expressed (from the first cassette), but eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the question is about why there's no green signal. So the reason is that the lox2272 stop wasn't excised. So the eGFP is not expressed.

But looking at the options, none directly say that. Let's see the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop isn't excised, but that's because Cre can't act on lox2272. So perhaps the construct is designed wrong, such that both stops are loxP, but in the case, it's loxP and lox2272.

Wait, the vector has a loxP stop in the ligand part and a lox2272 stop in the receptor part. So when Cre is introduced, only the loxP stop is removed, the lox2272 remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So perhaps the issue is that the Cre isn't working, but no, the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in the right cells.

Wait, but the construct is in the mouse. The Cre would be provided by the SOX10-Cre mice, which express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre should be active, excising the loxP stops but not the lox2272.

Ah, but the question is about the eGFP, which is after the lox2272 stop. So if that stop isn't excised, eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, when they look for green (eGFP), they see nothing. So the problem is that the stop isn't excised because the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre.

Wait, but why would the construct have different lox sites? Maybe it's a design choice. But in the context of the question, the issue is why eGFP isn't expressed.

So the answer is that the Cre doesn't recognize the lox2272 site, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the green signal isn't observed.

Which option aligns with this? Looking back, the options:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause eGFP not to be expressed, but that's a different reason—incorrect cloning.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean it's expressed but not on the surface. But the question is about expression.

Option C: enhancer missing. But the ligand is under strong promoter CBA.

Wait, but in the vector, the receptor is under IRES, which is weaker. So perhaps the IRES isn't active, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says that the vector was transfected into astrocytes and tested via Western blot. So if the vector isn't working, they would have seen issues in the blot.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't functional in the cells used (astrocytes), but in the mice, perhaps under neural crest expression, it's active.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Another angle: the Western blot uses total proteins, and the signal was proportional to actin. So perhaps the eGFP wasn't expressed because it wasn't cloned correctly.

Wait, but why would the mouse not express eGFP? Because the lox2272 stop wasn't removed.

So the correct reason is that the stop cassette for eGFP (lox2272) isn't excised because Cre can't recognize it. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, none directly state this. But perhaps option D is about the construct not being correctly in frame, leading to no eGFP expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the lox2272 site isn't being cut, meaning the stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't have this. So I have to think what the options are suggesting.

Option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're not in frame, then when the stop is excised, eGFP might not be expressed because the reading frame is wrong. But that's a cloning issue.

Wait, but in the vector, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is not excised, eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop is excised, but the eGFP is not in frame, then it’s not expressed.

But in the case of the mouse, the stop is not excised because the Cre can't cut lox2272. So the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green.

So the reason is that the Cre can't excise the lox2272 stop. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, which option would indicate that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed.

Wait, but the options don't directly state that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but that's about the frame. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options directly address this, but the closest is D.

Wait, another possibility. The vector is bicistronic, with the ligand first. When Cre is present, it only deletes the loxP stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the other stop (lox2272) remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the construct is designed such that only one reporter is expressed when Cre is present. But the question is why eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question says that the mouse was homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is active, but only deletes the loxP stop, not the lox2272. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is that in the construct, the eGFP is after the lox2272 stop, which isn't being excised. So eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason for no green is that the lox2272 stop isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options talk about lox sites or Cre issues. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the lox2272 isn't recognized, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, another angle: the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin. So the vector was expressing some proteins, but after mouse breeding, no eGFP. Maybe the Cre isn't working because it's not in the right cell type.

Wait, the Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So in neural crest-derived cells, Cre is active. So the construct should have the loxP stop excised, allowing mCherry, but the lox2272 remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised. So why is that? Because the vector used lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer is that the stop wasn't excised, which is because the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre.

So none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the vector is under CBA for ligand and IRES for receptor. But in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed. Hmm.

Wait, if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, so the eGFP wouldn't be either. But the option about IRES is not given.

Looking at the options again:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean they're secreted and act on other cells. But the question is about expression of eGFP.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If so, the eGFP would be in the cell, but not on the surface. But the Western blot would detect it, perhaps.

C) Enhancer missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is strong.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If not in frame, eGFP won't be expressed.

Wait, but if the construct is designed correctly, the eGFP should be in frame. If the vector's design is wrong, like the eGFP is inserted out of frame, then it won't be expressed.

In this case, the vector has the ligand ORF, stop (loxP), mCherry. Then IRES, receptor ORF, stop (lox2272), eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, so Cre can't remove it, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason is that the receptor-eGFP stop isn't being excised. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So the correct answer relates to the construct not allowing eGFP expression.

Looking at the options, none directly address the lox sites. So perhaps the correct answer is D: receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Wait, but if the stop is in place, then the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of the frame. So the absence of signal is because the stop isn't removed, not frame issue.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not correctly inserted, leading it to be stuck in the ER or Golgi, not being expressed on the cell surface. But the confocal would detect intracellular fluorescence, maybe.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Another approach: the vector design uses two different lox sites. So the Cre would only cut loxP, not lox2272. Therefore, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be. So in the mouse model, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no green signal.

So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't cut by Cre. But none of the options mention this. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the use of two different lox sites was intended for sequential excisions, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that both stops are loxP, but in this question, they're different.

Wait, if the vector has a loxP stop for the ligand and a lox2272 stop for the receptor, then the Cre would only excise the first, leaving the second. Hence, the eGFP is not expressed.

But the options don't address this. So I'm a bit stuck. 

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The vector is a bicistronic vector with two cassettes. The ligand is first, followed by a stop, then mCherry. The receptor is next, with a stop, then eGFP. The ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's stop is lox2272. Therefore, Cre would only remove the ligand's stop, allowing mCherry expression. The receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 stop isn't excised. So why is the answer not present? 

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working in the construct, so the receptor isn't expressed, hence no eGFP. But the option C is about the enhancer, which I don't think is the case.

Wait, another angle: the vector uses a lox-Cre system, which requires the presence of Cre to remove the stop. If the Cre isn't active or the construct isn't properly integrated, the stops remain. So in the mouse, without Cre (or if Cre isn't active in the cells), the stops remain. But in this case, the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, so Cre should be active.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the vectors are designed in such a way that the stop is still present because the Cre isn't active in the right cells, but that's not the case here.

I think I'm going in circles. Based on the vector design, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But in the options given, the best fit is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, no. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of frame. So the frame would only matter if the stop is removed. So in this scenario, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So none of the options directly address this, but perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B. If the receptor and eGFP are properly expressed but stuck in the ER, they won't fluoresce. But the Western blot would show the proteins, but the confocal wouldn't show fluorescence. But in the question, the initial test on the Western blot was after transfection, which likely included checking for the proteins. Since the signal was proportional to actin, perhaps the eGFP was expressed but not fluorescent because it's stuck in the Golgi.

But I'm not confident. Given the options, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if they're not in frame, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand-receptor pair, with mCherry fused to the ligand and eGFP fused to the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The vector contains two stop cassettes: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor ORF and eGFP. The construct was introduced into mice, and SOX10-Cre mice were used to excise the stops. However, no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the issue here is the lack of eGFP expression, which is unrelated to whether the ligand and receptor are paracrine or autocrine. This option does not explain the observed result.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would still be expressed but might not fluoresce on the cell surface. However, the Western blot would likely detect the protein, as it measures total protein expression. The absence of a green signal in the confocal microscopy suggests that eGFP is not being expressed at all, not just mislocalized. This option does not fully explain the result.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element, which allows for separate translation. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing, and the vector design does not rely on an enhancer for expression. This option is unlikely to explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. However, the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP (lox2272) remains unexcised because Cre does not recognize lox2272. This prevents eGFP expression entirely, regardless of whether the receptor and eGFP are in frame. While this option partially addresses the lack of eGFP expression, it does not fully capture the issue, which is the failure of Cre to excise the lox2272 stop cassette.

### Conclusion:
The lack of a green signal is due to the presence of the lox2272 stop cassette, which Cre cannot excise. This prevents eGFP expression. While none of the options directly address this issue, the closest explanation is **Option D**, as it partially accounts for the lack of eGFP expression by suggesting a problem with the construct's design.

Answer: D

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair and some genetic constructs. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with 8 alpha helices, 4 extracellular helices, and 3 beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices. So, both are membrane proteins, it seems.

They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the vector has both ligand and receptor genes. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, right? And upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry sites, so the receptor can be translated as a separate mRNA. So, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES, which is probably a weaker promoter but allows for separate expression.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh wait, loxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants. When Cre is present, it recognizes these sites and deletes the stop cassette, allowing the downstream reporter (mCherry or eGFP) to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. So, they transfected primary astrocytes with the plasmid and checked for the proteins. But when they breed mice and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see a green signal under the confocal. Green would come from eGFP, which is linked to the receptor.

So why no green signal? Let's look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct expression is about whether the eGFP is expressed. The setup in the vector is about whether both ligand and receptor are expressed, but in this case, the issue is whether the eGFP is being expressed. Maybe if the ligand and receptor are paracrine, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed in the same cell, but I'm not sure how that relates here. Hmm, not sure about this one yet.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is a reporter, so if it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be on the cell surface. But the question says they used primary astrocytes, and when they transfected, they probably checked Western blot. If they used antibodies, maybe they saw the eGFP in the blot. But the question says after plasmid transfection, they did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin. Wait, but the problem is when they look in the mouse offspring, which uses SOX10-Cre, they don't see green. Maybe the construct isn't being expressed in the right cells.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. The eGFP is fused to the C-terminus of the receptor. If they're not in frame, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed correctly. Wait, but the vector is designed so that the receptor is in frame with eGFP. If the stop cassettes are using lox2272, which requires Cre to excise, then when Cre is present, the stop is removed, and the receptor-eGFP is expressed. So perhaps the Cre is not working correctly.

Wait, they crossed the mice to SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. The construct is a lox-Cre vector, so SOX10-Cre would activate the Cre in neural crest-derived cells. The vector probably has lox sites around the stop cassettes. So in the mice, the Cre would excise the stops, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the question, when they look, there's no green signal. So why? Let's think about how the vector is set up.

The vector is bicistronic: ligand (CBA promoter) and receptor (IRES). The ligand is fused to mCherry, but the ligand is under CBA, so when it's expressed, it's ligand-mCherry. But between ligand and mCherry is a loxP stop cassette. So normally, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the mCherry wouldn't because the stop is in place. Cre would remove the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed in the same transcript, but that's a read-through. Wait, no, the stop cassette is between ligand ORF and mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry is not. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the transcript can go through ligand and then mCherry, but since mCherry is after the stop, perhaps it's under the same promoter as ligand. Hmm, but in the vector, the ligand is first, under CBA, then the stop, then mCherry. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, and the mCherry is expressed in the same direction.

Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES. So the receptor is a separate ORF after the IRES, which is under the same promoter as the ligand? Or is the IRES allowing for a separate translation from the same mRNA? I think the IRES allows for internal initiation, so the mRNA is for ligand and the IRES allows for receptor translation.

Wait, the vector is ligand (CBA), followed by IRES, receptor, and then eGFP with a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, the lox2272 stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed. So in the presence of Cre, both mCherry (from ligand) and eGFP (from receptor) should be expressed.

But in the mouse, they're using SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So the Cre should delete the stops, allowing both reporters to be expressed. But the result is no green signal. So why?

Looking at the options again. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, if the lox2272 stop is not excised correctly, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the presence of Cre should excise it. So why isn't Cre working? Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 site is not correctly recognized by Cre.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different. The loxP is the original site, and lox2272 is a variant with a different sequence. Cre can recombine loxP sites but not lox2272 unless it's a variant Cre, like Dre or another recombinase. Wait, but in this case, the vector has loxP in one stop and lox2272 in the other. So the Cre would only recognize the loxP site. So when Cre is introduced, it would excise the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, but not the lox2272 one. Because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272.

Wait, but the vector has two stops: one between ligand and mCherry (loxP), and one between receptor and eGFP (lox2272). So without Cre, the ligand is expressed (since CBA is active), but mCherry is blocked. The receptor is expressed via IRES, but the eGFP is blocked by the lox2272 stop.

When Cre is present (like in the mouse with SOX10-Cre), it would only act on the loxP site, not the lox2272. So the stop between ligand and mCherry would be excised, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the stop between receptor and eGFP is lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the eGFP remains under stop, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse, the receptor would be expressed (because IRES is active without the stop), but the eGFP isn't. So when they look for eGFP under the microscope, there's no green signal.

Wait, but the question says that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Oh wait, perhaps the construct is designed that the loxP sites are for Cre-mediated recombination. So the first stop (ligand-mCherry) is under loxP-stop-loxP, and the second (receptor-eGFP) is under lox2272-stop-lox2272. So Cre will only delete the first stop, not the second. Therefore, the mCherry is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, because the second stop remains.

But the question says they look for the eGFP. So they don't see it because the stop isn't removed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed. So why?

Looking back at the options, which one explains that.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. No, that's about the ORF. If they're not in frame, the eGFP would be truncated or not expressed. But if the lox2272 stop isn't excised, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the problem is that the Cre can't excise the second stop.

Wait, but the vector is designed with loxP and lox2272. So Cre, which recognizes loxP, would only delete the first stop. The second stop (with lox2272) would remain. Therefore, the eGFP is not expressed because the stop is still there.

But why is the second stop using lox2272? Because the Cre can't act on it. So the design is that only the first stop is removed, the second isn't. So in the mouse, mCherry would be expressed (from the first cassette), but eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the question is about why there's no green signal. So the reason is that the lox2272 stop wasn't excised. So the eGFP is not expressed.

But looking at the options, none directly say that. Let's see the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop isn't excised, but that's because Cre can't act on lox2272. So perhaps the construct is designed wrong, such that both stops are loxP, but in the case, it's loxP and lox2272.

Wait, the vector has a loxP stop in the ligand part and a lox2272 stop in the receptor part. So when Cre is introduced, only the loxP stop is removed, the lox2272 remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So perhaps the issue is that the Cre isn't working, but no, the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in the right cells.

Wait, but the construct is in the mouse. The Cre would be provided by the SOX10-Cre mice, which express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre should be active, excising the loxP stops but not the lox2272.

Ah, but the question is about the eGFP, which is after the lox2272 stop. So if that stop isn't excised, eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, when they look for green (eGFP), they see nothing. So the problem is that the stop isn't excised because the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre.

Wait, but why would the construct have different lox sites? Maybe it's a design choice. But in the context of the question, the issue is why eGFP isn't expressed.

So the answer is that the Cre doesn't recognize the lox2272 site, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the green signal isn't observed.

Which option aligns with this? Looking back, the options:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause eGFP not to be expressed, but that's a different reason—incorrect cloning.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean it's expressed but not on the surface. But the question is about expression.

Option C: enhancer missing. But the ligand is under strong promoter CBA.

Wait, but in the vector, the receptor is under IRES, which is weaker. So perhaps the IRES isn't active, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says that the vector was transfected into astrocytes and tested via Western blot. So if the vector isn't working, they would have seen issues in the blot.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't functional in the cells used (astrocytes), but in the mice, perhaps under neural crest expression, it's active.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Another angle: the Western blot uses total proteins, and the signal was proportional to actin. So perhaps the eGFP wasn't expressed because it wasn't cloned correctly.

Wait, but why would the mouse not express eGFP? Because the lox2272 stop wasn't removed.

So the correct reason is that the stop cassette for eGFP (lox2272) isn't excised because Cre can't recognize it. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, none directly state this. But perhaps option D is about the construct not being correctly in frame, leading to no eGFP expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the lox2272 site isn't being cut, meaning the stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't have this. So I have to think what the options are suggesting.

Option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're not in frame, then when the stop is excised, eGFP might not be expressed because the reading frame is wrong. But that's a cloning issue.

Wait, but in the vector, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is not excised, eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop is excised, but the eGFP is not in frame, then it’s not expressed.

But in the case of the mouse, the stop is not excised because the Cre can't cut lox2272. So the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green.

So the reason is that the Cre can't excise the lox2272 stop. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, which option would indicate that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed.

Wait, but the options don't directly state that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but that's about the frame. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options directly address this, but the closest is D.

Wait, another possibility. The vector is bicistronic, with the ligand first. When Cre is present, it only deletes the loxP stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the other stop (lox2272) remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the construct is designed such that only one reporter is expressed when Cre is present. But the question is why eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question says that the mouse was homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is active, but only deletes the loxP stop, not the lox2272. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is that in the construct, the eGFP is after the lox2272 stop, which isn't being excised. So eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason for no green is that the lox2272 stop isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options talk about lox sites or Cre issues. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the lox2272 isn't recognized, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, another angle: the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin. So the vector was expressing some proteins, but after mouse breeding, no eGFP. Maybe the Cre isn't working because it's not in the right cell type.

Wait, the Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So in neural crest-derived cells, Cre is active. So the construct should have the loxP stop excised, allowing mCherry, but the lox2272 remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised. So why is that? Because the vector used lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer is that the stop wasn't excised, which is because the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre.

So none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the vector is under CBA for ligand and IRES for receptor. But in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed. Hmm.

Wait, if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, so the eGFP wouldn't be either. But the option about IRES is not given.

Looking at the options again:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean they're secreted and act on other cells. But the question is about expression of eGFP.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If so, the eGFP would be in the cell, but not on the surface. But the Western blot would detect it, perhaps.

C) Enhancer missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is strong.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If not in frame, eGFP won't be expressed.

Wait, but if the construct is designed correctly, the eGFP should be in frame. If the vector's design is wrong, like the eGFP is inserted out of frame, then it won't be expressed.

In this case, the vector has the ligand ORF, stop (loxP), mCherry. Then IRES, receptor ORF, stop (lox2272), eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, so Cre can't remove it, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason is that the receptor-eGFP stop isn't being excised. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So the correct answer relates to the construct not allowing eGFP expression.

Looking at the options, none directly address the lox sites. So perhaps the correct answer is D: receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Wait, but if the stop is in place, then the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of the frame. So the absence of signal is because the stop isn't removed, not frame issue.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not correctly inserted, leading it to be stuck in the ER or Golgi, not being expressed on the cell surface. But the confocal would detect intracellular fluorescence, maybe.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Another approach: the vector design uses two different lox sites. So the Cre would only cut loxP, not lox2272. Therefore, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be. So in the mouse model, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no green signal.

So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't cut by Cre. But none of the options mention this. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the use of two different lox sites was intended for sequential excisions, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that both stops are loxP, but in this question, they're different.

Wait, if the vector has a loxP stop for the ligand and a lox2272 stop for the receptor, then the Cre would only excise the first, leaving the second. Hence, the eGFP is not expressed.

But the options don't address this. So I'm a bit stuck. 

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The vector is a bicistronic vector with two cassettes. The ligand is first, followed by a stop, then mCherry. The receptor is next, with a stop, then eGFP. The ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's stop is lox2272. Therefore, Cre would only remove the ligand's stop, allowing mCherry expression. The receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 stop isn't excised. So why is the answer not present? 

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working in the construct, so the receptor isn't expressed, hence no eGFP. But the option C is about the enhancer, which I don't think is the case.

Wait, another angle: the vector uses a lox-Cre system, which requires the presence of Cre to remove the stop. If the Cre isn't active or the construct isn't properly integrated, the stops remain. So in the mouse, without Cre (or if Cre isn't active in the cells), the stops remain. But in this case, the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, so Cre should be active.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the vectors are designed in such a way that the stop is still present because the Cre isn't active in the right cells, but that's not the case here.

I think I'm going in circles. Based on the vector design, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But in the options given, the best fit is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, no. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of frame. So the frame would only matter if the stop is removed. So in this scenario, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So none of the options directly address this, but perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B. If the receptor and eGFP are properly expressed but stuck in the ER, they won't fluoresce. But the Western blot would show the proteins, but the confocal wouldn't show fluorescence. But in the question, the initial test on the Western blot was after transfection, which likely included checking for the proteins. Since the signal was proportional to actin, perhaps the eGFP was expressed but not fluorescent because it's stuck in the Golgi.

But I'm not confident. Given the options, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if they're not in frame, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand-receptor pair, with mCherry fused to the ligand and eGFP fused to the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The vector contains two stop cassettes: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor ORF and eGFP. The construct was introduced into mice, and SOX10-Cre mice were used to excise the stops. However, no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the issue here is the lack of eGFP expression, which is unrelated to whether the ligand and receptor are paracrine or autocrine. This option does not explain the observed result.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would still be expressed but might not fluoresce on the cell surface. However, the Western blot would likely detect the protein, as it measures total protein expression. The absence of a green signal in the confocal microscopy suggests that eGFP is not being expressed at all, not just mislocalized. This option does not fully explain the result.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element, which allows for separate translation. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing, and the vector design does not rely on an enhancer for expression. This option is unlikely to explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. However, the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP (lox2272) remains unexcised because Cre does not recognize lox2272. This prevents eGFP expression entirely, regardless of whether the receptor and eGFP are in frame. While this option partially addresses the lack of eGFP expression, it does not fully capture the issue, which is the failure of Cre to excise the lox2272 stop cassette.

### Conclusion:
The lack of a green signal is due to the presence of the lox2272 stop cassette, which Cre cannot excise. This prevents eGFP expression. While none of the options directly address this issue, the closest explanation is **Option D**, as it partially accounts for the lack of eGFP expression by suggesting a problem with the construct's design.
