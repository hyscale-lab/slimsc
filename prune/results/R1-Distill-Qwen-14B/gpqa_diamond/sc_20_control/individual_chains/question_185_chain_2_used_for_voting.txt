Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me see what the question says.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So σ · n would be the dot product of σ and n. Since n is a unit vector, it's like a direction vector.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So σ · n would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. So H is ε times that sum. So H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2.

Eigenvalues of H... hmm. To find the eigenvalues, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are given by the solutions to det(H - λI) = 0. Alternatively, I can think about the properties of this operator.

Wait, another approach: the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and their eigenvalues are ±1. Oh wait, no, wait. Each Pauli matrix, when multiplied by a unit vector component, but here the whole sum is scaled by ε.

Wait, since σ · n is a vector in the Bloch sphere direction, for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because, for any direction, the spin operator has eigenvalues ±1/2 times ħ, but wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. Because, for example, σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So if I have an operator like σ · n, which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, what are its eigenvalues?

Wait, another thought. For any unit vector n, the operator σ · n is a Hermitian matrix. Its trace is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and the sum would also have zero trace. The determinant is also something I'm not sure about. But for 2x2 matrices, the eigenvalues satisfy λ1 + λ2 = trace, which is zero here, and λ1 * λ2 = determinant.

Wait, let's compute σ · n. Let me think about it as a matrix. Suppose n is (n_x, n_y, n_z). Then σ · n is n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Each σ matrix is 2x2, so this would be a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them out:

σx is [[0, 1],[1, 0]]
σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
σz is [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

So σ · n would be:

[ [n_z, n_x - i n_y],
  [n_x + i n_y, -n_z] ]

Wait, no, let me compute it:

n_x σx = n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]]
n_y σy = n_y * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
n_z σz = n_z * [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

Adding them together:

Top left element: n_z * 1 (from σz) + 0 + 0 = n_z
Top right: n_x *1 + n_y*(-i) = n_x - i n_y
Bottom left: n_x *1 + n_y*(i)
Bottom right: -n_z

So the matrix is:
[ [n_z, n_x - i n_y],
  [n_x + i n_y, -n_z] ]

Now, to find eigenvalues, we can find the trace and determinant.

The trace is n_z - n_z = 0. So sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y)

Let me compute that. Let me compute each part.

(n_z)(-n_z) = -n_z^2
The other term is (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = n_x^2 + (i n_y)(n_x) - (i n_y)(n_x) + (i^2)(n_y^2) = n_x^2 + (n_y^2)(-1) because i^2 is -1.

Wait, no, (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So it's (n_x)^2 - (i n_y)^2.

Which is n_x² - (i² n_y²) = n_x² + n_y^2 because i² is -1.

So determinant is -n_z^2 - (n_x^2 + n_y^2) )?

Wait, wait, no. The determinant is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x^2 + n_y^2) ) because I think I have the product (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = n_x² + (n_y)^2.

Wait, because (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So in this case, (n_x)^2 - (i n_y)^2 = n_x² - (i² n_y²) = n_x² - (-1) n_y² = n_x² + n_y².

So the determinant is -n_z^2 - (n_x² + n_y^2) = -(n_x² + n_y^2 + n_z^2) )

But n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So determinant is -1 * 1 = -1.

So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - (trace) λ + determinant = 0. Since trace is zero, equation is λ^2 - 1 = 0, so λ = ±1.

Wait, no, wait. The equation is λ² - (trace)λ + determinant = 0. So trace is zero. So λ² + (-1) = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ=1 and -1.

So the eigenvalues of σ · n are +1 and -1.

But wait, the Hamiltonian is H = ε (σ · n). So the eigenvalues would be ε multiplied by those. So each eigenvalue is ±ε.

So the eigenvalues would be +ε and -ε.

Looking at the options:

Option B is +ε, -ε.

Option C is (ε ħ)/2 and -(epsilon hbar)/2.

Wait, why would that be the case? Oh, wait because the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 when multiplied by Pauli matrices. Wait, but the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so for the operator (σ · n), eigenvalues are ±1, but when multiplied by ε, it's ± ε. So the eigenvalues are ± ε.

Wait, another way to think: The Pauli matrices are in units where ħ is considered, but in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. So the σ matrices are just the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues ±1. So H's eigenvalues would be ε * 1 and ε * (-1), so ± ε.

So the correct eigenvalues are +ε and -ε, which is option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with energy dimensions, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of \( H \).

The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices:  
\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z,
\]  
where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the components of the unit vector \( \vec{n} \). Each Pauli matrix (\( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \)) is Hermitian and has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). For any unit vector \( \vec{n} \), the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is also Hermitian and has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \), as it represents a spin operator in the direction of \( \vec{n} \).

The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) scales the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) by \( \varepsilon \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \), not \( \pm 1 \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as shown above.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), not \( \pm \hbar/2 \).
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not account for the scaling factor \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).
