Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: I need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components of P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But in this case, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means it has components in x and z, but no y component. So n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis, I think.

But how does this affect the operator P? Oh right, because the operator P would then be P · n, which is the dot product. So the operator we're interested in is P_n = P · n = (P_x)(n_x) + (P_y)(n_y) + (P_z)(n_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n is a unit vector. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Because each component (like P_x) is (ħ/2) times its matrix. So when I multiply by n_x and n_z, it becomes (ħ/2) times the sum of the matrices.

So, let's compute the matrix of P_n. The matrices for P_x and P_z are:

P_x matrix: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_z matrix: [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P_n's matrix is:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which gives:

Top left: cosθ * 1
Top right: sinθ * 1
Bottom left: sinθ *1
Bottom right: -cosθ *1

So the matrix is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

And each element is multiplied by ħ/2, right? Because each component was (ħ/2) times their matrices. So the entire P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So, substituting P_n:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is M |ψ> = |ψ>, where M is the matrix above, and |ψ> is the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, no. Because the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>, so when we divided by ħ/2, the right-hand side becomes 1 times |ψ>, so the matrix M is as above.

Wait, no, the matrix M is [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]. So the equation is M |ψ> = λ |ψ>, and λ is 1.

So to find the eigenvectors, we need to solve (M - I) |ψ> = 0.

Let me compute M - I:

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero for non-trivial solutions. The determinant is:

(cosθ - 1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0

Compute that:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ)(cosθ +1) +1*(cosθ +1) = -(cos^2θ + cosθ) + cosθ +1 = -cos^2θ - cosθ + cosθ +1 = -cos^2θ +1

Then subtract (sinθ)^2: (-cos^2θ +1) - sin^2θ = 0

But wait, 1 - cos^2θ = sin^2θ, so 1 - cos^2θ - sin^2θ = 1 - (cos^2θ + sin^2θ) )= 1-1=0. So yes, the determinant is zero, which makes sense for an eigenvalue.

So the system of equations from (M - I)|ψ> = 0 is:

(cosθ -1) ψ1 + sinθ ψ2 = 0

sinθ ψ1 + (-cosθ -1) ψ2 = 0

We can take the first equation: (cosθ -1) ψ1 + sinθ ψ2 = 0

So (1 - cosθ) ψ1 = sinθ ψ2

So ψ2 = [(1 - cosθ)/sinθ] ψ1

Hmm, but (1 - cosθ)/sinθ is (2 sin^2(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = tan(θ/2).

So ψ2 = tan(θ/2) ψ1.

So the eigenvector can be written in terms of ψ1.

Let me pick ψ1 as a parameter, say ψ1 = 1, then ψ2 = tan(θ/2).

But wait, the eigenvector must be normalized. So the components are [1, tan(θ/2)].

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the components are usually written as a column vector, so ψ = [ψ1; ψ2].

So ψ = [1; tan(θ/2)].

But we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1^2 + (tanθ/2)^2 = 1 + tan^2(θ/2) = sec^2(θ/2) = 1/(cos^2(θ/2)).

So normalization factor is cos(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T ?

Wait, because ψ1 is cos(theta/2), ψ2 is sin(theta/2) ?

Wait, let me see.

Wait, when we have ψ = [1; tan(theta/2)], then after normalization, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. Because 1 = cos(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ?

Wait, let me compute.

If ψ is [1; tan(theta/2)], then the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2)) ) = 1/sqrt(sec^2(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2). So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, because [1, tan(theta/2)] multiplied by cos(theta/2) gives [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Yes, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2). So multiplying by cos(theta/2) gives sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, but wait, let's double-check. The original eigenvector is [1; tan(theta/2)].

When normalized, its components become [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So the eigenvector is in the form [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Wait, but wait, the options are written as the elements, so option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which seems correct.

Wait, but wait, let's check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical harmonics, but I don't think that's the case here because we're in spin-1/2 space, not higher.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so that's a different scaling.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, but I don't think hbar is part of the eigenvector; eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, the question says the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So hbar isn't part of the vector. So options A and D have hbar terms, but eigenvectors are just vectors in Hilbert space, which are dimensionless. So those options are probably incorrect.

So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is a vector operator with components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $\hbar/2$ times a $2 \times 2$ matrix. The direction of interest is along an arbitrary unit vector $\vec{n}$ in the $x$-$z$ plane, which can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator along this direction is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]

the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle.
\]

This implies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = 0.
\]

From the first row of the matrix equation, the eigenvector components satisfy:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)\psi_1 + \sin\theta \psi_2 = 0.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
\psi_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \psi_1.
\]

Using the trigonometric identity $\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = \tan(\theta/2)$, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \psi_1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor. The norm squared is:

\[
\psi_1^2 + \tan^2(\theta/2) \psi_1^2 = \psi_1^2 \left(1 + \tan^2(\theta/2)\right) = \psi_1^2 \sec^2(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is $\cos(\theta/2)$, and the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \cos(\theta/2) \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents spherical harmonics, which is not relevant for spin-$1/2$ systems.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes additional scaling factors $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the derived eigenvector.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: I need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components of P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But in this case, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means it has components in x and z, but no y component. So n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis, I think.

But how does this affect the operator P? Oh right, because the operator P would then be P · n, which is the dot product. So the operator we're interested in is P_n = P · n = (P_x)(n_x) + (P_y)(n_y) + (P_z)(n_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n is a unit vector. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Because each component (like P_x) is (ħ/2) times its matrix. So when I multiply by n_x and n_z, it becomes (ħ/2) times the sum of the matrices.

So, let's compute the matrix of P_n. The matrices for P_x and P_z are:

P_x matrix: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_z matrix: [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P_n's matrix is:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which gives:

Top left: cosθ * 1
Top right: sinθ * 1
Bottom left: sinθ *1
Bottom right: -cosθ *1

So the matrix is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

And each element is multiplied by ħ/2, right? Because each component was (ħ/2) times their matrices. So the entire P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So, substituting P_n:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is M |ψ> = |ψ>, where M is the matrix above, and |ψ> is the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, no. Because the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>, so when we divided by ħ/2, the right-hand side becomes 1 times |ψ>, so the matrix M is as above.

Wait, no, the matrix M is [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]. So the equation is M |ψ> = λ |ψ>, and λ is 1.

So to find the eigenvectors, we need to solve (M - I) |ψ> = 0.

Let me compute M - I:

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero for non-trivial solutions. The determinant is:

(cosθ - 1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0

Compute that:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ)(cosθ +1) +1*(cosθ +1) = -(cos^2θ + cosθ) + cosθ +1 = -cos^2θ - cosθ + cosθ +1 = -cos^2θ +1

Then subtract (sinθ)^2: (-cos^2θ +1) - sin^2θ = 0

But wait, 1 - cos^2θ = sin^2θ, so 1 - cos^2θ - sin^2θ = 1 - (cos^2θ + sin^2θ) )= 1-1=0. So yes, the determinant is zero, which makes sense for an eigenvalue.

So the system of equations from (M - I)|ψ> = 0 is:

(cosθ -1) ψ1 + sinθ ψ2 = 0

sinθ ψ1 + (-cosθ -1) ψ2 = 0

We can take the first equation: (cosθ -1) ψ1 + sinθ ψ2 = 0

So (1 - cosθ) ψ1 = sinθ ψ2

So ψ2 = [(1 - cosθ)/sinθ] ψ1

Hmm, but (1 - cosθ)/sinθ is (2 sin^2(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = tan(θ/2).

So ψ2 = tan(θ/2) ψ1.

So the eigenvector can be written in terms of ψ1.

Let me pick ψ1 as a parameter, say ψ1 = 1, then ψ2 = tan(θ/2).

But wait, the eigenvector must be normalized. So the components are [1, tan(θ/2)].

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the components are usually written as a column vector, so ψ = [ψ1; ψ2].

So ψ = [1; tan(θ/2)].

But we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1^2 + (tanθ/2)^2 = 1 + tan^2(θ/2) = sec^2(θ/2) = 1/(cos^2(θ/2)).

So normalization factor is cos(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T ?

Wait, because ψ1 is cos(theta/2), ψ2 is sin(theta/2) ?

Wait, let me see.

Wait, when we have ψ = [1; tan(theta/2)], then after normalization, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. Because 1 = cos(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ?

Wait, let me compute.

If ψ is [1; tan(theta/2)], then the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2)) ) = 1/sqrt(sec^2(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2). So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, because [1, tan(theta/2)] multiplied by cos(theta/2) gives [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Yes, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2). So multiplying by cos(theta/2) gives sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, but wait, let's double-check. The original eigenvector is [1; tan(theta/2)].

When normalized, its components become [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So the eigenvector is in the form [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Wait, but wait, the options are written as the elements, so option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which seems correct.

Wait, but wait, let's check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical harmonics, but I don't think that's the case here because we're in spin-1/2 space, not higher.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so that's a different scaling.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, but I don't think hbar is part of the eigenvector; eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, the question says the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So hbar isn't part of the vector. So options A and D have hbar terms, but eigenvectors are just vectors in Hilbert space, which are dimensionless. So those options are probably incorrect.

So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is a vector operator with components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $\hbar/2$ times a $2 \times 2$ matrix. The direction of interest is along an arbitrary unit vector $\vec{n}$ in the $x$-$z$ plane, which can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator along this direction is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]

the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle.
\]

This implies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = 0.
\]

From the first row of the matrix equation, the eigenvector components satisfy:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)\psi_1 + \sin\theta \psi_2 = 0.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
\psi_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \psi_1.
\]

Using the trigonometric identity $\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = \tan(\theta/2)$, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \psi_1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor. The norm squared is:

\[
\psi_1^2 + \tan^2(\theta/2) \psi_1^2 = \psi_1^2 \left(1 + \tan^2(\theta/2)\right) = \psi_1^2 \sec^2(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is $\cos(\theta/2)$, and the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \cos(\theta/2) \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents spherical harmonics, which is not relevant for spin-$1/2$ systems.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes additional scaling factors $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the derived eigenvector.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
