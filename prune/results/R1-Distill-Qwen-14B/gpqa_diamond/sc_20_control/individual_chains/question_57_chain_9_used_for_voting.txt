Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitude and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question says we're dealing with elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored. We need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ, k') comes from partial wave analysis. Each partial wave contributes with an exponential term involving the phase shift for that angular momentum. 

The formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ, k') = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ ( (k/k')^(l) ) * e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l) ) ] * ... Wait, maybe it's better to think about the partial wave expansion. Oh right, for each partial wave l, the amplitude is ( ( (k/(k'))^l ) * e^{iδ_l} ) / (something with 2i and (l)(l+1))).

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over l of ( ( (k/(k'))^l ) * ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) ) / (2ik (2l+1)) ) * some Legendre polynomial terms. Oh wait, no, the Legendre polynomials come into play when you have the angular dependence. But the question says to calculate along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, along the beam direction is when θ=0°, right? So that's the forward direction.

But wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part. Oh, right! For the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, especially along the incident direction (θ=0), there's a simpler expression. 

I think the formula is Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) (k/(k'))^l ) * sin δ_l ) ) / (2ik) Wait, that's not quite right. Alternatively, I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by:

Im f(θ) = (k/(4π)) * Σ [ ( (2l + 1) (k/(k'))^l ) * sin δ_l ) * P_l(cosθ) ]

But when θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So that simplifies the sum.

So Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) (k/(k'))^l * sin δ_l ]

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact factors. Let me think again. The general form for the scattering amplitude f(θ) from partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = Σ [ ( (2l + 1) (k/(k'))^l ) / (2ik) ) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * P_l(cosθ) ]

So taking the imaginary part of f(θ), we get:

Im f(θ) = Σ [ (2l +1) (k/(k'))^l / (2k) ) * Im ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * P_l(cosθ) ]

Wait, because e^{2iδ} -1 is 2i e^{iδ} sin δ, so the imaginary part of that would be 2 e^{iδ} sin δ. But wait, let me calculate: e^{2iδ} -1 = e^{iδ}^2 -1 = (cos δ + i sin δ)^2 -1 = cos 2δ + 2i sin δ cos δ -1.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of Im(e^{iθ} -1) which is sin θ. Hmm, no, in this case the term is e^{2iδ} -1. Let's compute it:

e^{2iδ} -1 = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ) -1 = [cos(2δ) -1] + i sin(2δ) 

The imaginary part of this is sin(2δ).

Alternatively, e^{iφ} -1 has an imaginary part of sin φ, but here we have e^{2iδ} -1, so the imaginary part is sin(2δ). Wait, but in the expression for the amplitude, we have Im (e^{2iδ} -1 ) which is sin(2δ).

So Im f(θ) = Σ [ (2l +1) (k/(k'))^l / (2k) ) * sin(2δ_l) * P_l(cosθ) ]

But when θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l, so:

Im f(0) = [1/(2k)] * Σ [ (2l+1) (k/(k'))^l * sin(2δ_l) ]

So that's the expression we need.

But wait, the problem gives the phase shifts δ_0, δ_1, etc., so l runs from 0 to 4. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

So let's compute each term for l=0 to 4.

But wait, what's k and k' here? Oh, k is the initial wavevector, and k' is the final wavevector. But for elastic scattering, since energy is conserved, |k| = |k'|, so k' = k. So that (k/k')^l = 1 for all l, right? Because k' = k. So the term (k/k')^l is 1.

Wait, but wait, for scattering, the initial and final momenta are the same magnitude since it's elastic. So yes, k = k'.

So that simplifies the sum: (k/k')^l is 1. So the sum becomes:

Σ [ (2l +1) * sin(2δ_l) ]

Then, Im f(0) = [1/(2k)] * Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

Wait, but what is k?

k is the wavevector of the electrons. The energy is given as 50 MeV. So we can compute k.

The electrons have energy E = 50 MeV. Since electrons are light, we need to compute their momentum. For non-relativistic speeds, E ≈ (ħ² k²)/(2m), but 50 MeV is relativistic.

The mass of the electron is m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV. So E = 50 MeV is much larger than m_e c², so we can use relativistic expressions.

The relativistic energy for an electron is E = γ m_e c², and momentum p = γ m_e v. The relation between E and p is E² = (p c)^2 c^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

So E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 )

But since E is 50 MeV, much larger than m_e c² (0.511 MeV), we can approximate p c ≈ E.

So p ≈ E / c.

So k = p / ħ.

So k ≈ (E) / (ħ c).

But let me compute it accurately.

First, compute the momentum p.

E = 50 MeV = 50 x 10^6 eV.

Convert E to joules: 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.

E = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

The mass of the electron is m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

The speed of light c = 3e8 m/s.

Compute p using E² = (p c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

Solve for p:

p c = sqrt( E² - (m_e c^2)^2 )

E² is (8.01e-13 J)^2.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.18e-14 J.

So (m_e c²)^2 = (8.18e-14)^2 ≈ 6.69e-27 J².

E² = (8.01e-13)^2 ≈ 6.42e-25 J².

So E² - (m_e c²)^2 ≈ 6.42e-25 - 6.69e-27 ≈ 6.42e-25 J² (since 6.69e-27 is much smaller).

So p c ≈ sqrt(6.42e-25) = approx 8.01e-13 kg m/s * m/s.

Wait, units: sqrt(J²) is J, which is kg m²/s². So p c has units kg m²/s² * s/m (Wait, wait, I'm getting confused with units here. Let me compute it numerically.)

p c = sqrt(E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(6.42e-25) = approx 8.01e-13 J.

But J = kg m²/s², so p c = 8.01e-13 kg m²/s².

But p has units kg m/s, so p c = kg m/s * m/s = kg m²/s². So yes, correct.

So p = (8.01e-13 kg m²/s²) / c.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p ≈ (8.01e-13) / (3e8) kg m/s.

Which is approximately 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Wait, but that seems small. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach. Since E is much larger than m_e c², p ≈ E/c.

E is 50 MeV. Let's compute p in units of MeV/c.

p = E / c = 50 MeV / c.

But we can compute p in SI units.

1 MeV/c is approximately 5.344e-28 kg m/s.

So p = 50 * 5.344e-28 kg m/s = 2.672e-26 kg m/s.

Wait, wait, that's a big discrepancy. Earlier I got 2.67e-21, which is 1e5 times bigger. Hmm, must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me compute p c.

E (MeV) = 50 MeV.

p c (MeV) = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ 50 MeV.

So p c ≈50 MeV → p ≈50 MeV / c.

But 1 MeV/c is 1.7827e-27 kg m/s.

So p = 50 * 1.7827e-27 kg m/s ≈ 8.9135e-26 kg m/s.

Wait, but earlier I did a different approach and got 2.67e-26, which is close. So approximately 8.9e-26 kg m/s.

But perhaps I should just compute k.

k is p / ħ.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p / ħ ≈ (8.9135e-26 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J s) 

Calculate that:

8.9135e-26 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ (8.9135 / 1.0545718) * 1e8.

8.9135 / 1.0545718 ≈ 8.45.

So 8.45e8 m^-1.

Wait, that's 8.45e8 1/m.

But wait, let me compute the exact value. 

p = (50 MeV) / c.

But 1 MeV = 1e6 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 50 MeV = 50 * 1e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

p c = 50 MeV → p = (50 MeV) / c → 50 MeV in J is 8.01e-13 J, as before.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because p c is 50 MeV, but p is (50 MeV)/c.

So p = 50 MeV / c.

But 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J.

So 50 MeV = 8.01e-12 J.

Wait, but p c = 50 MeV → p = 50 MeV / c.

So p = (50e6 eV) / c.

But converting MeV to J:

50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-13 J.

p c = 8.01e-13 J → p = 8.01e-13 J / (3e8 m/s) → p ≈ 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Wait, that's different from the earlier approach. Now I'm getting confused. Which approach is correct?

Wait, let's do it correctly.

Energy E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

p c is sqrt( E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (8.01e-13)^2 - (0.511e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV)^2 ) → sqrt( (8.01e-13)^2 - (8.18e-14)^2 ) → approximately 8.01e-13 J.

So p c = 8.01e-13 J → p = (8.01e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p / ħ → (2.67e-21) / (1.05457e-34) → 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, 2.53e13 per meter? That seems really high. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula k = (2mE)^½ / ħ when E is in joules. Let me try that.

E = 50 MeV = 8.01e-13 J.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

So k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

Compute 2 m_e E: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J = 2*9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 → 2*9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 = 1.458e-43 kg J.

But 1 J = 1 kg m²/s² → so 2 m_e E = 1.458e-43 kg m²/s².

So sqrt(2 m_e E) = sqrt(1.458e-43) → approx 3.82e-22 kg m/s.

Then k = (3.82e-22) / (1.05457e-34) → 3.62e12 m^-1.

Wait, but that's different from the previous approach. Hmm, what's going on.

Wait, I think I messed up the relativistic vs non-relativistic approach.

Wait, when E is much larger than m_e c², then the non-relativistic formula E = p²/(2m) isn't accurate. So perhaps using the relativistic approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach of p ≈ E/c is correct.

Wait, let me compute k accurately.

In the relativistic case, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

We have E = 50 MeV. m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So E ≈ 50 MeV >> 0.511 MeV. So p c ≈ E → p ≈ E / c.

So p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

We can compute p in SI units.

50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

p = E / c → 8.01e-13 J / (3e8 m/s) → 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Then, k = p / ħ → 2.67e-21 / 1.05457e-34 → approx 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, that's a huge k. But maybe it's correct.

So now, going back to the formula for Im f(0):

Im f(0) = [1/(2k)] * Σ [ (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) ]

So let's compute each term for l=0,1,2,3,4.

Compute (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for each l.

Given the phase shifts: δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°.

So let's compute sin(2δ) for each l.

For l=0:

δ0=90° → 2δ0=180° → sin(180)=0. So this term is 0.

l=1:

δ=67° → 2δ=134° → sin(134) ≈ sin(180-46)=sin46≈0.7193.

So (2*1+1)=3 → term =3 * 0.7193 ≈2.1579.

l=2:

δ=55 → 110° → sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397 → (2*2+1)=5 → 5 * 0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3:

δ=30 → 60° → sin60=√3/2≈0.8660 → (2*3+1)=7 →7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:

δ=13 →26° → sin26≈0.4384 → (2*4+1)=9 →9 * 0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum all these terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1:2.1579.

l=2:4.6985.

l=3:6.062.

l=4:3.9456.

Sum = 0 + 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; 6.8564+6.062=12.9184; 12.9184+3.9456=16.864.

So the sum is approximately 16.864.

So Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * 16.864.

We have k ≈2.53e13 m^-1.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 2.53e13 ) → 1/(5.06e13) ≈1.976e-14.

Multiply by 16.864:

1.976e-14 *16.864 ≈3.33e-13.

So Im f(0)≈3.33e-13 m.

Wait, but the answer options are in femtometers (fm), where 1 fm=1e-15 m.

So 3.33e-13 m = 333e-15 m = 333 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 177, 251, etc.

Hmm, that suggests I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recompute k.

Wait, E =50 MeV.

Using E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 )

But with E=50 MeV, m_e c^2 =0.511 MeV.

So p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV / c.

So in terms of units, 1 MeV/c is approximately 5.344e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, no, wait, 1 eV/c is about 5.344e-30 kg m/s.

Wait, let me compute 1 MeV/c:

1 MeV =1e6 eV.

1 eV/c = (1.602e-19 J)/(3e8 m/s) )= (1.602e-19 kg m²/s²) / (3e8 m/s) )= 5.34e-28 kg m/s.

So 1 MeV/c =1e6 eV/c → 5.34e-28 *1e6 =5.34e-22 kg m/s.

So p =50 MeV/c →50 *5.34e-22 =2.67e-20 kg m/s.

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p / ħ → (2.67e-20) / (1.05457e-34) → approx 2.532e14 m^-1.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought I had 2.5e13 m^-1, but now I get 2.5e14. Because I must have messed up the decimal places earlier.

Wait, let's compute it accurately.

p =50 MeV/c =50 * (5.34e-22 kg m/s) =2.67e-20 kg m/s.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s.

k = p / ħ = 2.67e-20 /1.05457e-34 = (2.67 /1.05457) * 1e14 → approx 2.53 * 1e14 → 2.53e14 m^-1.

So 2.53e14 m^-1.

Then, 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *2.53e14) ) = 1/(5.06e14) ≈1.976e-15 m^-1.

Multiply by the sum 16.864:

1.976e-15 m^-1 *16.864 ≈3.33e-14 m.

Wait, 3.33e-14 meters is 33.3 fm (since 1 fm=1e-15 m).

But the options are in the hundreds. Hmm. Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, 33 fm isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for Im f(0). Let me re-examine.

Wait, another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude can be calculated using the formula:

Im f(θ) = (k/(4π)) Σ [ (2l+1) (k/k')^l sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ) ]

But for θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (k/k')^l.

But since it's elastic scattering, k =k', so (k/k')^l =1.

So Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

But earlier I used another formula where it was [1/(2k)] * sum. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula.

In partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ, φ) = Σ [ ( (2l+1) (k/k')^l e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ) / (k) ) * P_l(cosθ) ]

Wait, but this might not be right. Alternatively, the formula I found in textbooks is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ]

So taking the imaginary part:

Im f(θ) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (2l+1) Im( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ]

Im( e^{2iδ} -1 ) is sin(2δ), so:

Im f(θ) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ]

But for θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

Thus, Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (k/k')^l ]

But since k =k', (k/k')^l =1, so:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Earlier, I think I had an incorrect factor. The correct factor is (1/(2k)), not (k/(4π)). So I think the correct formula is (1/(2k)) * sum.

So with k=2.53e14 m^-1,

Im f(0) = (1/(2 * 2.53e14 )) * sum.

Sum is 16.864.

So,

Im f(0) = (1/(5.06e14)) *16.864 → 16.864 /5.06e14 → approx 3.33e-14 m.

Which is 33.3 fm.

But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait another thought: perhaps I'm using the wrong units for k. Let's think in terms of inverse femtometers, since the options are in fm.

Wait, wait, let me recompute k correctly.

Wait, E =50 MeV.

We can compute the wavevector k in terms of inverse femtometers.

We know that 1 fm^-1 is 1e15 m^-1.

So if k is 2.53e14 m^-1, that's 2.53e14 / 1e15 = 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute k in units where ħ c is set to 197.33 MeV fm.

Yes, that's a standard approach in particle physics.

So, let's compute k in inverse femtometers.

The formula for k is k = (2 m_e E )^(1/2) / ħ.

But using natural units where ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, but in natural units, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So 1 fm = (ħ c)/(197.33 MeV).

Compute k = (2 m_e E )^(1/2) / ħ.

Wait, perhaps using the relativistic expression is better.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with high energy, E ≈ pc → p ≈ E /c.

But let me use the formula k = (E^2 - m_e^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (ħ c).

Wait, in units where ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so:

k = sqrt( E^2 - m_e^2 c^4 ) / (ħ c) → but E and m_e c^2 are in MeV.

So E =50 MeV, m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So k ≈50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) → approximately 0.253 fm^-1.

So k ≈0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting somewhere.

Now, the formula is:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So substituting k=0.253 fm^-1:

1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.253) fm → 1/(0.506) fm ≈1.976 fm.

Multiply by the sum 16.864.

1.976 fm *16.864 ≈33.3 fm.

Hmm, same answer as before.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of (2m_e E) or something else.

Wait, perhaps I forgot the factor of k/(4π) in the formula. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, according to the partial wave expansion, the correct formula is:

Im f(θ) = (k/(4π)) Σ [ (2l +1) (k/k')^l sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ) ]

But since k =k', it becomes:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * Σ [ (2l +1) sin(2δ_l) ]

So in this case, k is in m^-1.

Earlier, I had k=2.53e14 m^-1.

So compute (k/(4π)) * sum.

Sum is 16.864.

k/(4π) = (2.53e14) / (12.566) → approx 1.999e13 ≈2e13.

Multiply by 16.864 → 3.37e14.

Wait, 3.37e14 m^-1. That's 3.37e14 m^-1 → 3.37e14 /1e15 fm^-1 →0.337 fm^-1.

Wait, but f is dimensionless? Or what's the unit? Because the scattering amplitude f has units of (fm)^-1 (since in natural units, 1 fm = 1/(197 MeV) ≈ 0.005 MeV^-1, but perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f has units of length (or inverse momentum transfer). But in the formula, Im f is in units of length.

Wait, the options are in fm, so we need to compute Im f(0) in fm.

But according to the formula, with k in m^-1, the units would be (1/(2k)) * (dimensionless sum) → (m) * m^-1 → dimensionless? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula correctly.

In the formula:

Im f(θ) = (k/(4π)) Σ [ ... ]

So if k is in m^-1, then:

(k/(4π)) is in m^-1.

Multiply by the sum (dimensionless) → Im f(0) is in m^-1.

But the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 m, but as a length unit, so 1/(fm^-1) = fm.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

But with k in units of inverse femtometers (fm^-1).

So, k =0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/(2k) =1/(2 * 0.253) fm = 1.976 fm.

Multiply by sum 16.864 → 1.976 *16.864 ≈33.3 fm.

Which is what I had earlier.

So the answer is approximately 33.3 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me compute the sum again.

l=0: 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134) → wait, 134 degrees.

sin(134) = sin(180-46) = sin(46) ≈0.7193.

So 3*0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110) → sin(110)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

No, the sum is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ) ]

So Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (k/k')^l ]

Ah, but wait, perhaps the correct formula is (e^{iδ} -1 ) instead of (e^{2iδ} -1 ), but no, I don't think so.

Wait, another source says that f(θ) is given by (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ]

Yes, so the formula I had before is correct.

So Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )

With k=0.253 fm^-1, and sum=16.864.

So Im f= (1/(2*0.253)) *16.864 ≈ (1.976) *16.864 ≈33.3 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: Compute k in inverse femtometers.

E =50 MeV.

Using E = pc, p =E/c → p =50 MeV/c.

But 1 MeV/c = (197.33 MeV fm )^{-1} → since ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, no, 1 fm^-1 = 197.33 MeV / (ħ c) → but ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, 1 MeV/c = 1/(197.33 MeV fm ) * (MeV fm) ) → Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled.

Alternatively, since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm,

p = E /c →50 MeV/c.

But p = (50 MeV/c) → in units of inverse femtometers:

p =50 MeV/c → 50 / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 0.253 fm^-1.

So k = p / ħ → but wait, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm /c.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, let's compute k in terms of 1/fm.

E =50 MeV.

p = E /c →50 MeV/c.

But 1 MeV/c = 5.344e-28 kg m/s.

So p =50 *5.344e-28 → 2.672e-26 kg m/s.

k = p / ħ.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

k= (2.672e-26 )/(1.0545718e-34 ) → approx 2.53e8 m^-1.

Convert to fm^-1: 1 m =1e15 fm → 1 m^-1=1e-15 fm^-1.

So 2.53e8 m^-1 =2.53e8 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.53e-7 fm^-1.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I do the exponents right?

Wait, 1 m^-1 = 1e15 fm^-1, because 1 fm =1e-15 m. So 1 m =1e15 fm → 1 m^-1 = (1e15 fm )^{-1} → 1e-15 fm^-1.

So 2.53e8 m^-1 =2.53e8 *1e-15 fm^-1 =2.53e-7 fm^-1.

So k=2.53e-7 fm^-1.

Then, 1/(2k) =1/(2 *2.53e-7 ) fm ≈1.976e6 fm.

Multiply by sum 16.864 →1.976e6 *16.864 ≈3.33e7 fm.

Wait, that's 33 million femtometers. Which is way bigger than the options. So I must have messed up the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes the factor of k/(4π). Let me re-calculate with that.

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * sum.

k=2.53e-7 fm^-1.

So (k/(4π)) = (2.53e-7) / (12.566) ≈1.976e-8 fm^-1.

Multiply by sum 16.864 →1.976e-8 *16.864≈3.33e-7 fm^-1.

Which is 0.333 fm^-1. But Im f must have units of length (fm), not inverse.

This is getting too confusing. I think I made a mistake in the units and perhaps I should use natural units where ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

In such units, k is E/(ħ c) → but E is 50 MeV.

So k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) → k=0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(0.506 fm^-1 ) → 1.976 fm.

Multiply by sum 16.864 → 1.976 *16.864 ≈33.3 fm.

So the result is about 33.3 fm. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again:

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Hmm, 33 is close to none. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, wait a minute, perhaps I'm missing that the phase shifts are given for l=0 to 4, but in the given problem, it's stated to ignore the rest. So l starts from 0, 1, 2, 3,4. So sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses δ_l instead of 2δ_l. Wait, no, the formula for Im f is based on sin(2δ_l ), because Im (e^{2iδ} -1 )= 2 sin δ cos δ * 2i ?

Wait no, no. Wait, let me re-express e^{2iδ} -1.

e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ → e^{2iδ} = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ).

So e^{2iδ} -1 = cos(2δ) -1 + i sin(2δ).

The imaginary part is sin(2δ).

So that part is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different way.

Wait, another thought: the phase shifts δ_l are given in the problem as δ0=90°, δ1=67°, etc. So for l=0, δ0=90°, which is π/2 radians.

Wait, but for l=0, sin(2δ0)=sin(180°)=0, which is what I had.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use (2l +1) times sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula for Im f is based on the scattering amplitude:

f(θ) = Σ [ ( (2l +1)/(2ik) ) (k/k')^l (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) ]

So the imaginary part is:

Im f(θ) = Σ [ (2l +1)/(2k) ) (k/k')^l Im (e^{2iδ} -1 ) P_l ]

Im (e^{2iδ} -1 )= sin(2δ).

But wait, perhaps the correct formula uses sin(δ), not sin(2δ).

Wait, no. Because e^{2iδ} -1 = e^{iδ}^2 -1. So the imaginary part is sin(2δ).

So I think the formula is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the phase shifts in the problem are given as the real part of the phase shifts. Or perhaps the formula uses δ, not 2δ.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for Im f is (2l +1) sin δ_l.

Wait, think for l=0.

δ0=90°, sin δ0=1. So (2*0 +1)*1 =1.

But the sum would include l=0.

But then for l=0, sin(2δ)=0. But for l=0, if the formula used sin δ, then for l=0, it would contribute 1.

But in our calculation, l=0 contributes 0 because sin(180) is zero.

Wait, maybe the correct formula uses sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l).

So let's recompute with sin δ_l.

Sum = Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin90=1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3*(0.9205)≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*(0.8192)=4.096.

l=3:7*sin30=7*(0.5)=3.5.

l=4:9*sin13≈9*(0.22495)=2.02455.

Sum =1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.

So sum is approximately13.382.

Then, Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) *13.382.

k=0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/(2k)=1/(0.506) fm≈1.976 fm.

Multiply by 13.382 →1.976 *13.382≈26.5 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l, and the factor is k/(4π).

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= (k/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So with k=0.253 fm^-1.

Compute (0.253/(4π)) *16.864.

0.253/(12.566)≈0.02013.

0.02013 *16.864≈0.339 fm.

Which is still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= (1/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So sum=16.864.

(1/(4π)) *16.864 →16.864/(12.566)≈1.342 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

Sum=13.382.

1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

13.382 *1.976 ≈26.5 fm.

So about 26.5 fm.

Looking at the options, D is 251.271 fm, which is about 10 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of (2m_e E) inside the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the partial wave coefficients as (2l+1) (k/(k'))^l e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l / (k).

But I think I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total cross-section and then relate it to the imaginary part.

Wait, The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is (4π/k²) * Im f(0).

So Im f(0) = (k²/(4π)) * σ_total.

But without knowing σ_total, that might not help.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, 33.3 fm is not present. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, I think the confusion is arising because I'm not handling the units properly for k.

Wait, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, the wavevector k is E.

But electrons have rest mass, so the correct expression is k = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) → but I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps to compute k in units of inverse femtometers, given E=50 MeV.

Using the relation:

k (fm^-1) = (E (MeV)) / (197.33 MeV fm )

So k =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

Which is what I had earlier.

So Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Sum=16.864.

1/(2k)=1/(0.506) →1.976 fm.

1.976 *16.864=33.3 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (4π k).

Sum=13.382.

k=0.253 fm^-1.

So 13.382/(4π *0.253) →13.382/(3.182) ≈4.207 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

Which would be 13.382/(2 *0.253) → 13.382/(0.506) ≈26.46 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2 sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the factor is (k/(2π)).

So Im f(0)= (k/(2π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

k=0.253 fm^-1.

So (0.253)/(6.283) ≈0.0403 fm.

Multiply by 16.864 →0.0403 *16.864≈0.677 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (k/(4π)).

So (0.253)/(12.566)→≈0.02013.

Multiply by 16.864 →0.339 fm.

No.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to select the closest option to 33.3 fm, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use (2l+1) sin δ_l, leading to sum=13.382, and then (1/(2k)) * sum=26.5 fm. Looking at the options, D is 251.271 fm, which is about 10 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k. Let me recompute k.

E=50 MeV.

k = E / (ħ c ) → since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So k =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

Yes.

Then, (1/(2k))=1/(0.506) ≈1.976 fm.

Multiply by sum=16.864 →33.3 fm.

But options do not have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be (1/0.253) *13.382 →52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that k=k' is wrong. For elastic scattering, |k|=|k'|, but k and k' may have different directions. But in the formula for the scattering amplitude, (k/k')^l is the ratio, but when k'=k, as in elastic scattering, this ratio is 1.

Wait, but perhaps the phase shifts given are for different l's, and only the first few are given. But the problem says to ignore the rest, so we consider l=0 to 4.

I think I've tried all possible approaches and the answer isn't matching any option. The closest would be around 33 fm, but the options are B:355, C:177, D:251.

Wait, let me think about possible factors. Oh! Wait, perhaps in the formula, the sum is multiplied by (k/(2π)).

Wait, Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So k=0.253 fm^-1.

(0.253/ (2 *3.1416)) =0.253/(6.283) ≈0.0403 fm.

Multiply by sum=16.864 →0.0403 *16.864≈0.677 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (k/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

k=0.253, so (0.253)/(12.566)≈0.02013.

Multiply by 16.864→0.339 fm.

No.

Hmm. Perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Wait, no, the question says phase shifts are in degrees.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) (1 - cos(2δ_l )) → which is 2 sin² δ_l.

But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l ), but I think that's not right.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k) )

So sum=13.382.

1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

13.382 *1.976=26.46 fm.

Which is close to option D, which is 251.271 fm.

Wait, 26.46 is about 1/10 of 251.271. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Ah! Oh wait, I think I know where I went wrong. The initial calculation of k was in inverse femtometers (fm^-1), but in the formula, k should be in inverse meters, not inverse femtometers.

Because when we compute 1/(2k), if k is in fm^-1, then 1/(2k) is in fm.

But earlier, I computed k=0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/(2k) =1/(2 *0.253) =1.976 fm.

But wait, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k/(4π)) times the sum in the correct units.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should recalculate using k in inverse meters.

Wait, 1 fm =1e-15 m.

So k=0.253 fm^-1 =0.253 / 1e-15 m^-1 =2.53e14 m^-1.

So 1/(2k) =1/(5.06e14 m^-1 )=1.976e-15 m.

Multiply by sum=16.864 →1.976e-15 *16.864≈3.33e-14 m.

Which is 33.3 fm.

Hmm.

I think I've tried everything and can't reconcile the result with the options. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l, and the sum is 13.382.

Then Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) *13.382 =1.976 *13.382≈26.5 fm.

But the closest option is D)251.271 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 10 somewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum with a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the phase shifts are in radians.

Wait, let me compute the sum with δ in radians.

l=0: δ0=90°=pi/2 radians. sin(2δ)=sin(pi)=0. So term is 0.

l=1: δ=67°=1.169 radians. 2δ=2.338 radians. sin(2.338)=approx 0.7193. 3*0.7193=2.1579.

Same as before. So sum remains 16.864.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 33 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k) )

sum=13.382.

1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

13.382 *1.976=26.46 fm.

Hmm, 26.46 is about 26.5 fm. None of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k/ (2π) )

k=0.253 fm^-1.

So (sum=13.382) * (0.253/(2*3.1416)) →13.382 * (0.0403) ≈0.539 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k/(4π) )

Which would be 13.382 * (0.253/(12.566)) →13.382 *0.02013≈0.269 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k) )

Which would be 13.382 *1.976≈26.5 fm.

Again, 26.5 is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by (1/k) instead of (1/(2k)).

So 1/k=3.95 fm.

13.382 *3.95≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k/(2π) )

k=0.253 fm^-1 →0.253/(6.283)=0.0403 fm.

13.382 *0.0403≈0.539 fm.

No.

I'm out of ideas. Perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is option C)177.675 fm, which is half of 355.351 (option B). Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, if I take the sum as 16.864 and multiply by (1/k)=3.95 fm:

16.864 *3.95≈66.6 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) * (something).

Wait, perhaps the formula should be Im f(0) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k) )

sum=13.382.

1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

13.382 *1.976≈26.5 fm.

Again, no.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Wait, but then the sum is 13.382.

1.976 *13.382≈26.5 fm.

No.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not in the options, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the sum should include all l from 0 to 4, but perhaps the phase shifts are given beyond l=4. But the problem says to ignore the rest, so only l=0 to4 are considered.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the phase shifts.

Wait, the given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. So all five terms are included.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with the calculation and conclude that the correct answer is approximately 33.3 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)177.675 fm, considering a possible factor of 5.31 due to unit conversion errors. But I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction using the given phase shifts and the formula derived from partial wave analysis. The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( k \)
The energy of the electrons is \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), and the electron mass is \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \). Using relativistic energy relations, the wavevector \( k \) is calculated as:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c}
\]

In natural units where \( \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm} \), we find:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \)
The phase shifts are given as:
- \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \), \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \), \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \), \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \).

For each \( l \), compute \( \sin(2\delta_l) \) and multiply by \( (2l+1) \):
- \( l=0 \): \( \sin(2\cdot 90^\circ) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), contribution = \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
- \( l=1 \): \( \sin(2 \cdot 67^\circ) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \), contribution = \( 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579 \).
- \( l=2 \): \( \sin(2 \cdot 55^\circ) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), contribution = \( 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \).
- \( l=3 \): \( \sin(2 \cdot 30^\circ) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), contribution = \( 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \).
- \( l=4 \): \( \sin(2 \cdot 13^\circ) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), contribution = \( 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.864
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im } f(0) \)
Substitute \( k = 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \) and the sum \( \sum = 16.864 \) into the formula:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \cdot \sum = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 0.253} \cdot 16.864 \approx 1.976 \cdot 16.864 \approx 33.3 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im } f(0) \approx 33.3 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest plausible answer, considering potential errors in unit conversion or interpretation, is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately five times larger than the computed value.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitude and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question says we're dealing with elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored. We need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ, k') comes from partial wave analysis. Each partial wave contributes with an exponential term involving the phase shift for that angular momentum. 

The formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ, k') = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ ( (k/k')^(l) ) * e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l) ) ] * ... Wait, maybe it's better to think about the partial wave expansion. Oh right, for each partial wave l, the amplitude is ( ( (k/(k'))^l ) * e^{iδ_l} ) / (something with 2i and (l)(l+1))).

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over l of ( ( (k/(k'))^l ) * ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) ) / (2ik (2l+1)) ) * some Legendre polynomial terms. Oh wait, no, the Legendre polynomials come into play when you have the angular dependence. But the question says to calculate along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, along the beam direction is when θ=0°, right? So that's the forward direction.

But wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part. Oh, right! For the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, especially along the incident direction (θ=0), there's a simpler expression. 

I think the formula is Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) (k/(k'))^l ) * sin δ_l ) ) / (2ik) Wait, that's not quite right. Alternatively, I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by:

Im f(θ) = (k/(4π)) * Σ [ ( (2l + 1) (k/(k'))^l ) * sin δ_l ) * P_l(cosθ) ]

But when θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So that simplifies the sum.

So Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) (k/(k'))^l * sin δ_l ]

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact factors. Let me think again. The general form for the scattering amplitude f(θ) from partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = Σ [ ( (2l + 1) (k/(k'))^l ) / (2ik) ) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * P_l(cosθ) ]

So taking the imaginary part of f(θ), we get:

Im f(θ) = Σ [ (2l +1) (k/(k'))^l / (2k) ) * Im ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * P_l(cosθ) ]

Wait, because e^{2iδ} -1 is 2i e^{iδ} sin δ, so the imaginary part of that would be 2 e^{iδ} sin δ. But wait, let me calculate: e^{2iδ} -1 = e^{iδ}^2 -1 = (cos δ + i sin δ)^2 -1 = cos 2δ + 2i sin δ cos δ -1.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of Im(e^{iθ} -1) which is sin θ. Hmm, no, in this case the term is e^{2iδ} -1. Let's compute it:

e^{2iδ} -1 = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ) -1 = [cos(2δ) -1] + i sin(2δ) 

The imaginary part of this is sin(2δ).

Alternatively, e^{iφ} -1 has an imaginary part of sin φ, but here we have e^{2iδ} -1, so the imaginary part is sin(2δ). Wait, but in the expression for the amplitude, we have Im (e^{2iδ} -1 ) which is sin(2δ).

So Im f(θ) = Σ [ (2l +1) (k/(k'))^l / (2k) ) * sin(2δ_l) * P_l(cosθ) ]

But when θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l, so:

Im f(0) = [1/(2k)] * Σ [ (2l+1) (k/(k'))^l * sin(2δ_l) ]

So that's the expression we need.

But wait, the problem gives the phase shifts δ_0, δ_1, etc., so l runs from 0 to 4. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

So let's compute each term for l=0 to 4.

But wait, what's k and k' here? Oh, k is the initial wavevector, and k' is the final wavevector. But for elastic scattering, since energy is conserved, |k| = |k'|, so k' = k. So that (k/k')^l = 1 for all l, right? Because k' = k. So the term (k/k')^l is 1.

Wait, but wait, for scattering, the initial and final momenta are the same magnitude since it's elastic. So yes, k = k'.

So that simplifies the sum: (k/k')^l is 1. So the sum becomes:

Σ [ (2l +1) * sin(2δ_l) ]

Then, Im f(0) = [1/(2k)] * Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

Wait, but what is k?

k is the wavevector of the electrons. The energy is given as 50 MeV. So we can compute k.

The electrons have energy E = 50 MeV. Since electrons are light, we need to compute their momentum. For non-relativistic speeds, E ≈ (ħ² k²)/(2m), but 50 MeV is relativistic.

The mass of the electron is m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV. So E = 50 MeV is much larger than m_e c², so we can use relativistic expressions.

The relativistic energy for an electron is E = γ m_e c², and momentum p = γ m_e v. The relation between E and p is E² = (p c)^2 c^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

So E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 )

But since E is 50 MeV, much larger than m_e c² (0.511 MeV), we can approximate p c ≈ E.

So p ≈ E / c.

So k = p / ħ.

So k ≈ (E) / (ħ c).

But let me compute it accurately.

First, compute the momentum p.

E = 50 MeV = 50 x 10^6 eV.

Convert E to joules: 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.

E = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

The mass of the electron is m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

The speed of light c = 3e8 m/s.

Compute p using E² = (p c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

Solve for p:

p c = sqrt( E² - (m_e c^2)^2 )

E² is (8.01e-13 J)^2.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.18e-14 J.

So (m_e c²)^2 = (8.18e-14)^2 ≈ 6.69e-27 J².

E² = (8.01e-13)^2 ≈ 6.42e-25 J².

So E² - (m_e c²)^2 ≈ 6.42e-25 - 6.69e-27 ≈ 6.42e-25 J² (since 6.69e-27 is much smaller).

So p c ≈ sqrt(6.42e-25) = approx 8.01e-13 kg m/s * m/s.

Wait, units: sqrt(J²) is J, which is kg m²/s². So p c has units kg m²/s² * s/m (Wait, wait, I'm getting confused with units here. Let me compute it numerically.)

p c = sqrt(E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(6.42e-25) = approx 8.01e-13 J.

But J = kg m²/s², so p c = 8.01e-13 kg m²/s².

But p has units kg m/s, so p c = kg m/s * m/s = kg m²/s². So yes, correct.

So p = (8.01e-13 kg m²/s²) / c.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p ≈ (8.01e-13) / (3e8) kg m/s.

Which is approximately 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Wait, but that seems small. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach. Since E is much larger than m_e c², p ≈ E/c.

E is 50 MeV. Let's compute p in units of MeV/c.

p = E / c = 50 MeV / c.

But we can compute p in SI units.

1 MeV/c is approximately 5.344e-28 kg m/s.

So p = 50 * 5.344e-28 kg m/s = 2.672e-26 kg m/s.

Wait, wait, that's a big discrepancy. Earlier I got 2.67e-21, which is 1e5 times bigger. Hmm, must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me compute p c.

E (MeV) = 50 MeV.

p c (MeV) = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ 50 MeV.

So p c ≈50 MeV → p ≈50 MeV / c.

But 1 MeV/c is 1.7827e-27 kg m/s.

So p = 50 * 1.7827e-27 kg m/s ≈ 8.9135e-26 kg m/s.

Wait, but earlier I did a different approach and got 2.67e-26, which is close. So approximately 8.9e-26 kg m/s.

But perhaps I should just compute k.

k is p / ħ.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p / ħ ≈ (8.9135e-26 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J s) 

Calculate that:

8.9135e-26 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ (8.9135 / 1.0545718) * 1e8.

8.9135 / 1.0545718 ≈ 8.45.

So 8.45e8 m^-1.

Wait, that's 8.45e8 1/m.

But wait, let me compute the exact value. 

p = (50 MeV) / c.

But 1 MeV = 1e6 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 50 MeV = 50 * 1e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

p c = 50 MeV → p = (50 MeV) / c → 50 MeV in J is 8.01e-13 J, as before.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because p c is 50 MeV, but p is (50 MeV)/c.

So p = 50 MeV / c.

But 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J.

So 50 MeV = 8.01e-12 J.

Wait, but p c = 50 MeV → p = 50 MeV / c.

So p = (50e6 eV) / c.

But converting MeV to J:

50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-13 J.

p c = 8.01e-13 J → p = 8.01e-13 J / (3e8 m/s) → p ≈ 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Wait, that's different from the earlier approach. Now I'm getting confused. Which approach is correct?

Wait, let's do it correctly.

Energy E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

p c is sqrt( E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (8.01e-13)^2 - (0.511e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV)^2 ) → sqrt( (8.01e-13)^2 - (8.18e-14)^2 ) → approximately 8.01e-13 J.

So p c = 8.01e-13 J → p = (8.01e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p / ħ → (2.67e-21) / (1.05457e-34) → 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, 2.53e13 per meter? That seems really high. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula k = (2mE)^½ / ħ when E is in joules. Let me try that.

E = 50 MeV = 8.01e-13 J.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

So k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

Compute 2 m_e E: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J = 2*9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 → 2*9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 = 1.458e-43 kg J.

But 1 J = 1 kg m²/s² → so 2 m_e E = 1.458e-43 kg m²/s².

So sqrt(2 m_e E) = sqrt(1.458e-43) → approx 3.82e-22 kg m/s.

Then k = (3.82e-22) / (1.05457e-34) → 3.62e12 m^-1.

Wait, but that's different from the previous approach. Hmm, what's going on.

Wait, I think I messed up the relativistic vs non-relativistic approach.

Wait, when E is much larger than m_e c², then the non-relativistic formula E = p²/(2m) isn't accurate. So perhaps using the relativistic approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach of p ≈ E/c is correct.

Wait, let me compute k accurately.

In the relativistic case, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

We have E = 50 MeV. m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So E ≈ 50 MeV >> 0.511 MeV. So p c ≈ E → p ≈ E / c.

So p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

We can compute p in SI units.

50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

p = E / c → 8.01e-13 J / (3e8 m/s) → 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Then, k = p / ħ → 2.67e-21 / 1.05457e-34 → approx 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, that's a huge k. But maybe it's correct.

So now, going back to the formula for Im f(0):

Im f(0) = [1/(2k)] * Σ [ (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) ]

So let's compute each term for l=0,1,2,3,4.

Compute (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for each l.

Given the phase shifts: δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°.

So let's compute sin(2δ) for each l.

For l=0:

δ0=90° → 2δ0=180° → sin(180)=0. So this term is 0.

l=1:

δ=67° → 2δ=134° → sin(134) ≈ sin(180-46)=sin46≈0.7193.

So (2*1+1)=3 → term =3 * 0.7193 ≈2.1579.

l=2:

δ=55 → 110° → sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397 → (2*2+1)=5 → 5 * 0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3:

δ=30 → 60° → sin60=√3/2≈0.8660 → (2*3+1)=7 →7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:

δ=13 →26° → sin26≈0.4384 → (2*4+1)=9 →9 * 0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum all these terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1:2.1579.

l=2:4.6985.

l=3:6.062.

l=4:3.9456.

Sum = 0 + 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; 6.8564+6.062=12.9184; 12.9184+3.9456=16.864.

So the sum is approximately 16.864.

So Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * 16.864.

We have k ≈2.53e13 m^-1.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 2.53e13 ) → 1/(5.06e13) ≈1.976e-14.

Multiply by 16.864:

1.976e-14 *16.864 ≈3.33e-13.

So Im f(0)≈3.33e-13 m.

Wait, but the answer options are in femtometers (fm), where 1 fm=1e-15 m.

So 3.33e-13 m = 333e-15 m = 333 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 177, 251, etc.

Hmm, that suggests I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recompute k.

Wait, E =50 MeV.

Using E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 )

But with E=50 MeV, m_e c^2 =0.511 MeV.

So p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV / c.

So in terms of units, 1 MeV/c is approximately 5.344e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, no, wait, 1 eV/c is about 5.344e-30 kg m/s.

Wait, let me compute 1 MeV/c:

1 MeV =1e6 eV.

1 eV/c = (1.602e-19 J)/(3e8 m/s) )= (1.602e-19 kg m²/s²) / (3e8 m/s) )= 5.34e-28 kg m/s.

So 1 MeV/c =1e6 eV/c → 5.34e-28 *1e6 =5.34e-22 kg m/s.

So p =50 MeV/c →50 *5.34e-22 =2.67e-20 kg m/s.

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p / ħ → (2.67e-20) / (1.05457e-34) → approx 2.532e14 m^-1.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought I had 2.5e13 m^-1, but now I get 2.5e14. Because I must have messed up the decimal places earlier.

Wait, let's compute it accurately.

p =50 MeV/c =50 * (5.34e-22 kg m/s) =2.67e-20 kg m/s.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s.

k = p / ħ = 2.67e-20 /1.05457e-34 = (2.67 /1.05457) * 1e14 → approx 2.53 * 1e14 → 2.53e14 m^-1.

So 2.53e14 m^-1.

Then, 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *2.53e14) ) = 1/(5.06e14) ≈1.976e-15 m^-1.

Multiply by the sum 16.864:

1.976e-15 m^-1 *16.864 ≈3.33e-14 m.

Wait, 3.33e-14 meters is 33.3 fm (since 1 fm=1e-15 m).

But the options are in the hundreds. Hmm. Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, 33 fm isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for Im f(0). Let me re-examine.

Wait, another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude can be calculated using the formula:

Im f(θ) = (k/(4π)) Σ [ (2l+1) (k/k')^l sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ) ]

But for θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (k/k')^l.

But since it's elastic scattering, k =k', so (k/k')^l =1.

So Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

But earlier I used another formula where it was [1/(2k)] * sum. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula.

In partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ, φ) = Σ [ ( (2l+1) (k/k')^l e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ) / (k) ) * P_l(cosθ) ]

Wait, but this might not be right. Alternatively, the formula I found in textbooks is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ]

So taking the imaginary part:

Im f(θ) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (2l+1) Im( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ]

Im( e^{2iδ} -1 ) is sin(2δ), so:

Im f(θ) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ]

But for θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

Thus, Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (k/k')^l ]

But since k =k', (k/k')^l =1, so:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Earlier, I think I had an incorrect factor. The correct factor is (1/(2k)), not (k/(4π)). So I think the correct formula is (1/(2k)) * sum.

So with k=2.53e14 m^-1,

Im f(0) = (1/(2 * 2.53e14 )) * sum.

Sum is 16.864.

So,

Im f(0) = (1/(5.06e14)) *16.864 → 16.864 /5.06e14 → approx 3.33e-14 m.

Which is 33.3 fm.

But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait another thought: perhaps I'm using the wrong units for k. Let's think in terms of inverse femtometers, since the options are in fm.

Wait, wait, let me recompute k correctly.

Wait, E =50 MeV.

We can compute the wavevector k in terms of inverse femtometers.

We know that 1 fm^-1 is 1e15 m^-1.

So if k is 2.53e14 m^-1, that's 2.53e14 / 1e15 = 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute k in units where ħ c is set to 197.33 MeV fm.

Yes, that's a standard approach in particle physics.

So, let's compute k in inverse femtometers.

The formula for k is k = (2 m_e E )^(1/2) / ħ.

But using natural units where ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, but in natural units, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So 1 fm = (ħ c)/(197.33 MeV).

Compute k = (2 m_e E )^(1/2) / ħ.

Wait, perhaps using the relativistic expression is better.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with high energy, E ≈ pc → p ≈ E /c.

But let me use the formula k = (E^2 - m_e^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (ħ c).

Wait, in units where ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so:

k = sqrt( E^2 - m_e^2 c^4 ) / (ħ c) → but E and m_e c^2 are in MeV.

So E =50 MeV, m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So k ≈50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) → approximately 0.253 fm^-1.

So k ≈0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting somewhere.

Now, the formula is:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So substituting k=0.253 fm^-1:

1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.253) fm → 1/(0.506) fm ≈1.976 fm.

Multiply by the sum 16.864.

1.976 fm *16.864 ≈33.3 fm.

Hmm, same answer as before.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of (2m_e E) or something else.

Wait, perhaps I forgot the factor of k/(4π) in the formula. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, according to the partial wave expansion, the correct formula is:

Im f(θ) = (k/(4π)) Σ [ (2l +1) (k/k')^l sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ) ]

But since k =k', it becomes:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * Σ [ (2l +1) sin(2δ_l) ]

So in this case, k is in m^-1.

Earlier, I had k=2.53e14 m^-1.

So compute (k/(4π)) * sum.

Sum is 16.864.

k/(4π) = (2.53e14) / (12.566) → approx 1.999e13 ≈2e13.

Multiply by 16.864 → 3.37e14.

Wait, 3.37e14 m^-1. That's 3.37e14 m^-1 → 3.37e14 /1e15 fm^-1 →0.337 fm^-1.

Wait, but f is dimensionless? Or what's the unit? Because the scattering amplitude f has units of (fm)^-1 (since in natural units, 1 fm = 1/(197 MeV) ≈ 0.005 MeV^-1, but perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f has units of length (or inverse momentum transfer). But in the formula, Im f is in units of length.

Wait, the options are in fm, so we need to compute Im f(0) in fm.

But according to the formula, with k in m^-1, the units would be (1/(2k)) * (dimensionless sum) → (m) * m^-1 → dimensionless? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula correctly.

In the formula:

Im f(θ) = (k/(4π)) Σ [ ... ]

So if k is in m^-1, then:

(k/(4π)) is in m^-1.

Multiply by the sum (dimensionless) → Im f(0) is in m^-1.

But the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 m, but as a length unit, so 1/(fm^-1) = fm.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

But with k in units of inverse femtometers (fm^-1).

So, k =0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/(2k) =1/(2 * 0.253) fm = 1.976 fm.

Multiply by sum 16.864 → 1.976 *16.864 ≈33.3 fm.

Which is what I had earlier.

So the answer is approximately 33.3 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me compute the sum again.

l=0: 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134) → wait, 134 degrees.

sin(134) = sin(180-46) = sin(46) ≈0.7193.

So 3*0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110) → sin(110)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

No, the sum is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ) ]

So Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (k/k')^l ]

Ah, but wait, perhaps the correct formula is (e^{iδ} -1 ) instead of (e^{2iδ} -1 ), but no, I don't think so.

Wait, another source says that f(θ) is given by (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (k/k')^l P_l(cosθ) ]

Yes, so the formula I had before is correct.

So Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )

With k=0.253 fm^-1, and sum=16.864.

So Im f= (1/(2*0.253)) *16.864 ≈ (1.976) *16.864 ≈33.3 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: Compute k in inverse femtometers.

E =50 MeV.

Using E = pc, p =E/c → p =50 MeV/c.

But 1 MeV/c = (197.33 MeV fm )^{-1} → since ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, no, 1 fm^-1 = 197.33 MeV / (ħ c) → but ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, 1 MeV/c = 1/(197.33 MeV fm ) * (MeV fm) ) → Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled.

Alternatively, since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm,

p = E /c →50 MeV/c.

But p = (50 MeV/c) → in units of inverse femtometers:

p =50 MeV/c → 50 / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 0.253 fm^-1.

So k = p / ħ → but wait, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm /c.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, let's compute k in terms of 1/fm.

E =50 MeV.

p = E /c →50 MeV/c.

But 1 MeV/c = 5.344e-28 kg m/s.

So p =50 *5.344e-28 → 2.672e-26 kg m/s.

k = p / ħ.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

k= (2.672e-26 )/(1.0545718e-34 ) → approx 2.53e8 m^-1.

Convert to fm^-1: 1 m =1e15 fm → 1 m^-1=1e-15 fm^-1.

So 2.53e8 m^-1 =2.53e8 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.53e-7 fm^-1.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I do the exponents right?

Wait, 1 m^-1 = 1e15 fm^-1, because 1 fm =1e-15 m. So 1 m =1e15 fm → 1 m^-1 = (1e15 fm )^{-1} → 1e-15 fm^-1.

So 2.53e8 m^-1 =2.53e8 *1e-15 fm^-1 =2.53e-7 fm^-1.

So k=2.53e-7 fm^-1.

Then, 1/(2k) =1/(2 *2.53e-7 ) fm ≈1.976e6 fm.

Multiply by sum 16.864 →1.976e6 *16.864 ≈3.33e7 fm.

Wait, that's 33 million femtometers. Which is way bigger than the options. So I must have messed up the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes the factor of k/(4π). Let me re-calculate with that.

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * sum.

k=2.53e-7 fm^-1.

So (k/(4π)) = (2.53e-7) / (12.566) ≈1.976e-8 fm^-1.

Multiply by sum 16.864 →1.976e-8 *16.864≈3.33e-7 fm^-1.

Which is 0.333 fm^-1. But Im f must have units of length (fm), not inverse.

This is getting too confusing. I think I made a mistake in the units and perhaps I should use natural units where ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

In such units, k is E/(ħ c) → but E is 50 MeV.

So k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) → k=0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(0.506 fm^-1 ) → 1.976 fm.

Multiply by sum 16.864 → 1.976 *16.864 ≈33.3 fm.

So the result is about 33.3 fm. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again:

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Hmm, 33 is close to none. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, wait a minute, perhaps I'm missing that the phase shifts are given for l=0 to 4, but in the given problem, it's stated to ignore the rest. So l starts from 0, 1, 2, 3,4. So sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses δ_l instead of 2δ_l. Wait, no, the formula for Im f is based on sin(2δ_l ), because Im (e^{2iδ} -1 )= 2 sin δ cos δ * 2i ?

Wait no, no. Wait, let me re-express e^{2iδ} -1.

e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ → e^{2iδ} = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ).

So e^{2iδ} -1 = cos(2δ) -1 + i sin(2δ).

The imaginary part is sin(2δ).

So that part is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different way.

Wait, another thought: the phase shifts δ_l are given in the problem as δ0=90°, δ1=67°, etc. So for l=0, δ0=90°, which is π/2 radians.

Wait, but for l=0, sin(2δ0)=sin(180°)=0, which is what I had.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use (2l +1) times sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula for Im f is based on the scattering amplitude:

f(θ) = Σ [ ( (2l +1)/(2ik) ) (k/k')^l (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) ]

So the imaginary part is:

Im f(θ) = Σ [ (2l +1)/(2k) ) (k/k')^l Im (e^{2iδ} -1 ) P_l ]

Im (e^{2iδ} -1 )= sin(2δ).

But wait, perhaps the correct formula uses sin(δ), not sin(2δ).

Wait, no. Because e^{2iδ} -1 = e^{iδ}^2 -1. So the imaginary part is sin(2δ).

So I think the formula is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the phase shifts in the problem are given as the real part of the phase shifts. Or perhaps the formula uses δ, not 2δ.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for Im f is (2l +1) sin δ_l.

Wait, think for l=0.

δ0=90°, sin δ0=1. So (2*0 +1)*1 =1.

But the sum would include l=0.

But then for l=0, sin(2δ)=0. But for l=0, if the formula used sin δ, then for l=0, it would contribute 1.

But in our calculation, l=0 contributes 0 because sin(180) is zero.

Wait, maybe the correct formula uses sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l).

So let's recompute with sin δ_l.

Sum = Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin90=1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3*(0.9205)≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*(0.8192)=4.096.

l=3:7*sin30=7*(0.5)=3.5.

l=4:9*sin13≈9*(0.22495)=2.02455.

Sum =1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.

So sum is approximately13.382.

Then, Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) *13.382.

k=0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/(2k)=1/(0.506) fm≈1.976 fm.

Multiply by 13.382 →1.976 *13.382≈26.5 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l, and the factor is k/(4π).

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= (k/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So with k=0.253 fm^-1.

Compute (0.253/(4π)) *16.864.

0.253/(12.566)≈0.02013.

0.02013 *16.864≈0.339 fm.

Which is still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= (1/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So sum=16.864.

(1/(4π)) *16.864 →16.864/(12.566)≈1.342 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

Sum=13.382.

1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

13.382 *1.976 ≈26.5 fm.

So about 26.5 fm.

Looking at the options, D is 251.271 fm, which is about 10 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of (2m_e E) inside the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the partial wave coefficients as (2l+1) (k/(k'))^l e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l / (k).

But I think I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total cross-section and then relate it to the imaginary part.

Wait, The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is (4π/k²) * Im f(0).

So Im f(0) = (k²/(4π)) * σ_total.

But without knowing σ_total, that might not help.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, 33.3 fm is not present. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, I think the confusion is arising because I'm not handling the units properly for k.

Wait, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, the wavevector k is E.

But electrons have rest mass, so the correct expression is k = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) → but I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps to compute k in units of inverse femtometers, given E=50 MeV.

Using the relation:

k (fm^-1) = (E (MeV)) / (197.33 MeV fm )

So k =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

Which is what I had earlier.

So Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Sum=16.864.

1/(2k)=1/(0.506) →1.976 fm.

1.976 *16.864=33.3 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (4π k).

Sum=13.382.

k=0.253 fm^-1.

So 13.382/(4π *0.253) →13.382/(3.182) ≈4.207 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

Which would be 13.382/(2 *0.253) → 13.382/(0.506) ≈26.46 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2 sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the factor is (k/(2π)).

So Im f(0)= (k/(2π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

k=0.253 fm^-1.

So (0.253)/(6.283) ≈0.0403 fm.

Multiply by 16.864 →0.0403 *16.864≈0.677 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (k/(4π)).

So (0.253)/(12.566)→≈0.02013.

Multiply by 16.864 →0.339 fm.

No.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to select the closest option to 33.3 fm, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use (2l+1) sin δ_l, leading to sum=13.382, and then (1/(2k)) * sum=26.5 fm. Looking at the options, D is 251.271 fm, which is about 10 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k. Let me recompute k.

E=50 MeV.

k = E / (ħ c ) → since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So k =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

Yes.

Then, (1/(2k))=1/(0.506) ≈1.976 fm.

Multiply by sum=16.864 →33.3 fm.

But options do not have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be (1/0.253) *13.382 →52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that k=k' is wrong. For elastic scattering, |k|=|k'|, but k and k' may have different directions. But in the formula for the scattering amplitude, (k/k')^l is the ratio, but when k'=k, as in elastic scattering, this ratio is 1.

Wait, but perhaps the phase shifts given are for different l's, and only the first few are given. But the problem says to ignore the rest, so we consider l=0 to 4.

I think I've tried all possible approaches and the answer isn't matching any option. The closest would be around 33 fm, but the options are B:355, C:177, D:251.

Wait, let me think about possible factors. Oh! Wait, perhaps in the formula, the sum is multiplied by (k/(2π)).

Wait, Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So k=0.253 fm^-1.

(0.253/ (2 *3.1416)) =0.253/(6.283) ≈0.0403 fm.

Multiply by sum=16.864 →0.0403 *16.864≈0.677 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (k/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

k=0.253, so (0.253)/(12.566)≈0.02013.

Multiply by 16.864→0.339 fm.

No.

Hmm. Perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Wait, no, the question says phase shifts are in degrees.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) (1 - cos(2δ_l )) → which is 2 sin² δ_l.

But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l ), but I think that's not right.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k) )

So sum=13.382.

1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

13.382 *1.976=26.46 fm.

Which is close to option D, which is 251.271 fm.

Wait, 26.46 is about 1/10 of 251.271. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Ah! Oh wait, I think I know where I went wrong. The initial calculation of k was in inverse femtometers (fm^-1), but in the formula, k should be in inverse meters, not inverse femtometers.

Because when we compute 1/(2k), if k is in fm^-1, then 1/(2k) is in fm.

But earlier, I computed k=0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/(2k) =1/(2 *0.253) =1.976 fm.

But wait, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k/(4π)) times the sum in the correct units.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should recalculate using k in inverse meters.

Wait, 1 fm =1e-15 m.

So k=0.253 fm^-1 =0.253 / 1e-15 m^-1 =2.53e14 m^-1.

So 1/(2k) =1/(5.06e14 m^-1 )=1.976e-15 m.

Multiply by sum=16.864 →1.976e-15 *16.864≈3.33e-14 m.

Which is 33.3 fm.

Hmm.

I think I've tried everything and can't reconcile the result with the options. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l, and the sum is 13.382.

Then Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) *13.382 =1.976 *13.382≈26.5 fm.

But the closest option is D)251.271 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 10 somewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum with a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the phase shifts are in radians.

Wait, let me compute the sum with δ in radians.

l=0: δ0=90°=pi/2 radians. sin(2δ)=sin(pi)=0. So term is 0.

l=1: δ=67°=1.169 radians. 2δ=2.338 radians. sin(2.338)=approx 0.7193. 3*0.7193=2.1579.

Same as before. So sum remains 16.864.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 33 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k) )

sum=13.382.

1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

13.382 *1.976=26.46 fm.

Hmm, 26.46 is about 26.5 fm. None of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k/ (2π) )

k=0.253 fm^-1.

So (sum=13.382) * (0.253/(2*3.1416)) →13.382 * (0.0403) ≈0.539 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k/(4π) )

Which would be 13.382 * (0.253/(12.566)) →13.382 *0.02013≈0.269 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k) )

Which would be 13.382 *1.976≈26.5 fm.

Again, 26.5 is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by (1/k) instead of (1/(2k)).

So 1/k=3.95 fm.

13.382 *3.95≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k/(2π) )

k=0.253 fm^-1 →0.253/(6.283)=0.0403 fm.

13.382 *0.0403≈0.539 fm.

No.

I'm out of ideas. Perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is option C)177.675 fm, which is half of 355.351 (option B). Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, if I take the sum as 16.864 and multiply by (1/k)=3.95 fm:

16.864 *3.95≈66.6 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) * (something).

Wait, perhaps the formula should be Im f(0) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k) )

sum=13.382.

1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

13.382 *1.976≈26.5 fm.

Again, no.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Wait, but then the sum is 13.382.

1.976 *13.382≈26.5 fm.

No.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not in the options, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the sum should include all l from 0 to 4, but perhaps the phase shifts are given beyond l=4. But the problem says to ignore the rest, so only l=0 to4 are considered.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the phase shifts.

Wait, the given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. So all five terms are included.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with the calculation and conclude that the correct answer is approximately 33.3 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)177.675 fm, considering a possible factor of 5.31 due to unit conversion errors. But I'm not certain.


To solve the problem, we calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction using the given phase shifts and the formula derived from partial wave analysis. The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( k \)
The energy of the electrons is \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), and the electron mass is \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \). Using relativistic energy relations, the wavevector \( k \) is calculated as:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c}
\]

In natural units where \( \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm} \), we find:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \)
The phase shifts are given as:
- \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \), \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \), \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \), \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \).

For each \( l \), compute \( \sin(2\delta_l) \) and multiply by \( (2l+1) \):
- \( l=0 \): \( \sin(2\cdot 90^\circ) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), contribution = \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
- \( l=1 \): \( \sin(2 \cdot 67^\circ) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \), contribution = \( 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579 \).
- \( l=2 \): \( \sin(2 \cdot 55^\circ) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), contribution = \( 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \).
- \( l=3 \): \( \sin(2 \cdot 30^\circ) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), contribution = \( 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \).
- \( l=4 \): \( \sin(2 \cdot 13^\circ) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), contribution = \( 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.864
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im } f(0) \)
Substitute \( k = 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \) and the sum \( \sum = 16.864 \) into the formula:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \cdot \sum = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 0.253} \cdot 16.864 \approx 1.976 \cdot 16.864 \approx 33.3 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im } f(0) \approx 33.3 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest plausible answer, considering potential errors in unit conversion or interpretation, is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately five times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor in the calculation or an issue with the problem setup.
