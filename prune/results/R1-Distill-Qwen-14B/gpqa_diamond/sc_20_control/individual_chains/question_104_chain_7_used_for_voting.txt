Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas, but let me think through this.

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. So the stars are identical, and the planets are same mass too. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things.

The RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves in response to the planet's orbit. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us. The problem gives the shifts as 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. Wait, no, wait: planet #1's spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2's is 7. So higher shift for planet #2.

Wait, but wait. The RV method gives a velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula I remember relates several factors. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) where v is the star's velocity. How does this relate to the planet's orbital parameters?

The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) )^(1/1) ) * (1 / ( (1 AU)^2 * (1 year)^-1 )^(1/3) ) ) * ( P )^(-1/3) ) * ( ( 2 pi ) / (c) ) ?

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. Alternatively, the expression is:

K = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * [ ( 1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) ) ] * [ ( 2 pi G )^(1/3) ) / ( c ) ] * ( 1 / ( (P) )^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula I know. The RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = [ ( (G * P) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ] / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but wait, let me get the correct formula. I think the correct expression is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2 pi / P c) ) )^(1/3) ?

Hmm, maybe another approach. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 pi) / (P * c) ) ) ]^(1/3) ]

Wait, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward expression. I remember that K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the formula is:

K = ( ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) / ( c * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between K, the RV semi-amplitude. K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star.

Wait, in the problem, both stars have same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have same mass, right? Because the question says each planet has a mass similar to Neptune, so same M_p for both.

So let me note that M_* is same for both stars, M_p same for both planets.

The RV measurement gives K for each star as the semi-amplitude. The problem says that for planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7? No, wait, the problem states: "the periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum... planet #1 was detected from up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift... planet #2 was 7." So the shift is larger for planet #2's star.

Wait, but wait. The RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is K. But the shift in wavelength is proportional to velocity. So the Doppler shift formula is v = (lambda shift) / lambda_0 * c. So v is proportional to the shift. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7, in milliangstroms. Or wait, perhaps the shift is given as the amplitude of the Doppler shift, so K is proportional to the shift.

So for the same star, higher K would mean higher velocity, which implies either a more massive planet, shorter period, or something else. But in our case, M_*, M_p are same. So the difference in K must come from other factors.

Wait, but the formula for K is K = (v) which is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since M_* and M_p are same for both planets, the only variable here is P, the orbital period.

Wait, but wait, that depends. Wait, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/1) * [ ( 2 pi ) / (c * P ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the formula for K is:

K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( ( 2 pi ) / ( c * P ) ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps a more precise approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi / (P) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / c )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

K = [ ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 2 pi / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

K = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) / ( c * P^(1/3) )

Yes, that seems right. So K is proportional to (M_p / (M_* + M_p))^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Since M_p is much less than M_* (for exoplanets, Neptune is about 1/7000th of the Sun's mass), so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so we can approximate K as proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, M_p and M_* are same for both planets, so (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) is the same for both. So K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3) )

So if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3)

So the ratio of periods P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3

Because since P ~ 1/K, so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me double-check. If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So setting up the ratio:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )^3.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So K = C * (1/P)^(1/3), where C is a constant. So P = (C / K )^3.

So P2 = (C / K2 )^3, P1 = (C / K1 )^3.

So P2 / P1 = ( (C/K2 )^3 ) / ( (C/K1)^3 ) ) = ( (K1/K2) )^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, in the problem, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So the ratio is (5/7)^3.

Calculating that: 5/7 is approximately 0.714. 0.714 cubed is about 0.364.

Wait, but wait, wait. The problem says that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2 it's 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, wait, but if K is larger, then P is smaller. Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So if K2 is larger, P2 is smaller than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait, but the question is asking: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is shorter than P1, then the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, so the period of planet #2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is shorter, then it's not longer; the answer would be less than one. But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which is less than one, and option D is ~0.85.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again.

Given that K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), or P proportional to (1/K^3).

So P2/P1 = (1/K2^3)/(1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, wait, because P is proportional to (1/K^3), so P2 = (1/K2^3) * C, P1 = (1/K1^3)*C. So when you take the ratio P2/P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then K1/K2 is less than 1, so (K1/K2)^3 is less than 1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3.

Let me compute that. 0.714 * 0.714 = approx 0.51. Then 0.51 * 0.714 ≈ 0.364. So about 0.36.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter; it's about 0.36 times as long.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be 0.36 times as long.

So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so the answer is 0.36 times as long.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Are K and the velocity shift directly proportional? Because the Doppler shift affects the velocity, which is inversely related to the period.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 pi) / (P) )^(1/3) ) ] / c

So K = ( ( G M_p ) / (M_* + M_p ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / (P c ) )^(1/3 )

Which can be written as K = ( G M_p (2 pi) )^(1/3) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) (P c )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So K ≈ ( G M_p (2 pi) )^(1/3) / ( M_*^(1/3) (P c )^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3 )

But since M_p and M_* are same for both, the ratio K1/K2 would be ( (1/P1) / (1/P2) )^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2) = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Then, to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1.

Wait, so that would mean P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, let me write the equation again.

We have K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So for two planets, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So if I cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no. Wait, let me redo it.

From K = C * (1/P)^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1 = C * P1^(-1/3)

K2 = C * P2^(-1/3)

Dividing both, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So to get P2/P1, we cube both sides:

(K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So with K1=5, K2=7, the ratio is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So planet #2 has a period shorter than planet #1 by about 0.36 times.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So planet #2's period is shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning it's about 0.36 times longer.

So looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, given that both planets orbit identical stars and were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, \( K \), is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the stars and planets have the same mass, the ratio of the periods can be derived from the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes.

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \), and then cubing it:

\[
\left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

From the given options:

- **A) ~0.36**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived ratio.
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived ratio.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived ratio.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. Alternatively, the expression is:

K = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * [ ( 1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) ) ] * [ ( 2 pi G )^(1/3) ) / ( c ) ] * ( 1 / ( (P) )^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula I know. The RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = [ ( (G * P) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ] / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but wait, let me get the correct formula. I think the correct expression is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2 pi / P c) ) )^(1/3) ?

Hmm, maybe another approach. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 pi) / (P * c) ) ) ]^(1/3) ]

Wait, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward expression. I remember that K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

So let me note that M_* is same for both stars, M_p same for both planets.

The RV measurement gives K for each star as the semi-amplitude. The problem says that for planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7? No, wait, the problem states: "the periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum... planet #1 was detected from up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift... planet #2 was 7." So the shift is larger for planet #2's star.

Wait, but wait. The RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is K. But the shift in wavelength is proportional to velocity. So the Doppler shift formula is v = (lambda shift) / lambda_0 * c. So v is proportional to the shift. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7, in milliangstroms. Or wait, perhaps the shift is given as the amplitude of the Doppler shift, so K is proportional to the shift.

So for the same star, higher K would mean higher velocity, which implies either a more massive planet, shorter period, or something else. But in our case, M_*, M_p are same. So the difference in K must come from other factors.

Wait, but the formula for K is K = (v) which is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since M_* and M_p are same for both planets, the only variable here is P, the orbital period.

Wait, but wait, that depends. Wait, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/1) * [ ( 2 pi ) / (c * P ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the formula for K is:

K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( ( 2 pi ) / ( c * P ) ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps a more precise approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi / (P) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / c )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

K = [ ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 2 pi / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

K = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) / ( c * P^(1/3) )

Yes, that seems right. So K is proportional to (M_p / (M_* + M_p))^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Since M_p is much less than M_* (for exoplanets, Neptune is about 1/7000th of the Sun's mass), so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so we can approximate K as proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, M_p and M_* are same for both planets, so (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) is the same for both. So K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3) )

So if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3)

So the ratio of periods P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3

Because since P ~ 1/K, so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me double-check. If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So setting up the ratio:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )^3.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So K = C * (1/P)^(1/3), where C is a constant. So P = (C / K )^3.

So P2 = (C / K2 )^3, P1 = (C / K1 )^3.

So P2 / P1 = ( (C/K2 )^3 ) / ( (C/K1)^3 ) ) = ( (K1/K2) )^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, in the problem, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So the ratio is (5/7)^3.

Calculating that: 5/7 is approximately 0.714. 0.714 cubed is about 0.364.

Wait, but wait, wait. The problem says that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2 it's 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, wait, but if K is larger, then P is smaller. Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So if K2 is larger, P2 is smaller than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait, but the question is asking: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is shorter than P1, then the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, so the period of planet #2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is shorter, then it's not longer; the answer would be less than one. But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which is less than one, and option D is ~0.85.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again.

Given that K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), or P proportional to (1/K^3).

So P2/P1 = (1/K2^3)/(1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, wait, because P is proportional to (1/K^3), so P2 = (1/K2^3) * C, P1 = (1/K1^3)*C. So when you take the ratio P2/P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then K1/K2 is less than 1, so (K1/K2)^3 is less than 1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3.

Let me compute that. 0.714 * 0.714 = approx 0.51. Then 0.51 * 0.714 ≈ 0.364. So about 0.36.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter; it's about 0.36 times as long.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be 0.36 times as long.

So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so the answer is 0.36 times as long.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Are K and the velocity shift directly proportional? Because the Doppler shift affects the velocity, which is inversely related to the period.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 pi) / (P) )^(1/3) ) ] / c

So K = ( ( G M_p ) / (M_* + M_p ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / (P c ) )^(1/3 )

Which can be written as K = ( G M_p (2 pi) )^(1/3) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) (P c )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So K ≈ ( G M_p (2 pi) )^(1/3) / ( M_*^(1/3) (P c )^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3 )

But since M_p and M_* are same for both, the ratio K1/K2 would be ( (1/P1) / (1/P2) )^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2) = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Then, to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1.

Wait, so that would mean P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, let me write the equation again.

We have K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So for two planets, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So if I cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no. Wait, let me redo it.

From K = C * (1/P)^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1 = C * P1^(-1/3)

K2 = C * P2^(-1/3)

Dividing both, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So to get P2/P1, we cube both sides:

(K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So with K1=5, K2=7, the ratio is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So planet #2 has a period shorter than planet #1 by about 0.36 times.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So planet #2's period is shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning it's about 0.36 times longer.

So looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.


The problem involves determining how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, given that both planets orbit identical stars and were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, \( K \), is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the stars and planets have the same mass, the ratio of the periods can be derived from the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes.

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \), and then cubing it:

\[
\left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
