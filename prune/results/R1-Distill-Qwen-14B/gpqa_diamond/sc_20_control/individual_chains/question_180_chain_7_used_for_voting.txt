Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see, the problem is about calculating the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges and their interactions, Coulomb's Law and electric potential energy are key here.

Alright, let's read the question again carefully. There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So each charge is twice the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.2e-19 C.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system.

Wait, so the setup is that 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed, so it doesn't move. The other 12 are all at 2 meters from it. Hmm, but wait, are the 12 charges arranged in some way around point P? Like on a sphere? Because if they're all at 2 meters from P, they might form a spherical shell or something. But since their positions are fixed, maybe the potential energy calculation is about their configuration relative to the central charge.

Wait, but wait, in an isolated system, the potential energy depends on the configuration of all charges. But since one of them is fixed, maybe only the interactions between the 12 and the central one are considered? Or do I need to consider interactions among the 12 as well?

Oh wait, the question says it's the minimum energy of the system. So maybe the system's configuration is such that the potential energy is minimized. For point charges, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as close as possible, but since some are constrained, perhaps their arrangement doesn't change. Hmm, but in this case, the 12 are at fixed positions, so maybe their mutual potential energy is fixed, and the only thing that varies is their position relative to the central charge.

Wait, no. The problem says the system is isolated. So the charges are fixed in their positions relative to each other? So the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge is fixed because their separation is fixed. Also, the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves is fixed because their positions are fixed. So the total potential energy is the sum of all these interactions.

Wait, but wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in the configuration that gives the minimum potential energy. But their positions are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, but not necessarily fixed in any specific arrangement. So maybe their mutual potential energy can be minimized by arranging them in a certain way, like equally spaced on a sphere. But for potential energy, arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy, but wait no, actually, the potential energy between like charges is positive and increases with distance. Wait, wait, for point charges, the potential energy is positive when they're like charges and repel each other. So if you bring them closer together, the potential energy increases because you're doing work against the repulsion. So to minimize the potential energy, you want the charges as far apart as possible.

But in this problem, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances aren't fixed. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints on their mutual distances except that each is 2 meters from P. So perhaps they're at the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something on a sphere of radius 2 meters. But I think for the purpose of calculating the potential energy, the exact arrangement among themselves might not matter if you're considering the minimum energy. Wait, but no, because the potential energy between the 12 charges depends on their mutual distances. If you arrange them as far apart as possible, the potential energy would be lower. But if they're all on the surface of a sphere, the potential energy between any two would be (k * q1 q2) / r, where r is the distance between them.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, not between the 12 themselves. Because the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the system's total potential energy includes all pairs: the central charge with each of the 12, and each pair among the 12.

But the question says it's the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the 12 charges are arranged such that the mutual potential energy is minimized. Or maybe the mutual potential energy is fixed if their positions are fixed. Wait, no, because their positions are all at 2 m from P, but their relative positions can vary. So perhaps the problem is designed so that we only calculate the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and ignore the mutual potential energy among the 12. Because maybe the problem states that the 12 are fixed in position, so their mutual distances can't change, so their potential energy is fixed. But the question doesn't specify that. It just says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps the mutual distances can vary, but each is always at 2m from P.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system, so all charges are fixed in their positions. So the configuration is fixed, meaning all the potential energies are fixed. Therefore, the total potential energy is the sum of all pairwise interactions.

So, to calculate the total potential energy, I need to compute:

U_total = U_central + U_mutual.

U_central is the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 charges.

U_mutual is the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, no, because the central charge is fixed. Let me think. Each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from the central charge, so each has a potential energy with the central charge of U = (k * q_central * q) / r.

But since all 12 are identical, perhaps the sum is 12 times (k * q^2)/(2 m). Because each of the 12 has charge 2e, so q = 2e.

Wait, but wait, let me think: The central charge is fixed, so it's 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So the potential energy between the central charge and one of the 12 is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m) = k*(4e²)/(2 m) = 2 k e² / (2 m) )? Wait, no, let me compute that properly.

Wait, each pair between the central charge and the 12 contributes U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). So that's (4e² k) / (2 m) = (2 e² k) / m.

Wait, but wait, that would be the potential energy for one pair. But since the 12 are all identical, each contributes the same. So the total U_central is 12 times that. So 12 * (4e² k) / (2 m) )? Wait, no, wait: No, each of the 12 charges contributes a term with the central charge. So each term is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). Which is (4e² k) / (2 m) = (2 e² k) / m. So for 12 charges, it's 12 * (2 e² k)/(2 m). Wait, no, wait: Wait, the distance is 2 meters between the central charge and each of the 12, right? So each term is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) = (4 e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k. So for 12 such terms, it's 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Wait, but wait, no, because in potential energy calculations, each pair is considered once. But the central charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges contributes a unique pair with the central charge. So, yes, the sum is 12 times each individual U.

So U_central = 12 * [ (k (2e)(2e) ) / (2 m) ].

Wait, no, wait: The central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e, right? So each of the 12 contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). So each term is (4e² k) / (2 m) = (2 e² k) / m. Multiply by 12: 12*(2 e² k)/m = 24 e² k / m.

Wait, but 2e is the charge, so each term is k*(2e)(2e)/(2) = 4 e² k / 2 = 2 e² k. So for 12 terms: 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Wait, but this is the U_central part. Then, we have the U_mutual part: the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. So how many pairs are there?

Well, 12 charges, each pair once, so the number of pairs is (12 choose 2) = 66. So for each pair, the potential energy is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

But wait, what is r_ij? Because each of the 12 charges is on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m, but their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. Since the problem is about the minimum energy, perhaps the arrangement that minimizes the potential energy is when the charges are as far apart as possible, which would place them on the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something. But that would complicate the calculation because each r_ij would vary. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all mutual distances are the same, but that's not the case for 12 points on a sphere.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only asking about the potential energy due to the central charge, not the mutual interactions. Because otherwise, without knowing the specific arrangement of the 12 charges, I can't compute their mutual potential energy. Hmm, the question says it's asking for the minimum energy, so perhaps considering only the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central one, and not the mutual potential energy. Because including the mutual energy would require knowing their arrangement, which the problem doesn't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps in this scenario, the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. But that's not possible because like charges repel, so their mutual potential would be positive.

Wait, but the problem says to find the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energy is as small as possible, which would be the case when the charges are as far apart as possible. But without knowing their exact positions, I can't compute that. So maybe the problem is ignoring the mutual potential energy and only considering the central charge's interactions. Or perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered negligible, but that doesn't make sense for 12 charges.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says, "the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals." Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, and not the mutual potential energy between the 12. Because otherwise, the answer would require knowing the arrangement, which is not given.

So for the purpose of this calculation, perhaps I should only calculate the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 charges.

So let's proceed under that assumption.

So U_central = 12 * [ (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) ].

Calculating this:

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, 1.602e-19 C.

So each term: (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m).

Wait, (2e) is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = (approx) 1.026e-37 C².

So each term is (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / 2.

Wait, because denominator is 2 m.

So per term: (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / 2.

Let me compute that.

8.988e9 = approx 9e9.

1.026e-37 is about 1e-37.

So 9e9 * 1e-37 = 9e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.5e-28.

Multiply by 12: 54e-28 = 5.4e-27 J?

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Each term: (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / (2 m).

(2e)^2 is (3.204e-19)^2 = (approx) 1.0264e-37 C².

So (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) = 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 * 1e-37 = 8.988e-28.

But 1.0264e-37 is 1.0264 times that, so 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = 8.988 * 1.0264 * 1e-28 = 9.236e-28.

Then divide by 2: 9.236e-28 / 2 ≈ 4.618e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.618e-28 * 12 = 5.542e-27 J.

Wait, but that's the U_central. So the total potential energy is 5.542e-27 J.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 28e-27, so roughly 5 times higher. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

First, compute (2e)^2: (2*(1.602e-19))^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 1.0264e-37 C². That's correct.

Then, k*(2e)^2 = 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = let's compute that accurately.

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

1.0264e-37 is 1.0264 * 1e-37.

Multiply 8.988 * 1.0264 ≈ 9.236.

So 9.236e(9-37) = 9.236e-28.

Divide by 2 meters: 9.236e-28 / 2 = 4.618e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.618e-28 * 12 = 5.5416e-27 J.

Hmm, that's approximately 5.54e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 7.056e-27, but that's not close. Option B is about 2.822e-26, which is about 28.22e-27, which is about 5 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps including the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Because if I don't consider that, the answer I get isn't among the options.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are arranged in a certain way, their mutual potential energy would be minimal. Let's think about that.

Each pair of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy term of (k (2e)(2e))/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between them.

But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at the same distance from each other. But that's not possible except for certain numbers of points on a sphere, like the vertices of a regular polyhedron. For example, 12 points can't all be equidistant on a sphere; the regular polyhedron with 12 vertices doesn't exist. The closest is the regular icosahedron, which has 12 vertices, but the edge lengths are the same, so the distances between adjacent vertices are the same, but the distances across the faces are longer.

Wait, but the mutual potential energy would be the sum of all pairs, each with their own r_ij. But without knowing the exact distances, it's hard to compute. So perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and not the mutual terms. But then why is the answer not matching the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero? But that's impossible because all are positive charges; their potential energy would be positive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Each term for the central charge is (k (2e) (2e)) / (2 m) ).

So each term is (k * 4e²) / (2 m) ) = (2 k e²) / m.

Wait, no, because 2e * 2e is 4e², and divided by 2 m. So each term is (4e² k)/(2 m) ) = 2 e² k / m.

Wait, but m is the distance, 2 meters. So each term is (2 e² k) / 2 = e² k.

Wait, wait! I think I see a mistake here. Let's re-express:

Each term: (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m).

So 2e * 2e = 4 e².

Denominator is 2 m, so 4 e² / (2 m) = 2 e² / m.

So each term is (k * 2 e²) / m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters, so each term becomes (k * 2 e²) / 2 = (k e²) / 1.

Wait, no: Wait, wait, the denominator is 2 m, where m=2 meters. So each term is (k *4 e²) / (2 * 2) )?

Wait, no, the distance is 2 meters. So it's (k * (2e)^2) / 2.

So (k * 4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Ah, that's the mistake I was making earlier. So each term is 2 k e².

So 12 terms would be 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, that's a big difference. So earlier I might have miscalculated.

Let me compute each term correctly.

Each term: (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (distance).

Distance is 2 m, so 2 meters.

So each term is (k * 4 e² ) / 2 = 2 k e².

So 12 terms: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, let's compute 24 k e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² = (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So compute 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let's compute step by step.

First, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiply 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23. (Let's compute it more accurately.)

8.988 * 2.566:

Well, 8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ approx 2.538.

Total approx 20.528 + 2.538 ≈ 23.066.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 23.066e(9-38) = 23.066e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.066e-29 *24.

23.066 *24 = 553.584.

So 553.584e-29 = 5.53584e-26 J.

So U_central is approximately 5.536e-26 J.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 5.645e-26

Option B) 2.822e-26

Option C) 7.056e-27

Option D) 122.330

So option A is 5.645e-26, which is close to my calculation of 5.536e-26. But wait, perhaps I made a slight approximation in the multiplication.

Let me compute more accurately.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988 * 2.566 = ?

Let me compute it precisely:

8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 = ?

0.988 * 2 = 1.976.

0.988 * 0.566 = approx 0.560.

So 1.976 + 0.560 = 2.536.

So total 20.528 +2.536 =23.064.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.064e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.064e-29 *24 = 553.536e-29 =5.53536e-26 J.

So approximately 5.535e-26 J.

The options are A)5.645e-26, which is a bit higher. So perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the 2e^2 is (2e)^2. Let me recheck.

(2e)^2 =4e^2. Yes.

So each term is (k * (4e^2) ) / (2) = 2 k e^2.

Yes.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that I forgot to consider the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Because if the 12 charges are all on a sphere, their mutual potential energy would be significant. So the total potential energy would be U_central + U_mutual.

But without knowing the arrangement of the 12 charges, I can't calculate U_mutual. Hmm. But perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make sense because all charges are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is as far as possible from each other, thus minimizing the mutual potential energy. But without a specific arrangement, it's impossible to compute. So perhaps the problem is only asking about the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and the mutual terms are considered negligible or not part of the question.

If that's the case, then the answer I got is around 5.535e-26 J. Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is close. But option B is about half of that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another way to compute: Let's compute 24 * k * e².

k=8.988e9.

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 24 *8.988e9 = 24 *8.988=215.712e9.

So 215.712e9 *2.566e-38 = 215.712 *2.566 *1e(9-38) = 553.53e-29 =5.5353e-26 J.

Hmm, same as before. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But the given options don't have this value. Wait, option A is 5.645e-26, which is close but a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation more accurately.

Calculate 24 * 8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Let me compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 first.

8.988e9 = 8.988 *1e9.

2.566e-38 =2.566 *1e-38.

Multiply 8.988 *2.566: 8 *2.566=20.528; 0.988 *2.566≈2.536. So 20.528+2.536=23.064.

So 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =23.064e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.064 *24=553.536e-29 =5.53536e-26 J.

So approximately 5.535e-26 J.

The options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of each charge's potential due to all others. So the central charge is fixed, and each of the 12 contributes potential energy, but perhaps each charge's potential energy includes their own contribution from the central charge and their mutual terms.

Wait, another approach: The total potential energy U is the sum of all pairs. Each pair includes:

- Between the central charge and each of the 12: that's 12 pairs.

- Between each pair of the 12 charges: that's 12C2=66 pairs.

So U_total = U_central + U_mutual.

But without knowing r_ij for the mutual pairs, I can't compute U_mutual.

So perhaps the problem is only including U_central in the calculation.

But if that's the case, the answer should be around 5.5e-26 J, but the options don't have that. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k * e².

Let me compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 8.988 *2.566 *1e-29.

8.988 *2.566 = ?

Let me compute 8 *2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 *2.566 ≈ 2.536.

So total ≈23.064.

So 23.064e-29.

So 24 * 23.064e-29 = 553.536e-29 =5.53536e-26 J.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option A is the intended answer, but perhaps the problem is that each of the 12 charges is distance 2m from P, but the central charge is also 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So perhaps the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). Multiply by 12.

Wait, yes, that's what I did.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is that the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e, so the potential energy between each pair is (k*(2e)*(2e))/r.

Which is what I did.

So the calculation seems correct.

But the options don't have 5.5e-26. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the central charge is fixed, so it's considered as the reference point, so the potential energy is only due to the 12 charges moving towards or away from it. Wait, no, in electrostatics, the potential energy is the work done to assemble the charges. So the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is (k*(2e)^2)/(2), multiplied by 12.

Wait, because each charge is placed at 2m from P. So for each charge, the energy is (k*(2e)^2)/(2). So 12 times that.

So 12 * [ (k*(2e)^2)/2 ] = 12 * [ (k*4e²)/2 ] = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Which is what I computed earlier.

So 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Which gives 5.535e-26 J.

But none of the options match exactly, but option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 0.2% higher.

Perhaps I should check the exact value.

Let me do the calculation more precisely.

Compute (2e)^2: (2 * 1.602176634e-19)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 = 1.0265158e-37 C².

k=8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So each term is (8.9875517879e9) * (1.0265158e-37) / 2.

Wait, no, each term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2), right?

So 8.9875517879e9 * 1.0265158e-37 = ?

Let me compute 8.9875517879e9 *1.0265158e-37 = ?

Multiply 8.9875517879 *1.0265158 = ?

Let me compute:

8 *1.0265158 =8.2121264.

0.9875517879 *1.0265158 ≈ approx 1.0146.

So total approx 8.2121 +1.0146=9.2267.

So 9.2267e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.61335e-28.

Multiply by 12: 5.53602e-27 J.

Wait, wait, wait, no, wait: No, each term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = (8.98755e9 * 1.0265158e-37) / 2 = (9.2267e-28)/2 =4.61335e-28.

Multiply by 12: 5.53602e-27 J.

Wait, that's 5.536e-27 J. But earlier I thought I had 5.5e-26 J. Wait, no—wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier in the number of decimal places.

Wait, wait, 8.98755e9 *1.0265158e-37 = 9.2267e-28? That can't be right.

Wait, no: 8.98755e9 is 8.98755 *1e9.

1.0265158e-37 is 1.0265158 *1e-37.

Multiply them: 8.98755 *1.0265158 = approx 9.2267.

So 1e9 *1e-37 =1e-28.

So 9.2267e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.61335e-28.

Multiply by 12: 5.53602e-27 J.

Wait, that's 5.536e-27 J, which is 5.536 x 10^-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5.6 times higher.

Hmm, so now I'm getting 5.536e-27 J, which is not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I confused the distance. The problem states that 12 charges are at 2 meters from P. Wait, if the central charge is at P, then each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from P. So the distance is 2 meters.

So the calculation is correct.

But the answer isn't among the options. Wait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot to account for the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

Let me think: Each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy with the others. But without knowing their arrangement, I can't compute the sum of their mutual potential energies. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is the same as if all 12 were at the same distance from each other, which isn't the case, but let's suppose for a moment.

Assume all mutual distances are 2 meters as well. Then each pair would contribute (k*(2e)^2)/2.

Number of pairs: 12C2=66.

So U_mutual=66*(k*(2e)^2)/2 =66*(4 e² k)/2 =66 * 2 e² k = 132 e² k.

But adding that to the U_central of 24 e² k would give (24 +132) e² k =156 e² k.

Wait, let's compute that.

156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Which is 156 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.306e-28.

Multiply by 156: 2.306e-28 *156≈ 3.59e-26 J.

But this doesn't match any of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not the case.

Wait, but going back, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not considered here, and the correct calculation is about 5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: it says the system is isolated. So perhaps the potential energy is only due to the central charge and the 12 charges. So U = sum for each charge of (k * central_charge * charge)/(distance).

Which is what I did earlier. So 24 k e² =5.535e-26 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A:5.645e-26.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact calculation without approximations.

Compute 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2 m).

Wait, wait, no: no, the distance is 2 m, so each term is (k (2e)^2 )/(2 m) = (4e² k)/(2 m) )= (2 e² k)/m.

Wait, no, 2 m is the distance, so 2e *2e is 4 e², divided by 2 m.

So 4 e² / (2 m) = 2 e² / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 2 e² / 2 = e².

So each term is k e².

So 12 terms:12 k e².

Ah! So that's where I went wrong earlier. I think I misapplied the distance. Because the distance is 2 meters, so it's (k*(2e)^2)/2 m.

Which is (4 e² k )/(2 m).

Wait, no, the distance is 2 m, so it's (4 e² k )/(2 m) = 2 e² k / m.

Wait, m is 2, so 2 e² k / 2 = e² k.

Ah, so each term is e² k.

So 12 terms:12 e² k.

So U_central =12 * e² *k.

e is 1.602e-19 C.

So e² is (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38 C².

So 12 * (2.566e-38) *8.988e9.

Compute 12 *8.988e9 =107.856e9.

107.856e9 *2.566e-38 = 107.856 *2.566e-29 = approx 276.7e-29 =2.767e-26 J.

So U_central is approximately 2.767e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is very close.

Ah, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation by not correctly simplifying the distance. So the correct calculation is 12 * [ (k*(2e)^2) / (2m) ].

Wait, no, no, wait this is another mistake. Let me double-check.

Each term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m), where m=2 m.

So (2e)^2 =4 e².

Denominator is 2 m =4 meters? No, m is 2, so denominator is 2 m=2*2=4? No, no, no—wait, no. The distance is 2 meters. So denominator is 2 m, which is 2 meters.

Wait, no, the calculation is (k * (2e)^2 )/(distance). The distance is 2 m.

So each term is (k *4 e² )/(2 m) = (2 k e² ) / m.

Wait, no.

Wait, 2e is the charge, but the distance is 2 meters. So each term is (k * (2e) * (2e) ) / (2 m).

So that's (4 e² k )/(2 m) = 2 e² k / m.

Wait, but if m=2, then 2 e² k / 2 = e² k.

So each term is e² k.

So U_central =12 * e² k.

Which is 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Compute that:

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

So 12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =23.064e-29.

Multiply by 12: 276.768e-29 =2.76768e-26 J.

Which is approximately 2.768e-26 J. So option B is 2.822e-26, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B, 2.822e-26 J.

Ah, so I see where I went wrong earlier. I incorrectly multiplied by 24 instead of 12 after miscalculating the simplified term. The correct approach is to realize that each term simplifies to e² k, so 12 terms give 12 e² k.

So the correct answer is approximately 2.768e-26 J, which is closest to option B, 2.822e-26.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the minimum energy of the system, we consider the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 charges constrained at a distance of 2 meters from point P. The total potential energy is given by:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{central}}
\]

where \( U_{\text{central}} \) is the sum of the potential energies between the central charge and each of the 12 charges. The potential energy for each pair is:

\[
U = \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{2 \, \text{m}}
\]

Here:
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) (Coulomb's constant),
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (elementary charge),
- \( 2e \) is the charge of each particle,
- \( 2 \, \text{m} \) is the distance between the central charge and each of the 12 charges.

### Step 1: Simplify the expression for \( U \)
\[
U = \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{2 \, \text{m}} = \frac{k \cdot 4e^2}{2 \, \text{m}} = \frac{2k e^2}{\text{m}}
\]

Since \( \text{m} = 2 \, \text{m} \), this simplifies to:
\[
U = \frac{2k e^2}{2} = k e^2
\]

### Step 2: Total potential energy
There are 12 identical charges, so the total potential energy is:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot U = 12 \cdot k e^2
\]

### Step 3: Substitute values
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \),
- \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \).

Substitute these values:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
\]

First, calculate \( k \cdot e^2 \):
\[
k \cdot e^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 23.064 \times 10^{-29}
\]

Now multiply by 12:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot 23.064 \times 10^{-29} = 276.768 \times 10^{-29} = 2.76768 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated value of \( U_{\text{total}} \) is approximately \( 2.768 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \).**

### Final Answer:
The minimum energy of the system is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**.
