Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. 

The host stars have the same radii. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. But wait, both stars have the same radius, which is interesting because usually, more massive stars are larger, but maybe Planet_1's host hasn't expanded yet because it's not evolved? 

So the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by a formula. I think it's something like (R_p / a) * (something else?), wait no. Let me think. Oh right, the formula for the probability P that a planet will transit is approximately (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 (e^2 + (n * a/(c))^2 )) ), but wait, when the orbit is circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so it simplifies. 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. I think the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star's size. Oh right! The probability is roughly (R_star / a) * something else? Or is it (R_star / a) multiplied by another factor that accounts for the alignment. 

Wait, I remember that the probability P is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but if the planet's size is much smaller than the star's, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So we can approximate P ≈ (R_star) / (a * (1 + sqrt(1 - (b^2))) ), wait, maybe that's for the impact parameter. Alternatively, I think the basic formula is P ≈ (2 R_star) / (a (1 + sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )))) ), but that might get complicated. 

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The probability of a transit is given by the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbital plane covers. Or maybe it's the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, intersects with our line of sight. 

Alternatively, the transit probability can be approximated as (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5 ), but since e is zero here, it's (R_star + R_planet)/a. But both planets are Earth-like, so R_planet << R_star, so we can ignore R_planet. So P ≈ R_star / a. 

Wait, that seems too simplistic. I think the actual formula is more nuanced. Let me think. Oh, wait! The transit probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (some function involving the inclination). But in general, the probability is (R_star / a) * (something else), maybe a factor of 2? I think the formula is 2(R_star / a) when the inclination is right. 

Wait, no. Let me try to recall. The probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) / (something), but I'm getting a bit stuck. 

Alternatively, I remember that for a given star and planet, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by 2. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think about the geometry. 

The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on from our perspective. The probability is proportional to the area where this happens. The formula I recall is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) * something, but perhaps for an Earth-like planet, R_p is negligible compared to R_star and a. 

Wait, no. Let's get back. For a circular orbit, the probability of a transit is approximately (2 R_star) / (a) divided by something else. Hmm. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_star / (a)) multiplied by (1/(something)). Wait, maybe it's (R_star / (a)) multiplied by (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) / (something else). I'm getting confused. 

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) × (some other term), but since e=0 here, it's (R_star + R_planet)/a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, this simplifies to R_star / a.

But wait, that can't be right because if a is the semi-major axis, and it's much larger than R_star, the probability would be small. 

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Maybe the formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by 2π or something? Let me think about another approach. 

I recall that the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_star / a) × (1 / (1 + (a/(R_star))^2 )^(1/2) ) , but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by 2/(sqrt(1 + ... )).

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transit probability for a given system is approximately (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) * something, but given that R_p << R_star and a >> R_star, it's roughly (R_star/a) * something.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

P = (R_star / (a)) * (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) * (something else), but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe I should look for the formula in terms of the semi-major axis. Wait, I found a formula before that the probability is P = (2 R_star) / (a (1 + sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) ), but again, with R_p << R_star, this can be approximated as (2 R_star)/(a*(1 + 1 )) = (2 R_star)/(2a) ) = R_star / a. 

Wait, that would make P ≈ R_star / a. But that doesn't seem right because if a is very large, the probability would be small, which makes sense. So the bigger a is, the less likely a transit. So for Planet_1, which has a shorter orbital period, its semi-major axis a is smaller. Because from Kepler's third law, a³ is proportional to P²/(M_star). 

Wait, yes! Let's think about Kepler's third law. The formula is (a^3) / (P^2) ) = (G(M + m)) / (4π²). But since M >> m (for planets), we can approximate a³ ≈ (G M P²)/(4 π²). 

So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3). So Planet_1 has orbital period P1 = P2 / 3. So the ratio of their semi-major axes is a1/a2 = [ (M1 * (P1²) ) / (M2 * (P2²) ) ]^(1/3). 

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. M1 is twice M2: M1 = 2 M2. P1 = P2/3. So:

a1^3 / a2^3 = ( (2 M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) ) / ( M2 * (P2^2) ) )

Simplify numerator: 2 M2 * (P2² /9) ) → (2/9) M2 P2².

Denominator: M2 P2².

So the ratio (a1³/a2³) = (2/9)/(1) ) → a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * (0.222)^0.333. 

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of that is about 0.6. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2. 

So Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis than Planet_2. 

Now, the transit probability for each is proportional to (R_star / a), as per the earlier formula. 

Wait no, earlier I thought P ≈ R_star / a. But perhaps that's not correct. Let me double-check. 

Another approach: the probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by a factor that depends on the size of the planet. But for Earth-like planets, which are much smaller than stars, the probability is roughly (R_star / a). 

But wait, I think the exact formula for the probability of a transit is:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a) * (something else). Or perhaps it's (R_star / a) * (some other geometric factor). 

Wait, according to the transit probability formula, it's actually given by:

P = (R_star / a) * [ (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) / (1 + sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) ) ] * 2 

Wait, I'm not so confident. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is approximately (2 R_star) / (a) * sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 ). But since R_p is small, it's ≈ (2 R_star) / a. 

Wait, that makes sense for the case where R_p is much smaller than R_star and a. Because the transit can happen when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and the area where this is possible is a function of the star's size relative to the orbit.

But perhaps the correct formula is P ≈ (R_star / a) × 2. 

Wait, I think I found a source once that the transit probability is approximately (R_*/a) where R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis. But that would make sense only if the orbit is viewed edge-on, but the probability is the chance of that happening. Oh wait, it's the fraction of the orbit where the planet could transit, considering the star's size. 

Wait, another way: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So it's (2 R_star) / (2 a) ) = R_star / a. So the probability is approximately R_star / a. 

If that's the case, then the transit probability is proportional to R_star divided by a. 

In this problem, both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2. 

So P1 = R1 / a1

P2 = R2 / a2 

So since R1 = R2, P1/P2 = a2 / a1. 

Because P1 is proportional to 1/a1, and P2 is proportional to 1/a2.

Wait, but earlier we found that a1 is about 0.6 a2. So P1 = R/(0.6 a2), P2 = R/(a2). 

So P1 = (1/0.6) * (R/(a2)) ) = 1.666... * (R/(a2)) 

P2 is R/(a2). 

So the ratio P1/P2 = 1.666..., so P1 is about 1.666 times higher than P2. 

So Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit. 

But wait, wait a second. Wait, the formula I used for the transit probability is correct? Because if a is smaller, the probability is higher. That makes sense, because a smaller a (closer planet) has a higher chance of transiting. 

So if Planet_1 has a shorter period, it is closer to its star (since a is smaller), which would imply a higher probability of transit. 

So in our case, P1 is about 1.666 times higher than P2. 

Looking at the options: 

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times higher.

Wait, 1.666 is approximately 1.67, which is close to 1.65. So option C would have Planet_1 being preferred.

But wait, let me check the a1 and a2 ratio again. 

Earlier, we had a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let's calculate that more accurately.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2. 

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So P1 = R / a1 = R / (0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.648 * (R/a2). 

P2 is R / a2. 

So the ratio P1/P2 is approximately 1.648, which is about 1.65 times higher. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

Thus, the researchers would prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

So looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is way too high. So the correct option is C.

To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. For a circular orbit, the transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \): the smaller \( a \), the higher the probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and a host star mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \). The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.648.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is preferred for observation.

From the options:

- **Option A** and **Option B** are incorrect because they suggest Planet_2 has a higher probability.
- **Option C** is correct, as it states Planet_1 is preferred due to a ~1.65 times higher probability.
- **Option D** is incorrect, as it overestimates the probability ratio.

Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Wait, yes! Let's think about Kepler's third law. The formula is (a^3) / (P^2) ) = (G(M + m)) / (4π²). But since M >> m (for planets), we can approximate a³ ≈ (G M P²)/(4 π²). 

So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3). So Planet_1 has orbital period P1 = P2 / 3. So the ratio of their semi-major axes is a1/a2 = [ (M1 * (P1²) ) / (M2 * (P2²) ) ]^(1/3). 

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. M1 is twice M2: M1 = 2 M2. P1 = P2/3. So:

a1^3 / a2^3 = ( (2 M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) ) / ( M2 * (P2^2) ) )

Simplify numerator: 2 M2 * (P2² /9) ) → (2/9) M2 P2².

Denominator: M2 P2².

So the ratio (a1³/a2³) = (2/9)/(1) ) → a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * (0.222)^0.333. 

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of that is about 0.6. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2. 

So Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis than Planet_2. 

Now, the transit probability for each is proportional to (R_star / a), as per the earlier formula. 

Wait no, earlier I thought P ≈ R_star / a. But perhaps that's not correct. Let me double-check.

If that's the case, then the transit probability is proportional to R_star divided by a. 

In this problem, both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2. 

So P1 = R1 / a1

P2 = R2 / a2 

So since R1 = R2, P1/P2 = a2 / a1. 

Because P1 is proportional to 1/a1, and P2 is proportional to 1/a2.

Wait, but earlier we found that a1 is about 0.6 a2. So P1 = R/(0.6 a2), P2 = R/(a2). 

So P1 = (1/0.6) * (R/(a2)) ) = 1.666... * (R/(a2)) 

P2 is R/(a2). 

So the ratio P1/P2 = 1.666..., so P1 is about 1.666 times higher than P2. 

So Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit. 

But wait, wait a second. Wait, the formula I used for the transit probability is correct? Because if a is smaller, the probability is higher. That makes sense, because a smaller a (closer planet) has a higher chance of transiting. 

So if Planet_1 has a shorter period, it is closer to its star (since a is smaller), which would imply a higher probability of transit. 

So in our case, P1 is about 1.666 times higher than P2. 

Looking at the options: 

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times higher.

Wait, 1.666 is approximately 1.67, which is close to 1.65. So option C would have Planet_1 being preferred.

But wait, let me check the a1 and a2 ratio again. 

Earlier, we had a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let's calculate that more accurately.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2. 

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So P1 = R / a1 = R / (0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.648 * (R/a2). 

P2 is R / a2. 

So the ratio P1/P2 is approximately 1.648, which is about 1.65 times higher. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

Thus, the researchers would prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

So looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is way too high. So the correct option is C.


To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. For a circular orbit, the transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \): the smaller \( a \), the higher the probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and a host star mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \). The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.648.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is preferred for observation.

From the options:

- **Option A** and **Option B** are incorrect because they suggest Planet_2 has a higher probability.
- **Option C** is correct, as it states Planet_1 is preferred due to a ~1.65 times higher probability.
- **Option D** is incorrect, as it overestimates the probability ratio.

Answer: C
