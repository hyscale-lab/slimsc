Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about titrating acetic acid. So, we're given that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The reaction should produce acetate ions and water.

Wait, so first, I think I need to calculate the initial concentrations after diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³, then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M. When we dilute it, the concentration should change. Since we're doubling the volume (from 20 to 40), the concentration halves. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles first.

Moles of acetic acid in diluted solution: volume (L) times concentration. So 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol. So 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles divided by concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.1 M NaOH is 0.1 mol per liter. So 0.001 mol needs 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. That would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted. So when we add 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence, that's 2.5 cm³ added to the diluted solution, which is 20 cm³ of acetic acid solution plus 20 cm³ water, making 40 cm³, plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Hmm, but maybe I don't need to worry about the total volume yet.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let me think about each part: first, the pH at 25% titration, then the pH at equivalence.

Starting with 25% titration. So, 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence has been added. So, the moles of NaOH added are 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol.

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, initially, in the diluted solution, there are 0.001 mol of CH3COOH. When we add 0.00025 mol of NaOH, it will react with 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH, producing 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

So, after reaction:
Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.
Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume has increased. The initial solution is 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so the total volume is now 42.5 cm³.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since we're dealing with a weak acid and its conjugate base, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) = 0 - (-4.735) ≈ 4.735.

Wait, let me calculate pKa properly.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, the first part (25% titration) is around 4.26. Let me check the options.

Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

The moles of NaOH at equivalence is 0.001 mol. The volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.

Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced:

x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485.

pH = 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515.

So pH at equivalence is about 8.515, which is approximately 8.52. So looking at the options, option A gives 4.26 and 8.52.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for equivalence point. Wait, the volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. 0.001 mol / 0.05 L is 0.02 M, correct. Kb is 5.405e-10. The calculation for x seems correct.

Wait, but wait, let me check the Kb calculation again. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is indeed approximately 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait another thing. The acetate concentration is 0.02 M, correct. So Kb is 5.405e-10. Let me compute x again.

x^2 = Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So OH- is 3.288e-6 M. pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517, so log(3.288e-6) is 5.517? Wait, no, wait: log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → 0.517 -6 → -5.483. So pOH is 5.483, so pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517. So about 8.52.

So option A says 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point pH depends on the salt formed. For acetic acid, the salt is sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base and should result in a basic solution, so pH >7. So the equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which makes sense. But option D's equivalence point is 6.92, which is acidic, which can't be right. So that suggests that option A or D is possible.

Wait, but wait, another possibility. Perhaps I miscalculated the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, when you titrate a weak acid (like acetic acid) with a strong base (like NaOH), the equivalence point is in the basic range because the salt formed (CH3COONa) is the conjugate base of a weak acid. So the solution should be basic, pH>7. So the equivalence point can't be 6.92, which is acidic. So that rules out option D and C (which has 7.00, which is neutral). So only option A and B's equivalence points are above 7 or not.

Wait, option B's equivalence point is 6.73, which is acidic. No, that can't be. So option A is the only one where equivalence is 8.52, which is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me check the 25% titration again. I calculated 4.26, which matches option A. But let me think about another approach.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base. So the Henderson equation should apply.

The ratio of [A^-]/[HA] is (moles of A^-)/(moles of HA). The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 *0.001 =0.00025 mol is converted to A^-.

So moles of HA = 0.00075, moles A^- =0.00025. Ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈0.333.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈4.733 -0.477≈4.256, which is 4.26 as before.

So the first part of option A is correct. So the 25% point is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52. So the answer should be option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. So why is that? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, when all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L =0.02 M.

The Kb for acetate is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10.

So Kb =5.405e-10.

Set up the expression:

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02) → x^2 = 0.02 *5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11.

So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈3.288e-6.

[OH-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515, which is 8.52, as before.

So yes, option A's equivalence point pH is correct.

But wait, another thought—could there be a mistake in the initial dilution step? Let me double-check.

Original volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Diluted with 20 cm³ of water, so total is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: M1V1 = M2V2 → 0.05 *20 = M2 *40 → M2= (0.05 *20)/40 = (1) /40 → 0.025 M. Correct.

So, no mistake there.

So the 25% point is 4.26, equivalence 8.52. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me look back at the options. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, in the 25% calculation, I considered 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. But wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, adding 2.5 cm³ gives 42.5 cm³ total.

So moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 /0.0425 L = 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 /0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈0.333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.333) → pKa is 4.733. log(0.333)=-0.477.

So pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256. So 4.26. So that's correct.

So the first part is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: what if I made a mistake in the 25% titration point? Because 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³, but sometimes the way the question is phrased, it could be 25% of the acetic acid neutralized, which would be the same as 25% of the equivalence volume. So I think I did it right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of pKa. Let me recheck that.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5).

I think I did that correctly. Let me compute it more accurately.

log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → log(1.85)=0.267, so 0.267 -5= -4.733. pKa is 4.733. Correct.

So the Henderson equation calculation is correct.

So the answer should be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

But wait, the options: option A is 4.26; 8.52.

But wait, I'm looking at the problem again. The diluted solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid plus 20 cm³ water. So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Hmm, I think everything checks out. So the answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. When diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula:

\[
M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \implies 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = M_2 \times 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \implies M_2 = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.040 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Moles of unreacted acetic acid (HA): \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of acetate ion (A⁻): \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume of the solution is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the ratio:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming a solution of sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The moles of acetate ion (A⁻) are equal to the moles of acetic acid initially present:

\[
\text{Moles of A}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of OH⁻ at equilibrium be \( x \). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( x \ll 0.020 \), so \( [\text{A}^-] - x \approx 0.020 \). Thus:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.020 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about titrating acetic acid. So, we're given that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The reaction should produce acetate ions and water.

Wait, so first, I think I need to calculate the initial concentrations after diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³, then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M. When we dilute it, the concentration should change. Since we're doubling the volume (from 20 to 40), the concentration halves. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles first.

Moles of acetic acid in diluted solution: volume (L) times concentration. So 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol. So 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles divided by concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.1 M NaOH is 0.1 mol per liter. So 0.001 mol needs 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. That would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted. So when we add 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence, that's 2.5 cm³ added to the diluted solution, which is 20 cm³ of acetic acid solution plus 20 cm³ water, making 40 cm³, plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Hmm, but maybe I don't need to worry about the total volume yet.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let me think about each part: first, the pH at 25% titration, then the pH at equivalence.

Starting with 25% titration. So, 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence has been added. So, the moles of NaOH added are 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol.

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, initially, in the diluted solution, there are 0.001 mol of CH3COOH. When we add 0.00025 mol of NaOH, it will react with 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH, producing 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

So, after reaction:
Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.
Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume has increased. The initial solution is 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so the total volume is now 42.5 cm³.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since we're dealing with a weak acid and its conjugate base, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) = 0 - (-4.735) ≈ 4.735.

Wait, let me calculate pKa properly.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, the first part (25% titration) is around 4.26. Let me check the options.

Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

The moles of NaOH at equivalence is 0.001 mol. The volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.

Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced:

x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485.

pH = 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515.

So pH at equivalence is about 8.515, which is approximately 8.52. So looking at the options, option A gives 4.26 and 8.52.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for equivalence point. Wait, the volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. 0.001 mol / 0.05 L is 0.02 M, correct. Kb is 5.405e-10. The calculation for x seems correct.

Wait, but wait, let me check the Kb calculation again. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is indeed approximately 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait another thing. The acetate concentration is 0.02 M, correct. So Kb is 5.405e-10. Let me compute x again.

x^2 = Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So OH- is 3.288e-6 M. pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517, so log(3.288e-6) is 5.517? Wait, no, wait: log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → 0.517 -6 → -5.483. So pOH is 5.483, so pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517. So about 8.52.

So option A says 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point pH depends on the salt formed. For acetic acid, the salt is sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base and should result in a basic solution, so pH >7. So the equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which makes sense. But option D's equivalence point is 6.92, which is acidic, which can't be right. So that suggests that option A or D is possible.

Wait, but wait, another possibility. Perhaps I miscalculated the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, when you titrate a weak acid (like acetic acid) with a strong base (like NaOH), the equivalence point is in the basic range because the salt formed (CH3COONa) is the conjugate base of a weak acid. So the solution should be basic, pH>7. So the equivalence point can't be 6.92, which is acidic. So that rules out option D and C (which has 7.00, which is neutral). So only option A and B's equivalence points are above 7 or not.

Wait, option B's equivalence point is 6.73, which is acidic. No, that can't be. So option A is the only one where equivalence is 8.52, which is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me check the 25% titration again. I calculated 4.26, which matches option A. But let me think about another approach.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base. So the Henderson equation should apply.

The ratio of [A^-]/[HA] is (moles of A^-)/(moles of HA). The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 *0.001 =0.00025 mol is converted to A^-.

So moles of HA = 0.00075, moles A^- =0.00025. Ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈0.333.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈4.733 -0.477≈4.256, which is 4.26 as before.

So the first part of option A is correct. So the 25% point is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52. So the answer should be option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. So why is that? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, when all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L =0.02 M.

The Kb for acetate is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10.

So Kb =5.405e-10.

Set up the expression:

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02) → x^2 = 0.02 *5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11.

So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈3.288e-6.

[OH-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515, which is 8.52, as before.

So yes, option A's equivalence point pH is correct.

But wait, another thought—could there be a mistake in the initial dilution step? Let me double-check.

Original volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Diluted with 20 cm³ of water, so total is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: M1V1 = M2V2 → 0.05 *20 = M2 *40 → M2= (0.05 *20)/40 = (1) /40 → 0.025 M. Correct.

So, no mistake there.

So the 25% point is 4.26, equivalence 8.52. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me look back at the options. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, in the 25% calculation, I considered 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. But wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, adding 2.5 cm³ gives 42.5 cm³ total.

So moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 /0.0425 L = 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 /0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈0.333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.333) → pKa is 4.733. log(0.333)=-0.477.

So pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256. So 4.26. So that's correct.

So the first part is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: what if I made a mistake in the 25% titration point? Because 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³, but sometimes the way the question is phrased, it could be 25% of the acetic acid neutralized, which would be the same as 25% of the equivalence volume. So I think I did it right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of pKa. Let me recheck that.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5).

I think I did that correctly. Let me compute it more accurately.

log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → log(1.85)=0.267, so 0.267 -5= -4.733. pKa is 4.733. Correct.

So the Henderson equation calculation is correct.

So the answer should be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

But wait, the options: option A is 4.26; 8.52.

But wait, I'm looking at the problem again. The diluted solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid plus 20 cm³ water. So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Hmm, I think everything checks out. So the answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. When diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula:

\[
M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \implies 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = M_2 \times 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \implies M_2 = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.040 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Moles of unreacted acetic acid (HA): \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of acetate ion (A⁻): \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume of the solution is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the ratio:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming a solution of sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The moles of acetate ion (A⁻) are equal to the moles of acetic acid initially present:

\[
\text{Moles of A}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of OH⁻ at equilibrium be \( x \). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( x \ll 0.020 \), so \( [\text{A}^-] - x \approx 0.020 \). Thus:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.020 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
