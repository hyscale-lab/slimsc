Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an acid anhydride or maybe an ester? Or wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, wait—red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of an acid chloride, right? Because acid chlorides react with water or HI to form carboxylic acids. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

So, first, I need to figure out what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Then, after identifying X, I can determine what happens when it's reacted with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, probably from O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. But wait, that region is also typical for alcohols or maybe an amine. But the 1720 cm-1 peak is strong. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H (broad, around 2500-3300) and a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. But the peak here is at 1720, which is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or maybe a ketone? Wait, no, a ketone's carbonyl is around 1715 cm-1, so 1720 could fit. Or maybe an acid anhydride? The anhydride has a higher carbonyl stretch, around 1800s, so probably not. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, X has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a pretty high chemical shift, indicative of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, aldehydes are deshielded, but that could also be an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, the IR has a broad peak in 3400-2500, which could be the O-H of a carboxylic acid. So maybe the 10.5 ppm is the -COOH proton. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but 10.5 is a bit low. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde? Or maybe an acidic proton from a different group.

Looking further at the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two doublets. The coupling suggests that it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So, perhaps a para-substituted benzene, where each substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, maybe a carbonyl.

The other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let me think about that. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl group. Wait, the triplet suggests the CH2 is next to another CH2—like in an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet of 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, maybe a branched chain. Wait, let me see:

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl group. Maybe a CH that's attached to a carbonyl? Or perhaps a CH in a branched chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is two protons, perhaps on a CH2 next to a branching point. So perhaps we have a structure where the carbonyl is attached to a branched alkyl group.

Putting this together: the aromatic ring is para-substituted with a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an acid) and another group. Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, which is a bit high for a ketone. Let's see: carboxylic acids have around 1700, esters around 1740-1720, ketones around 1715. 1720 could be an ester or maybe an acid chloride, but the presence of O-H in IR would suggest it's not an acid chloride. So maybe an ester.

Hmm, but the NMR doesn't show any ester oxygen (like OCH2 or something), but wait, the 10.5 could be an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde. Wait, but the IR at 3400-2500 could be an aldehyde as well as other O-H groups.

Wait, let me think again. Let's parse the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12, but sometimes aldehydes are around 9-10.5, but the broadness (bs) could also suggest a carboxylic acid. Wait, wait, aldehyde protons are usually sharp singlets. If it's a broad signal, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So the 10.5 might be -COOH.

If that's the case, then the IR's 3400-2500 cm-1 is the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The 1720 could be a carbonyl, which would fit a carboxylic acid (but usually around 1700). Wait, but maybe it's a conjugated acid, which would have a higher wavenumber? Or perhaps it's an ester. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR doesn't show any ester groups. Let me see: if it's an aromatic ring para-substituted with a carboxylic acid and another group, what would the other group be? The NMR shows a singlet at 1.4 ppm, 3H, which is a methyl group attached to something. And there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a terminal methyl group. So perhaps the chain is something like CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH attached to the ring?

Wait, the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl. Like, the structure could be benzene with a COOH group, and another substituent that's a branched alkyl.

Wait, looking at the substituent, perhaps it's a propanoic acid group, with a substituent on the alpha carbon. Let me think: the NMR shows 2.9 (1H, m), 1.7 (2H, m), 1.4 (3H, d), and 0.9 (3H, t). That seems like a chain that's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, let me sketch a possible structure. The aromatic ring is para-substituted. One substituent is -COOH (if that's the case), and the other is an alkyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an alkoxy group, but the NMR doesn't show any OCH2 or OCH3, so maybe not.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data again. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that are electron-withdrawing, like carbonyl groups or nitro groups. But in this case, it's more likely a carbonyl group.

So, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a benzaldehyde or a carboxylic acid) and another group.

Looking at the 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9 peaks: 2.9 is a methine (CH) with some splitting, 1.7 is a methylene (CH2), 1.4 is a methyl (CH3) as a doublet, and 0.9 is a triplet (another CH3). This could represent a chain like CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOH? Or maybe a different arrangement.

Wait, putting it all together: the 1.4 (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H) might form an ethyl group. Because a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is likely a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 (d,3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me think about the alkyl chain. The splitting and the chemical shifts suggest a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- but I'm not quite sure. Let me try to figure out the connectivity.

Alternatively, let's consider that the substituent on the benzene is a ketone group. If the substituent is a ketone, like a benzophenone structure, but that doesn't fit with the NMR here because there's no aldehyde proton. Or perhaps it's an aryl ester.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group (COCH2CH2CH3). But the NMR doesn't have a triplet for a CH2CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanoic acid with a branch. For example, the substituent is a (something)propanoic acid.

Wait, the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which might be an ester group. If it's an ester, then the structure would be aryl-O-CO-R or R-O-CO-aryl. But the NMR doesn't show an OCH2 or OCH3 group, which would be expected in an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone, like a benzaldehyde with a ketone group. But then where is the aldehyde proton?

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a broad peak in 3400-2500, which could be an alcohol's O-H. But then the carbonyl at 1720 could be an ester. But without seeing the OCH2 in NMR, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with a branched chain. So, the substituent on the benzene is a propanal group with a branch.

Wait, the NMR has a singlet at 10.5, which would be an aldehyde proton. Then the IR would have a peak in 3400-2500, which could be an aldehyde's O-H? Wait, no, aldehydes don't have O-H; that's for alcohols or carboxylic acids. So that can't be.

So, going back, the 10.5 peak is likely a carboxylic acid O-H. So the substituent is a carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring. Then the other substituent is a branched alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR again, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH next to the COOH group. So, perhaps the structure is benzene with a COOH group and a substituent that's a propyl group with branching.

Wait, the substituent attached to the benzene would be a group like -(CH2)n-COOH. But in our case, the substituent is more complex.

So, let's imagine the substituent is a propyl group that's branched. For example, a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar.

Wait, but the NMR shows 1.4 (d,3H), which suggests that the methyl is attached to a CH. So, maybe the substituent is a (1-methylpropyl) group. Alternatively, that could be a tert-butyl group, but the NMR doesn't have a singlet for a tert-butyl.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. Let me see: a sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2. No, wait, a sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is actually CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, no, the structure of isobutyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituent is probably a branched alkyl group, but let's think about the NMR peaks. So, the 0.9 (t,3H) is a methyl group at the end of a chain. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. The 1.7 (m,2H) is a CH2 group, and the 2.9 (m,1H) is a CH.

Putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a four-carbon chain, like:

Benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (COOH), and another substituent that's a butyl group arranged in a certain way.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The substituent would be connected to the benzene ring as an alkyl group. So, the substituent is perhaps a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, let's consider the substituent as a (CH2)2CH(CH3)- group. Hmm, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a methyl group connected to a CH2. So, perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH2CH(CH2CH3). But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, like CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that's a geminal dimethyl, which is possible.

Wait, let me think about the integration. The 2.9 (1H) is a CH, 1.7 (2H) is CH2, 1.4 (3H) is CH3, and 0.9 (3H) is CH3. So, perhaps the substituent is:

Benzene ring - COOH and another substituent which is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene ring. Let me draw this out.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CO- group? No, not necessarily. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2- something) group. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Let me try a different approach. Looking at the options, the possible products after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The options are all substituted benzoic acids or benzene derivatives.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I recall that when acid chlorides react with HI, they undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids. Also, the reaction of an acid chloride with red phosphorus and HI is called the Gattermann–Koch reaction? Wait, no, the Gattermann–Koch reaction is for the formylation of aromatic rings, using CO and HCl with AlCl3 as catalyst. So not that.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used for the conversion of esters into carboxylic acids. Or, more accurately, the hydrolysis of acid chlorides. Wait, acid chlorides (R-COCl) when treated with HI would produce R-COOH and HCl. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is for demethylation of methyl esters, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a hydrolysis of an acyl chloride. So, if Compound X is an acyl chloride (like benzoyl chloride), reacting with HI would give a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. If X is an ester, reacting with HI might cause saponification (if it's an ethyl ester), but I'm not certain about that.

Wait, but let me think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. So, if Compound X is an acid chloride, the reaction would produce the corresponding carboxylic acid.

So, the product would be a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which seems a bit confusing. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a benzene with substituents.

Wait, but let's get back to what Compound X is.

Let me try to reconstruct the structure of Compound X.

From the NMR data:

- Two doublets in the aromatic region (8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each 2H), suggests a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, actually, if it's para-substituted, there would be two doublets for the aromatic protons. So that's consistent with a substituent in the para position, perhaps a substituent that's an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

So, the benzene ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like COOH or COOR or COR) and another substituent which is an alkyl group.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene are at para positions. So, if one substituent is a COOH group, the other substituent would be an alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR of the alkyl region:

At 2.9 ppm (m,1H) – probably a CH attached to something.

At 1.7 ppm (m,2H) – a CH2 group.

At 1.4 ppm (d,3H) – a CH3 attached to a CH.

At 0.9 ppm (t,3H) – a CH3 at the end of a chain.

Putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a branched alkyl group, such as a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3), right? No, wait, no. Let me get this straight. The butyl group can be in different positions.

A) n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH2-

B) isobutyl (or 2-methylpropyl): -CH2CH(CH3)2

Wait, no. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The substituent is a butyl group.

- n-butyl: straight chain (CH2)3CH3.

- isobutyl: the branching is on the second carbon. So, it's CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's not correct. Wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the substituent as a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Hmm. Let's think about the substituent attached to the benzene. Let's imagine that the substituent is a propyl group where the middle carbon is branched with a methyl. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, but that doesn't fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, let me think about the substituent as a four-carbon chain. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a terminal methyl group. So that's a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH attached to something. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 group.

So, the substituent would be something like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group, which doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon chain with a branch.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. That would mean a substituent like -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. But that's a four-carbon chain, but the NMR doesn't have enough protons for that.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2-. But how does that fit the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent would be a four-carbon group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, let me think in terms of the substituent's structure. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring and has the following substructure:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

But that's a four-carbon chain, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which would be the end of a CH2CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, but no, that would require more protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a pentyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So, that would be an isobutyl group.

Wait, the isobutyl group has the structure -CH2CH(CH3)2. Let me see: the substituent would be attached to the benzene as -CH2CH(CH3)2.

But wait, the NMR would then have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) for the CH2CH3 group. The isobutyl group's protons would be:

- The terminal methyl (CH2CH3) gives a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

- The middle CH would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Wait, but in the isobutyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the central CH would have two CH3 groups attached. So, the NMR would show for the isobutyl group:

- The central CH as a septet (if split by two adjacent CH3 groups), but in the given data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, which could fit.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a m (multiplet) of 1H, which would correspond to the central CH in the isobutyl group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the two CH2 groups in the isobutyl structure. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2, so the CH2 is next to the benzene, and the CH is connected to two methyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that would be a pentyl group, which I don't think is present.

Wait, another approach: the substituent on the benzene could be an alkyl group with the formula -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-methylpentyl group. No, that seems too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon, making it a iso-propyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, which would be an isopropyl group attached to the benzene. But the NMR would show a singlet for the isopropyl's methyl groups, but in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which doesn't fit a singlet.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Let me see: that would be a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. But that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group, which would be an isopropyl group. But then the NMR would have a septet for the central CH, which isn't present.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)- group, which would split into more peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, like -CH(CH2CH2CH3). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, but I'm not making progress here.

Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, these are the products after the reaction.

If the reaction is hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be a benzoic acid derivative with the substituent being the same as in the starting material.

So, if the starting material is an acid chloride, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Alternatively, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, but the starting material's IR has a carbonyl at 1720. If it's a benzoyl chloride, the carbonyl would be higher, around 1800. So, perhaps the starting material is an ester. Wait, the ester's carbonyl is around 1740, so 1720 could be a conjugated ester.

Wait, another thought: the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound is an aromatic ester or an aromatic ketone.

Wait, if it's an ester, the structure would be Ar-O-CO-R.

But the NMR doesn't have any oxygenated protons, like OCH2 or OCH3. So, perhaps it's an aromatic ketone.

Wait, but a ketone's NMR wouldn't have a proton attached to the carbonyl. So, for a benzophenone-type structure, the NMR would show the aromatic protons, but where would the ketone's CH3 be?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene. So, the structure would be benzene with a COCH2CH2CH3 group. But that would mean the substituent is a propyl ketone.

But then, the NMR would show the propyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanoyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a carbonyl, making it a benzene ring with a COCH2CH(CH3) group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branching on the second carbon, making it a iso-propyl propionyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options. If the product is a benzoic acid, then the starting material must have been an acid chloride. So, which option becomes a benzoic acid after hydrolysis? Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would be the product if the starting material was 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride.

Looking at the starting material's NMR, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene and a carbonyl group.

Wait, the substituent would be a benzoyl group with a sec-butyl substituent.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene would be -CO-(sec-butyl). But that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, let me think again. The benzene substituents: one is a carbonyl group (COOH or COR) and the other is an alkyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think of it as a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which is a CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent would have a CH2CH3 at the end.

So, substituent: benzene ring - COOH and another substituent which is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group? No, that's a pentyl group.

Alternatively, substituent is benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, that's an isobutyl group. So, substituents would be COOH and isobutyl in para positions.

So, the structure would be 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Is isobutyl the same as sec-butyl? Let me think. No, wait, the substituent is a butyl group. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2, whereas the sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the butyl groups can be:

1. n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3.

2. isobutyl: -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no. Wait, the isobutyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the terminology wrong. Let me think: the 'sec-' in substituents refers to the position of the branch. So, a sec-butyl group would have the branch on the second carbon.

So, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-?

No, wait. Wait, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, no. Let me get this straight. The butyl group can be in different forms:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

- isobutyl (or 2-methylpropyl): CH(CH3)2CH2-.

Wait, no. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer to IUPAC nomenclature.

The substituent butyl can be named as:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH(CH3)CH2CH2-

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think of the substituent as a four-carbon chain. The position of the substituent on the benzene is para.

So, the substituent would be a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, and the benzoic acid group is in the para position.

The benzoic acid would have a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. The substituent on the para position would be the sec-butyl group.

So, the starting material would have been 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. When this reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to form 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the product would be option C.

But let me check the NMR data again. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the structure of the sec-butyl group is actually -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the structure is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, if it's a sec-butyl group, the structure is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as a four-carbon chain with the branch on the second carbon. So, it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon group. No, wait, the substituent is a butyl group, so four carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be a iso-butyl group.

Wait, the iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show the following:

The iso-butyl group: the central CH (attached to two CH3 groups) would be a septet (7 peaks), but in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (m) of 1H. That doesn't match a septet.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, that's a four-carbon substituent. So, the substituent is a iso-pentyl group? No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that's a pentyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR data of the substituent.

The substituent has:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): this is a terminal methyl group, so a CH2CH3.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): this is a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): a CH2 group.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): a CH group.

So, the substituent would be a chain that starts with the benzene, then has a CH2, then a CH, then a CH2, then a CH2CH3.

Wait, that would be a pentyl group: benzene-CH2-CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that would be a straight chain, but the NMR data has a doublet at 1.4 ppm, which doesn't fit a straight chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a branch. Let me try to write the structure:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

In this case, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene.

But that would require a four-carbon substituent.

So, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent is a iso-butyl group.

Wait, but the iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the substituent nomenclature.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, that's a four-carbon substituent with a branch on the second carbon.

So, the substituent would look like:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon, making it a iso-butyl group.

So, the substituent is a iso-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the structure of the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the substituent as a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

So, substituent: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH3.

That's an isobutyl group.

In that case, the substituent on the benzene ring would be a isobutyl group.

So, the NMR would have:

The methyl groups (CH3) attached to the central CH would be a doublet (if they're attached to a CH which is next to a CH2). Wait, no. For the isobutyl group, the NMR would have:

The central CH would be split into a septet (if coupled with two CH3 groups), but in the given data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, leading to a chain like:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

But that's a four-carbon substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group, which would be an iso-propyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the substituent would then be a three-carbon group, which doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's a longer chain.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should proceed based on the options. From the data, the product after reaction is a benzoic acid. So, the correct option is C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data and determining the final product after it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows a broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ region, consistent with an O-H stretch (likely from a carboxylic acid), and a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. The aromatic C=C stretching peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ further suggest the presence of a para-substituted benzene ring.

The NMR data provides additional structural insights:
- A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- Two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) confirm a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- Peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) indicate a branched alkyl group. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a terminal methyl group (CH₃), the doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) indicates a methyl group attached to a CH, and the multiplets at 2.9 ppm (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) correspond to a CH and CH₂ group, respectively.

From this analysis, Compound X is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. When it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the acid chloride undergoes hydrolysis to form the corresponding carboxylic acid, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Among the options provided:
- **Option A** (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid) does not match the substituent pattern or the reaction conditions.
- **Option B** (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene) is not a carboxylic acid and does not fit the reaction.
- **Option C** (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) matches the expected product of the hydrolysis reaction.
- **Option D** (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene) is not a carboxylic acid and does not fit the reaction.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
