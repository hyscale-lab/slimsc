Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember from my astronomy class that spectrographs have different capabilities, especially in terms of the brightness of the stars they can observe. 

The question gives me a bunch of stars with various parameters, and I need to figure out which ones are bright enough to be seen by both instruments. Let me parse the information given.

First, the key points:
- ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So anything with V < 17 is observable.
- HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So V < 16 mag.

Wait, no, wait. Wait the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO" — so that means apparent V less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. Similarly for HIRES, apparent V <16 mag.

So a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So the star must have apparent V magnitude less than 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's less than 16, then it's also less than 17. So the star must be apparent V mag <=15.999, but let's see the options.

Now, looking at each star and calculating their apparent V magnitudes if not already given.

Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15.5 mag.
- Distance is 10 pc. 

Wait, the formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = Mv + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for Star1, m = 15.5 +5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5 +5 * 0 = 15.5. So m=15.5.

That's 15.5, which is less than 16. So it's observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES? Wait, no. Wait, HIRES requires m <16. So m=15.5 is okay for both. But wait, ESPRESSO goes up to m=17. So Star1's m=15.5 is within both. So both can detect it.

Wait, but let me check the other stars.

Star2:
- Apparent V mag is 16.5. So m=16.5.
- HIRES can't see it because it's more than 16 (brighter than 16 would be m=16.0 and below). 16.5 is more than 16, so it's too faint for HIRES but maybe okay for ESPRESSO? Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So Star2 is visible to ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it's out of the options.

Star3:
- Apparent V mag is 15.5 mag, but wait, the question also mentions E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. Oh, right, that's the color excess, which is related to interstellar extinction (dust reddening and dimming). The formula given is that the total absorption in V band is E(B-V) * 3.1. So extinction A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V).

So Star3's actual apparent V magnitude before extinction is m = 15.5 - A_v. Wait, wait wait. No, extinction makes stars appear dimmer, which means their apparent magnitude increases. So if the star's light is absorbed, the observed m is higher than the intrinsic.

Wait, wait, let me think. The formula for extinction is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. So if the star is dimmed by extinction, its apparent magnitude is higher (since m is higher, meaning fainter). So in this case, Star3's given apparent magnitude (m) is 15.5, but that's after extinction. Wait, no, wait. The star's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5 mag, but does that include extinction or not? Let's read the question again.

Star3's parameters: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So I think the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, which includes the extinction. Wait, no, perhaps the given values are the intrinsic, and the extinction applies. Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc and E(B-V) =0.6." So I think that the given m is the observed one, which includes extinction. But wait, another way: if the apparent magnitude is measured through the dust, then to get the intrinsic m, you subtract the extinction.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The star emits light, but dust along the line of sight makes it appear dimmer. So the observed (apparent) magnitude is m = m_intrinsic + A_v, where A_v is extinction in V band. So if you have an observed m, and you know A_v, then the intrinsic (what it would be without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v.

But wait, in the question, when it gives Star3's apparent magnitude as 15.5, is that the observed (after extinction) or the intrinsic? Hmm, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" and E(B-V)=0.6, so I think the apparent magnitude is the observed, which includes the extinction. So to find the intrinsic magnitude, we subtract A_v.

Wait, no, no, wait. Let me think again. Extinction makes the star appear dimmer. So if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, then the observed apparent magnitude is higher (since lower brightness means larger m). So if the star's true apparent magnitude without extinction is m0, then the observed m is m0 + A_v.

So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5. Assuming it's observed, then the intrinsic m0 would be 15.5 - A_v, where A_v is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86.

So m0 = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. Hmm, but wait, that would be the apparent magnitude without extinction. So the star is actually brighter than 13.64. But does that matter for the instruments? Because the instruments are looking at the observed m. So Star3's observed m is 15.5. Since HIRES can observe up to 16, so 15.5 is acceptable. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so it's fine as well. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is less than both 16 and 17. So both can detect it.

Wait, but wait. I'm not sure if the given apparent magnitude includes extinction. Oh! Wait, the question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag. Does that include the extinction? Or is that the intrinsic magnitude? Because E(B-V) is given, which is the color excess, which is used to compute the extinction.

Wait, the way the question is written: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag." So I think that the given apparent magnitude is the corrected, extinction-included value. Or wait, perhaps it's the observed value, and the extinction is the amount by which it's reddened. So to get the intrinsic apparent magnitude, we subtract the extinction. Wait, no, because extinction affects the apparent magnitude as m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. So if a star's intrinsic apparent magnitude is 13.64, but due to extinction, it's observed as 15.5.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. Let's say a star has an intrinsic (absolute) magnitude M. Its apparent magnitude without extinction would be m0 = M + 5 log (d/10). If it is at 15 pc, then d=15, so m0 = M +5*(log(1.5)) ≈ M +5*(0.176) ≈ M +0.88.

But the actual observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m0 + A_v. So if the question gives m_observed as 15.5, and we have A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 1.86, then m0 = m_observed - A_v = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But that would mean that without extinction, the apparent magnitude is 13.64. But wait, does that matter for the instruments? Because the instruments are looking at the observed m, which is 15.5. So the m observed is 15.5, which is still less than 16 and 17. So both instruments can see it. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is acceptable by both.

But wait, the question says that with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. So m <16. So 15.5 is okay for HIRES. So Star3 is observable by both.

Wait, but wait. The original apparent magnitude without extinction would be 13.64. But that's not what is observed. The observed m is 15.5. So yes, both spectrographs can detect it.

Star4:
- Absolute V magnitude is 15.5.
- Distance is 10 pc.
- E(B-V) =0.4.

So first, calculate the apparent magnitude without extinction: m0 = M +5 log (d/10) =15.5 +5*(log(1)) =15.5. Then, compute extinction A_v=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed m = m0 + A_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, so the observed apparent magnitude is 16.74. Now, for HIRES, the limit is m <16. So 16.74 is above 16, meaning HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is below 17, so ESPRESSO can observe it.

But wait, wait a second. The question says that Star4's parameters are absolute magnitude 15.5, which is similar to Star1 and Star4. But this one has extinction, so the observed m is higher than the intrinsic. So Star4's observed m is 16.74.

So Star4 is visible to ESPRESSO (m=16.74 <17) but not to HIRES (16.74>16). So Star4 is only detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star5:
- Absolute V magnitude is 16.5.
- Distance is 5 pc.

So m0 = M +5 log(d/10) =16.5 +5*(log(0.5))=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, approx 15.0.

Wait, but Star5's parameters: absolute magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc. Let me compute m0:

m0 = 16.5 +5 * log(5/10) =16.5 +5 * log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, which is about 15.0.

So m0 is 15.0. Now, what about extinction? Oh, the question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star5. So I assume there's no extinction, or E(B-V) is zero. So the observed m is 15.0.

So, m=15.0. For HIRES, 15.0 is less than 16, so detectable. For ESPRESSO, 15.0 is less than 17, so also detectable. So Star5 is visible by both.

Wait, but wait. The question states that Star5's parameters are absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. So m0 is 15.0, as I computed. So that's under 16. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

So, going back, which stars can be seen by both? Let's recap:

Star1:
- m=15.5. Both can see it, since 15.5 <16 (HIRES) and <17 (ESPRESSO).

Star2:
- m=16.5. Only ESPRESSO can see it.

Star3:
- m=15.5. Both can see it.

Star4:
- m=16.74. Only ESPRESSO.

Star5:
- m=15.0. Both can see it.

Wait, so which of the stars meet the condition of being observable by both?

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes.

Star5: yes.

Wait, but the options are:

Options:
A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, in the options, only two stars are correct. Let me re-examine all.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star3's apparent magnitude. Let me think again.

Star3: given apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction affects it. So the observed m is m = 15.5 + 1.86=17.36, which is above both limits. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So need to calculate the observed apparent magnitude.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the setup. The question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, and E(B-V)=0.6. So that 15.5 is the apparent magnitude as observed (i.e., after extinction). So in that case, m_observed is 15.5. So both spectrographs can see it.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the extinction is applied. If that's the case, then the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is above both 16 and 17. So neither spectrograph would see it. But that can't be because the question says something about being detected.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude, and the observed apparent magnitude is higher due to extinction. So if that's the case, then the observed m is 15.5 +1.86 =17.36. So that would be beyond ESPRESSO's limit (which is up to 17), since 17.36 is more than 17. So Star3 would not be detected by ESPRESSO or HIRES. But that seems unlikely because the star's distance is 15 pc, which is not too far, so maybe the apparent magnitude would be brighter.

Wait, perhaps I got it backwards. Let me think. The star's light is dimmed by extinction, making its apparent magnitude higher (fainter). So if Star3's intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5, then the observed m would be higher. So for example, m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

Wait, that would make the observed m =15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is beyond both instruments' limits. But that can't be, because the problem implies that Star3 is a candidate.

Alternatively, perhaps the given 15.5 is the observed (apparent) magnitude, already including the extinction. So in that case, the observed m is 15.5, which is under both 16 and 17. So both can detect it.

So in that case, Star3 is observable by both, and Star5 is as well.

Wait, but according to the options, B is Star3 and Star5.

So let me recheck each star.

Star1: m=15.5. So both can see it.

Star2: m=16.5. Only ESPRESSO can.

Star3: m=15.5. Both can see it.

Star4: m=16.74. Only ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can see it.

So which stars are observable by both? Stars 1,3,5.

But the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74 not seen by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both are seen by both, yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 not seen by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 not seen by HIRES.

So the correct answer would be B) Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star5's m is 15.0, but Star3 is 15.5. So both are under 16, so both observable by both instruments.

But wait, wait. Let's make sure:

Star3's m=15.5, which is less than 16. So HIRES can detect it.

Star5's m=15.0, which is less than 16. So both are okay.

So the options include B) Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but I had Star1 as 15.5 as well. So why isn't Star1 and Star3 and Star5 all being options? Because the options only allow two.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D says Star1 and Star4. Star1 is 15.5, which is okay for both, but Star4's m is 16.74, which is beyond HIRES' limit. So D is wrong.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

But the options don't have an option with all three. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me re-examine Star5.

Star5: absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

So m0 = M +5 log(d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10)=16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5-1.505=14.995≈15.0.

So m=15.0, which is under both limits.

So which options include Star5? Options B and D.

But D is Star1 and Star4. Star1 is okay, but Star4 isn't.

So the correct stars would be Star1, Star3, Star5. But the options don't have an option with three stars. So perhaps in the options, only some are correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is 16.74, so only ESPRESSO. HIRES can't see it. So A is wrong.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both have m <16. So correct.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 is 16.5. HIRES can't see it. So C is wrong.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is 15.5 (okay), Star4 is 16.74 (only ESPRESSO). So D is wrong.

So the correct option is B) Star3 and Star5.

But wait, earlier I thought Star1 was observable by both. So why isn't Star1 in the options?

Wait, the question asks which of the following stars can be detected with both. So the correct answer would include stars that are observable by both.

So Star1 is observable by both, but perhaps in the options I need to see if any option includes it.

Looking again at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → No.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → No.

D) Star1 and Star4 → No.

So the correct answer is B, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$). A star must satisfy both conditions to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M_V = 15.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - $m = 15.5$ satisfies $m < 16$ for HIRES and $m < 17$ for ESPRESSO.  
   - **Detectable by both instruments.**

2. **Star2**  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 16.5$  
   - $m = 16.5$ exceeds the HIRES limit ($m < 16$), but is within the ESPRESSO limit ($m < 17$).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

3. **Star3**  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 15.5$  
   - Color excess: $E(B-V) = 0.6$  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The given apparent magnitude already includes extinction, so $m = 15.5$ is used directly.  
   - $m = 15.5$ satisfies $m < 16$ for HIRES and $m < 17$ for ESPRESSO.  
   - **Detectable by both instruments.**

4. **Star4**  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M_V = 15.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
   - Color excess: $E(B-V) = 0.4$  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m_0 = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude (including extinction):  
     \[
     m = m_0 + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - $m = 16.74$ exceeds the HIRES limit ($m < 16$), but is within the ESPRESSO limit ($m < 17$).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

5. **Star5**  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M_V = 16.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 \cdot (-0.301) = 15.0
     \]  
   - $m = 15.0$ satisfies $m < 16$ for HIRES and $m < 17$ for ESPRESSO.  
   - **Detectable by both instruments.**

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**.
