Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question gives me a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

I need to figure out where this matrix is located geometrically in the space of qubits. The options are points in 3D space, so r is a vector with three components, like (x,y,z).

Wait, what's the geometrical representation of a density matrix? I think for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the density matrix is a more general concept. Pure states are vectors on the sphere, while mixed states are statistical mixtures and can be represented as points inside the Bloch sphere.

The given density matrix looks like an equal mixture of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Let me write it out as a matrix to get a better idea. The |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 at (2,2). So adding these and multiplying by 1/2 gives:

ρ = (1/2) [ [1, 0], [0, 1] ] = [ [0.5, 0], [0, 0.5] ]

Wait, no wait, that can't be right. Because |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So when you add them, you get [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiply by 1/2: ρ = 0.5 * [[1,0],[0,1]] which is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. 

Alternatively, sometimes people write the density matrix for a mixed state as a convex combination. So this ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So it's a completely mixed state for a qubit. Because each state is equally probable, the density matrix should represent the maximally mixed state.

Now, the maximally mixed state for a qubit is represented by the completely depolarized state. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and the maximally mixed state is at the center.

Wait, the Bloch vector of a density matrix ρ is given by the expectation values. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector r is [x, y, z], where x = Tr(ρ X), y = Tr(ρ Y), z = Tr(ρ Z), with X, Y, Z being the Pauli matrices.

Let me compute each component.

First, X is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So Tr(ρ X) = (0.5)(1)(1) + (0.5)(1)(1) wait, no. Let me compute each term.

Wait, ρ is diagonal, so when multiplied by X, which swaps the basis vectors, the trace would be the sum of the diagonal elements after multiplication. Let's calculate each term.

ρ X: ρ is diagonal with 0.5 and 0.5 on the diagonal. Multiply X (which has 0 and 1 in the first row, 1 and 0 in the second) by ρ, then take the trace.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute Tr(ρ A) where A is a Pauli matrix.

Alternatively, since ρ is diagonal, perhaps the off-diagonal terms (like X, Y) will have zero expectation. Let's see.

For X: Tr(ρ X) = 0.5*Tr(|0><0| X) + 0.5*Tr(|1><1| X).

Wait, |0><0| X is X |0><0|. But X|0> is |1>, so |0><0| X is |0><1|. The trace of this matrix is zero because the only non-zero element is in (1,1) position, but the trace is sum of diagonals, which are both zero.

Similarly, |1><1| X is |1><0|. Tr of this is zero. So Tr(ρ X) = 0.5*(0) + 0.5*(0) = 0.

Same with Y. Tr(ρ Y) would be zero for the same reason. Because Y has imaginary components, but when you take the trace, any imaginary parts would cancel out, but in this case, the trace is zero.

What about Z? Tr(ρ Z) = 0.5 Tr(|0><0| Z) + 0.5 Tr(|1><1| Z).

Z|0> is |0>, so Tr(|0><0| Z) = 1. Similarly, Z|1> is -|1>, so Tr(|1><1| Z) = -1. So Tr(ρ Z) = 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(-1) = 0.5 -0.5 =0.

So all components x, y, z are zero. That means the Bloch vector is at the origin (0,0,0), which is the center of the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because the maximally mixed state has no preference in any direction, hence it's at the center.

Looking back at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → Bloch vector in x-y plane, but that's not the center.

B) (0,0,1) → Along z-axis, like a pure state aligned with Z.

C) (0,0,0) → Center.

D) (1,1,1) → Diagonal in all axes, but that's outside the Bloch sphere (since the Bloch vector has length sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(3) which is larger than 1).

So the correct answer should be option C, r=(0,0,0).

The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), corresponding to a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are located on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are represented as points inside the sphere. The maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the origin \((0,0,0)\).

To confirm this, the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) is determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\):

\[
x = \text{Tr}(\rho X), \quad y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y), \quad z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z),
\]

where \(X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), \(Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and \(Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\). 

- For \(x = \text{Tr}(\rho X)\), the trace of \(\rho X\) is zero because \(\rho\) is diagonal, and \(X\) swaps the basis states, resulting in no contribution to the diagonal elements.
- Similarly, \(y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y)\) is zero for the same reason.
- For \(z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z)\), the trace of \(\rho Z\) is zero because the contributions from \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) cancel out.

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0,0,0)\), corresponding to the center of the Bloch sphere. This matches option C.

**Analysis of options:**
- **A) \((1,1,0)\):** This corresponds to a point in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane, not the center.
- **B) \((0,0,1)\):** This corresponds to a point along the \(z\)-axis, like a pure state aligned with \(Z\), not the center.
- **C) \((0,0,0)\):** This is the center of the Bloch sphere, correct for the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \((1,1,1)\):** This corresponds to a point outside the Bloch sphere, as its magnitude exceeds 1.

The correct answer is **C**, \(r = (0,0,0)\).
