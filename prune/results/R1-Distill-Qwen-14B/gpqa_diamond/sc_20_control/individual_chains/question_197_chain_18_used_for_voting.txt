Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different products, and I have the IR and NMR data to go by. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI acid catalyzed reaction, which is usually for eliminating or some kind of substitution. Wait, actually, I think they're used in the hydroxymercuration or maybe in the formation of alkenes from alcohols, but more likely, in the case of an elimination reaction, like the formation of alkenes from alcohols via E2 mechanism. Oh wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is more associated with the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. Because in that reaction, ketones (RCOR') are converted to alkanes (RCH2R') using Zn(Hg)/HCl and HgSO4. Wait, but wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, right? Oh, right, red phosphorus and HI is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction for removing carbonyl groups, but wait, no, Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 (hydrazine) and strong base like KOH, then heat. So wait, maybe I'm confusing the reactions. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. Oh wait, there's another reaction where aldehydes or ketones are reduced to alkanes. I think that's the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but maybe red phosphorus and HI is a different condition? Or maybe it's another reaction. Alternatively, another thought: when you have a carbonyl group, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by something else. Wait, but in this case, the IR and NMR data would give clues about the starting material.

Let me look at the IR data first. The IR shows strong absorption between 3400–2500 cm^-1, which is a broad peak, probably O-H stretching. Then 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So putting this together: the compound has an aromatic ring (since there are aromatic peaks), a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe ester or acid), and an O-H group. Wait, but wait, the IR between 3400-2500 could also be from an alcohol or maybe an acid. But the 1720 is a strong peak, which is more indicative of a ketone or aldehyde. Because carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 (broad) and carbonyl around 1700, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak would be around 1700 but maybe a bit lower. Wait, but the IR data here has 1720, which is higher than a typical carboxylic acid carbonyl. So that suggests maybe a ketone or an aldehyde. But wait, an aldehyde has a strong peak around 2800-2700 as well (the aldehyde C-H stretch), but in the given IR, the 3400–2500 is a broad region, so perhaps it's an O-H stretch, like from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: the strong peak at 1720 could be an ester (around 1730-1740) or a ketone (around 1700-1750). If it's a ketone, then the O-H could be an alcohol, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid. Let me think about the NMR to get more clues.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. There's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That high chemical shift often corresponds to an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but if it were an aldehyde, the peak would be around 9-10 ppm, but it's broad. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12 ppm, also broad. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but the IR carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid, which is usually around 1700 or lower. Hmm, but maybe it's a conjugated acid or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Wait, no, esters have higher carbonyl frequencies, like 1730-1750. So a 1720 is a bit lower than that. So perhaps a ketone is more likely, but then the O-H at 3400-2500 might be from an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, which would have conjugation, lowering the carbonyl frequency a bit.

Wait, but let's look at the NMR. There's a triplet at 0.9 ppm, integrating to 3H. That's likely a CH2CH3 group, a methyl group attached to a CH2. Then a quartet would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH3. Wait, but in this case, it's a triplet at 0.9, so maybe it's a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3. Then looking at 1.7 ppm, it's a multiplet integrating to 2H, perhaps a CH2 adjacent to a branching point. At 1.4 ppm, it's a triplet (d, 3H), which is a CH3 attached to a CH, maybe a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, trying to piece together the structure. So the aromatic region is from 7.2 to 8.0 ppm. The NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe an ortho, meta, or para substitution on the aromatic ring. Let's say it's a para-substituted aromatic ring because the doublets would indicate coupling between two protons each. So for example, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split into doublets. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is in the para position, and another is in the meta.

Wait, but looking at the aromatic region, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). For a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are in the para positions, so each substituent has two ortho, two meta, and one para proton. Wait no, in NMR, a para-substituted benzene would show each set of two protons as doublets. Because each proton has one neighboring proton. For example, if you have substituents in the para positions, each set of protons would be a doublet. Wait, actually, for a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets. Hmm, not sure about that. Let me think: In a para-disubstituted benzene, the substituents are opposite each other, so each set of H's adjacent to substituents would be in a doublet. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, and each coupling with the other set. So if the substituents are in the para positions, each H would have one adjacent H on the same ring. Wait, perhaps more accurately, in para-xylene, the protons are all equivalent, but that's because the substituents are in the para positions. Wait, but in this case, the substituents may not be identical. So perhaps the substituents are different. That would lead to two different sets of H's, each as doublets.

So perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions, each of which is a substituent that affects the chemical shift. One substituent is more de-shielding than the other, causing the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

Now, looking at the rest of the NMR. There's a 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H), which is a methylene group adjacent to something. Then a 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), perhaps another CH2 group. At 1.4 ppm, a triplet (3H), so maybe a CH3 attached to a CH. Hmm, like a CH(CH3) group.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, one being a carbonyl group (since we have a peak at 1720 cm^-1) and another being an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, but wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. If the starting compound X has a carbonyl group, then when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? I think red phosphorus and HI might be for the reduction of a carbonyl group. Wait, but red phosphorus and HI is used in the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alkanes via the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction? No, that's for elimination. Or perhaps it's the reaction where carbonyl groups are reduced to methylene groups, but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, let me think about the products. One of the options is a benzoic acid derivative, another is an isobutyl benzene, etc.

Wait, if the starting material is a benzophenone derivative with an isobutyl group and a ketone, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to an alkane. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde, then reducing it would give a benzyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzophenone with an isobutyl substituent. Let's think: benzene ring with a ketone group and an isobutyl group in para positions.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a benzoic acid with an ethyl group in the para position and a propanoic acid substituent.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Wait, the initial compound X has a carbonyl group. Suppose X is a ketone. Then, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong reducing agent for ketones, it would reduce the ketone to a methylene group, but wait, no. Wait, the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HgSO4 to reduce ketones to alkanes. Red phosphorus and HI is used in another reaction. Wait, another thought: I think that red phosphorus and HI can be used to remove a carbonyl group, perhaps via a substitution. Wait, no, perhaps the reaction is the Oppenauer oxidation? No, Oppenauer is for ketones to alkenes.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the starting material structure based on the spectroscopic data.

The 1H NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), perhaps a CH2 next to a branching point. At 1.4 ppm, a triplet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group, so maybe a CH(CH3) group. So the structure might have a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, it's a CH2CH(CH3) group. Hmm.

Let me sketch it out:

Benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (from the IR data). The other substituent is an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 1.4 ppm (3H, d), which is a CH3 attached to a CH, and a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), which is a CH group. Then 1.7 ppm (2H) as another CH2. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, let me think: The substituent on the benzene is a propyl chain with a branching. For example, it could be -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, but that's not correct. Alternatively, it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, like a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be something like benzene with a ketone and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

So, the substituents are a carbonyl group (e.g., a ketone) and a sec-butyl group.

Then, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Well, if the starting material is a ketone, then the reaction might reduce the ketone to a methylene group. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with a sec-butyl group. Then, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde would be reduced to a methylene group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would mean the starting material had a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group, but how would the reaction affect it? Alternatively, if the starting material had a ketone group, and the reaction reduces it to CH2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of a ketone to a methylene group. So for example, a ketone R-CO-R' would be reduced to R-CH2-R'. So, if the starting material has a benzophenone (Ph-CO-Ph), it would become Ph-CH2-Ph. But in our case, it's a substituted benzene. So if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, the reduction would give 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions. Alternatively, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which would have an isobutyl and a methyl group in para.

Wait, but if the starting material is a ketone, say 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone (so benzene ring with a ketone and a sec-butyl group), the reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)ethylbenzene. Wait, but that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but an elimination. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are usually not for elimination. Wait, unless it's a substitution. Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if the starting material is a benzyl bromide or something, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, going back to the initial data. The 1H NMR has a triplet at 0.9 (3H), a quartet would be expected for a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, the 0.9 triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So perhaps there's a (CH2)2CH3 group attached somewhere.

So putting it all together, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a substituent like a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something else.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be a ketone. Then, after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the ketone would be reduced to a CH2 group. So if the starting material is 4-(something)acetophenone, the product would be 4-(something)ethy benzene.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would be a substituent in the para position. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Wait, in the NMR, the triplet at 0.9 suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could be a CH adjacent to another CH2. Then, 1.7 is a multiplet (2H), perhaps a CH2.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. No, that might not fit. Alternatively, a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that's not matching the options. Alternatively, the substituent is a secondary butyl group. So, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should try to look at each option and see what the product would look like.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid would have a sec-butyl group in the para position. But the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, would that reaction affect the benzoic acid? I don't think so. Because in the starting material, compound X, maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative, but reacting with red phosphorus and HI might not change it. Alternatively, if X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, then the reaction would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzophenone with a sec-butyl group. Let me think: structure would be Ph-CO-Ph with a sec-butyl substituent on one of the phenyl rings. When reduced, the ketone becomes Ph-CH2-Ph. But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, the reduction would give a benzyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. For example, 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. Then, upon reduction with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group would be reduced to a CH2 group, giving 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group, which would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. Wait, but toluene is methyl benzene, so perhaps the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the benzene ring has a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4? Wait, no, position 4 would be para to position 1. So, if the benzene has a substituent at position 1 (let's say the sec-butyl group) and another substituent at position 4 (which is the same as position para to position 1), that's actually the same as having substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but the starting material would have a benzaldehyde group and a substituent in the para position. So, when you reduce the aldehyde to CH2, you get a methyl group in that position.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

Alternatively, looking back at the NMR data: the 10.5 ppm peak could be the aldehyde proton. But wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is more for a ketone. Hmm, but if it's an aldehyde, the carbonyl peak would be around 1720, which matches. The aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm, which is what we have in the NMR (10.5 ppm, broad). So that fits.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group, making it 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

Wait, but option D is described as 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, which are para to each other. So that's correct.

So the answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction where Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR and NMR data provided help determine the structure of Compound X, which is then analyzed for how it reacts under these conditions.

### Analysis of IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: A broad peak, likely from an O-H stretch, suggesting the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong peak, indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from a ketone or aldehyde.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Peaks consistent with aromatic C=C stretching, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.

### Analysis of NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad signal, likely from an aldehyde proton (RCHO) or a carboxylic acid proton (RCOOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group adjacent to other protons.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a CH₃ group at the end of a chain (e.g., CH₂CH₂CH₃).

### Structure of Compound X:
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde**. This structure contains:
- A para-substituted benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and an aldehyde group.
- The aldehyde group explains the 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR and the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak in the IR.
- The sec-butyl group accounts for the signals at 1.7 ppm (CH₂), 1.4 ppm (CH(CH₃)), and 0.9 ppm (CH₃).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents that reduce aldehydes to alkanes. In this case, the aldehyde group (-CHO) in **4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The resulting product is **4-(sec-butyl)toluene**, where the benzene ring has a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

### Matching with the Options:
- **Option A**: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid — Incorrect, as the product does not involve a carboxylic acid group.
- **Option B**: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene — Incorrect, as the substituent is a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.
- **Option C**: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid — Incorrect, as the reaction does not produce a carboxylic acid.
- **Option D**: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene — Correct, as this matches the product formed after the reduction of the aldehyde group to a methyl group.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.
