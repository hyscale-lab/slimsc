Okay, so I'm faced with this metric question in general relativity or differential geometry, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because I see dx² and dy² terms. Oh, but wait, in the context of pseudospheres, I think they are talking about a 2-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space, or perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space. Hmm.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Oh, but wait, maybe I should think about whether this metric represents a pseudosphere or something else. The term "pseudosphere" is often used in the context of hyperbolic geometry, where the Gaussian curvature is negative. So this might be a metric in hyperbolic space.

Let me recall. The metric given is written in terms of x and y, but it's scaled by a factor that depends on x² + y². The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), multiplied by 32. So, the line element is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), if I switch to polar coordinates, where r² = x² + y². Oh, because in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So, the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

That looks like a metric in two dimensions with a specific radial scaling. Wait, the general form of a metric in 2D polar coordinates is ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ², where A and B are functions of r.

In this case, A(r) = 32/(4 - r²), and B(r) is the same as A(r) because both terms have that factor. So, the metric is conformally flat, meaning it's a conformal transformation of the flat metric. So, the geometry is determined by the function multiplying the flat metric.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K for a two-dimensional metric in polar coordinates can be found using the formula derived from the metric. I remember that the formula for Gaussian curvature in terms of the conformal factor is K = - (1/(2A)) [ (dA/dr) * (1/r) + ... ] Wait, perhaps I should recall the general formula for Gaussian curvature when the metric is conformally related to the Euclidean metric.

Alternatively, the Gaussian curvature K can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2A)) * (d/d r (A / r)) )

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about the metric in terms of isometric embedding. The pseudosphere has constant negative curvature, so perhaps the metric here represents that.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, like a tractricoid. But I'm a bit confused about whether this metric is for a pseudosphere or another surface.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric and see if it's constant and negative. If it is, then the surface has constant negative curvature, which would make it a pseudosphere (in the sense of hyperbolic geometry, perhaps).

So let's compute the Gaussian curvature K. For a metric ds² = a(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = - (1/(2 r a²)) d/dr (a² r) )

Wait, I think that's correct. Let me write down the formula again.

Given the metric ds² = a(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is:

K = - (1/(2 r a²)) * d/dr (a² r) )

So, in our case, a(r)^2 is 32/(4 - r²), so a(r) is sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

So a² = 32/(4 - r²). Then, a² r is 32 r / (4 - r²).

The derivative of a² r with respect to r is:

d/dr [ (32 r) / (4 - r²) ) ]

Let's compute that. Let me let f(r) = 32 r. g(r) = 4 - r².

Then, d/dr (f/g) ) = (f' g - f g') / g².

f' = 32, g' = -2r.

So,

(32*(4 - r²) - 32 r*(-2 r)) / (4 - r²)^2

Simplify numerator:

32 (4 - r²) + 64 r²

= 128 - 32 r² + 64 r²

= 128 + 32 r²

So, putting it together:

(128 +32 r²)/(4 - r²)^2

So, the derivative is (32 (4 + r²)) / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, so the derivative of a² r is (128 +32 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, the numerator is 32*(4 - r²) - (32 r)(-2r) = 32(4 - r²) + 64 r² = 128 -32 r² +64 r² = 128 +32 r²= 32(4 + r²).

So, the derivative is [32(4 + r²)] / (4 - r²)^2.

Then, Gaussian curvature K is:

K = - (1/(2 r a²)) * [d/dr (a² r) ]

We have a² =32/(4 -r²). So 1/(2 r a²) is (4 - r²)/(2 r *32).

So,

K = - [ (4 - r²)/(2 r *32) ) ] * [32 (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Let's simplify this:

The 32 in numerator and denominator cancel.

(4 - r²)/(2 r) ) * [ (4 + r²) ) / (4 - r²)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

(4 + r²) / [ 2 r (4 - r²) ) ]

So,

K = - (4 + r²) / [ 2 r (4 - r²) ) ]

Hmm, but for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature should be a negative constant, right? Because pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. But this expression for K depends on r, which suggests that the curvature isn't constant. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for Gaussian curvature in the conformal metric.

Wait, another approach: the formula for Gaussian curvature when the metric is conformally flat is:

K = - (1/(2 a²)) [ (d a / dr ) (1/r) + (a/r²) ]

Wait, no, maybe I should use the standard formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates.

Another formula I remember is that for a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ², the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = [ (B' - (A' B) / A ) / (2 B r ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should use the standard formula for Gaussian curvature in 2D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try a different approach. Let me write down the formula for Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric components.

In general, for a 2D metric with components:

g_rr = A(r), g_θθ = B(r), and cross terms zero.

The Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2 sqrt(g))) [ ( ∂_r (g^{rr} ∂_r g_{θθ}) ) - ... ]

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as:

K = [ ( (B') / (2 r) ) - ( (B) (A') )/( 2 A r ) ) ] / ( B )

Wait, not sure. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula from the book or notes. Another approach: For a metric ds² = a(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is:

K = - (1/(2 r a²)) d/dr (a² r )

Which is what I used earlier. So let's go back.

So, substituting a² =32/(4 - r²), then a² r = (32 r)/(4 - r²).

The derivative of a² r is 32*(4 + r²)/(4 -r²)^2, as before.

So,

K = - [ (4 + r²) ] / [ 2 r (4 - r²) ) ]

Wait, but this is a function of r, not a constant. That means the curvature isn't constant, which would imply it's not a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature. So this must mean that either my calculation is wrong, or the metric isn't for a pseudosphere.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the metric. Or perhaps the metric is in a different coordinate system or includes an overall scaling.

Wait, the question gives the metric as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in these coordinates, x and y are likely in a Euclidean plane, but the denominator (4 - x² - y²) suggests a spherical-like coordinate system, but perhaps in a hyperbolic context.

Alternatively, maybe this is a metric for a hyperbolic space embedded in some way. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but perhaps the metric here is for a 2D hyperbolic plane, which is a different concept.

Wait, the 2D hyperbolic plane has a metric similar to this. The standard hyperbolic metric can be written in various forms, such as the Poincaré disk model. Let me think about that. The Poincaré disk model has metric:

ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk.

In our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), which would be 4(1 - (r²/4)), but our metric is (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), which is (32)/(4 - r²) times (dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2). So that's (32)/(4(1 - (r²/4))) ) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)) ), but the standard Poincaré disk has 4/(1 - r²)^2. So perhaps this is a different scaling.

Wait, but why is this metric given? The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, perhaps the metric is for a sphere of radius 2 in some sense.

Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, while a sphere has positive curvature. So perhaps the question is a bit of a trick, as the given metric may not actually represent a pseudosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of a sphere of radius 2 in this metric, not a pseudosphere. Wait, but the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2".

Wait, perhaps the metric given is that of a sphere. Let me think. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in polar coordinates is:

ds² = a² (dr² + r² dθ²)/(a² - r²)

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the standard spherical metric is ds² = a² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²). So perhaps not directly applicable.

Wait, but the given metric is conformally flat. The area element is A = sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ. In our case, g_rr =32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ= 32 r²/(4 - r²). So the area element is:

A = sqrt( (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) dr dθ

= sqrt( (32 *32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) dr dθ

= (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ

So the area would be the integral of A over the region where 4 - r² >0, since the denominator must be positive. So r² <4, so r <2. So the domain of r is from 0 to 2.

Thus, the total area is the integral from r=0 to r=2 of (32 r)/(4 -r²) dr, multiplied by the integral over θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area is [ integral_0^{2} (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr ] * [ integral_0^{2π} dθ ]

Let me compute the radial integral first.

Let me make a substitution. Let u =4 - r². Then, du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ r dr ]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (u=4 to 0) [ (-du/2) ) / u ]

Which is 32 * (1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 ( - du / u )

= 16 [ ∫ from 4 to 0 (- du / u) ]

=16 [ ∫ from 0 to 4 du/u ]

Because the limits invert, and the negative sign flips them.

Wait, let's see:

∫(u=4 to 0) (-du/2u) = (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 du/u = (-1/2) [ ln u from 4 to 0 ].

Wait, but integrating from 4 to 0 would be negative of integrating from 0 to 4.

So:

= (-1/2) [ ln 0 - ln 4 ].

But ln 0 is negative infinity. So this integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, but that's a problem. The area would be infinite?

Wait, but that can't be right. If the metric is defined for r<2, maybe the area is finite. Let me recheck the substitution.

Wait, the integral is:

∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) from r=0 to r=2.

Let me do substitution again.

Let u =4 - r² → du= -2 r dr → r dr= - du/2.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [ (r dr) / u ] =32 ∫ [ (- du/2) / u ]

Which is -16 ∫ (du/u )

The limits: when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So, the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (du/u) =-16 [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

= -16 ( ln 0 - ln4 )

But ln 0 is -infty, so ln0 - ln4 = -infty - ln4 → -infty.

Multiply by -16: -16*(-infty - ln4 )= +infty.

So the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

Wait, but that suggests that the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 is infinite. So looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. But if the metric's area is infinite, perhaps that's the case. But wait, a pseudosphere is a finite area surface, isn't it? Like, the tractricoid has finite area. Hmm, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric. Wait, the metric given is for a two-dimensional surface, and perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space, which has infinite area. So in that case, the area would be infinite, which would make option D the correct answer.

But wait, the pseudosphere is a finite surface. So why is the area infinite here?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a sphere of radius 2, but the area is 4π(2)^2=16π, but that's not one of the options. Wait, but the options don't have a finite number except A (0) and D (infinite).

Wait, but in the given options, option D is +infty, and option A is 0.

Wait, maybe the metric is not for a sphere, but for a hyperbolic plane, which indeed has infinite area.

Wait, so the problem is about the pseudosphere of radius 2. But perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, but let's think again: the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. Integrating this from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to 2π. The integral over r is divergent as we saw, leading to infinite area.

So, the area is infinite, which is option D.

But I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between a pseudosphere as a surface embedded in 3D (tractricoid) which has finite area, and a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So the metric given isn't for a pseudosphere but for a hyperbolic plane.

Wait, but the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2'. So maybe I should think in terms of a sphere in hyperbolic space.

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, a sphere of radius r would have an area that depends on the hyperbolic scale. But perhaps the area is still infinite, but that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is not for a pseudosphere, but for a sphere, and the area comes out to something else.

Wait, but the integral over r from 0 to 2 gives an infinite area, so the answer is D. So in that case, the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This is a two-dimensional metric written in terms of Cartesian coordinates \(x\) and \(y\). To analyze the geometry, it is useful to switch to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\). In polar coordinates, the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left( dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 \right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric, where the conformal factor is \(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\). The domain of \(r\) is restricted to \(r < 2\), as the denominator \(4 - r^2\) must remain positive.

The question asks for the area of the "pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\)." A pseudosphere is typically a surface with constant negative curvature, but the given metric does not represent a pseudosphere. Instead, it describes a two-dimensional surface with a curvature that depends on \(r\), as shown by computing the Gaussian curvature \(K\). The curvature is not constant, indicating that the surface is not a pseudosphere.

To compute the area, the area element in polar coordinates is:

\[
A = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating the area element over the domain \(r \in [0, 2)\) and \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)\):

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral over \(\theta\) gives \(2\pi\), so the radial integral becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
-16 \left[ \ln u \right]_4^0 = -16 \left( \ln 0 - \ln 4 \right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Therefore, the area of the surface described by the given metric is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
