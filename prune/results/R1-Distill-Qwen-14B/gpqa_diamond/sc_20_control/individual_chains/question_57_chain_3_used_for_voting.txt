Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude plays a crucial role. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, the given data is phase shifts at different angular momentum values. The phase shifts are δ0 = 90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. Oh, right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude can be expressed using these phase shifts.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum l. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδl} sin(lθ + δl) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact expression. Alternatively, another formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) [e^{iδl} sin(lθ + δl) ] ), but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδl} sin(lθ + δl) )/(1 + ... ). Oh wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, I think the general formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ) ) / (k * something )

Wait, no, another approach. The scattering amplitude in the case of partial waves is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1 ) [ e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1 ) [ e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

No, wait, perhaps it's:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ) )

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should think about the optical theorem or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the direction of the incident beam is specifically when θ = 0 degrees.

Oh right! Because θ=0 would mean the direction is the same as the incident beam. So the question is asking for the imaginary part of f(0).

Hmm, okay, so let's compute f(0) and take its imaginary part.

Wait, but what's f(θ) at θ=0? Let's consider the general formula.

Wait, perhaps the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ) / (2ik)

But when θ=0, sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l). So each term becomes (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) / (2ik)

So f(0) would be sum_{l} [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) ] / (2ik )

But what is k? Oh, right, k is the wave number. For electrons, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But wait, since we have phase shifts provided, maybe the actual value of k isn't required? Or perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is being asked for along the beam direction, which is the forward direction.

Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to (4π/k²) times the imaginary part of f(0), so Im[f(0)] = (k²/(4π)) σ_total.

Wait, but the problem gives phase shifts, so perhaps the imaginary part can be computed directly from the phase shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0 is given by sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k), because when θ=0, the sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l), and then we have e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when multiplying by sin(lθ + δ_l) which is sin δ_l, the product becomes [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l] * sin δ_l = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of each term would be (2l +1) sin² δ_l / (2ik) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the partial wave expansion. Since in the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) * e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

So when θ=0, f(0) becomes sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) * e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

The imaginary part of f(0) would then be the sum over l of ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) * Im( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Now, compute Im( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ). Let's write e^{i δ_l} as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. Then multiply by sin δ_l:

( cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) * sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part is sin² δ_l.

So Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^n [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) * sin² δ_l ] 

But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. So l goes from 0 to 4.

So we have l=0,1,2,3,4.

So compute each term (2l+1) sin² δ_l, sum them, and then divide by 2k.

But wait, what's k? The wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Hmm, the energy E is 50 MeV. But wait, electrons are light, so relativistic effects might be significant. But the problem doesn't specify, but I think in this context, we can proceed with the non-relativistic formula for k.

Wait, wait, the energy E here is the kinetic energy. So non-relativistic, E = (p^2)/(2m) => p = sqrt(2mE). So k = p/ħ.

But we need to calculate k in appropriate units.

Let me think about the units. The phase shifts are given, but the question is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in fm. So the imaginary part has units of length.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude has f in units of length. So let's compute each term.

But first, compute each (2l+1) sin² δ_l. Then sum them, multiply by (1/(2k)), and that gives Im(f(0)).

Wait, but what's k in terms of the given energy?

E is given as 50 MeV. Let's compute k.

First, E = 50 MeV.

We can use the relation E = (ħ² k² )/(2m_e c² )

Wait, wait, because for electrons, when using E in MeV, perhaps it's better to express in natural units where c=1 and ħ is expressed in eV·s or similar.

Wait, but perhaps we can compute k in atomic units. Alternatively, using the conversion factors.

Let me recall that for an electron:

ħ = 197.33 MeV fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, but wait, ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm / (3e8 m/s) → but perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k in units where ħ and c are set to 1.

Wait, but let's think in terms of MeV and fm. Let's find k in units of 1/fm.

We have E = (ħ² k² )/(2m_e) 

So rearranged, k = sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ 

But I need to plug in the numbers.

m_e is the electron mass, approximately 0.511 MeV/c².

So m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

But in this case, E is given as 50 MeV of kinetic energy. Wait, but in non-relativistic terms, E = (p²)/(2m_e) → p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

Wait, but the relation between k and p is p = ħ k → k = p/ħ.

So let's compute p:

p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

But E is 50 MeV, and m_e is 0.511 MeV/c². So E in terms of m_e:

E = 50 MeV = (50 / 0.511) m_e c^2 ≈ 97.836 m_e c^2.

But wait, in non-relativistic approximation, E ≈ (p²)/(2m_e) → p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

So:

p = sqrt( 2 * m_e * E ) 

But m_e is 0.511 MeV/c², E is 50 MeV.

So 2 * m_e * E = 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV = 51.1 MeV² / c².

Wait, but then p² = 51.1 MeV² / c² → p = sqrt(51.1) MeV / c ≈ 7.15 MeV / c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c) [since ħ has units of J s, and c m/s → (ħ c) has units of J m, but perhaps I'm mixing units here.]

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ

But in units where ħ c is known, perhaps.

Alternatively, let's express everything in natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to compute k.

Wait, another approach. The Compton wavelength of the electron is λ = 2πħ/(m_e c²) ≈ 2.426 × 10^-12 m, which is about 2.426 fm (since 1 fm is 1e-15 m).

But perhaps I should just compute k in terms of fm⁻¹.

We have:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ

Expressed in units where E is in MeV, m_e is 0.511 MeV/c², and ħ is in MeV fm.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator.

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c²

E =50 MeV.

So 2 m_e E = 2 * 0.511 * 50 = 51.1 MeV² / c².

Wait, but what are the units? Let's see.

We have: k = sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ

But m_e E is (MeV/c²) * MeV = MeV² / c². Taking sqrt gives MeV / (c).

But ħ has units of MeV fm (since ħ c ≈ 197 MeV fm, so ħ is about 197 MeV fm / c).

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe let me plug in the numbers.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 m_e E )

2 m_e E = 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV = 51.1 MeV² / c².

Take square root: sqrt(51.1) MeV / c ≈ 7.15 MeV / c.

Denominator: ħ is 197.33 MeV fm / c.

So k = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = (7.15 / 197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that gives k ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

But wait, 1/(fm) is a large number, but let me compute 7.15 divided by 197.33.

7.15 / 197.33 ≈ 0.0362.

So k ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the units here. Let me double-check.

Actually, ħ has units of J s. But in terms of MeV and fm, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

But perhaps it's easier to just use the expression for k:

k = sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ 

But given that E is in MeV, m_e is 0.511 MeV/c². So:

k = sqrt( (2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV ) ) / ħ 

= sqrt(51.1 MeV²/c² ) / ħ 

= (sqrt(51.1) MeV/c ) / ħ 

But ħ is in units of MeV s/(fm c), perhaps? Because ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So plugging in:

k = (7.15 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) 

= 7.15 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but that seems small. Let me think again. Because 50 MeV is a high energy for an electron, so the wavelength should be small, which would mean k is large. So 0.0362 fm⁻¹ is 36.2 fm⁻¹, because 0.0362 * 1e2 is 3.62, but wait no, 0.0362 is 3.62e-2, so 36.2 fm⁻¹ would be 0.0362 reciprocal fm, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. 0.0362 fm⁻¹ is 36.2 per femtometer, which is a large number, implying a small wavelength. Wait, that makes sense because high energy implies small wavelength.

Wait, but wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So the wavelength λ = 2π/k. If k is 0.0362 fm⁻¹, then λ = 2π / 0.0362 fm⁻¹ ≈ 171 fm. That's a huge wavelength for 50 MeV electrons. That can't be right. Because 50 MeV electrons are high energy and should have much shorter wavelengths.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let's try again.

The correct formula for the wave number k is k = p/ħ.

And p = sqrt(2 m_e E ), where E is the kinetic energy in joules. But since E is given in MeV, perhaps I should convert it to joules.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation:

k (fm⁻¹) = (2 m_e E )^½ / ħ 

With E in MeV, and m_e in MeV/c².

Wait, another approach: using the relation where E (in MeV) is related to the wavelength.

The Compton wavelength λ_c = ħ/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426 × 10^-12 m = 2.426 fm.

So for an electron, E ≈ (ħ c)^2/(2 m_e c^2 λ^2) → but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using relativistic energy would give a better result. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's non-relativistic.

Wait, but even in non-relativistic case, E = p²/(2m_e), so p = sqrt(2 m_e E ).

So p = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV ) → in units where c is considered.

But to get p in units of MeV/c, since E is MeV.

So p = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 * 50 ) MeV/c → sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k = p / ħ c → since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = (7.15 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 7.15 / 197.33 = 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, same result as before. So, k ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but that gives a very large wavelength, which doesn't make sense for 50 MeV electrons. So perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps E is 50 MeV, so including relativistic factors, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the Debye wavelength or something else, but no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the wave number in terms of energy is:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But when E is in eV, m_e is in eV s²/m², ħ is in J s.

Wait, maybe I should compute everything in SI units.

E = 50 MeV = 50 * 1e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

So, k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J )

Compute 2 * m_e * E = 2 * 9.109e-31 * 8.01e-13 ≈ 1.458e-43 kg J.

Wait, 1 J = 1 kg m²/s², so kg * J = kg² m²/s².

So sqrt(1.458e-43 kg² m²/s² ) → sqrt(1.458e-43) kg m/s ≈ 3.82e-21.9 kg m/s.

Wait, 3.82e-21.9 is about 3.82e-22 kg m/s.

Denominator: ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = (3.82e-22 kg m/s ) / (1.0545718e-34 J s )

But J = kg m²/s², so J s = kg m²/s.

So units: (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) → 1/(m), which is correct for k.

Compute the value: 3.82e-22 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 3.62e12 m⁻¹.

Wait, 3.62e12 m⁻¹ is 3.62e12 per meter, which is 3.62e3 per nanometer, or 3.62e6 per micrometer. But wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, so 1 m is 1e15 fm. So 3.62e12 m⁻¹ = 3.62e12 * 1e15 fm⁻¹ = 3.62e27 fm⁻¹. Which is a gigantic number; that can't be right.

Wait, that can't be correct. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, sqrt(2 m_e E ) → 2 m_e E = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J.

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so 8.01e-13 J = 8.01e-13 kg m²/s².

So 2 m_e E = 2 *9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 kg m²/s² = 2 * 9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 kg² m²/s² = 1.458e-43 kg² m²/s².

Taking the square root: sqrt(1.458e-43 kg² m²/s² ) = 3.82e-21.9 kg m/s.

Wait, but 3.82e-21.9 is approx 3.82e-22 kg m/s.

So k = 3.82e-22 kg m/s / 1.05457e-34 J s.

Wait, J s is kg m²/s. So denominator: 1.05457e-34 kg m²/s.

So, 3.82e-22 kg m/s divided by 1.05457e-34 kg m²/s → (3.82e-22) / (1.05457e-34 ) * (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) → (3.82e-22 /1.05457e-34 ) * (1/(m)).

So 3.82e-22 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 3.62e12 m⁻¹.

Wait, same as before. So k ≈ 3.62e12 m⁻¹, which is 3.62e12 per meter → which is 3.62e3 per nanometer. That can't be right, because 50 MeV electrons should have a much smaller wavelength.

Wait, something's wrong. Oh, wait, because E is 50 MeV, which is a lot, so maybe this is correct because electrons with high energy have small wavelengths.

Wait, the Compton wavelength is about 2.4 fm, but if E is 50 MeV, which is about 100 times the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are significant. So perhaps I should use relativistic expressions.

Wait, the relativistic energy is E = gamma m c². So for E =50 MeV, gamma is E/(m c²) =50/(0.511) ≈97.836. So gamma is about 98.

In that case, the momentum p is gamma m v, where v is the velocity. Alternatively, using the relation E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) → p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / c.

So plug in E =50 MeV, m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) MeV ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV.

So p = 49.997 MeV / c.

Then, k = p / ħ c → because p = ħ k.

So k = (49.997 MeV/c ) / ( ħ c )

But ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So k = 49.997 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Ah, that makes more sense! So k≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but how did I get this? Because earlier, I thought E is 50 MeV, which is much bigger than m c², so the non-relativistic approach wasn't correct. So using the relativistic approach gives a more accurate k.

So the correct k is about 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

So now, going back to Im(f(0)).

Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^4 [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, no, wait: earlier steps.

Wait, when θ=0, each term in f(0) is (2l +1)/(2ik) * e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

The imaginary part is sum [ (2l +1)/(2k) * sin² δ_l ]

So Im(f(0)) = [ sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

So sum each (2l +1) sin² δ_l:

l=0: 2(0)+1=1; δ0=90°, sin(90)=1 → 1 *1 =1

l=1: 3; δ1=67°, sin(67)≈0.9205 → 3*(0.9205)^2 ≈3*(0.8473)=2.5419

l=2:5; δ2=55°, sin(55)≈0.8192 →5*(0.8192)^2≈5*(0.6710)=3.355

l=3:7; δ3=30°, sin(30)=0.5 →7*(0.5)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75

l=4:9; δ4=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495 →9*(0.22495)^2≈9*(0.0506)=0.4554

Now sum all these:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419

3.5419 +3.355 = 6.8969

6.8969 +1.75 =8.6469

8.6469 +0.4554≈9.1023.

So the sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now, divide by 2k → 2 *0.2536 fm⁻¹ =0.5072 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))=9.1023 / 0.5072 ≈17.94 fm⁻¹? Wait, no, that can't be right because the answer options are in the hundreds of fm.

Wait, wait no. Wait, because Im(f(0)) is in units of 1/k, which is in fm.

Wait, no. Because 1/k is in fm. So:

Im(f(0))= sum/(2k) → sum is dimensionless, 2k is in fm⁻¹, so sum/(fm⁻¹) is fm.

Wait, wait: sum is dimensionless, 2k is in fm⁻¹, so sum/(2k) is sum * (fm).

So Im(f(0)) = [ sum ] / (2k ) → [9.1023 ] / (2 *0.2536 fm⁻¹ ) → 9.1023 / 0.5072 ≈17.94 fm.

But looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in the sum?

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated the sum.

Let me recalculate each term.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1; sin(90)=1; 1*1=1 → 1.

l=1:3; sin(67)≈0.9205 → 0.9205^2=0.8473 → 3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5; sin(55)=0.8192 → 0.8192^2≈0.6710 →5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7; sin(30)=0.5 →0.5^2=0.25 →7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9; sin(13)≈0.22495 →0.22495^2≈0.0506 →9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

So sum is 1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355→6.8969; +1.75→8.6469; +0.4554→9.1023.

Yes, that's correct.

k was 0.2536 fm⁻¹, so 2k=0.5072 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))=9.1023 / 0.5072 ≈17.94 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds of fm, except option C is 177.675 fm which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the formula? Oh, perhaps I confused the formula for Im(f(0)).

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] / (2k )

Wait, wait, earlier I thought the imaginary part of e^{i δ} sin(δ) is sin^2 δ. But wait, perhaps I should recalculate.

Given that e^{i δ} sin(δ) = (cos δ + i sin δ) * sin δ = cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ.

So the imaginary part is sin² δ.

But, wait, another approach: the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l} ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula. Let me think about this.

In the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ) / (2ik )

Because the optical theorem uses the imaginary part of f(0), which is Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin(δ_l) / (2k )

Wait, no.

Wait, when θ=0, lθ=0, and the term becomes (2l+1)/(2ik) * e^{2i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

Because e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l ) → e^{2i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

So the term is (2l+1)/(2ik) * e^{2i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

The imaginary part of this term is the imaginary part of [ (2l+1)/(2ik) * e^{2i δ_l} sin(δ_l ) ]

Let me write e^{2i δ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l).

So the term becomes (2l+1)/(2ik) [ cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) ] sin(δ_l )

Multiply this out:

= (2l+1)/(2ik) [ cos(2δ_l) sin(δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l) ]

The imaginary part is the coefficient of i:

Imaginary part = (2l+1)/(2k) [ sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l) ]

So Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin(δ_l) ] / (2k )

Hmm, so that's different from what I calculated earlier. So I made a mistake earlier.

So now, I have to compute each term as (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin(δ_l ), sum them, and divide by 2k.

So let's compute each term.

Again, l=0 to 4.

l=0: 2(0)+1=1.

δ0=90° → sin(2δ0) = sin(180°)=0 → term=0.

l=1:3.

δ1=67° → 2δ1=134° → sin(134)≈0.6691; sin(67)=0.9205.

Term=3 * 0.6691 * 0.9205 ≈3 * 0.6691 * 0.9205.

Compute 0.6691 *0.9205 → approximately 0.6691 *0.9205 ≈0.6153.

Then 3 *0.6153≈1.8459.

l=2:5.

δ2=55° → 2δ2=110° → sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397; sin(55)=0.8192.

Term=5 * 0.9397 * 0.8192 ≈5 * 0.7694 →≈3.847.

Wait, let's compute 0.9397 *0.8192:

0.9397 *0.8192 ≈0.7694.

5 *0.7694≈3.847.

l=3:7.

δ3=30° → 2δ3=60° → sin60=√3/2≈0.8660; sin30=0.5.

Term=7 *0.8660 *0.5 →7 *0.4330≈3.031.

l=4:9.

δ4=13° →2δ4=26° → sin26≈0.4384; sin13≈0.22495.

Term=9 *0.4384 *0.22495 →approx 9 *0.0985 →≈0.8865.

Now sum all terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1:1.8459.

l=2:3.847 → total so far 5.6929.

l=3:3.031 → total 8.7239.

l=4:0.8865 → total 9.6104.

So sum ≈9.6104.

Now, divide by 2k → 2 *0.2536 fm⁻¹ =0.5072 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0)) =9.6104 / 0.5072 ≈18.96 fm.

Wait, but the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, but this is for the imaginary part of f(0). But wait, the options are in the hundreds of fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula again. Another possibility: the imaginary part of the amplitude is (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )/(2k) multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for Im(f(0)) is sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l) ] / (2k )

But perhaps the correct formula is sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k ), because when you take the imaginary part of e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l ), perhaps it's sin(2 δ_l ), not sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, let me re-examine the expression:

e^{i δ} sin δ = (cos δ + i sin δ) sin δ = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

So the imaginary part is sin² δ, not sin(2 δ) sin δ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the correct term is (2l +1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Earlier, when I summed (2l+1) sin² δ_l, I got about 9.1023.

Then, Im(f(0))=9.1023/(2k )=9.1023/(2 *0.2536 )=9.1023/(0.5072 )≈17.94 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, looking back, when I computed k using the relativistic approach, I got k≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

But let's recalculate that.

E=50 MeV. Using E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → p c = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) ≈49.997 MeV.

So p=49.997 MeV /c.

k= p / ħ c → since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So k=49.997/(197.33 ) ≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Which is correct.

Hmm.

So Im(f(0))=17.94 fm.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, wait, the question says "the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction". Wait, but the scattering amplitude is a function of the angle. At θ=0, it's the forward direction. But the question states that the answer is among the options, which are all around 100-35000 fm.

Wait, but 17.94 fm is not among the options. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the question is about the total cross-section, which is related to the imaginary part of f(0).

The optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ_total =4π/k² Im(f(0)).

So Im(f(0))= (k²/(4π)) σ_total.

But the problem doesn't give the cross-section. So that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in terms of the partial wave expansion. Another thought: sometimes, the scattering amplitude is written as f(θ) = sum_{l} ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] sin(lθ + δ_l )

But perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) [ e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ) ]

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

I think another approach is needed. Let's think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

These options are much larger than what I computed. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units in calculating k.

Wait, if k is in fm⁻¹, and the Im(f(0)) is in fm, then perhaps in the sum, I should have used 2l+1 multiplied by sin(2 δ_l) * sin(δ_l ), but perhaps the correct factor is (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l ) / (2k )

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) / (2k )

Then, compute each term as (2l +1) sin(2 δ_l )

l=0:1*sin(180)=0 →0.

l=1:3*sin(134) →3 *0.6691=2.0073.

l=2:5*sin(110)=5*0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9*sin(26)=9*0.4384=3.9456.

Sum all: 0 +2.0073=2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Then, Im(f(0))=16.7134/(2k )=16.7134/(2*0.2536)=16.7134/0.5072≈32.90 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are about 177, 251, etc.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = sum ( (2l +1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

Wait, for each term:

l=0:1 * sin90=1 →1.

l=1:3 *sin67≈3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *sin55≈5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *sin13≈9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382/(2k )=13.382/(0.5072)=26.40 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should not have considered the relativistic approach for k, but used the non-relativistic formula. Let's try that.

Non-relativistic approach:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

E=50 MeV, m_e=0.511 MeV/c².

But in non-relativistic terms, E is in Joules.

Wait, E=50 MeV →50 * 1e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

So k = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J ) / ħ.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ) = sqrt(1.458e-43 )=≈3.82e-21.9 m/s.

Wait, 3.82e-22 m/s.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

So k=3.82e-22 / 1.05457e-34 ≈3.62e12 m⁻¹.

Which is 3.62e12 per meter →3.62e12 m⁻¹=3.62e3 per nanometer.

But in fm⁻¹: 1 m=1e15 fm →3.62e12 m⁻¹=3.62e12 *1e15 fm⁻¹=3.62e27 fm⁻¹.

Which is way too large.

Wait, but that can't be correct.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) / (2k )

But that doesn't seem to fit either.

Wait, another thought. The scattering amplitude f is given by f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

But in the forward direction, θ=0, so f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

The imaginary part is [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(δ_l) ) ] summed and multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, no. Because e^{i δ} sin δ = cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ. So the imaginary part is sin² δ.

So sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l over l, divided by k.

Wait, so Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (k )

Which for our sum gives 9.1023 / 0.2536 ≈35.87 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps k is 0.2536 fm. No, wait, k is 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps the actual value of k is different.

Alternative approach: Compute k using E=50 MeV.

E = (ħ c)² (k² + m_e² c^4 )/(2 m_e c² )

Wait, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation for the de Broglie wavelength λ = 2πħ/(p ), and p= sqrt(2 m_e E ) non-relativistically.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, but that gives a large wavelength which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for k is k = sqrt( 2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But with E in Joules.

E=50 MeV = 50 * 1e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 )=sqrt(1.458e-43 )=approx3.82e-22 kg m/s.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

So k=3.82e-22 /1.05457e-34 =3.62e12 m⁻¹.

Which is 3.62e12 per meter → 3.62e3 per nanometer → which is 3.62e18 per femtometer.

Wait, no, because 1 m=1e15 fm → 1 m⁻¹=1e-15 fm.

So 3.62e12 m⁻¹ =3.62e12 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹=3.62e-3 fm⁻¹=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's different. Ah! I must have made a mistake in converting m⁻¹ to fm⁻¹.

Wait, 1 m⁻¹ = (1 m)^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 =1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So, 3.62e12 m⁻¹ =3.62e12 *1e-15 fm⁻¹=3.62e-3 fm⁻¹=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

So k=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because then, 1/k would be 276 fm.

Wait, but let me recompute the conversion.

Wait, 1 m⁻¹ = (1 m)^-1.

1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 m⁻¹ = 1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So 3.62e12 m⁻¹ =3.62e12 *1e-15 fm⁻¹=3.62e-3 fm⁻¹ =0.00362 fm⁻¹.

So k=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

Now, Im(f(0))= sum/(2k )=9.1023/(2 *0.00362 )≈9.1023/(0.00724 )≈1257 fm.

Hmm, option A is 87163 fm, B is 355, which is about 355, but 1257 isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) / (2k )

So sum=13.382 (from earlier calculation).

Then Im(f(0))=13.382/(2k )=13.382/(2*0.00362 )=13.382/(0.00724 )≈1850 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, when the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Sum=9.1023.

k=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))=9.1023/(2 *0.00362 )=9.1023/(0.00724 )≈1257 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) / (2k )

Which gives sum=16.7134.

Im(f(0))=16.7134/(2*0.00362 )=16.7134/(0.00724 )≈2307 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (k )

Which would be 13.382 /0.00362 ≈3695 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach, and the correct way is to calculate the total cross-section and then find Im(f(0)).

But since the question gives phase shifts, I'm supposed to calculate Im(f(0)) directly.

Given that none of my approaches are matching the options, perhaps I should make a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k.

Compute sum:

l=0:1 * sin90=1.

l=1:3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Then Im(f(0))=13.382 /0.00362 ≈3695 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, but the options have 177.675 fm, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) )/(2k )

Which sum is 16.7134.

Im(f(0))=16.7134/(2*0.00362 )=16.7134/0.00724≈2307 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is designed to ignore higher l terms beyond δ4, but perhaps the actual formula is using (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, perhaps the sum is (1) +3 e^{i67} sin 67 +5 e^{i55} sin55 + etc.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, sum=13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382 /0.00362 =3695 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach involves using the relativistic expression for k, but I'm not getting the right value.

Wait, in the relativistic approach, the correct k is 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Then, using the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l =9.1023.

Im(f(0))=9.1023/(2*0.2536 )=17.94 fm.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (2k )

Sum=13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382/(2*0.2536 )=13.382/(0.5072 )≈26.4 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) * (1/(2k )).

Which gives 26.4 fm.

Hmm.

Given that none of the approaches are matching, perhaps I should look for another angle.

Wait, the options are A)87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Option C is approximately 177.675, which is about 10 times 17.94.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k, and k is actually 0.02536 fm⁻¹, not 0.2536.

Wait, let's recalculate the relativistic k.

E=50 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 )= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )=49.997 MeV.

p=49.997 MeV/c.

k= p/(ħ c )=49.997/(197.33 )=0.2536 fm⁻¹.

So no, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k )

Sum=13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382/(0.2536 )=52.74 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) / (2k )

Which gives 16.7134/(2*0.2536 )=16.7134/0.5072≈32.9 fm.

Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should try to see which option matches when I use the sum 9.1023/(2k), with k=0.02536.

Wait, if k were 0.02536 fm⁻¹, then 2k=0.05072.

9.1023/0.05072≈179.4 fm.

Which is close to option C, 177.675 fm.

But why would k be 0.02536?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me recheck.

Relativistic E=50 MeV.

p c = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )=49.997 MeV.

k= p/(ħ c )=49.997 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 49.997 /197.33 ≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

So earlier calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach with non-relativistic k is correct, giving k=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

Then Im(f(0))=9.1023/(2k )=9.1023/(2*0.00362 )=9.1023/(0.00724 )≈1257 fm.

But that's not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, like 2π.

Wait, if I multiply 17.94 fm by 2π, I get about 112.6 fm, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2, giving 35.88 fm, which is close to option B (355.351), but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) / (2k )

Which gives 16.7134/(2*0.2536 )=16.7134/0.5072≈32.9 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (2k )

Which gives 13.382/(2*0.2536 )=13.382/0.5072≈26.4 fm.

No match.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and not finding the correct approach, perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) * (1/k )

In that case, sum=13.382/(0.2536 )=52.74 fm.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) * (something else )

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (k )

Which gives 13.382/0.2536=52.74 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic k, which gives Im(f(0))=1257 fm, but that's not an option.

Wait, wait, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times 17.94 fm.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum, and the actual sum is 91.023.

Wait, no, I think the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part, but no, the question specifies the imaginary part.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I used degrees. Oh, wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake here.

Yes! Because if I used degrees instead of radians when calculating the sine, that would give wrong results.

Wait, that's a big mistake. Because sin(67°) is different from sin(67 radians).

So, I must convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians before computing the sine.

So all the phase shifts (δ0=90°, δ1=67°, etc.) must be converted to radians.

Yes, that's a crucial mistake I made earlier.

So let me recalculate everything.

First, convert each δ_l to radians.

δ0:90° → π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

δ1:67° →67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

δ2:55°→55 * π/180≈0.95993 rad.

δ3:30°→π/6≈0.523599 rad.

δ4:13°→13 * π/180≈0.226893 rad.

Now, compute sin for each δ in radians.

Compute each term for the formula Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, no, earlier I thought that the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) ) / (2k )

But perhaps after converting to radians, the sum is correct.

But to correct for the mistake, I'll recompute the sum with radians.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute each (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

l=0:

δ0=1.5708 rad. sin(1.5708)=1. So sin²=1.

Term:1 *1=1.

l=1:

δ1=1.16937 rad. sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205 (same as 67 degrees since converting to radians doesn't change the sine value). So sin²=0.8473.

Term:3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:

δ2=0.95993 rad. sin=0.8192 → sin²=0.6710.

Term:5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:

δ3=0.523599 rad. sin=0.5 → sin²=0.25.

Term:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:

δ4=0.226893 rad. sin=0.22495 → sin²=0.0506.

Term:9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

So sum is 1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Same sum as before.

But wait, the sin is the same whether in degrees or radians because the phase shifts are the same. Wait, no, you're right, the phase shifts in radians and degrees are different. So I must compute the sine correctly.

Wait, no: when I converted the phase shifts to radians, the actual values are different. For example, 67 degrees is about 1.16937 radians, and sin(1.16937) is indeed approximately 0.9205, same as sin(67°).

So the earlier sum remains the same.

Thus, I think that the mistake was elsewhere.

So, this doesn't affect the sum.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) / (2k )

Because with the phase shifts in radians, let's recompute.

Compute each term.

l=0:

2δ0=3.1416 rad. sin=0. So term=0.

l=1:

2δ1=2.33874 rad. sin=approx 0.7431.

Term:3 *0.7431≈2.2293.

l=2:

2δ2=1.91986 rad. sin= approx 0.9455.

Term:5 *0.9455≈4.7275.

l=3:

2δ3=1.047198 rad. sin=0.8660.

Term:7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:

2δ4=0.453786 rad. sin=0.4384.

Term:9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum:0+2.2293=2.2293 +4.7275=6.9568 +6.062=13.0188 +3.9456≈16.9644.

Then, Im(f(0))=16.9644/(2k )=16.9644/(2 *0.2536 )=16.9644/0.5072≈33.43 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, but perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but in the calculation of the formula, I should have used the sine of the phase shifts in radians.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and not finding the correct approach, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The closest option to my earlier relativistic calculation (17.94 fm) is not present. But perhaps the correct approach gives option C:177.675 fm, which is 10 times 17.94 fm. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

E=50 MeV.

Relativistic approach:

E^2 = (p c )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 → (p c )=sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )≈49.997 MeV.

k = p/(ħ c )=49.997 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 49.997/197.33≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation of k.

Wait, 49.997/197.33=0.2536 → which is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) /k → sum=16.9644.

Im(f(0))=16.9644/0.2536 ≈66.86 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm, but I'm not sure how to get there. Perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (k )

Which gives 13.382 /0.2536≈52.74 fm.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) * (something else )

But I'm not finding the correct approach.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to choose the closest option, which I think is option C:177.675 fm.

The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons, given the phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at $\theta = 0^\circ$ is derived using the partial wave expansion:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shifts in Radians**: Convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians:
   - $\delta_0 = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5708 \, \text{rad}$
   - $\delta_1 = 67^\circ \approx 1.16937 \, \text{rad}$
   - $\delta_2 = 55^\circ \approx 0.95993 \, \text{rad}$
   - $\delta_3 = 30^\circ \approx 0.523599 \, \text{rad}$
   - $\delta_4 = 13^\circ \approx 0.226893 \, \text{rad}$

2. **Compute $\sin^2 \delta_l$**:
   - $\sin^2 \delta_0 = \sin^2(1.5708) = 1$
   - $\sin^2 \delta_1 = \sin^2(1.16937) \approx 0.8473$
   - $\sin^2 \delta_2 = \sin^2(0.95993) \approx 0.6710$
   - $\sin^2 \delta_3 = \sin^2(0.523599) = 0.25$
   - $\sin^2 \delta_4 = \sin^2(0.226893) \approx 0.0506$

3. **Sum the Terms**:
   - For each $l$, compute $(2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l$:
     - $l=0$: $1 \cdot 1 = 1$
     - $l=1$: $3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419$
     - $l=2$: $5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.355$
     - $l=3$: $7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75$
     - $l=4$: $9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554$
   - Total sum: $1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023$

4. **Wave Number $k$**:
   - Using the relativistic relation $k = \frac{p}{\hbar c}$, where $p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2}}{c}$:
     - $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}, m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$
     - $p c = \sqrt{50^2 - 0.511^2} \approx 49.997 \, \text{MeV}$
     - $k = \frac{49.997}{197.33} \approx 0.2536 \, \text{fm}^{-1}$

5. **Imaginary Part of $f(0)$**:
   - Substitute into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{9.1023}{2 \cdot 0.2536} \approx 17.94 \, \text{fm}
     \]

6. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated value of $17.94 \, \text{fm}$ does not match any of the provided options. However, option **C (177.675 fm)** is approximately 10 times larger, suggesting a possible missing factor of 10 in the calculation or interpretation of the formula.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch and the closest proximity of option **C** to the expected scale, the answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude plays a crucial role. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, the given data is phase shifts at different angular momentum values. The phase shifts are δ0 = 90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. Oh, right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude can be expressed using these phase shifts.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum l. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδl} sin(lθ + δl) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact expression. Alternatively, another formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) [e^{iδl} sin(lθ + δl) ] ), but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδl} sin(lθ + δl) )/(1 + ... ). Oh wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, I think the general formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ) ) / (k * something )

Wait, no, another approach. The scattering amplitude in the case of partial waves is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1 ) [ e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1 ) [ e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

No, wait, perhaps it's:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ) )

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should think about the optical theorem or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the direction of the incident beam is specifically when θ = 0 degrees.

Oh right! Because θ=0 would mean the direction is the same as the incident beam. So the question is asking for the imaginary part of f(0).

Hmm, okay, so let's compute f(0) and take its imaginary part.

Wait, but what's f(θ) at θ=0? Let's consider the general formula.

Wait, perhaps the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ) / (2ik)

But when θ=0, sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l). So each term becomes (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) / (2ik)

So f(0) would be sum_{l} [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) ] / (2ik )

But what is k? Oh, right, k is the wave number. For electrons, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But wait, since we have phase shifts provided, maybe the actual value of k isn't required? Or perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is being asked for along the beam direction, which is the forward direction.

Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to (4π/k²) times the imaginary part of f(0), so Im[f(0)] = (k²/(4π)) σ_total.

Wait, but the problem gives phase shifts, so perhaps the imaginary part can be computed directly from the phase shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0 is given by sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k), because when θ=0, the sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l), and then we have e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when multiplying by sin(lθ + δ_l) which is sin δ_l, the product becomes [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l] * sin δ_l = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of each term would be (2l +1) sin² δ_l / (2ik) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the partial wave expansion. Since in the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) * e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

So when θ=0, f(0) becomes sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) * e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

The imaginary part of f(0) would then be the sum over l of ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) * Im( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Now, compute Im( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ). Let's write e^{i δ_l} as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. Then multiply by sin δ_l:

( cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) * sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part is sin² δ_l.

So Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^n [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) * sin² δ_l ] 

But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. So l goes from 0 to 4.

So we have l=0,1,2,3,4.

So compute each term (2l+1) sin² δ_l, sum them, and then divide by 2k.

But wait, what's k? The wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Hmm, the energy E is 50 MeV. But wait, electrons are light, so relativistic effects might be significant. But the problem doesn't specify, but I think in this context, we can proceed with the non-relativistic formula for k.

Wait, wait, the energy E here is the kinetic energy. So non-relativistic, E = (p^2)/(2m) => p = sqrt(2mE). So k = p/ħ.

But we need to calculate k in appropriate units.

Let me think about the units. The phase shifts are given, but the question is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in fm. So the imaginary part has units of length.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude has f in units of length. So let's compute each term.

But first, compute each (2l+1) sin² δ_l. Then sum them, multiply by (1/(2k)), and that gives Im(f(0)).

Wait, but what's k in terms of the given energy?

E is given as 50 MeV. Let's compute k.

First, E = 50 MeV.

We can use the relation E = (ħ² k² )/(2m_e c² )

Wait, wait, because for electrons, when using E in MeV, perhaps it's better to express in natural units where c=1 and ħ is expressed in eV·s or similar.

Wait, but perhaps we can compute k in atomic units. Alternatively, using the conversion factors.

Let me recall that for an electron:

ħ = 197.33 MeV fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, but wait, ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm / (3e8 m/s) → but perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k in units where ħ and c are set to 1.

Wait, but let's think in terms of MeV and fm. Let's find k in units of 1/fm.

We have E = (ħ² k² )/(2m_e) 

So rearranged, k = sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ 

But I need to plug in the numbers.

m_e is the electron mass, approximately 0.511 MeV/c².

So m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

But in this case, E is given as 50 MeV of kinetic energy. Wait, but in non-relativistic terms, E = (p²)/(2m_e) → p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

Wait, but the relation between k and p is p = ħ k → k = p/ħ.

So let's compute p:

p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

But E is 50 MeV, and m_e is 0.511 MeV/c². So E in terms of m_e:

E = 50 MeV = (50 / 0.511) m_e c^2 ≈ 97.836 m_e c^2.

But wait, in non-relativistic approximation, E ≈ (p²)/(2m_e) → p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

So:

p = sqrt( 2 * m_e * E ) 

But m_e is 0.511 MeV/c², E is 50 MeV.

So 2 * m_e * E = 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV = 51.1 MeV² / c².

Wait, but then p² = 51.1 MeV² / c² → p = sqrt(51.1) MeV / c ≈ 7.15 MeV / c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c) [since ħ has units of J s, and c m/s → (ħ c) has units of J m, but perhaps I'm mixing units here.]

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ

But in units where ħ c is known, perhaps.

Alternatively, let's express everything in natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to compute k.

Wait, another approach. The Compton wavelength of the electron is λ = 2πħ/(m_e c²) ≈ 2.426 × 10^-12 m, which is about 2.426 fm (since 1 fm is 1e-15 m).

But perhaps I should just compute k in terms of fm⁻¹.

We have:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ

Expressed in units where E is in MeV, m_e is 0.511 MeV/c², and ħ is in MeV fm.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator.

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c²

E =50 MeV.

So 2 m_e E = 2 * 0.511 * 50 = 51.1 MeV² / c².

Wait, but what are the units? Let's see.

We have: k = sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ

But m_e E is (MeV/c²) * MeV = MeV² / c². Taking sqrt gives MeV / (c).

But ħ has units of MeV fm (since ħ c ≈ 197 MeV fm, so ħ is about 197 MeV fm / c).

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe let me plug in the numbers.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 m_e E )

2 m_e E = 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV = 51.1 MeV² / c².

Take square root: sqrt(51.1) MeV / c ≈ 7.15 MeV / c.

Denominator: ħ is 197.33 MeV fm / c.

So k = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = (7.15 / 197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that gives k ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

But wait, 1/(fm) is a large number, but let me compute 7.15 divided by 197.33.

7.15 / 197.33 ≈ 0.0362.

So k ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the units here. Let me double-check.

Actually, ħ has units of J s. But in terms of MeV and fm, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

But perhaps it's easier to just use the expression for k:

k = sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ 

But given that E is in MeV, m_e is 0.511 MeV/c². So:

k = sqrt( (2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV ) ) / ħ 

= sqrt(51.1 MeV²/c² ) / ħ 

= (sqrt(51.1) MeV/c ) / ħ 

But ħ is in units of MeV s/(fm c), perhaps? Because ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So plugging in:

k = (7.15 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) 

= 7.15 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but that seems small. Let me think again. Because 50 MeV is a high energy for an electron, so the wavelength should be small, which would mean k is large. So 0.0362 fm⁻¹ is 36.2 fm⁻¹, because 0.0362 * 1e2 is 3.62, but wait no, 0.0362 is 3.62e-2, so 36.2 fm⁻¹ would be 0.0362 reciprocal fm, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. 0.0362 fm⁻¹ is 36.2 per femtometer, which is a large number, implying a small wavelength. Wait, that makes sense because high energy implies small wavelength.

Wait, but wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So the wavelength λ = 2π/k. If k is 0.0362 fm⁻¹, then λ = 2π / 0.0362 fm⁻¹ ≈ 171 fm. That's a huge wavelength for 50 MeV electrons. That can't be right. Because 50 MeV electrons are high energy and should have much shorter wavelengths.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let's try again.

The correct formula for the wave number k is k = p/ħ.

And p = sqrt(2 m_e E ), where E is the kinetic energy in joules. But since E is given in MeV, perhaps I should convert it to joules.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation:

k (fm⁻¹) = (2 m_e E )^½ / ħ 

With E in MeV, and m_e in MeV/c².

Wait, another approach: using the relation where E (in MeV) is related to the wavelength.

The Compton wavelength λ_c = ħ/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426 × 10^-12 m = 2.426 fm.

So for an electron, E ≈ (ħ c)^2/(2 m_e c^2 λ^2) → but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using relativistic energy would give a better result. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's non-relativistic.

Wait, but even in non-relativistic case, E = p²/(2m_e), so p = sqrt(2 m_e E ).

So p = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV ) → in units where c is considered.

But to get p in units of MeV/c, since E is MeV.

So p = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 * 50 ) MeV/c → sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k = p / ħ c → since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = (7.15 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 7.15 / 197.33 = 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, same result as before. So, k ≈ 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but that gives a very large wavelength, which doesn't make sense for 50 MeV electrons. So perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps E is 50 MeV, so including relativistic factors, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the Debye wavelength or something else, but no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the wave number in terms of energy is:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But when E is in eV, m_e is in eV s²/m², ħ is in J s.

Wait, maybe I should compute everything in SI units.

E = 50 MeV = 50 * 1e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

So, k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J )

Compute 2 * m_e * E = 2 * 9.109e-31 * 8.01e-13 ≈ 1.458e-43 kg J.

Wait, 1 J = 1 kg m²/s², so kg * J = kg² m²/s².

So sqrt(1.458e-43 kg² m²/s² ) → sqrt(1.458e-43) kg m/s ≈ 3.82e-21.9 kg m/s.

Wait, 3.82e-21.9 is about 3.82e-22 kg m/s.

Denominator: ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = (3.82e-22 kg m/s ) / (1.0545718e-34 J s )

But J = kg m²/s², so J s = kg m²/s.

So units: (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) → 1/(m), which is correct for k.

Compute the value: 3.82e-22 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 3.62e12 m⁻¹.

Wait, 3.62e12 m⁻¹ is 3.62e12 per meter, which is 3.62e3 per nanometer, or 3.62e6 per micrometer. But wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, so 1 m is 1e15 fm. So 3.62e12 m⁻¹ = 3.62e12 * 1e15 fm⁻¹ = 3.62e27 fm⁻¹. Which is a gigantic number; that can't be right.

Wait, that can't be correct. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, sqrt(2 m_e E ) → 2 m_e E = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J.

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so 8.01e-13 J = 8.01e-13 kg m²/s².

So 2 m_e E = 2 *9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 kg m²/s² = 2 * 9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 kg² m²/s² = 1.458e-43 kg² m²/s².

Taking the square root: sqrt(1.458e-43 kg² m²/s² ) = 3.82e-21.9 kg m/s.

Wait, but 3.82e-21.9 is approx 3.82e-22 kg m/s.

So k = 3.82e-22 kg m/s / 1.05457e-34 J s.

Wait, J s is kg m²/s. So denominator: 1.05457e-34 kg m²/s.

So, 3.82e-22 kg m/s divided by 1.05457e-34 kg m²/s → (3.82e-22) / (1.05457e-34 ) * (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) → (3.82e-22 /1.05457e-34 ) * (1/(m)).

So 3.82e-22 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 3.62e12 m⁻¹.

Wait, same as before. So k ≈ 3.62e12 m⁻¹, which is 3.62e12 per meter → which is 3.62e3 per nanometer. That can't be right, because 50 MeV electrons should have a much smaller wavelength.

Wait, something's wrong. Oh, wait, because E is 50 MeV, which is a lot, so maybe this is correct because electrons with high energy have small wavelengths.

Wait, the Compton wavelength is about 2.4 fm, but if E is 50 MeV, which is about 100 times the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are significant. So perhaps I should use relativistic expressions.

Wait, the relativistic energy is E = gamma m c². So for E =50 MeV, gamma is E/(m c²) =50/(0.511) ≈97.836. So gamma is about 98.

In that case, the momentum p is gamma m v, where v is the velocity. Alternatively, using the relation E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) → p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / c.

So plug in E =50 MeV, m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) MeV ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV.

So p = 49.997 MeV / c.

Then, k = p / ħ c → because p = ħ k.

So k = (49.997 MeV/c ) / ( ħ c )

But ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So k = 49.997 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Ah, that makes more sense! So k≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but how did I get this? Because earlier, I thought E is 50 MeV, which is much bigger than m c², so the non-relativistic approach wasn't correct. So using the relativistic approach gives a more accurate k.

So the correct k is about 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

So now, going back to Im(f(0)).

Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^4 [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, no, wait: earlier steps.

Wait, when θ=0, each term in f(0) is (2l +1)/(2ik) * e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

The imaginary part is sum [ (2l +1)/(2k) * sin² δ_l ]

So Im(f(0)) = [ sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

So sum each (2l +1) sin² δ_l:

l=0: 2(0)+1=1; δ0=90°, sin(90)=1 → 1 *1 =1

l=1: 3; δ1=67°, sin(67)≈0.9205 → 3*(0.9205)^2 ≈3*(0.8473)=2.5419

l=2:5; δ2=55°, sin(55)≈0.8192 →5*(0.8192)^2≈5*(0.6710)=3.355

l=3:7; δ3=30°, sin(30)=0.5 →7*(0.5)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75

l=4:9; δ4=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495 →9*(0.22495)^2≈9*(0.0506)=0.4554

Now sum all these:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419

3.5419 +3.355 = 6.8969

6.8969 +1.75 =8.6469

8.6469 +0.4554≈9.1023.

So the sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now, divide by 2k → 2 *0.2536 fm⁻¹ =0.5072 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))=9.1023 / 0.5072 ≈17.94 fm⁻¹? Wait, no, that can't be right because the answer options are in the hundreds of fm.

Wait, wait no. Wait, because Im(f(0)) is in units of 1/k, which is in fm.

Wait, no. Because 1/k is in fm. So:

Im(f(0))= sum/(2k) → sum is dimensionless, 2k is in fm⁻¹, so sum/(fm⁻¹) is fm.

Wait, wait: sum is dimensionless, 2k is in fm⁻¹, so sum/(2k) is sum * (fm).

So Im(f(0)) = [ sum ] / (2k ) → [9.1023 ] / (2 *0.2536 fm⁻¹ ) → 9.1023 / 0.5072 ≈17.94 fm.

But looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in the sum?

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated the sum.

Let me recalculate each term.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1; sin(90)=1; 1*1=1 → 1.

l=1:3; sin(67)≈0.9205 → 0.9205^2=0.8473 → 3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5; sin(55)=0.8192 → 0.8192^2≈0.6710 →5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7; sin(30)=0.5 →0.5^2=0.25 →7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9; sin(13)≈0.22495 →0.22495^2≈0.0506 →9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

So sum is 1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355→6.8969; +1.75→8.6469; +0.4554→9.1023.

Yes, that's correct.

k was 0.2536 fm⁻¹, so 2k=0.5072 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))=9.1023 / 0.5072 ≈17.94 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds of fm, except option C is 177.675 fm which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the formula? Oh, perhaps I confused the formula for Im(f(0)).

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] / (2k )

Wait, wait, earlier I thought the imaginary part of e^{i δ} sin(δ) is sin^2 δ. But wait, perhaps I should recalculate.

Given that e^{i δ} sin(δ) = (cos δ + i sin δ) * sin δ = cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ.

So the imaginary part is sin² δ.

But, wait, another approach: the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l} ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ]

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula. Let me think about this.

In the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ) / (2ik )

Because the optical theorem uses the imaginary part of f(0), which is Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin(δ_l) / (2k )

Wait, no.

Wait, when θ=0, lθ=0, and the term becomes (2l+1)/(2ik) * e^{2i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

Because e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l ) → e^{2i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

So the term is (2l+1)/(2ik) * e^{2i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

The imaginary part of this term is the imaginary part of [ (2l+1)/(2ik) * e^{2i δ_l} sin(δ_l ) ]

Let me write e^{2i δ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l).

So the term becomes (2l+1)/(2ik) [ cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) ] sin(δ_l )

Multiply this out:

= (2l+1)/(2ik) [ cos(2δ_l) sin(δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l) ]

The imaginary part is the coefficient of i:

Imaginary part = (2l+1)/(2k) [ sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l) ]

So Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin(δ_l) ] / (2k )

Hmm, so that's different from what I calculated earlier. So I made a mistake earlier.

So now, I have to compute each term as (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin(δ_l ), sum them, and divide by 2k.

So let's compute each term.

Again, l=0 to 4.

l=0: 2(0)+1=1.

δ0=90° → sin(2δ0) = sin(180°)=0 → term=0.

l=1:3.

δ1=67° → 2δ1=134° → sin(134)≈0.6691; sin(67)=0.9205.

Term=3 * 0.6691 * 0.9205 ≈3 * 0.6691 * 0.9205.

Compute 0.6691 *0.9205 → approximately 0.6691 *0.9205 ≈0.6153.

Then 3 *0.6153≈1.8459.

l=2:5.

δ2=55° → 2δ2=110° → sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397; sin(55)=0.8192.

Term=5 * 0.9397 * 0.8192 ≈5 * 0.7694 →≈3.847.

Wait, let's compute 0.9397 *0.8192:

0.9397 *0.8192 ≈0.7694.

5 *0.7694≈3.847.

l=3:7.

δ3=30° → 2δ3=60° → sin60=√3/2≈0.8660; sin30=0.5.

Term=7 *0.8660 *0.5 →7 *0.4330≈3.031.

l=4:9.

δ4=13° →2δ4=26° → sin26≈0.4384; sin13≈0.22495.

Term=9 *0.4384 *0.22495 →approx 9 *0.0985 →≈0.8865.

Now sum all terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1:1.8459.

l=2:3.847 → total so far 5.6929.

l=3:3.031 → total 8.7239.

l=4:0.8865 → total 9.6104.

So sum ≈9.6104.

Now, divide by 2k → 2 *0.2536 fm⁻¹ =0.5072 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0)) =9.6104 / 0.5072 ≈18.96 fm.

Wait, but the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, but this is for the imaginary part of f(0). But wait, the options are in the hundreds of fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula again. Another possibility: the imaginary part of the amplitude is (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )/(2k) multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for Im(f(0)) is sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l) ] / (2k )

But perhaps the correct formula is sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k ), because when you take the imaginary part of e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l ), perhaps it's sin(2 δ_l ), not sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, let me re-examine the expression:

e^{i δ} sin δ = (cos δ + i sin δ) sin δ = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

So the imaginary part is sin² δ, not sin(2 δ) sin δ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the correct term is (2l +1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Earlier, when I summed (2l+1) sin² δ_l, I got about 9.1023.

Then, Im(f(0))=9.1023/(2k )=9.1023/(2 *0.2536 )=9.1023/(0.5072 )≈17.94 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, looking back, when I computed k using the relativistic approach, I got k≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

But let's recalculate that.

E=50 MeV. Using E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → p c = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) ≈49.997 MeV.

So p=49.997 MeV /c.

k= p / ħ c → since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So k=49.997/(197.33 ) ≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Which is correct.

Hmm.

So Im(f(0))=17.94 fm.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, wait, the question says "the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction". Wait, but the scattering amplitude is a function of the angle. At θ=0, it's the forward direction. But the question states that the answer is among the options, which are all around 100-35000 fm.

Wait, but 17.94 fm is not among the options. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the question is about the total cross-section, which is related to the imaginary part of f(0).

The optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ_total =4π/k² Im(f(0)).

So Im(f(0))= (k²/(4π)) σ_total.

But the problem doesn't give the cross-section. So that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in terms of the partial wave expansion. Another thought: sometimes, the scattering amplitude is written as f(θ) = sum_{l} ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] sin(lθ + δ_l )

But perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) [ e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ) ]

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

I think another approach is needed. Let's think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

These options are much larger than what I computed. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units in calculating k.

Wait, if k is in fm⁻¹, and the Im(f(0)) is in fm, then perhaps in the sum, I should have used 2l+1 multiplied by sin(2 δ_l) * sin(δ_l ), but perhaps the correct factor is (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l ) / (2k )

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) / (2k )

Then, compute each term as (2l +1) sin(2 δ_l )

l=0:1*sin(180)=0 →0.

l=1:3*sin(134) →3 *0.6691=2.0073.

l=2:5*sin(110)=5*0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9*sin(26)=9*0.4384=3.9456.

Sum all: 0 +2.0073=2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Then, Im(f(0))=16.7134/(2k )=16.7134/(2*0.2536)=16.7134/0.5072≈32.90 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are about 177, 251, etc.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = sum ( (2l +1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

Wait, for each term:

l=0:1 * sin90=1 →1.

l=1:3 *sin67≈3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *sin55≈5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *sin13≈9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382/(2k )=13.382/(0.5072)=26.40 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should not have considered the relativistic approach for k, but used the non-relativistic formula. Let's try that.

Non-relativistic approach:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

E=50 MeV, m_e=0.511 MeV/c².

But in non-relativistic terms, E is in Joules.

Wait, E=50 MeV →50 * 1e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

So k = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J ) / ħ.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ) = sqrt(1.458e-43 )=≈3.82e-21.9 m/s.

Wait, 3.82e-22 m/s.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

So k=3.82e-22 / 1.05457e-34 ≈3.62e12 m⁻¹.

Which is 3.62e12 per meter →3.62e12 m⁻¹=3.62e3 per nanometer.

But in fm⁻¹: 1 m=1e15 fm →3.62e12 m⁻¹=3.62e12 *1e15 fm⁻¹=3.62e27 fm⁻¹.

Which is way too large.

Wait, but that can't be correct.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) / (2k )

But that doesn't seem to fit either.

Wait, another thought. The scattering amplitude f is given by f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l )

But in the forward direction, θ=0, so f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

The imaginary part is [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(δ_l) ) ] summed and multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, no. Because e^{i δ} sin δ = cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ. So the imaginary part is sin² δ.

So sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l over l, divided by k.

Wait, so Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (k )

Which for our sum gives 9.1023 / 0.2536 ≈35.87 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps k is 0.2536 fm. No, wait, k is 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps the actual value of k is different.

Alternative approach: Compute k using E=50 MeV.

E = (ħ c)² (k² + m_e² c^4 )/(2 m_e c² )

Wait, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation for the de Broglie wavelength λ = 2πħ/(p ), and p= sqrt(2 m_e E ) non-relativistically.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, but that gives a large wavelength which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for k is k = sqrt( 2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But with E in Joules.

E=50 MeV = 50 * 1e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 )=sqrt(1.458e-43 )=approx3.82e-22 kg m/s.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

So k=3.82e-22 /1.05457e-34 =3.62e12 m⁻¹.

Which is 3.62e12 per meter → 3.62e3 per nanometer → which is 3.62e18 per femtometer.

Wait, no, because 1 m=1e15 fm → 1 m⁻¹=1e-15 fm.

So 3.62e12 m⁻¹ =3.62e12 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹=3.62e-3 fm⁻¹=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's different. Ah! I must have made a mistake in converting m⁻¹ to fm⁻¹.

Wait, 1 m⁻¹ = (1 m)^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 =1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So, 3.62e12 m⁻¹ =3.62e12 *1e-15 fm⁻¹=3.62e-3 fm⁻¹=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

So k=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because then, 1/k would be 276 fm.

Wait, but let me recompute the conversion.

Wait, 1 m⁻¹ = (1 m)^-1.

1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 m⁻¹ = 1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So 3.62e12 m⁻¹ =3.62e12 *1e-15 fm⁻¹=3.62e-3 fm⁻¹ =0.00362 fm⁻¹.

So k=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

Now, Im(f(0))= sum/(2k )=9.1023/(2 *0.00362 )≈9.1023/(0.00724 )≈1257 fm.

Hmm, option A is 87163 fm, B is 355, which is about 355, but 1257 isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) / (2k )

So sum=13.382 (from earlier calculation).

Then Im(f(0))=13.382/(2k )=13.382/(2*0.00362 )=13.382/(0.00724 )≈1850 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, when the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Sum=9.1023.

k=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))=9.1023/(2 *0.00362 )=9.1023/(0.00724 )≈1257 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) / (2k )

Which gives sum=16.7134.

Im(f(0))=16.7134/(2*0.00362 )=16.7134/(0.00724 )≈2307 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (k )

Which would be 13.382 /0.00362 ≈3695 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach, and the correct way is to calculate the total cross-section and then find Im(f(0)).

But since the question gives phase shifts, I'm supposed to calculate Im(f(0)) directly.

Given that none of my approaches are matching the options, perhaps I should make a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k.

Compute sum:

l=0:1 * sin90=1.

l=1:3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Then Im(f(0))=13.382 /0.00362 ≈3695 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, but the options have 177.675 fm, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) )/(2k )

Which sum is 16.7134.

Im(f(0))=16.7134/(2*0.00362 )=16.7134/0.00724≈2307 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is designed to ignore higher l terms beyond δ4, but perhaps the actual formula is using (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, perhaps the sum is (1) +3 e^{i67} sin 67 +5 e^{i55} sin55 + etc.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, sum=13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382 /0.00362 =3695 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach involves using the relativistic expression for k, but I'm not getting the right value.

Wait, in the relativistic approach, the correct k is 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Then, using the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l =9.1023.

Im(f(0))=9.1023/(2*0.2536 )=17.94 fm.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (2k )

Sum=13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382/(2*0.2536 )=13.382/(0.5072 )≈26.4 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) * (1/(2k )).

Which gives 26.4 fm.

Hmm.

Given that none of the approaches are matching, perhaps I should look for another angle.

Wait, the options are A)87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Option C is approximately 177.675, which is about 10 times 17.94.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k, and k is actually 0.02536 fm⁻¹, not 0.2536.

Wait, let's recalculate the relativistic k.

E=50 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 )= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )=49.997 MeV.

p=49.997 MeV/c.

k= p/(ħ c )=49.997/(197.33 )=0.2536 fm⁻¹.

So no, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k )

Sum=13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382/(0.2536 )=52.74 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) / (2k )

Which gives 16.7134/(2*0.2536 )=16.7134/0.5072≈32.9 fm.

Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should try to see which option matches when I use the sum 9.1023/(2k), with k=0.02536.

Wait, if k were 0.02536 fm⁻¹, then 2k=0.05072.

9.1023/0.05072≈179.4 fm.

Which is close to option C, 177.675 fm.

But why would k be 0.02536?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me recheck.

Relativistic E=50 MeV.

p c = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )=49.997 MeV.

k= p/(ħ c )=49.997 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 49.997 /197.33 ≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

So earlier calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach with non-relativistic k is correct, giving k=0.00362 fm⁻¹.

Then Im(f(0))=9.1023/(2k )=9.1023/(2*0.00362 )=9.1023/(0.00724 )≈1257 fm.

But that's not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, like 2π.

Wait, if I multiply 17.94 fm by 2π, I get about 112.6 fm, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2, giving 35.88 fm, which is close to option B (355.351), but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) / (2k )

Which gives 16.7134/(2*0.2536 )=16.7134/0.5072≈32.9 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (2k )

Which gives 13.382/(2*0.2536 )=13.382/0.5072≈26.4 fm.

No match.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and not finding the correct approach, perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) * (1/k )

In that case, sum=13.382/(0.2536 )=52.74 fm.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) * (something else )

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (k )

Which gives 13.382/0.2536=52.74 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic k, which gives Im(f(0))=1257 fm, but that's not an option.

Wait, wait, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times 17.94 fm.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum, and the actual sum is 91.023.

Wait, no, I think the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part, but no, the question specifies the imaginary part.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I used degrees. Oh, wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake here.

Yes! Because if I used degrees instead of radians when calculating the sine, that would give wrong results.

Wait, that's a big mistake. Because sin(67°) is different from sin(67 radians).

So, I must convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians before computing the sine.

So all the phase shifts (δ0=90°, δ1=67°, etc.) must be converted to radians.

Yes, that's a crucial mistake I made earlier.

So let me recalculate everything.

First, convert each δ_l to radians.

δ0:90° → π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

δ1:67° →67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

δ2:55°→55 * π/180≈0.95993 rad.

δ3:30°→π/6≈0.523599 rad.

δ4:13°→13 * π/180≈0.226893 rad.

Now, compute sin for each δ in radians.

Compute each term for the formula Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, no, earlier I thought that the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) ) / (2k )

But perhaps after converting to radians, the sum is correct.

But to correct for the mistake, I'll recompute the sum with radians.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute each (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

l=0:

δ0=1.5708 rad. sin(1.5708)=1. So sin²=1.

Term:1 *1=1.

l=1:

δ1=1.16937 rad. sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205 (same as 67 degrees since converting to radians doesn't change the sine value). So sin²=0.8473.

Term:3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:

δ2=0.95993 rad. sin=0.8192 → sin²=0.6710.

Term:5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:

δ3=0.523599 rad. sin=0.5 → sin²=0.25.

Term:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:

δ4=0.226893 rad. sin=0.22495 → sin²=0.0506.

Term:9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

So sum is 1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Same sum as before.

But wait, the sin is the same whether in degrees or radians because the phase shifts are the same. Wait, no, you're right, the phase shifts in radians and degrees are different. So I must compute the sine correctly.

Wait, no: when I converted the phase shifts to radians, the actual values are different. For example, 67 degrees is about 1.16937 radians, and sin(1.16937) is indeed approximately 0.9205, same as sin(67°).

So the earlier sum remains the same.

Thus, I think that the mistake was elsewhere.

So, this doesn't affect the sum.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) / (2k )

Because with the phase shifts in radians, let's recompute.

Compute each term.

l=0:

2δ0=3.1416 rad. sin=0. So term=0.

l=1:

2δ1=2.33874 rad. sin=approx 0.7431.

Term:3 *0.7431≈2.2293.

l=2:

2δ2=1.91986 rad. sin= approx 0.9455.

Term:5 *0.9455≈4.7275.

l=3:

2δ3=1.047198 rad. sin=0.8660.

Term:7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:

2δ4=0.453786 rad. sin=0.4384.

Term:9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum:0+2.2293=2.2293 +4.7275=6.9568 +6.062=13.0188 +3.9456≈16.9644.

Then, Im(f(0))=16.9644/(2k )=16.9644/(2 *0.2536 )=16.9644/0.5072≈33.43 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, but perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but in the calculation of the formula, I should have used the sine of the phase shifts in radians.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and not finding the correct approach, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The closest option to my earlier relativistic calculation (17.94 fm) is not present. But perhaps the correct approach gives option C:177.675 fm, which is 10 times 17.94 fm. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

E=50 MeV.

Relativistic approach:

E^2 = (p c )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 → (p c )=sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )≈49.997 MeV.

k = p/(ħ c )=49.997 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 49.997/197.33≈0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation of k.

Wait, 49.997/197.33=0.2536 → which is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) /k → sum=16.9644.

Im(f(0))=16.9644/0.2536 ≈66.86 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm, but I'm not sure how to get there. Perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (k )

Which gives 13.382 /0.2536≈52.74 fm.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) * (something else )

But I'm not finding the correct approach.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to choose the closest option, which I think is option C:177.675 fm.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons, given the phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at $\theta = 0^\circ$ is derived using the partial wave expansion:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shifts in Radians**: Convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians:
   - $\delta_0 = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5708 \, \text{rad}$
   - $\delta_1 = 67^\circ \approx 1.16937 \, \text{rad}$
   - $\delta_2 = 55^\circ \approx 0.95993 \, \text{rad}$
   - $\delta_3 = 30^\circ \approx 0.523599 \, \text{rad}$
   - $\delta_4 = 13^\circ \approx 0.226893 \, \text{rad}$

2. **Compute $\sin^2 \delta_l$**:
   - $\sin^2 \delta_0 = \sin^2(1.5708) = 1$
   - $\sin^2 \delta_1 = \sin^2(1.16937) \approx 0.8473$
   - $\sin^2 \delta_2 = \sin^2(0.95993) \approx 0.6710$
   - $\sin^2 \delta_3 = \sin^2(0.523599) = 0.25$
   - $\sin^2 \delta_4 = \sin^2(0.226893) \approx 0.0506$

3. **Sum the Terms**:
   - For each $l$, compute $(2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l$:
     - $l=0$: $1 \cdot 1 = 1$
     - $l=1$: $3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419$
     - $l=2$: $5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.355$
     - $l=3$: $7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75$
     - $l=4$: $9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554$
   - Total sum: $1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023$

4. **Wave Number $k$**:
   - Using the relativistic relation $k = \frac{p}{\hbar c}$, where $p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2}}{c}$:
     - $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}, m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$
     - $p c = \sqrt{50^2 - 0.511^2} \approx 49.997 \, \text{MeV}$
     - $k = \frac{49.997}{197.33} \approx 0.2536 \, \text{fm}^{-1}$

5. **Imaginary Part of $f(0)$**:
   - Substitute into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{9.1023}{2 \cdot 0.2536} \approx 17.94 \, \text{fm}
     \]

6. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated value of $17.94 \, \text{fm}$ does not match any of the provided options. However, option **C (177.675 fm)** is approximately 10 times larger, suggesting a possible missing factor of 10 in the calculation or interpretation of the formula.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch and the closest proximity of option **C** to the expected scale, the answer is:

**Answer: C**
