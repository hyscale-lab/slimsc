Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopy, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by breaking down the question.

Mike is working on a high-res TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 1e-9 Torr. The point is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment because having too many can mess up the electron microscopy by causing scattering. So, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spec.

Mike measures the mean free path (λ1) of these gas molecules. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. That depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. Factors I remember: higher pressure means more molecules, so shorter mean free path. Lower pressure, longer mean free path.

But then, when he turns on the electron beam, something happens. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2, and the temperature is the same. So why would λ change? Because the mean free path is calculated based on pressure (and other things), but if the beam is on, maybe it's causing some effect.

Wait, the mean free path in a vacuum is given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number of molecules per unit volume and σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where d is the diameter, k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, P pressure.

But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be interacting with the electrons. Electrons can cause scattering of the gas molecules, right? Or maybe the gas molecules are getting ionized or excited by the electrons? Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam might affect the pressure in some way.

Wait, the electron beam itself has a high energy. At 1000 kV, that's a lot. Maybe the electrons are causing gas molecules to become ionized. When a gas is ionized, the ions and electrons can affect the mean free path differently. Or perhaps the electron beam is causing some pumping effect, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas in the chamber might experience a phenomenon called "electron scattering." The electrons from the beam hit the gas molecules, which changes their velocity or direction. This would increase the rate of collisions among the gas molecules because each collision with the electron beam imparts some energy, leading to more frequent collisions.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas particles to move more, increasing n (number density), which would decrease the mean free path. Or wait, no, if the beam is causing the gas molecules to be more energetic, the mean free path might actually increase because they move faster, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, the mean free path in the original scenario was λ1, determined under the vacuum conditions. So when Mike turned on the beam, the mean free path became λ2. The question is whether λ2 is larger or smaller than λ1.

If the pressure is the same, then λ should be the same. But wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the pressure? Or perhaps causes a change in the effective cross-section for collisions.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons, which might mean that the electron mean free path in the TEM is affected, but the gas molecule mean free path? Hmm, the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, so it's about their collisions with each other, not with electrons.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, which could cause them to be more likely to collide with the walls or other structures in the chamber. Or maybe the electrons cause the gas to heat up, changing the temperature, but the question says the temperature remained the same.

Wait, the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So T is the same. So the only change would be in the pressure or the collision dynamics.

Wait, but why would the mean free path change? If the number density (n) is the same, then λ should stay the same. Unless the effective cross-section (σ) changes. For example, if the gas molecules are charged, or if the collisions are more likely when the electrons are present.

Wait, another angle: the presence of the electron beam can cause the gas to become ionized. So, in the presence of the beam, the gas molecules might get ionized, turning into ions. Ions have different cross-sections for collisions compared to neutral gas molecules. So if the gas was previously neutral (or more neutral), then the collision cross-section σ would be smaller (ions have bigger cross-sections because they have higher charge and maybe larger effective sizes). Wait, no, actually, the cross-section depends on the interactions. For example, neutral atoms have certain collision cross-sections, while ions, especially with higher charge, may have different cross-sections. Alternatively, when a gas is ionized, the mean free path might change because the dominant interactions change.

Wait, but if gas is ionized, the ion mean free path could be different. But the question is about the gas molecules (presumably neutral) in the vacuum. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by high-energy electrons. That could cause gas molecules to either be ionized or to be scattered more frequently. If the gas is ionized, the number of neutral molecules decreases, and ions increase. But in terms of the mean free path for the gas molecules (perhaps the question refers to neutral gas molecules), if there are more ions, those could interact with the gas molecules, altering their mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps when the beam is on, the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move. Each collision with an electron could change the gas molecules' trajectory, leading to more frequent collisions. So the effective number of collisions increases, which would decrease the mean free path λ. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

Wait, but the mean free path is λ = 1/(n σ √2). If σ increases because of the presence of electrons (maybe the gas molecules are more likely to collide with each other due to electron-induced excitation or something), then λ would decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of electrons doesn't directly affect the gas molecules' collisions, but the ionization does. If ionization causes the gas to have more charged particles, the mean free path could decrease because the charged particles might interact more with each other or with the chamber walls.

Wait, but Mike measured λ1 under the vacuum state, and when he turned on the beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. He found that λ2 was different. The question is whether λ2 is greater than or less than λ1.

If the mean free path decreases when the beam is on, then λ2 < λ1. So that would mean option C is the choice.

But why would the mean free path decrease? Well, perhaps because the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other. If the beam causes a higher rate of collisions, the mean free path would be shorter.

Another thought: the presence of the electron beam might cause a change in the pressure. Wait, but the pressure is already ultra-high vacuum. Maybe the beam is causing some additional pumping, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be more likely to hit the walls due to higher energy, but that would reduce the mean free path as they'd be getting stopped quicker.

Wait, but the mean free path is about the average distance between collisions among the gas molecules. If the beam makes the gas molecules more likely to collide with each other, then the mean free path would be smaller.

So in the initial state (beam off), the gas has a mean free path λ1. When the beam is on, gas molecules collide more, so λ2 < λ1.

So the conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1, so option C is correct.

When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 1000 kV, Mike aimed to achieve an ultra-high vacuum (< 10^-9 Torr) to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment, as these molecules can scatter electrons and degrade imaging quality. He measured the mean free path of the gas molecules, denoted as λ1, under these vacuum conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the mean free path to λ2, despite the temperature remaining constant.

The mean free path, λ, is determined by factors such as the number density of gas molecules (n), the collision cross-section (σ), and the pressure. The formula for mean free path is given by:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot n \cdot \sigma}
\]

When the electron beam is turned on, the high-energy electrons interact with the gas molecules. These interactions can include ionization, scattering, or energy transfer, which alter the effective collision dynamics. Specifically, the electron beam can increase the likelihood of collisions among gas molecules, either by directly scattering them or by ionizing the gas, leading to changes in the collision cross-section (σ). Additionally, the presence of charged particles (ions) in the chamber can further influence the mean free path, as charged particles often have larger collision cross-sections compared to neutral molecules.

Given that the temperature remains constant, any change in the mean free path must arise from changes in the collision dynamics or effective cross-section. The increased likelihood of collisions due to electron beam interactions would reduce the mean free path, leading to λ2 < λ1. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the mean free path decreases when the electron beam is active.
