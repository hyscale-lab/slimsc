Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh right, the complementary color thing. Like, if something absorbs blue, it might emit orange or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when a substance absorbs light, it doesn't emit it, but the color we see is the one that's not absorbed. Oh wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

So the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So I think the energy of the emitted light relates to the energy gap in the compound. Oh right, the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) determines the wavelength of light absorbed. Because when light hits the molecule, if it has enough energy to bridge that gap, the electron gets excited, and the molecule absorbs that light.

Wait, so the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. But wait, I think that's the energy that's being emitted. So when the electron transitions from a higher energy state to a lower one, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted light is equal to the energy difference between the states. But wait, that might be the energy of the photon that's emitted. But absorption is when the molecule takes in energy, so maybe the energy of the absorbed light is higher than the emitted?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think the absorbed light provides the energy for the electron to jump from HOMO to LUMO. The energy of that absorbed photon is the energy gap (E). So E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So the bigger the energy, the shorter the wavelength.

Wait, the energy given here is 2.3393 eV. But wait, that's the energy of the emitted light. So the molecule must have a HOMO-LUMO gap that is equal to that energy. Or is it different? Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it uses that energy to promote an electron from HOMO to LUMO. The energy of the photon must match that gap. Then, when the electron drops back down, it emits a photon. But wait, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed one because some energy is lost as heat or something? Or perhaps in this case, the emitted light is from a different transition.

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. The energy of the absorbed photon is the energy gap. When the electron falls back, it emits a photon with lower energy than the absorbed photon? Or same? Or higher? I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, energy conservation. When an electron absorbs a photon, it gains energy equal to the photon's energy. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon. But that emitted photon's energy depends on the transition. So if the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, and when it emits, it might emit a photon of lower energy (if the transition is from LUMO to some lower state) than E. Or maybe it's the same as E.

Wait, but in this question, the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy of the emitted photon. The question is asking what color is absorbed. So perhaps the absorbed light has higher energy than the emitted? Or lower?

Wait, maybe the energy of the absorbed light is the same as the emitted. No, that doesn't make sense because the electron would have to go up and then come down, so the process would involve the same energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the emitted energy is the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO, which is the same as the absorbed energy.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the HOMO-LUMO gap, which is the energy the electron requires to jump. Then, when the electron relaxes back, it emits a photon. But that emitted photon's energy depends on the transition. For example, if the molecule has more than one excited state, the electron might drop to a lower state, emitting a photon of lower energy. But in the case of a simple transition, perhaps the emitted photon has the same energy as the absorbed one. But I think that's not the case.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the electron absorbs a photon (energy E) and gets excited, it's promoted from HOMO to LUMO. Then, when it relaxes, it can emit a photon of energy E again. So the emitted photon's energy would be the same as the absorbed. But wait, the question says the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed light would have the same energy? So then, the color absorbed would be the same as the emitted? No, that can't be right because the emitted color is what we see.

Wait, no. The color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So if a dye emits light of a certain color, that's the color it's giving off. But the absorbed light is the one it takes in. Oh wait, I'm getting confused again. When a substance absorbs certain wavelengths, it reflects or emits others. The color we see is the color that's not absorbed. But in this case, the dye is emitting light, so perhaps it's fluorescent or something.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV and see what color that is. Then, the absorbed light is the complementary color.

So the energy E is 2.3393 eV. To find the wavelength, I can use E = hc/λ. But let me get the numbers right. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But since we're dealing with eV, there's a conversion factor. 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. Alternatively, I can remember that 1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of about 1240 nm (since hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm). So λ (in nm) ≈ 1240 / E(eV).

So plugging in E = 2.3393 eV, λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's see. 1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me calculate that. 2.3393 times 530 is about 1240 (since 2.3393 * 530 = approximately 1240). So λ is about 530 nm.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 2.3393 * 530 = 2 *530 = 1060, 0.3393 *530 ≈ 180. So total around 1240. So yes, λ is approximately 530 nm. Which is in the green region. Because the visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm. 530 is green. So if the dye emits green light, then the color it absorbs would be the complementary color. Wait, what's the complementary color of green? It's magenta or something, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Because the emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to green, but the absorbed light is what excited the molecule. So the absorbed light's energy is the same as the HOMO-LUMO gap, which is the same as the emitted photon? Or wait, perhaps the emitted photon is from a different transition. Maybe when it emits, it's a lower energy than what was absorbed.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy required to excite the molecule. The molecule absorbs a photon with energy higher than the HOMO-LUMO gap, but that doesn't make sense. No, wait, the HOMO-LUMO gap is the energy needed to absorb a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is E = hc/λ, which is the same as the energy gap. So when the molecule absorbs that photon, the electron jumps from HOMO to LUMO. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. But the emitted photon's energy could be lower. So maybe the emitted energy is less than the absorbed.

Wait, that would make sense because when the molecule relaxes, it may drop to a lower energy state than the initial ground state. So the emitted photon would have lower energy than the absorbed photon.

Wait, but in our case, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So if the emitted is lower, the absorbed must be higher. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So let's find the wavelength of 2.3393 eV. As before, around 530 nm (green). If the emitted is green, the absorbed must be a higher energy photon (shorter wavelength). So what color is higher energy than green? Violet is higher energy than green. Because the visible spectrum goes from red (long wavelength, low energy) to violet (short wavelength, high energy). So violet is higher energy than green.

Wait, but wait: the energy of the absorbed photon is E_absorb = hc/λ_absorb. λ_absorb is shorter than λ_emitted. Because E_absorb > E_emitted. Because E is inversely proportional to λ.

So if E_absorb is higher than 2.3393 eV, then λ_absorb is shorter than 530 nm. What's the color with a wavelength shorter than 530? Blue is around 450-495 nm, violet is below 450. So if the absorbed photon is violet, that would make sense.

Wait, but the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow. So the absorbed color is violet, which is option B. But wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed photon? That would mean that the color emitted and absorbed are the same. But that can't be right because the color we see is the emitted, and it's the absorbed that's the opposite.

Wait, no, the dye's color is what's not absorbed. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

When a dye absorbs certain wavelengths (colors), it reflects/transmits the complementary color. So if it absorbs blue, it reflects orange. But in this case, the dye emits light. So perhaps the dye is fluorescent. When it's excited by absorbing a photon, it emits another photon of lower energy.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted. So the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher energy than that.

Calculating the emitted wavelength as 530 nm (green), so the absorbed photon must be higher energy, meaning shorter wavelength. 530 nm is green; higher energy photons would be blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. Which one is higher energy? Violet has a shorter wavelength than blue. So if the absorbed photon is violet, its energy is higher. So the dye would absorb violet light, and emit green. But then, the color we see would be green, but the question is about the absorbed color.

Wait, the question is: what color of light is absorbed by the organic compound? So the dye absorbs light with energy corresponding to E = 2.3393 eV? Or higher?

Wait, no, wait. The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the HOMO-LUMO gap, which is the same as the energy needed to promote the electron, so the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV as well. Because when the electron drops back, it emits a photon of the same energy. No, that can't be right because then the emitted and absorbed would be same color, but the color you see would be the emitted, but the absorbed would be the same.

Wait, this is getting more confusing. Maybe I should think about the energy levels. Let's say the molecule's ground state is at energy level E1. When it absorbs a photon of energy E, it jumps to E2 (E2 = E1 + E). Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E2 - E3, where E3 is lower than E2. If E3 is higher than E1, then the emitted photon has energy E2 - E3. Depending on E3, this could be less than E.

But in some cases, maybe E2 - E3 is the same as E. So the emitted photon has the same energy as the absorbed. That would mean the color emitted is the same as absorbed. But that can't be right because when a substance absorbs and emits the same photon, nothing changes. So perhaps that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the emitted photon's energy is lower. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed energy must be higher. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Calculating the wavelength for 2.3393 eV gives 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which means shorter wavelength. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet region.

Looking at the options, violet is 400-450 nm (higher energy than green), blue is 450-495 nm. So which one is higher in energy than 530 nm? Both violet and blue are higher than 530 in energy. Wait, no, wait. Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength.

So 530 nm is green. Violet is around 400 nm, which is higher energy. Blue is around 470, which is also higher than green. So both violet and blue are higher than green, which is 530.

So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet. So how do we choose between B) Violet and C) Blue?

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the absorption corresponds to the energy difference. So if the emitted photon has energy E_em = 2.3393 eV, and the absorption is E_abs = E_em, then the wavelength is 530 nm, which is green. So the dye would absorb green and emit green? That doesn't make much sense. Unless it's a different process.

Wait, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed photon. So the absorbed color is green. But that's not one of the options. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait another approach: when you have a material that emits light upon excitation, it's usually because it absorbed a photon of higher energy. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So E_abs = E_em + some energy, perhaps.

Wait, but if the molecule emits a photon when it relaxes, the energy of that photon is determined by the energy difference between the excited state and the lower state. So if the molecule absorbs a photon of E_abs, takes it to a higher state, then emits a photon when it relaxes. Depending on the transitions, the emitted photon could be of lower energy.

So for example, if the molecule absorbs a blue photon (say, 450 nm), which is higher energy than green (530). Then, upon relaxation, it emits a green photon (530 nm). So in this case, the absorbed light is blue, and the emitted is green.

So the dye would absorb blue light and emit green. So the question is, the dye emits 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed light must have higher energy than green, which is blue (450 nm) or violet (400 nm). So which one is higher than 530 nm? No, higher energy is lower wavelength.

So the absorbed light is either blue or violet. So the question is, what color is absorbed?

The options are B and C: Violet and Blue.

So which one corresponds to higher energy than 2.3393 eV?

Wait, 1 eV is about 1240 nm. So 2.3393 eV is 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm.

So the absorbed photon must have higher energy, so lower wavelength. Let's see what energy corresponds to the options.

Option B: Violet. Violet is about 400-450 nm. So E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV. 450 nm would be about 2.76 eV.

Option C: Blue is roughly 450-495 nm. 450 nm is 2.76 eV, 495 nm is ~2.5 eV.

So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm.

So 2.3393 eV is 530 nm. So any photon with energy higher than that (shorter wavelength) would be absorbed. So violet (like 400 nm, 3.1 eV) and blue (450, 2.76 eV) are both higher than 2.3393 eV.

But in the options, B is violet and C is blue. So which one is the correct absorbed color?

Wait, the question is asking which color is absorbed. So when the dye emits green (530 nm), the absorbed color must be higher energy than green. So either violet or blue.

But without more information, it's hard to say. However, in such questions, the absorbed color is usually the complementary color of the emitted color. The complementary color of green is magenta, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted light's energy is the same as the absorbed. So the dye absorbs green and emits green, which would mean it's transparent or something, but that doesn't make sense for a dye.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon (2.3393 eV) is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So when the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, it gets excited. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of the same E. So the absorbed and emitted photons have same energy.

But in that case, the color absorbed would be the same as the emitted. But the options don't have green. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is the energy gap. So the molecule absorbs that energy, gets excited, and then emits the same energy again. But then, the color of the dye would be the color of the emitted, which we're told is 2.3393 eV (green). So the dye would absorb green and emit green. But that doesn't make sense because then it wouldn't appear as a color. So I'm getting stuck.

Maybe I should look for another approach. The question says the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. The energy of the emitted photon is E_emit = 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is E_absorb = E_emit. So the absorbed color is the same as the emitted.

But the options don't have green. So maybe the question is misinterpreted. Maybe the emitted light is the complementary color of the absorbed. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the photon that the molecule emits is the difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels. So the energy of the emitted photon is E = E_LUMO - E_HOMO. Which is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon. So the absorbed and emitted photons have same energy. So the color absorbed is the same as the emitted.

But 2.3393 eV is green, which isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the wavelength.

Wait, let me recalculate the wavelength. E = hc/(lambda * e), where e is the charge. So let's compute lambda for E = 2.3393 eV.

E (eV) = 1240 / lambda (nm). So lambda = 1240 / 2.3393.

Calculating this: 1240 ÷ 2.3393 ≈ let's see.

2.3393 × 530 = ?

2.3393 × 500 = 1169.65

2.3393 ×30 = 70.179

Total = 1169.65 +70.179 = 1239.829, which is very close to 1240. So lambda is approximately 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted photon is green. Therefore, the absorbed photon is also green. But the options don't have green.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Maybe the question is about the color that's not emitted, meaning the color absorbed is what's not seen. But that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound emits light when it is excited, and the color it doesn't absorb is what we see. Wait, when a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it doesn't reflect that color, so the color we see is the complement.

Wait, if the compound emits green, then perhaps it didn't absorb green. So the absorbed color is the complement of green, which is magenta. But again, magenta isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound absorbs the complement of the emitted color. But without knowing the exact colors, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking what color is absorbed, given the emitted energy. If the emitted is green, the absorbed is the same, but that's not an option. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the energy of the emitted light is the energy difference between the excited state and a lower state, not necessarily the one it absorbed. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted.

So E_abs > E_emit.

So E_abs = 2.3393 eV + something.

Wait, but if the emitted is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must be higher. So, for example, if the emitted is green, the absorbed could be blue or violet.

So the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which one has higher energy than 2.3393 eV? Let's see.

Violet is about 400 nm (3.1 eV), which is higher than 2.3393. Blue is about 470 nm (2.64 eV), which is also higher.

So either B or C.

But how do I decide between the two?

Wait, perhaps the compound has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to absorption in the visible region. The energy gap for conjugated systems is smaller, leading to longer wavelengths (lower energy) being absorbed.

Wait, the more conjugated the system, the lower the energy gap (since the pi orbitals are more delocalized, the energy levels are closer). So lower energy (longer wavelength) is absorbed. So the compound would absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) region.

Wait, but the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So if the absorbed is longer wavelength than emitted, that can't be because energy can't be lower. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when a molecule absorbs a photon, the energy of that photon is converted into exciting the electron. Then, when the electron relaxes, it emits a photon. The emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed because some energy is lost as heat or other processes.

Wait, if E_abs is greater than E_emit, then E_abs > E_emit. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Which color is higher than green? Violet and blue.

But without knowing the exact energy, it's hard to choose between B and C.

Wait, perhaps the absorbed photon's energy is exactly 2.3393 eV. So it's green. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted light is the same as the absorbed, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe the question is about the complementary color. So if the emitted light is green, then the color absorbed is magenta, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about absorption but about emission, but the question asks what color is absorbed.

Wait, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Red is longer wavelength (lower energy), about 650 nm. E = 1240 /650 ≈ 1.907 eV.

So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed must be higher energy, so either blue (2.64 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

So which one is correct?

I think that the color absorbed would be the violet because higher energy, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed, which would be green, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is mistaken. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the HOMO-LUMO gap, which is the same as the emitted. So the absorbed photon is green. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait, maybe the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So for example, E_abs = 3.0 eV (violet), and E_emit = 2.3 eV (green). Then, the absorbed is violet.

So the color absorbed would be violet (option B) and emitted is green.

So the answer would be B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the absorbed is blue.

But I think the correct approach is that the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted. So the color absorbed is violet, so option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The energy of the emitted light is given as **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm** (calculated using the formula \( \lambda = \frac{1240}{E} \), where \( E \) is in eV). This wavelength falls within the green region of the visible spectrum.

When a molecule absorbs light, it uses the energy to promote an electron from the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) to the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital). The energy of the absorbed photon must match the HOMO-LUMO gap. Upon relaxation, the molecule emits a photon, but the energy of the emitted photon is typically lower than the absorbed photon due to energy losses (e.g., as heat). Therefore, the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

Since the emitted photon corresponds to **2.3393 eV** (green light), the absorbed photon must have higher energy, corresponding to a shorter wavelength. Among the options provided:

- **Red (650 nm)**: Lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.
- **Violet (400–450 nm)**: Higher energy than green, corresponding to **3.1–2.76 eV**.
- **Blue (450–495 nm)**: Higher energy than green, corresponding to **2.76–2.5 eV**.
- **Yellow (570–590 nm)**: Lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.

Both violet and blue have higher energy than green, but violet corresponds to a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than blue. Therefore, the absorbed light is most likely **violet**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh right, the complementary color thing. Like, if something absorbs blue, it might emit orange or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when a substance absorbs light, it doesn't emit it, but the color we see is the one that's not absorbed. Oh wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

So the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So I think the energy of the emitted light relates to the energy gap in the compound. Oh right, the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) determines the wavelength of light absorbed. Because when light hits the molecule, if it has enough energy to bridge that gap, the electron gets excited, and the molecule absorbs that light.

Wait, so the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. But wait, I think that's the energy that's being emitted. So when the electron transitions from a higher energy state to a lower one, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted light is equal to the energy difference between the states. But wait, that might be the energy of the photon that's emitted. But absorption is when the molecule takes in energy, so maybe the energy of the absorbed light is higher than the emitted?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think the absorbed light provides the energy for the electron to jump from HOMO to LUMO. The energy of that absorbed photon is the energy gap (E). So E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So the bigger the energy, the shorter the wavelength.

Wait, the energy given here is 2.3393 eV. But wait, that's the energy of the emitted light. So the molecule must have a HOMO-LUMO gap that is equal to that energy. Or is it different? Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it uses that energy to promote an electron from HOMO to LUMO. The energy of the photon must match that gap. Then, when the electron drops back down, it emits a photon. But wait, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed one because some energy is lost as heat or something? Or perhaps in this case, the emitted light is from a different transition.

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. The energy of the absorbed photon is the energy gap. When the electron falls back, it emits a photon with lower energy than the absorbed photon? Or same? Or higher? I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, energy conservation. When an electron absorbs a photon, it gains energy equal to the photon's energy. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon. But that emitted photon's energy depends on the transition. So if the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, and when it emits, it might emit a photon of lower energy (if the transition is from LUMO to some lower state) than E. Or maybe it's the same as E.

Wait, but in this question, the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy of the emitted photon. The question is asking what color is absorbed. So perhaps the absorbed light has higher energy than the emitted? Or lower?

Wait, maybe the energy of the absorbed light is the same as the emitted. No, that doesn't make sense because the electron would have to go up and then come down, so the process would involve the same energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the emitted energy is the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO, which is the same as the absorbed energy.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the HOMO-LUMO gap, which is the energy the electron requires to jump. Then, when the electron relaxes back, it emits a photon. But that emitted photon's energy depends on the transition. For example, if the molecule has more than one excited state, the electron might drop to a lower state, emitting a photon of lower energy. But in the case of a simple transition, perhaps the emitted photon has the same energy as the absorbed one. But I think that's not the case.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the electron absorbs a photon (energy E) and gets excited, it's promoted from HOMO to LUMO. Then, when it relaxes, it can emit a photon of energy E again. So the emitted photon's energy would be the same as the absorbed. But wait, the question says the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed light would have the same energy? So then, the color absorbed would be the same as the emitted? No, that can't be right because the emitted color is what we see.

Wait, no. The color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So if a dye emits light of a certain color, that's the color it's giving off. But the absorbed light is the one it takes in. Oh wait, I'm getting confused again. When a substance absorbs certain wavelengths, it reflects or emits others. The color we see is the color that's not absorbed. But in this case, the dye is emitting light, so perhaps it's fluorescent or something.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV and see what color that is. Then, the absorbed light is the complementary color.

So the energy E is 2.3393 eV. To find the wavelength, I can use E = hc/λ. But let me get the numbers right. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But since we're dealing with eV, there's a conversion factor. 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. Alternatively, I can remember that 1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of about 1240 nm (since hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm). So λ (in nm) ≈ 1240 / E(eV).

So plugging in E = 2.3393 eV, λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's see. 1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me calculate that. 2.3393 times 530 is about 1240 (since 2.3393 * 530 = approximately 1240). So λ is about 530 nm.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 2.3393 * 530 = 2 *530 = 1060, 0.3393 *530 ≈ 180. So total around 1240. So yes, λ is approximately 530 nm. Which is in the green region. Because the visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm. 530 is green. So if the dye emits green light, then the color it absorbs would be the complementary color. Wait, what's the complementary color of green? It's magenta or something, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Because the emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to green, but the absorbed light is what excited the molecule. So the absorbed light's energy is the same as the HOMO-LUMO gap, which is the same as the emitted photon? Or wait, perhaps the emitted photon is from a different transition. Maybe when it emits, it's a lower energy than what was absorbed.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy required to excite the molecule. The molecule absorbs a photon with energy higher than the HOMO-LUMO gap, but that doesn't make sense. No, wait, the HOMO-LUMO gap is the energy needed to absorb a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is E = hc/λ, which is the same as the energy gap. So when the molecule absorbs that photon, the electron jumps from HOMO to LUMO. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. But the emitted photon's energy could be lower. So maybe the emitted energy is less than the absorbed.

Wait, that would make sense because when the molecule relaxes, it may drop to a lower energy state than the initial ground state. So the emitted photon would have lower energy than the absorbed photon.

Wait, but in our case, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So if the emitted is lower, the absorbed must be higher. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So let's find the wavelength of 2.3393 eV. As before, around 530 nm (green). If the emitted is green, the absorbed must be a higher energy photon (shorter wavelength). So what color is higher energy than green? Violet is higher energy than green. Because the visible spectrum goes from red (long wavelength, low energy) to violet (short wavelength, high energy). So violet is higher energy than green.

Wait, but wait: the energy of the absorbed photon is E_absorb = hc/λ_absorb. λ_absorb is shorter than λ_emitted. Because E_absorb > E_emitted. Because E is inversely proportional to λ.

So if E_absorb is higher than 2.3393 eV, then λ_absorb is shorter than 530 nm. What's the color with a wavelength shorter than 530? Blue is around 450-495 nm, violet is below 450. So if the absorbed photon is violet, that would make sense.

Wait, but the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow. So the absorbed color is violet, which is option B. But wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed photon? That would mean that the color emitted and absorbed are the same. But that can't be right because the color we see is the emitted, and it's the absorbed that's the opposite.

Wait, no, the dye's color is what's not absorbed. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

When a dye absorbs certain wavelengths (colors), it reflects/transmits the complementary color. So if it absorbs blue, it reflects orange. But in this case, the dye emits light. So perhaps the dye is fluorescent. When it's excited by absorbing a photon, it emits another photon of lower energy.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted. So the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher energy than that.

Calculating the emitted wavelength as 530 nm (green), so the absorbed photon must be higher energy, meaning shorter wavelength. 530 nm is green; higher energy photons would be blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. Which one is higher energy? Violet has a shorter wavelength than blue. So if the absorbed photon is violet, its energy is higher. So the dye would absorb violet light, and emit green. But then, the color we see would be green, but the question is about the absorbed color.

Wait, the question is: what color of light is absorbed by the organic compound? So the dye absorbs light with energy corresponding to E = 2.3393 eV? Or higher?

Wait, no, wait. The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the HOMO-LUMO gap, which is the same as the energy needed to promote the electron, so the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV as well. Because when the electron drops back, it emits a photon of the same energy. No, that can't be right because then the emitted and absorbed would be same color, but the color you see would be the emitted, but the absorbed would be the same.

Wait, this is getting more confusing. Maybe I should think about the energy levels. Let's say the molecule's ground state is at energy level E1. When it absorbs a photon of energy E, it jumps to E2 (E2 = E1 + E). Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E2 - E3, where E3 is lower than E2. If E3 is higher than E1, then the emitted photon has energy E2 - E3. Depending on E3, this could be less than E.

But in some cases, maybe E2 - E3 is the same as E. So the emitted photon has the same energy as the absorbed. That would mean the color emitted is the same as absorbed. But that can't be right because when a substance absorbs and emits the same photon, nothing changes. So perhaps that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the emitted photon's energy is lower. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed energy must be higher. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Calculating the wavelength for 2.3393 eV gives 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which means shorter wavelength. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet region.

Looking at the options, violet is 400-450 nm (higher energy than green), blue is 450-495 nm. So which one is higher in energy than 530 nm? Both violet and blue are higher than 530 in energy. Wait, no, wait. Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength.

So 530 nm is green. Violet is around 400 nm, which is higher energy. Blue is around 470, which is also higher than green. So both violet and blue are higher than green, which is 530.

So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet. So how do we choose between B) Violet and C) Blue?

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the absorption corresponds to the energy difference. So if the emitted photon has energy E_em = 2.3393 eV, and the absorption is E_abs = E_em, then the wavelength is 530 nm, which is green. So the dye would absorb green and emit green? That doesn't make much sense. Unless it's a different process.

Wait, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed photon. So the absorbed color is green. But that's not one of the options. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait another approach: when you have a material that emits light upon excitation, it's usually because it absorbed a photon of higher energy. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So E_abs = E_em + some energy, perhaps.

Wait, but if the molecule emits a photon when it relaxes, the energy of that photon is determined by the energy difference between the excited state and the lower state. So if the molecule absorbs a photon of E_abs, takes it to a higher state, then emits a photon when it relaxes. Depending on the transitions, the emitted photon could be of lower energy.

So for example, if the molecule absorbs a blue photon (say, 450 nm), which is higher energy than green (530). Then, upon relaxation, it emits a green photon (530 nm). So in this case, the absorbed light is blue, and the emitted is green.

So the dye would absorb blue light and emit green. So the question is, the dye emits 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed light must have higher energy than green, which is blue (450 nm) or violet (400 nm). So which one is higher than 530 nm? No, higher energy is lower wavelength.

So the absorbed light is either blue or violet. So the question is, what color is absorbed?

The options are B and C: Violet and Blue.

So which one corresponds to higher energy than 2.3393 eV?

Wait, 1 eV is about 1240 nm. So 2.3393 eV is 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm.

So the absorbed photon must have higher energy, so lower wavelength. Let's see what energy corresponds to the options.

Option B: Violet. Violet is about 400-450 nm. So E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV. 450 nm would be about 2.76 eV.

Option C: Blue is roughly 450-495 nm. 450 nm is 2.76 eV, 495 nm is ~2.5 eV.

So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm.

So 2.3393 eV is 530 nm. So any photon with energy higher than that (shorter wavelength) would be absorbed. So violet (like 400 nm, 3.1 eV) and blue (450, 2.76 eV) are both higher than 2.3393 eV.

But in the options, B is violet and C is blue. So which one is the correct absorbed color?

Wait, the question is asking which color is absorbed. So when the dye emits green (530 nm), the absorbed color must be higher energy than green. So either violet or blue.

But without more information, it's hard to say. However, in such questions, the absorbed color is usually the complementary color of the emitted color. The complementary color of green is magenta, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted light's energy is the same as the absorbed. So the dye absorbs green and emits green, which would mean it's transparent or something, but that doesn't make sense for a dye.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon (2.3393 eV) is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So when the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, it gets excited. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of the same E. So the absorbed and emitted photons have same energy.

But in that case, the color absorbed would be the same as the emitted. But the options don't have green. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is the energy gap. So the molecule absorbs that energy, gets excited, and then emits the same energy again. But then, the color of the dye would be the color of the emitted, which we're told is 2.3393 eV (green). So the dye would absorb green and emit green. But that doesn't make sense because then it wouldn't appear as a color. So I'm getting stuck.

Maybe I should look for another approach. The question says the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. The energy of the emitted photon is E_emit = 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is E_absorb = E_emit. So the absorbed color is the same as the emitted.

But the options don't have green. So maybe the question is misinterpreted. Maybe the emitted light is the complementary color of the absorbed. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the photon that the molecule emits is the difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels. So the energy of the emitted photon is E = E_LUMO - E_HOMO. Which is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon. So the absorbed and emitted photons have same energy. So the color absorbed is the same as the emitted.

But 2.3393 eV is green, which isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the wavelength.

Wait, let me recalculate the wavelength. E = hc/(lambda * e), where e is the charge. So let's compute lambda for E = 2.3393 eV.

E (eV) = 1240 / lambda (nm). So lambda = 1240 / 2.3393.

Calculating this: 1240 ÷ 2.3393 ≈ let's see.

2.3393 × 530 = ?

2.3393 × 500 = 1169.65

2.3393 ×30 = 70.179

Total = 1169.65 +70.179 = 1239.829, which is very close to 1240. So lambda is approximately 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted photon is green. Therefore, the absorbed photon is also green. But the options don't have green.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Maybe the question is about the color that's not emitted, meaning the color absorbed is what's not seen. But that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound emits light when it is excited, and the color it doesn't absorb is what we see. Wait, when a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it doesn't reflect that color, so the color we see is the complement.

Wait, if the compound emits green, then perhaps it didn't absorb green. So the absorbed color is the complement of green, which is magenta. But again, magenta isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound absorbs the complement of the emitted color. But without knowing the exact colors, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking what color is absorbed, given the emitted energy. If the emitted is green, the absorbed is the same, but that's not an option. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the energy of the emitted light is the energy difference between the excited state and a lower state, not necessarily the one it absorbed. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted.

So E_abs > E_emit.

So E_abs = 2.3393 eV + something.

Wait, but if the emitted is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must be higher. So, for example, if the emitted is green, the absorbed could be blue or violet.

So the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which one has higher energy than 2.3393 eV? Let's see.

Violet is about 400 nm (3.1 eV), which is higher than 2.3393. Blue is about 470 nm (2.64 eV), which is also higher.

So either B or C.

But how do I decide between the two?

Wait, perhaps the compound has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to absorption in the visible region. The energy gap for conjugated systems is smaller, leading to longer wavelengths (lower energy) being absorbed.

Wait, the more conjugated the system, the lower the energy gap (since the pi orbitals are more delocalized, the energy levels are closer). So lower energy (longer wavelength) is absorbed. So the compound would absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) region.

Wait, but the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So if the absorbed is longer wavelength than emitted, that can't be because energy can't be lower. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when a molecule absorbs a photon, the energy of that photon is converted into exciting the electron. Then, when the electron relaxes, it emits a photon. The emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed because some energy is lost as heat or other processes.

Wait, if E_abs is greater than E_emit, then E_abs > E_emit. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Which color is higher than green? Violet and blue.

But without knowing the exact energy, it's hard to choose between B and C.

Wait, perhaps the absorbed photon's energy is exactly 2.3393 eV. So it's green. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted light is the same as the absorbed, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe the question is about the complementary color. So if the emitted light is green, then the color absorbed is magenta, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about absorption but about emission, but the question asks what color is absorbed.

Wait, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Red is longer wavelength (lower energy), about 650 nm. E = 1240 /650 ≈ 1.907 eV.

So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed must be higher energy, so either blue (2.64 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

So which one is correct?

I think that the color absorbed would be the violet because higher energy, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed, which would be green, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is mistaken. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the HOMO-LUMO gap, which is the same as the emitted. So the absorbed photon is green. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait, maybe the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So for example, E_abs = 3.0 eV (violet), and E_emit = 2.3 eV (green). Then, the absorbed is violet.

So the color absorbed would be violet (option B) and emitted is green.

So the answer would be B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the absorbed is blue.

But I think the correct approach is that the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted. So the color absorbed is violet, so option B.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The energy of the emitted light is given as **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm** (calculated using the formula \( \lambda = \frac{1240}{E} \), where \( E \) is in eV). This wavelength falls within the green region of the visible spectrum.

When a molecule absorbs light, it uses the energy to promote an electron from the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) to the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital). The energy of the absorbed photon must match the HOMO-LUMO gap. Upon relaxation, the molecule emits a photon, but the energy of the emitted photon is typically lower than the absorbed photon due to energy losses (e.g., as heat). Therefore, the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

Since the emitted photon corresponds to **2.3393 eV** (green light), the absorbed photon must have higher energy, corresponding to a shorter wavelength. Among the options provided:

- **Red (650 nm)**: Lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.
- **Violet (400–450 nm)**: Higher energy than green, corresponding to **3.1–2.76 eV**.
- **Blue (450–495 nm)**: Higher energy than green, corresponding to **2.76–2.5 eV**.
- **Yellow (570–590 nm)**: Lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.

Both violet and blue have higher energy than green, but violet corresponds to a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than blue. Therefore, the absorbed light is most likely **violet**.

Answer: B
