Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm. I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's β1 to β4, but the order is a bit mixed because β3 is the highest. Wait, no, the order is just given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Interesting, so β3 is the largest, followed by β2, then β1, and β4 is next, wait no, 16 is less than 40 and 9? Wait, no, β1 is 9, β2 is 40, so β3 is 63, β4 is 16. So the order of stability is β3 > β2 > β1 > β4. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ions, then two, then one, then four? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number of ligands isn't directly given. Wait, I think the subscript in β usually refers to the number of ligands attached. So β1 would be the complex with one SCN-, β2 with two, β3 with three, β4 with four. So the complex with three SCN- is the most stable, then two, then one, and four is less? Wait, no, β3 is 63, which is higher than β2 (40), so that's the most stable. So the complexes are Co(SCN)n^2+ where n is 1,2,3,4.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, blue dithiocyanato... dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ions. So that would be the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ complex, right? So we need to find the percentage of this species compared to all cobalt species.

So the approach I think is to calculate the distribution of each complex based on their stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. But how?

I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the log of the formation constants and the concentrations. The formula for the fraction f_n of the complex with n SCN- is f_n = (β_n * [Co] * [SCN]^n) / (sum over all m of β_m * [Co] * [SCN]^m )

Wait, [Co] is the concentration of the metal ion, which is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So let's set up the terms.

Each term in the denominator is β_m * [Co] * [SCN]^m for m=1,2,3,4.

Wait, but wait, isn't the general formula for the fraction f_n = (β_n [M][L]^n) / (sum from k=0 to n of β_k [M][L]^k + [M][L]^(n+1)β_{n+1} etc. ? Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, no, for each complex species, the fraction is given by f_n = (β_n [Co][SCN]^n) / K_total, where K_total is the sum of all β_m [Co][SCN]^m for m=0 to 4.

Wait, but wait, [Co] is the free ion concentration, which is 1e-2 M. Hmm, but this is getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)2]^2+, etc. So c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^2+ + [Co(SCN)2]^2+ + ... up to [Co(SCN)4]^2+.

But using the stability constants, each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN-].

So for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So the total [Co] is [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ = [Co^2+] + sum β_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

Factor out [Co^2+], so:

[Co]_total = [Co^2+] (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN]^n )

But [Co]_total is given as 1e-2 M. So [Co^2+] = [Co]_total / (1 + sum β_n [SCN]^n )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can calculate the concentration of each complex.

But what we need is the fraction of each complex.

Alternatively, the fraction f_n of each complex is:

f_n = [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ / [Co]_total = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n ) / [Co]_total.

Substituting [Co^2+] from earlier:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n ) / [Co]_total
= (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n ) / ( [Co^2+] (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 β_m [SCN]^m ) ) )
= (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 β_m [SCN]^m )

So the fractions depend only on the β values and [SCN-].

So for each n, compute (β_n [SCN]^n ) and sum all terms (including 1 for n=0, which is the Co^2+ ion). Wait wait, the denominator should include all possible complexes plus the free ion. So the denominator is 1 (n=0, Co^2+) plus sum_{m=1 to 4} β_m [SCN]^m.

Wait, but according to the expression I have:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0}^4 a_m ), where a_0 =1, a_m=β_m [SCN]^m for m>=1.

So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So let's compute each term:

Given [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each a_m:

a_0 =1
a_1 = β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1 =0.9
a_2 = β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4
a_3=β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063
a_4=β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum all a_m: 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = let's compute:

1 +0.9 =1.9; 1.9 +0.4=2.3; 2.3+.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Now, the numerator for each f_n is βn [SCN]^n.

We are interested in f_2, which is the fraction of [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

So numerator for f_2 is a_2 =0.4.

So f_2 =0.4 / 2.3646 = let's calculate that.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1691, which is approximately 16.91%.

Wait, but wait, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So that's about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Compute each a_m again:

a_0=1
a_1=9 *0.1=0.9
a_2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4
a_3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063
a_4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9, 1.9+0.4=2.3, +0.063=2.363, +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is correct.

f_2= a_2 / sum =0.4 /2.3646.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Let me compute that:

2.3646 * 0.169 = approx 0.4? Let's see:

2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 2.3646 *0.17= approx 0.401982.

So 0.169 is approximately 0.4 /2.3646.

So 0.169, which is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, is the question asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ complex. So yes, f_2 is the fraction, which is about 16.9%, so option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the given concentrations: [Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt complex is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
\]

Here, \(a_m = \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m\) for \(m = 1, 2, 3, 4\), and \(a_0 = 1\) represents the free cobalt ion. The denominator is the sum of all \(a_m\), and the numerator corresponds to the complex of interest.

### Step 1: Compute \(a_m\) for each species
- \(a_0 = 1\)
- \(a_1 = \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \(a_2 = \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4\)
- \(a_3 = \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063\)
- \(a_4 = \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016\)

### Step 2: Compute the denominator
\[
\text{Denominator} = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 3: Compute the numerator for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺
The numerator for \(f_2\) is \(a_2 = 0.4\).

### Step 4: Compute \(f_2\)
\[
f_2 = \frac{a_2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1691
\]

### Step 5: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.91\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.
