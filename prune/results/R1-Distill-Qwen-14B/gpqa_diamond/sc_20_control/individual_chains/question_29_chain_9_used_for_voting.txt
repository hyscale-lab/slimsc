Okay, I'm trying to solve this genetics question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found some mutations in the first exon area.

The question is asking which mutation would most probably eliminate the compound. The options are Mutants 1-4, and the choices are A to D.

First, I need to understand what each mutation looks like. Let's look at the sequences provided for each mutant and the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene:
The first part differs. The intact is ATGTTTCTCGCT..., mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCT...

Wait, let's break it down.

Intact: positions 1-20:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, looking at the first exon, let's find where the changes are. Maybe the first few codons are altered.

I think the key is to look for nonsense mutations or missense mutations that could disrupt the gene function.

Nonsense mutations cause a premature stop codon, which would truncate the protein. Missense changes an amino acid, possibly disrupting function if it's a critical residue.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Let's see the changes. The sequence changes from TTTCTCGCT to TTC TACGCT.

Wait, let's write the DNA sequences for the first part.

Intact: ...TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant1: ...TTC TAC GCT...

So, the first triplet in the intact is TTT (which is Phe), and in mutant1, it's TTC (also Phe, same amino acid). Then, the next part: CTC in intact becomes TAC.

CTC is Leu (Leucine), TAC is Tyr. So that's a missense mutation at that codon. So, the second codon changes from Leu to Tyr. So, an amino acid change, but perhaps not a frameshift or stop.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact:
The first part is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

Intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT...
So, the first triplet in intact is TTT, which is Phe. In mutant2, TTC (still Phe). Then, the next in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant2 it's TAA. Wait, TAA is a stop codon (Tyr is TAC, TAA is stop). So, the second codon in the gene would be a stop. Because the gene starts with ATG (start), then TTT becomes TTC. Then, the next codon: CTC (Leu) becomes TAA, which is a stop.

So, the gene would have a premature stop at the second codon. That would make a truncated protein. So, this is a nonsense mutation, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

That's a strong candidate for eliminating the compound because the protein is not made.

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Wait, the beginning is ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

So, first triplet same (ATG). Second triplet: TTT in intact is Phe. In mutant3, it's TTT? Wait, wait, let me look again.

Wait, the intact gene's first exons are 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3's sequence:

5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, the first triplet is same (ATG). The second is TTT (same as intact). The third triplet in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant3 it's TAC (Tyr). So, the third codon changes from Leu to Tyr. Then, the fourth triplet in intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant3, it's GCT (Ala) same? Wait, no: Wait, the fourth triplet in intact is GCT, and in mutant3, it's GCT as well? Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, the intact gene's exons are:

Exon 1: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3's exon 1 starts with ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, the third codon of the gene (third exon?) is changing. Alternatively, maybe in the same exon.

Hmm, but the third codon in the gene's first part is CTC (Leu) in the intact, and in mutant3, it's TAC, which would be Tyr. So, another missense mutation. Not a stop, so the protein is still produced but with a different amino acid.

Mutant4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Wait, the beginning is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...

So, the first two codons (ATG and TTT) are same. Third codon: intact is CTC (Leu), mutant4 is TAC (Tyr). Fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, two changes here: third from Leu to Tyr, fourth from Ala to Thr. So, again, missense mutations. No stop codon.

So, looking for which mutations cause a stop.

Mutant 2 has a TAA in the second codon. TAA is a stop codon. So, in the mutated gene, the second codon is TAA. So, the reading frame would stop at that point.

If the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting it (by creating a stop) would likely result in the compound not being made.

So, the correct answer would be Mutant 2, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check. The question is about which mutation would eliminate the compound. A premature stop codon would likely cause a nonfunctional protein. So, if the gene is for synthesizing the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting it would prevent the compound's synthesis.

So, Mutant 2 has a stop codon early on. So, option A is Mutant 2.

Alternatively, I should also consider if any of the mutations cause a frameshift. But looking at the sequences, the lengths seem the same. So, no insertions or deletions that would cause frameshifts. It's substitution mutations only.

So, Mutant 2's mutation introduces a stop codon, which would likely eliminate the compound.

To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the provided sequences of the intact gene and the mutants. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or significantly altering the protein product (missense mutation).

### Intact Gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

### Mutant Analysis:
1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
   - Comparison:
     - First codon: TTT → TTC (Phe → Phe, no change).
     - Second codon: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr, missense mutation).
   - No premature stop codon, so the protein is likely produced but with an altered amino acid.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
   - Comparison:
     - First codon: TTT → TTC (Phe → Phe, no change).
     - Second codon: CTC → TAA (Leu → Stop codon).
   - The introduction of a premature stop codon (TAA) at the second codon truncates the protein, likely rendering it nonfunctional.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
   - Comparison:
     - First codon: TTT → TTT (no change).
     - Second codon: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr, missense mutation).
     - Third codon: GCT → GTC (Ala → Val, missense mutation).
   - Multiple missense mutations, but no premature stop codon.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
   - Comparison:
     - First codon: TTT → TTT (no change).
     - Second codon: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr, missense mutation).
     - Third codon: GCT → ACT (Ala → Thr, missense mutation).
   - Multiple missense mutations, but no premature stop codon.

### Conclusion:
Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) at the second codon, which truncates the protein and likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound. None of the other mutants introduce a stop codon, so they are less likely to completely eliminate the compound.

So, first triplet same (ATG). Second triplet: TTT in intact is Phe. In mutant3, it's TTT? Wait, wait, let me look again.

Wait, the intact gene's first exons are 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3's sequence:

So, the first triplet is same (ATG). The second is TTT (same as intact). The third triplet in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant3 it's TAC (Tyr). So, the third codon changes from Leu to Tyr.

Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, the intact gene's exons are:

Exon 1: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3's exon 1 starts with ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, the third codon of the gene (third exon?) is changing. Alternatively, maybe in the same exon.

Hmm, but the third codon in the gene's first part is CTC (Leu) in the intact, and in mutant3, it's TAC, which would be Tyr. So, another missense mutation. Not a stop, so the protein is still produced but with a different amino acid.

Mutant4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Wait, the beginning is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...

So, the first two codons (ATG and TTT) are same. Third codon: intact is CTC (Leu), mutant4 is TAC (Tyr). Fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, two changes here: third from Leu to Tyr, fourth from Ala to Thr. So, again, missense mutations. No stop codon.

So, looking for which mutations cause a stop.

But wait, let me double-check. The question is about which mutation would eliminate the compound. A premature stop codon would likely cause a nonfunctional protein. So, if the gene is for synthesizing the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting it would prevent the compound's synthesis.
