Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over (parallax to the fifth power). And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, with various exponents.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So the formula is parallax (π) = 1/distance (d), so d = 1/π. That's the basic relationship.

But this question is about how the number of stars varies with parallax. It says the number varies as 1/π^5. So N ∝ 1/π^5. Wait, but we want to relate this to distance, not parallax. Since π is inversely proportional to d, I can write π = 1/d. Substituting that into the equation, N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that.

So (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Oh wait, but wait, N is the number of stars, so as distance increases, the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power? But wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the question says how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range, like, what's the dependence on r, where r is the distance.

Wait, the number of stars varies as 1/π^5. Since π is 1/d, so 1/π^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So if you have a small change in distance, dr, how does the number of stars change? Or perhaps it's about the number density, like stars per unit volume or something.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it this way. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/π^5. Since π = 1/d, substitute that in. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, d is the distance. So N increases as d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance per unit range. So per unit increase in distance, like, for each parsec further you go, how does the number change.

Wait, but wait. The number of stars varies as d^5, so the number itself is proportional to d^5. But the question is about the change per unit distance, so that would be the derivative. So derivative of N with respect to d. Because how many more stars are there when you go a little further.

Wait, let me get back. N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. So dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the change in N per unit change in d is proportional to d^4. But wait, the options are in terms of r, which I think is the same as d here. So the change would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the options don't have r^4 as a first choice. Let me check the options again. Option C is ~ r^4. So is that the answer? Or wait, did I get the direction right?

Wait wait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Because if the number of stars N is proportional to 1/π^5, and π is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases. But when you move to a higher distance, the number of stars you see in a region increases, which seems a bit counterintuitive because stars are farther away, but maybe because the volume they're spread over increases. Wait, but I think the question is about the number density, but the way the question is phrased, I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says "the number of stars in that region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So maybe it's N ∝ 1/π^5. But since π = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars in that region (wait, region of the sky—so perhaps a fixed solid angle?) So as you look further (higher d), you can see more stars because the volume increases, but the number in a given solid angle may also depend on their distribution.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach. Let’s think about stellar density. The number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. But the number per unit volume might be a constant, so the total number would scale with volume. But what's the volume as a function of distance?

Wait, if we're considering a spherical volume at a distance d, but wait, no, because when you look into the sky (a certain region), the volume you're considering is a sort of cone, with height up to distance d, and a certain solid angle. So the volume element would be something like 4π (solid angle) * d^2 * dr, but perhaps for a fixed solid angle, it's a thin shell with area A and thickness dr. So the volume is A * dr * (d^2) ?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. Let me think again. The number of stars in a small volume element is the stellar density (stars per volume) multiplied by the volume. So if the stellar density is constant, then the number of stars N ∝ volume.

But the volume as a function of distance. Suppose you have a certain solid angle Ω. The volume up to distance r is approximately (4/3)π r^3 Ω. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, the volume of a spherical shell between r and r+dr is 4π r² dr. So if you're considering a small shell at radius r, the volume is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be (stellar density) * (4π r² dr).

But in this question, the number of stars in a region varies as 1/π^5. So perhaps the way it's being considered is not a volume but a flux or something else. Alternatively, maybe the number of stars observed in a given area (on the sky) and within a certain distance range.

Wait, but according to the problem, N ∝ 1/π^5. Since π = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars in that region as a function of d is N(d) = k d^5. Now, the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit distance. So that would be dN/dr, the derivative.

So dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So when distance increases, the change per unit distance is r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~r^4. So the answer should be C.

To determine how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, we start with the given relationship: the number of stars \( N \) varies with parallax \( \pi \) as \( N \propto 1/\pi^5 \). Since parallax \( \pi \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \) (\( \pi = 1/d \)), we substitute \( \pi = 1/d \) into the equation to express \( N \) in terms of \( d \). 

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\pi^5} = \frac{1}{(1/d)^5} = d^5
\]

Thus, \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4
\]

This shows that the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^4 \). Since \( d \) represents distance, the change is proportional to \( r^4 \), where \( r \) is the distance.

From the given options:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \)**: Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \)**: Correct, as the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^2 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
