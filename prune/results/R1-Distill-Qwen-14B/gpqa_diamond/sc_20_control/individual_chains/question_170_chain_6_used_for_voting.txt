Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. I remember that spin states are usually represented as column vectors in a two-component form, like (up, down) or something. So maybe (3i, 4) is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second 4. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the spin state can be written as a two-element vector where each element corresponds to the amplitude of spin-up and spin-down states, respectively.

The question is asking for the expectation value of S_y. I know that the expectation value of an operator is given by the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the state vector again. So <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix.

Wait, right, the Pauli matrices. The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So I need to compute this matrix multiplied by the state vector, then take the conjugate transpose of the state vector and multiply that in.

Let me write down the state vector ψ. It's (3i,4) as a column vector. So ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

First, I should compute σ_y ψ. Let me do that matrix multiplication. The σ_y matrix is 2x2, and ψ is 2x1, so the product will be another 2x1 vector.

Calculating each component:

First element of σ_y ψ: (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.
Second element: (i)*(3i) + (0)*(4) = 3i^2 + 0. Oh wait, i^2 is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So the second element is -3.

So σ_y ψ = [-4i, -3]^T.

Next, I need to compute ψ†, which is the conjugate transpose of ψ. The original ψ is [3i, 4], so the conjugate would change 3i to -3i. So ψ† is [-3i, 4].

Now, multiply ψ† with σ_y ψ. That's a 1x2 vector times a 2x1 vector, resulting in a scalar.

So (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = ?

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2. i^2 is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but wait a second. The expectation value for spin is given in terms of ħ. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±ħ/2. So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. Because S = (ħ/2) σ for each component.

So the expectation value <S_y> is (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of σ_y.

In my calculation, I found that <σ_y> is -24/(something?), wait no, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. The calculation I did was for ψ† σ_y ψ, which gives the expectation value of σ_y, which is a dimensionless quantity. But the actual spin operator is S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. Therefore, the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by the result I just got.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check:

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, and when you compute <σ_y>, you get a number. The spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so <S_y> is (ħ/2) * <σ_y>.

Wait, but in my calculation, I found <σ_y> as a scalar. Wait no. Wait no, I think I messed up the dimensions. Let me recast this.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me be precise.

The state is ψ = [3i; 4]. The operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value is <ψ| S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) <ψ| σ_y |ψ>.

So I computed <σ_y> as -24/(something?), wait, no, hold on. Wait, in my initial calculation, I computed ψ† σ_y ψ. Let me compute that.

Wait, ψ is [3i;4], so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

σ_y ψ = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + 0(4) ].

Which is [ -4i, 3i² ].

3i² is 3*(-1) = -3. So σ_y ψ = [ -4i, -3 ].

Now ψ† times σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

Which is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = ?

Calculating each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24.

Wait, but that can't be right because σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, so its trace is zero, and the maximum eigenvalue is 1. So how can the expectation value be -24? That doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a second, no. Oh wait, no, because the state ψ is not normalized. Oh! Right! Because the state vector ψ may not have a norm of 1. So I need to normalize it first, or account for that in the calculation.

Ah, I see. So the expectation value also depends on the normalization of the state. So I should compute the expectation value as (ψ† σ_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ).

Wait, but wait, in my calculation above, I found ψ† σ_y ψ = -24. But that's without normalization. So what's ψ† ψ?

ψ is [3i;4], so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

ψ† ψ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = (-9i^2) + 16 = (-9*(-1)) +16 = 9 + 16 =25.

So ψ is not normalized; its norm is sqrt(25)=5. So to get the expectation value properly, I need to compute (ψ† σ_y ψ)/(ψ† ψ).

Wait, but wait, in the calculation before, ψ† σ_y ψ was -24. So the expectation value is -24 / 25. But wait, no, because the actual operator is (ħ/2)σ_y. So the expectation value would be (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ħ)/(2*25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Wait, but let me make sure I got the normalization correctly.

The expectation value is <S_y> = [ψ† (σ_y) ψ]/[ψ† ψ] * (ħ/2).

Because S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So yeah, the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by (-24/25).

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ /25. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't mess up any signs or calculations.

1. ψ is [3i, 4]^T.

2. ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

3. σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]].

4. σ_y ψ: first component (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i. Second component (i)(3i) + 0(4) = 3i² = -3. So σ_y ψ = [ -4i, -3 ].

5. ψ† σ_y ψ: (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = (12 i²) + (-12) = 12*(-1) -12 = -12-12 = -24.

6. ψ† ψ: (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = (-9 i²) +16 = 9 +16 =25.

7. So expectation of σ_y is -24/25.

8. Expectation of S_y is (ħ/2)* (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

So the correct answer is A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli y-matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle.
   \]
   Here, \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \) is the expectation value of \( \sigma_y \), which can be computed as \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \).

3. **State Vector**: The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Its conjugate transpose is:
   \[
   \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Matrix Multiplication**: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Inner Product**: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \):
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Breaking this into components:
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i^2 + (-12) = 12(-1) - 12 = -24.
   \]

6. **Normalization**: The norm of the state \( \psi \) is:
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi} = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

7. **Final Expectation Value**: Substituting into the formula for \( \langle S_y \rangle \):
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{-24}{25} \right) = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

8. **Answer Verification**: Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \text{A) } \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]
