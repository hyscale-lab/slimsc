Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. Wait, relative speed in special relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two velocities, right? Because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity is different.

I remember that the formula for the relative speed u' between two objects moving at speeds u and v (with u being the speed of the second object relative to the first) is given by (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. If object A is moving at u and object B at v in the same direction, the speed of B relative to A would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

So here, both astronauts are moving in the same direction. The first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, the second (3m) at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that numerator and denominator. Numerator is -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7. The negative sign indicates direction; since the second is moving slower in the same direction, it's behind. But the question probably just wants the magnitude, or maybe it's positive because direction was considered. Wait, the options have positive values, so I'll take the magnitude. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now for the total energy. Hmm, in relativity, the total energy of an object is given by gamma times mc². So I need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and add them together.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So each astronaut's energy is their individual rest mass energy multiplied by their respective gamma factors.

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c, v²/c² is 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 is gamma * m_rest * c². But wait, the mass here is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75). sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So 1/0.866 is approximately 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². Hmm, looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and option D has E=5 mc².

So putting it together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that would be the correct answer.

Wait a second, but did I calculate the relative speed correctly? Because the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Oh wait, wait, in the problem, the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. So if I'm calculating the relative speed of the second from the first's frame, it's (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 = -1/7 c ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So yes, v_rel is 0.14c, and the energy is 5.96 mc², which is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, the first astronaut (mass \(2m\)) moves at \(v_1 = 0.6c\), and the second astronaut (mass \(3m\)) moves at \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the problem likely asks for the magnitude. Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (\(2m\), \(v_1 = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (\(3m\), \(v_2 = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, the first astronaut (mass \(2m\)) moves at \(v_1 = 0.6c\), and the second astronaut (mass \(3m\)) moves at \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the problem likely asks for the magnitude. Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[

\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (\(3m\), \(v_2 = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
