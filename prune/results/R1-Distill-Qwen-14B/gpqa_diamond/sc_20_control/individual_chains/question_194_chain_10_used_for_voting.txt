Okay, so I'm trying to solve this partition function problem. Let me think about it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about three spins, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factors, which is exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So Z = sum exp(-β E). But here, each spin can be +1 or -1, so each spin has two possible states.

Wait, but the system has three spins, so the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being +1 or -1.

But maybe I can find a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think. The energy expression is symmetric in all three spins, so perhaps we can find how many states have a particular value of the energy.

Alternatively, maybe express E in terms of the number of pairs that are aligned or anti-aligned. Because each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same, and -1 otherwise. So each term S_i S_j contributes to the energy.

Wait, the energy E is minus J times the sum of S_i S_j for each pair. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

So let me compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each possible state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me denote this sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J S.

Hmm, but I'm not sure what S can be. Maybe I can find the possible values of S.

Each S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. But their sum can vary. Let me think of all possible combinations.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a system where each spin is either up or down, and compute S for each case.

But maybe another approach: think of the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me think about possible values. Let's consider all possible values of S:

Case 1: All spins are the same. Either all +1 or all -1.

If S1 = S2 = S3 = +1, then each product S_i S_j is +1. So S = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Similarly, S1 = S2 = S3 = -1, each product is +1 again. So S=3.

So when all spins are same, S=3.

Case 2: Two spins are same, one different.

Let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1.

Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum is 1-1-1 = -1.

Alternatively, S1= +1, S2= +1, S3= -1: same as above.

What if S1= +1, S2= -1, S3= +1? Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. Similarly, any two same and one different leads to sum S = -1.

But wait, how many states have two same and one different? For each spin, you can choose which one is different.

In three spins, the number of such states is 3 * (number of ways to have two same, one different). Let's see: for each position, we can have one spin different. For each such case, the two others are same. So for each of the three positions, there are two possibilities (the different spin can be +1 or -1, and the others follow), but actually, for each arrangement, it's two times three, because for each of the three positions, you can have the different spin as either +1 or -1.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: for a given state where two are same and one is different, how many states are there.

Let me count all possible states where exactly two spins are same and the third is different.

Each spin can be either +1 or -1. So for each of the 3 positions, you can have the different spin.

For each such position, the different spin can be either +1 or -1, but when you fix two, the third is forced.

Wait, maybe a better way: the total number of such states is 3 (choices for which spin is different) multiplied by 2 (since the different spin can be +1 or -1, while the others are the opposite). Or not? Wait, for example:

Option 1: S3 is different from S1 and S2. So S3 = -S1 (if S1 = S2). So for each of the three positions, the different spin can be either + or -.

Wait, perhaps each of these cases contributes two states. For example, for the case where S3 is different, you can have:

S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1.

Or S1 = S2 = -1, S3 = +1.

So for each of the three positions being the different one, there are two possibilities. So that's 3 * 2 =6 states where exactly two spins are the same and the third is different.

Each of these states has S = -1.

Wait, in the earlier case, when two are same and one different, S was -1. So for each of these 6 states, S = -1.

Case 3: All spins are different. Wait, but with three spins, each being +1 or -1, is that possible? Because there are only two possible values. So three spins can't all be different. Because you have two values, +1 and -1. So for three spins, one must be different from the others.

Wait, no, that's not possible. You can't have three different spins when each spin is either +1 or -1. So the third spin must be the same as one of the others. So in case 3, all spins are not same, but exactly two are same and one different. So all the 8 states are covered in cases 1 and 2.

Wait, let me think again. How many states are there with all spins same? Two: all +1, all -1.

Then, the remaining 6 states are with two same and one different. So that's correct.

So the possible values of S:

In case 1, S =3. There are 2 such states.

In case 2, S=-1. There are 6 such states.

Wait, but wait, let's compute S for the two cases:

Case 1: all same.

Each S_i S_j is 1. So S = 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

Case 2: two same, one different.

Each of the three pairs: two pairs have same spins (so S_i S_j=1), and one pair has different spins (so S_i S_j=-1).

Wait, no. Let me take an example.

S1 = S2 =1, S3=-1.

Then, S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

Sum S =1 -1 -1 = -1.

So yes, each of these states leads to S =-1.

So now, each of the 6 states has S=-1.

So the possible values of E are E = -J * S.

So for case 1, E = -J *3.

For case 2, E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no: E is -J times S, so for S=3: E = -J *3.

For S=-1: E =-J * (-1) = J.

Wait, that's right.

Now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -β E ). For each state, it's exp( -β * E ), which is exp( -β * (-J S) ), because E =-J S. So exp( β J S ).

Wait, because E = - J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J S. So -β E = β J S.

So for each state, the Boltzmann factor is exp( β J S ).

So for the two states where S=3, each contributes exp( 3 β J ).

For the six states where S=-1, each contributes exp( (-1) β J ).

So Z = 2 * exp(3 β J) + 6 * exp( (-1) β J )

Which can be rewritten as 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- J β}.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ) → No, because the first term is 3Jβ negative.

Option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6e^(-Jβ) → Yes, that's what I have.

Option C: 2e^(2 Jβ) +6e^(-2 Jβ) → Doesn't match.

Option D: 6e^{2 Jβ} +2e^{-2 Jβ} → No.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J [S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), and the partition function is defined as \( Z = \sum \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).

### Step 1: Analyze the energy expression
The energy depends on the sum \( S = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). Each term \( S_iS_j \) is \( +1 \) if the spins are aligned and \( -1 \) if they are anti-aligned. Thus, \( S \) can take specific values depending on the spin configuration.

### Step 2: Determine possible values of \( S \)
- **Case 1: All spins are the same**  
  If \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \), all terms \( S_iS_j = +1 \), so \( S = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).  
  There are 2 such states.

- **Case 2: Two spins are the same, one is different**  
  For example, \( S_1 = S_2 = +1 \), \( S_3 = -1 \):  
  \( S_1S_2 = +1 \), \( S_1S_3 = -1 \), \( S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \).  
  Similarly, any configuration with two spins aligned and one anti-aligned gives \( S = -1 \).  
  There are \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) such states (3 choices for the different spin, and 2 possibilities for its value).

### Step 3: Calculate the partition function
The partition function is the sum of Boltzmann factors for all states. For each state, the Boltzmann factor is \( \exp(-\beta E) = \exp(\beta J S) \), since \( E = -J S \).

- For the 2 states with \( S = 3 \):  
  Contribution to \( Z \) is \( 2 \exp(3J\beta) \).

- For the 6 states with \( S = -1 \):  
  Contribution to \( Z \) is \( 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).

Thus, the total partition function is:  
\[
Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta).
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
- **Option A:** \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \)  
  Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.

- **Option B:** \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \)  
  Correct, matches the derived expression.

- **Option C:** \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \)  
  Incorrect, as the exponents do not match the derived values.

- **Option D:** \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \)  
  Incorrect, as both the coefficients and exponents are incorrect.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

Answer: B
