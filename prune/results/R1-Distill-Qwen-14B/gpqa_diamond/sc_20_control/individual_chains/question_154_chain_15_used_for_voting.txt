Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify an unknown compound based on spectral data. Let's see, the question gives me the mass, IR, and 1H NMR data. Hmm, I'll need to go through each piece of data step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100% abundance. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Wait, molecular ion plus two? I remember that in mass spec, a molecular ion plus 2 might suggest something like an isotope. Chlorine has an atomic mass of about 35, but its natural abundance is about 75% for the 35Cl and 25% for 37Cl. So when you have a molecule with a Cl atom, the molecular ion would appear as two peaks: one at m/z (M) and another at M+2. Let me calculate. If the molecular ion is at 156, then M is 156, so the Cl substitution must be present.

Wait, the molecular formula could include Cl. Let me think, what's the molecular weight? 156. If it's a benzoic acid derivative, maybe. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2, which is 122 g/mol. Adding Cl would add about 35.5. Wait, 122 + 35.5 is 157.5, but the molecular ion is 156. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Or perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, looking at the options. Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl would make it C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight: (12*7)+(1*5)+(35.5)+(16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is C8H7ClO2? Let me calculate that: (12*8)+(1*7)+(35.5)+(16*2)= 96 +7 +35.5 +32= 170.5. That's higher than 156. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait another approach: the molecular ion is at 156, and the base peak. The other peak is at 158, which is M+2, so that supports the presence of a Cl atom. So the molecular formula likely includes Cl.

Looking at the IR data: Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a strong absorption, probably O-H stretch. But wait, a broad peak could be either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300. Also, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids usually have their carbonyl around 1700-1725 cm^-1. So that fits with a carboxylic acid group.

Now the 1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) – that's probably the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid. Because in D2O, the O-H would exchange and not show up, but if it's a singlet, maybe it's a strong acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid. The other peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if it's benzoic acid, the protons on the ring would be in a para position relative to the substituent (the COOH group). So, if the substituent is at position 4, the ring protons would be two doublets.

Wait, the options. Let's look at the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and COOH at position 1 (assuming numbering where COOH is 1). So the ring would have two sets of protons. The COOH is at 1, Cl at 4. Then the neighboring protons would be at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH), and 3 and 5 (meta to COOH). Wait, no, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. So the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons: positions 2 and 6, which would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Positions 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Wait, but in the NMR, the peaks are 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So, two doublets, each 2H. That suggests a para-substituted ring with two substituents opposite each other. Wait, but 4-chlorobenzoic acid has two substituents: COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. So the ring would have two pairs: the protons adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded more, maybe appearing downfield at 8.02 ppm, while the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be a bit upfield, maybe around 7.72. So that fits.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have a hydroxyl (phenolic) group, aldehyde, and Cl. The IR would show a broad O-H (phenol), and maybe a carbonyl from the aldehyde, which has a higher wavenumber than a carboxylic acid, around 1710-1740. But the IR here shows a strong peak at 1720, which is in the range for a carboxylic acid. So this option might not fit because it's not a carboxylic acid.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is OCl-CO-O-Ph. Hmm, but that would have an ester group. The IR would have a carbonyl around 1720 (for esters, maybe a bit lower). However, the O-Cl would have a strong peak in IR around 800-850 cm^-1? Or maybe the OCl would be a stretch around 550-650 cm^-1. Not sure. Also, the NMR would have different peaks. The phenyl protons would depend on substitution. But the NMR here shows two doublets, suggesting a para-substituted ring. Phenyl chloroformate would have the chloroformate group attached to the benzene. So the ring would have substituents that could lead to different NMR patterns.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2. So the ring would have substituents in adjacent positions. The aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. But then the substitution would lead to more complex splitting, perhaps a doublet of doublets or a triplet. But in the NMR, we have two doublets. So, for D, the substituents are adjacent. The protons would be in two sets: those next to COOH (position 3 and 5) and next to Cl (position 4 and 6). Wait, or maybe it's a para-substituted situation? No, it's ortho substitution. So, the ring protons might be more complex than two doublets.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's a classic pattern for a para-substituted ring with two substituents, or perhaps a meta substitution but with equivalent protons. Alternatively, it's a benzene ring with a substituent in one position and another group in para. Wait, but benzoic acid has COOH in position 1. If Cl is in position 4 (para to COOH), then the ring has substituents at 1 and 4. So the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 (meta to COOH, ortho to Cl) would be another set. That would give two doublets, which matches the NMR.

So, in option B, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's see, the NMR would have two doublets. The protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded more, so appear downfield. The protons ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be a bit upfield. So their chemical shifts would be different, which matches the 8.02 and 7.72 ppm.

Mass spectrum: The molecular ion at 156. Let me compute the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula is C7H5ClO2. Carbon is 12*7=84, H is 5=5, Cl is 35.5, O is 16*2=32. So total is 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156, which is an integer. Hmmm, 156.5 rounds up, but perhaps the instrument is showing M+ as 156. Alternatively, maybe the formula is C8H7ClO2? Wait, that would be 12*8=96, H=7=7, Cl=35.5, O=32. 96+7=103; 103+35.5=138.5; 138.5+32=170.5, which is higher than 156. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C6H5ClO2? Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl would make it C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Maybe it's M+1? No, M is at 156, and the isotopic peak is at 158. Wait, the M peak is at 156, and the M+2 is 158, which is consistent with the presence of Cl. So 156 is the molecular ion, which would correspond to the formula with Cl. So perhaps the formula is C7H5ClO2, which is 156.5, but maybe in the mass spec, it's rounded to 156 as the molecular ion. Alternatively, perhaps it's the exact mass. Let me calculate exact mass: 7 carbons would be 7*12=84, 5 H:5*1=5, Cl:34.97 (approx 35), O:32. So 84 +5 +34.97 +32= 155.97, which is ~156. So M is at 156.

So the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. That fits option B.

Another point: In the mass spec, the base peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and the 158 is 32%. The 158 would correspond to the M+2 peak, which is due to the Cl isotope (37Cl). So the ratio should be about 3:1 (since Cl has ~75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl). So the M peak would be (35Cl present) and M+2 would be (37Cl present). The abundance of M is 100%, and M+2 is 32%. The natural abundance of 37Cl is 24.1%, so the ratio M+2 / M should be approximately (0.241)/(0.759) ≈ 0.318, or 31.8%. The data gives M+2 as 32%, which matches. So that's a good sign.

Putting it all together: IR indicates a carboxylic acid (broad O-H, strong C=O). NMR shows a para-substituted benzoic acid, as seen in the two doublets. The molecular weight and mass spec support a Cl in the structure. So the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Here's the analysis:

### Mass Spectrometry
- The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156** (100%), and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) is observed.  
- The **M+2 peak** at 158 suggests the presence of a chlorine atom (Cl), as chlorine has two isotopes: 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). The ratio of M to M+2 (100% to 32%) matches the natural abundance of these isotopes.  
- The molecular formula is likely **C7H5ClO2**, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5. This aligns with the molecular ion peak at 156.

### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy
- A **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.  
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.  

### Proton NMR
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: This is characteristic of the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid.  
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggest a **para-substituted aromatic ring**. This is consistent with a benzoic acid derivative where the substituents are at the 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl) positions.

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound contains a phenolic O-H group and an aldehyde. The IR would show a carbonyl peak for the aldehyde (higher than 1720 cm⁻¹), but the given IR data is more consistent with a carboxylic acid.  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - The structure has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 4.  
   - The IR data matches the carboxylic acid functional groups.  
   - The NMR data is consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring, as the two doublets (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm) correspond to the aromatic protons ortho to COOH and ortho to Cl, respectively.  
   - The molecular weight and mass spectrometry data also align with this structure.  
   - **Matches all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - This compound contains an ester group (OCl-CO-O-Ph). The IR would show a carbonyl peak around 1720 cm⁻¹, but the O-Cl stretch would appear around 800-850 cm⁻¹, which is not observed in the given IR data.  
   - The NMR pattern would differ due to the presence of the ester group and the substitution pattern on the benzene ring.  
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 2.  
   - The aromatic protons would not produce two simple doublets in the NMR due to the adjacent substituents, leading to more complex splitting patterns.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion
The spectral data (mass, IR, and NMR) are consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.  

**Answer: B**
