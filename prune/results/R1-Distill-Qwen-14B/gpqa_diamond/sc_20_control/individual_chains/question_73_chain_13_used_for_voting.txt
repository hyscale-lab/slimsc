Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics because the rules change. Right, we need to use special relativity here.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I'll tackle the relative speed. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. So if one astronaut is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, their relative speed isn't simply 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of c, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, let me think about that again. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the slower one from the faster one's perspective would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Or wait, is it the other way around? Because if I'm in the faster astronaut's frame, the slower one would approach at a certain speed.

Wait, no, let me get the formula correct. The velocity of object 2 as seen from object 1's frame is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, no, that's when they're moving towards each other. Wait, no, velocity addition formula is for when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So, if frame S is the rest frame, and frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S, then the velocity v' of an object in S' is given by (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). 

In this problem, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, because in the problem, the question is about the relative speed of the two astronauts. So, considering astronaut A as the observer (since he's moving at 0.6c), the speed of astronaut B relative to A is (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/c²). Wait, but vB is slower than vA, so vB - vA is negative. But wait, relative speed is a positive quantity, so perhaps I should take the absolute value.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it properly. Let me define v1 as 0.6c (the speed of the first astronaut as observed in the rest frame), and v2 as 0.5c (the speed of the second astronaut in the rest frame). The relative speed from the first astronaut's frame would be the speed of the second astronaut in that frame. So using the velocity addition formula:

v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait no, in the frame of the first astronaut, the second astronaut's speed would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²))).

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think of it differently. Suppose we have two objects, A and B, moving in the same direction in the lab frame. From A's frame, what is the speed of B?

The formula for the relative velocity u' when you are moving at speed u relative to the lab frame is:

u' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)).

In this case, in the lab frame, B is moving at v = 0.5c, and A is moving at u = 0.6c. So from A's perspective, what speed does B have? So substituting, u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is ( -0.1c ). The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) ) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1 c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857 c. The negative sign indicates direction. But since we're talking about speed, the magnitude is 0.142857 c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait, but wait another moment. Alternatively, if I consider the other way around, the relative speed from B's perspective. But the question asks for the relative speed between them, which is a scalar. So regardless of the perspective, it's the same. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Wait, but let's compute more accurately. 0.1 / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857, which is about 0.1428c, so 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So the first part of the answer should be v_rel =0.14c. Which leaves options C and D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The energy E of an object is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 =3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Adding them together, E_total = 2.5 m c² + 3.4641 m c² ≈ 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc².

So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C (5.96 mc²) and option C has v_rel=0.14c. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of E2. Gamma for 0.5c is 1.1547 approximately. So 3m * 1.1547 c² is indeed 3.464 m c². Then E1 is 2.5 m c². Sum is 5.964 m c², which is close to 5.96 mc².

So putting it all together, the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is ~5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (the faster astronaut) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (the slower astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but since we are interested in the magnitude of the relative speed:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of an object is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\), speed = \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = 2m \cdot 1.25c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### Energy of the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\), speed = \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = 3m \cdot 1.1547c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- Relative speed: \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\)
- Total energy: \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2\)

These values match **Option C**, which states \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and \(E = 5.96mc^2\).

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think of it differently. Suppose we have two objects, A and B, moving in the same direction in the lab frame. From A's frame, what is the speed of B?

The formula for the relative velocity u' when you are moving at speed u relative to the lab frame is:

u' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)).

In this case, in the lab frame, B is moving at v = 0.5c, and A is moving at u = 0.6c. So from A's perspective, what speed does B have? So substituting, u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is ( -0.1c ). The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) ) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1 c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857 c. The negative sign indicates direction. But since we're talking about speed, the magnitude is 0.142857 c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait, but wait another moment. Alternatively, if I consider the other way around, the relative speed from B's perspective. But the question asks for the relative speed between them, which is a scalar. So regardless of the perspective, it's the same. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 =3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Adding them together, E_total = 2.5 m c² + 3.4641 m c² ≈ 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc².

So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C (5.96 mc²) and option C has v_rel=0.14c. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of E2. Gamma for 0.5c is 1.1547 approximately. So 3m * 1.1547 c² is indeed 3.464 m c². Then E1 is 2.5 m c². Sum is 5.964 m c², which is close to 5.96 mc².
