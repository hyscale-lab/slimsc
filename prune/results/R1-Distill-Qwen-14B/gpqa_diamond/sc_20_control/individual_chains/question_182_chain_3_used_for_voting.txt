Okay, so I need to figure out which statement about the Mott-Gurney equation is correct. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices, specifically in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. 

Let me think. The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V^2)/(L^3). I remember that this equation comes into play when the current is limited by the space charge effect, which happens in certain conditions, like when the voltage is high enough that the accumulation of charge in the device's vicinity affects the electric field.

So, the equation's validity depends on the conditions of the device. The options are A to D, each describing different conditions.

Option A says it's for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, Ohmic contact implies that the electron injection is efficient, right? Also, if drift current is negligible, that might not fit because I thought the Mott-Gurney equation includes the drift component. Or wait, no, because in SCLC, the current is mainly due to the space charge, so maybe other currents are negligible.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barriers, and negligible diffusion current. No injection barriers would mean it's an Ohmic contact, perhaps. And if diffusion current is negligible, that might be a condition for the Mott-Gurney derivation. Wait, in the derivation, is it based on drift current being dominant?

Option C: Single-carrier with Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. Schottky contact implies a barrier for carriers, but I'm not sure how that affects the Mott-Gurney equation. Maybe the equation assumes that carriers can be injected without much barrier, so Ohmic is more likely.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion. Mott-Gurney is usually for single-carrier devices, right? Because when you have both electrons and holes, the expressions might be different. So D might not be correct.

Back to the Mott-Gurney equation conditions. The derivation, I think, assumes a single type of carrier (like only electrons or only holes) and that the contact is Ohmic (so no barriers). Also, in the SCLC region, the space charge is such that the electric field is modified by the charge accumulation, so the current is due to the drift of carriers under this varying field.

The equation is derived under the assumption that the space charge is so dominant that the electric field is altered, leading to a quadratic dependence on voltage. Also, it's typically for a single-carrier device because if you have both electrons and holes, the behavior might be more complex, perhaps leading to a Child-Langmuir current instead, or a different equation.

So for the Mott-Gurney equation to hold, the device should have a single carrier type, the contacts should be such that injection is efficient (like Ohmic), and that the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. Wait, or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. In the SCLC region, the current is limited by the space charge, which is due to the carriers being injected. So the condition is that the injection is efficient, so the contacts are Ohmic (no barriers that would cause incomplete injection). So that supports options A and B.

Now, the equation includes terms like mobility (μ) and permittivity (ε), which are part of the drift current expression. So if the equation already includes those terms, it's because the drift is the main component, and diffusion might be considered negligible, or perhaps the equation assumes steady-state drift.

Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation comes from integrating the space-charge limited current scenario. The derivation involves the assumption that the space charge creates a potential barrier, and the current is determined by the drift of carriers over this barrier. So in that case, drift is the main factor. So diffusion currents would be negligible, perhaps.

Looking at the options:

Option B says no carrier injection barriers (so Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. So that aligns with the condition for Mott-Gurney.

Option A says negligible drift current. But if drift is the main current, then A would not make sense because it says drift is negligible. So that can't be correct.

So between B and C. Option C has a Schottky contact. Schottky contacts have a barrier for carrier injection, which would require overcoming the barrier via tunneling or thermionic emission. But if the contact is Schottky, then the injection is not Ohmic, so the Mott-Gurney equation might not apply because it assumes that the carriers are being injected without much barrier. Therefore, option C is probably incorrect.

So the correct statement should be option B: trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic) and negligible diffusion current.

The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation, \( J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3} \), is derived under specific assumptions about the device conditions. These include a single-carrier type (electron or hole), efficient carrier injection (Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current, as the current is dominated by drift under the influence of the space charge.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation assumes drift current is the dominant mechanism, not negligible.

- **Option B**: States that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is derived, as it assumes efficient injection and negligible diffusion.

- **Option C**: States that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. This is incorrect because a Schottky contact introduces a barrier to carrier injection, which contradicts the assumption of efficient injection in the Mott-Gurney derivation.

- **Option D**: States that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation is typically derived for single-carrier devices, not two-carrier systems.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option B**, as it accurately reflects the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation: a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current.
