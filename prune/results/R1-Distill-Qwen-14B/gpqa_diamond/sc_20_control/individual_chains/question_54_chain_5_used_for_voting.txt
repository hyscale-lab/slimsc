Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, ring-closing metathesis is a reaction where two alkenes undergo a redistribution of their substituents, right? The catalyst involved is usually something like Grubbs catalyst. The main thing that happens is the formation of a ring by connecting the two ends of a diene.

The question is asking about the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via this method. Let me think about what the structure of the product looks like. The product is a cyclohexene, so a six-membered ring with a double bond, and substituents at positions 3,4 (two methyl groups) and 5 (an isopropyl group).

So, in ring-closing metathesis, we'll have a diene that will form the ring. The idea is that two alkenes (from the same molecule, since it's ring-closing) will swap partners, leading to a ring formation. The diene will have two double bonds? Or wait, no, wait. No, wait. Ring-closing metathesis typically uses an olefin, perhaps with substituents on either end, so that when the metathesis occurs, the ends come together to form a ring.

Wait, wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The product is a cyclohexene, which has a ring of six members with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 3,4, and 5. So the numbering goes 1 (double bond starts here), 2 (maybe a CH2), 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (isopropyl), and 6 would be CH2 perhaps. So the ring is six-membered, with substituents at 3,4,5.

The starting material for ring-closing metathesis would be a diene, right? So when the metathesis happens, two double bonds in the diene would reorganize, forming a ring. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ring-closing metathesis usually starts with a diene, but perhaps it's a mono-alkene with substituents on each end that, when the metathesis occurs, the ends connect to form a ring.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to think that the starting material is a dialkene, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of substituents on each end of a diene to form a ring. The general setup is that each end of the diene has substituents that will become attached to the other end. So, for example, if you have a molecule with two double bonds (but wait, that's not possible unless it's conjugated?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diene where the ends can undergo metathesis to form a ring. Wait, maybe the starting molecule is a diene with substituents at each end that will cyclize when the metathesis occurs.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a molecule that has two double bonds, or perhaps a diene that will form a ring upon metathesis. Alternatively, perhaps it's a molecule with two alkenes, but in a way that the ends can come together to form a ring. Let me think about the product structure. The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

So the cyclohexene has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. The substituents are at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So positions 1 and 2 are the double bond. Then, positions 3 and 4 each have methyl groups, and position 5 has an isopropyl.

So the ring is six-membered. Now, the starting material must have a structure that, when the metathesis happens, forms this ring. Let me consider how.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst (like Grubbs) facilitates the breaking and reforming of the double bonds. So, the starting material is likely a diene where the two double bonds (or perhaps one double bond with substituents) are positioned such that upon metathesis, the ends connect to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene, and the metathesis forms a six-membered ring. So, the starting material has two double bonds, perhaps at positions 1 and 7 (octa-1,7-diene) or something like that.

Wait, let's consider the options. The options are four different octadienes.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So, the product is a cyclohexene. So the starting material must have substituents that, when the ends are connected, form the substituents in the cyclohexene.

Let me imagine the starting material as an octadiene. The idea is that the two ends (from the double bonds) will undergo metathesis to form the ring. So, perhaps the diene is such that when the two ends are joined, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Let's take option A: octa-1,7-diene. So positions 1 and 2 are a double bond, and positions 7 and 8 are another double bond. The substituents are at 3 and 4 (methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl).

Wait, so during metathesis, the two double bonds (1-2 and 7-8) would undergo a process where the ends are swapped. So the ends at 1 and 8 would come together, and the ends at 2 and 7 would also come together. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each end will determine where the ring forms.

Wait, another approach: in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst will break both double bonds. So each end of the molecule will swap partners, leading to a new ring.

So, for example, if the starting material is a diene, and each end has substituents, then the ring will form when the substituents are connected.

Wait, maybe the structure would look like this: the starting material is a molecule where positions 1 and 2 are a double bond, and positions 7 and 8 are another double bond. So, positions 1,2 and 7,8 are double bonds. Then, during ring-closing metathesis, the double bonds are broken, and the ends are joined.

Wait, but that might form a ring. So let's imagine the molecule is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, perhaps the substituents are placed such that when the ends are connected, the substituents are in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with substituents at positions that, when the metathesis forms the ring, those substituents end up at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Let me think about the product: cyclohex-1-ene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So, in the product, the substituents are at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (isopropyl). So, the ring has six carbons. So the starting material must be a linear molecule with substituents that, when connected, form this arrangement.

Let me think about the positions. If I have a diene that's octa-1,7-diene, then the molecule is eight carbons long. So positions 1-2 and 7-8 are double bonds.

The substituents are at 3,4,5: so that's positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

Wait, so in the starting material, the substituents are at specific positions. When the metathesis occurs, the ends (the double bonds) are broken, and the substituents from each end are connected.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So:

Positions 1-2: double bond.

Positions 7-8: double bond.

Between positions 3 and 4: two methyl groups.

Position 5: isopropyl.

So the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)) ... wait, no, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the ring-closing metathesis process.

In ring-closing metathesis, two alkenes in a single molecule undergo a redistribution. So, for a cyclohexene, the molecule should have a structure where when the two ends (the alkenes) undergo metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, the numbering goes as follows:

1 (double bond start), 2, 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (isopropyl), 6 (end of ring).

But wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond between 1 and 2. So, positions 3 and 4 are adjacent to that, and position 5 is opposite.

So, the starting molecule must have the substituents arranged such that when the two ends (each with an alkene) undergo metathesis, the substituents are positioned correctly.

Let me model this. Suppose the starting material is an octadiene. For ring-closing, the two alkenes are at the ends. So, the structure might be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's too long.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's two double bonds at positions 1 and 7.

Wait, wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8.

So, the molecule would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, but in such a molecule, positions 1-2 and 7-8 are double bonds. So the molecule is eight carbons long.

Wait, but when the ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two alkenes would exchange partners. So the ends (positions 1 and 8) would form bonds.

Wait, but that would form a six-membered ring because the starting material is eight carbons; if you form a ring by connecting 1 and 8, that would be a seven-membered ring, but the product is cyclohexene, six-membered.

Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps the starting material has two double bonds which are spaced in such a way that the ring formed is six-membered.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the two double bonds are separated by a certain number of carbons. For a six-membered ring, the diene would need to have four carbons between the two double bonds. Because when the metathesis occurs, the ends connect, forming a ring.

Wait, let me think. For a six-membered ring, the two ends of the diene should be separated by four single bonds. Because when you form the ring, each double bond contributes two carbons, plus the four in between. Let me count.

Wait, no. Let's think about the number of atoms between the two ends. If the starting material is an octadiene, positions 1-2 and 6-7, for example. Then the number of carbons between the two alkenes would be 6-2=4 (positions 3,4,5,6). Wait, but in an octadiene, if the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7, then the distance between the two is four carbons (positions 3,4,5,6). So when metathesis occurs, the two double bonds are broken, and the ends are connected. So the ring formed would be 1-2, then 3,4,5,6,7,8? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with two double bonds that are four carbons apart, which would form a six-membered ring upon metathesis.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is an octa-1,6-diene. Let me see.

So, for example, if the starting material is an octa-1,6-diene, the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me try to count the carbons. Octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7.

So the molecule would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that's eight carbons. So the positions are 1-2 (double bond), then 3,4,5,6 (single bonds), then 6-7 (another double bond), and 8 is a CH2.

But wait, that's not possible because octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7, meaning between positions 6 and 7. So the molecule would be eight carbons long.

But when ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two ends (the ends of the double bonds) would form new bonds. So the 1 end connects to the 7 end, and the 2 end connects to the 6 end. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about how the substituents are arranged in the starting material.

The product has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, the substituents should be positioned such that when the ring forms, they end up at these positions.

Let me imagine the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene (option A). So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that's eight carbons with double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. So positions 1-2 and 7-8 are double bonds.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (1-2 and 7-8) would break, and the ends would connect. So the 1 and 8 carbons would form bonds, and the 2 and 7 carbons would form bonds. But that would form a ring of 8 - (2 + 2) = 4? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the product is six-membered. So the starting material must have two double bonds such that when they undergo metathesis, the ring formed has six members. So the number of atoms between the two double bonds should be four, perhaps.

Wait, let's count the number of atoms between the two double bonds. If the starting material is an octa-2,6-diene (option B), then the double bonds are at positions 2-3 and 6-7. The number of single bonds between the double bonds would be positions 3,4,5,6, which is four single bonds. So, the distance between the two double bonds is four carbons (positions 4,5,6,7?), wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the number of carbons between the two double bonds would be 6-3=3 single bonds? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the product structure again. The product is cyclohexene, which has six carbons. So the starting material must have a diene that, when connected, forms six carbons in the ring.

So, the starting material would be a diene with two double bonds—each at one end. So, for example, an octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at the ends, and when they undergo metathesis, the ring formed would have six members.

Wait, let's think: starting material is octa-1,6-diene.

Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

So the molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that's eight carbons. So when metathesis occurs, the 1 and 7 carbons (from the ends of each double bond) would form a bond, and the 2 and 6 carbons would form another bond. Wait, but that would form a ring with 7 carbons? Because between 1 and 7, there are 6 bonds (since 1-2, 3,4,5,6,7). So that would form a seven-membered ring, which is not what we want.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the general process. Ring-closing metathesis forms a ring by breaking and reforming the double bonds.

The product is a cyclohexene, so the ring has six members. The starting material must have a diene (two double bonds) that, when the ends connect, form a six-membered ring. So, the diene must be such that when the ends are connected, the number of atoms in the ring is six.

This would mean that the starting material is a diene with four single bonds between the two double bonds. Because each double bond contributes two carbons, and four single bonds add four, making 2 + 4 + 2 = 8, but wait, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the number of atoms between the two double bonds is four, which would make the ring six-membered.

Wait, each double bond is two carbons. So, if the two double bonds are separated by four single bonds, that would be a total of 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms. But that would form an eight-membered ring, which is more than the six-membered product. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the number of atoms between the two double bonds is three single bonds. So, two double bonds (each two carbons) and three single bonds between them, totaling 2+3+2=7, which would give a seven-membered ring. That's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to imagine that the number of carbons between the two double bonds is four, but including the double bond carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that's eight carbons and wouldn't form a six-membered ring.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents. The substituents in the product are at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents are in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at those positions.

Looking at option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So starting material has substituents at 3 and 4 (both methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). The double bonds are at 1,2 and 7,8.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 8) would form a bond, and the other ends (2 and 7) would form a bond. So the ring would be formed by connecting 1 to 8 and 2 to 7.

Wait, but that would result in a seven-membered ring, because the chain would be from 1 to 8, which is 8-1+1=8 carbons? Wait, no. Wait, the ring would have the number of carbons equal to the number of carbons between the two ends. So, if we have a starting material of 8 carbons with double bonds at 1,2 and 7,8, then the ring formed would have 8 - (2 + 2) = 4? No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, the ring size is determined by the number of carbons between the two double bonds. So, if the two double bonds are at 1,2 and 7,8, the number of carbons between them is 7-2=5, but that would be positions 3,4,5,6,7, which is five carbons. So adding the two double bonds (each two carbons), that's 5 + 2*2=9, which doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the Grubbs mechanism. In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst breaks the two double bonds and swaps the substituents. So, for example, if the starting material is a diene with groups A and B on one end, and groups C and D on the other end, after metathesis, the structure would have A connected to C and B connected to D, forming a ring.

So, considering substituents on each end.

In the product, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, these substituents must be on the ends that will form the ring.

Wait, the product has substituents at 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, substituents at positions 3,4,5 would need to end up adjacent when the ring is formed.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is such that when the ends are joined, the substituents at 3,4,5 become the substituents at the 3,4,5 positions of the cyclohexene.

Let me consider option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, with double bonds at 2 and 6.

Wait, octa-2,6-diene: double bonds at 2-3 and 6-7.

So positions 2-3 and 6-7 are double bonds. The substituents are at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (isopropyl).

So when the ring-closing occurs, the ends at 2 and 7 would form bonds. So the ring would be formed by connecting the 2 and 7 positions.

Wait, but then the substituents at 3,4,5 would be inside the ring.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the product structure again. The product is cyclohex-1-ene. So positions 1 and 2 are the double bond. The substituents at 3,4,5 are all connected in the ring.

So, when the starting material is converted into the product via metathesis, the substituents that are on the ends of the diene will end up at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the substituents in the starting material that, when the ends are joined, form the substituents in the product.

In the product, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which are adjacent positions. In the starting material, these substituents must be on adjacent carbons that will end up adjacent in the ring.

Looking back at the options, option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5, which are adjacent. So when the ring forms, these substituents would be placed in positions that are adjacent in the ring.

Wait, but then the diene in option B is at positions 2 and 6. So the two double bonds are at the 2-3 and 6-7 positions. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So, after metathesis, the two ends (positions 2 and 7) would form bonds, creating a ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would become part of the ring.

Wait, but how would that place the substituents? Let me imagine the ring formation. If the starting material is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)) - wait, perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has the substituents in the middle, and the ring forms by connecting the ends, bringing those substituents into the ring.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the product and work backward.

The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, in the ring, substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

So, looking at the starting material, the substituents should be positioned so that when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4,5.

In option B, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which are in the middle of the chain.

So, when the ring forms by joining positions 2 and 7 (from the two double bonds), the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle of the ring, which is positions 3,4,5.

Hmm, that seems possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents in the starting material are at positions adjacent to the double bonds, so that when the ring forms, they end up in the correct positions.

Wait, another approach: the product has a cyclohexene ring, which is formed by connecting two ends of the starting material. The substituents in the product are at positions 3,4,5, which are in the middle of the ring.

So, in the starting material, the substituents must be positioned such that when the ends are connected, they end up in the middle.

Looking at option B, which has substituents at 3,4,5 and double bonds at 2 and 6.

So, the starting material would be:

CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the substituents right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option B, which is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (at 2-3 and 6-7) would break, and the ends would form new bonds. So, the 2 end would connect to the 7 end, and the 3 end would connect to the 6 end.

Wait, but that would form a seven-membered ring, which isn't what we need.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another approach. The key point is that during ring-closing metathesis, the positions of the substituents must end up in the correct spots.

In the product, the substituents are at 3,4,5.

In the starting material, the substituents should be in positions that are two carbons away from each end of the diene. Because when the ring forms, those substituents will be two carbons away from the new double bond.

Wait, the product has a double bond at position 1, so the substituents are on positions 2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents at positions that are two away from each end. So, for a six-membered ring, the substituents would be at positions 3,4,5, which are three positions from each end.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Because when the metathesis occurs, the ends (2 and 6) would form bonds, and the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

In this case, the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

So, when the metathesis occurs, the 1 and 7 ends would form bonds, and the 2 and 6 ends would form bonds.

Wait, but that would form a six-membered ring, as follows:

The chain is 8 carbons long.

The ring would be formed by connecting 1 and 7, which are at the two ends. So the ring would consist of positions 1,2,3,4,5,6, which is six carbons. Wait, no, that's seven carbons because 1 to 7 is seven positions.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of carbons in the starting material and the ring.

The product is a six-membered ring. The starting material must have a diene that, when the ends are connected, forms a ring with six members. So, the starting material must have four carbons between the two double bonds.

Because each double bond is two carbons, and four in between, totaling 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 carbons. So an eight-carbon starting material with two double bonds separated by four single bonds.

So, the diene is at 1,2 and 6,7 positions. So, octa-1,6-diene.

Looking at the options, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So, the substituents are at 3,4,5, and the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

So, when the metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) form bonds, and the ends (2 and 6) form bonds. This would create a six-membered ring.

The substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

So, this would match the product structure.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the product and the options provided. The product is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). Ring-closing metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds to form a ring, so the starting material must be a diene with substituents positioned such that, upon metathesis, they end up at the correct positions in the product.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, with substituents at 3, 4, and 5. If metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) would form bonds, creating a seven-membered ring. This does not match the six-membered cyclohexene product.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7, with substituents at 3, 4, and 5. If metathesis occurs, the ends (2 and 6) would form bonds, creating a six-membered ring. However, the substituents at 3, 4, and 5 would not align correctly with the substituents in the product.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7, with substituents at 3, 4, and 5. When metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) form bonds, and the substituents at 3, 4, and 5 are positioned correctly to match the substituents in the product. This forms a six-membered ring with the desired structure.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, but the substituents are at positions 4, 5, and 6. If metathesis occurs, the substituents would not align correctly with those in the product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **option C**, as it has the appropriate substituents and double bonds to form the six-membered cyclohexene ring with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, ring-closing metathesis is a reaction where two alkenes undergo a redistribution of their substituents, right? The catalyst involved is usually something like Grubbs catalyst. The main thing that happens is the formation of a ring by connecting the two ends of a diene.

The question is asking about the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via this method. Let me think about what the structure of the product looks like. The product is a cyclohexene, so a six-membered ring with a double bond, and substituents at positions 3,4 (two methyl groups) and 5 (an isopropyl group).

So, in ring-closing metathesis, we'll have a diene that will form the ring. The idea is that two alkenes (from the same molecule, since it's ring-closing) will swap partners, leading to a ring formation. The diene will have two double bonds? Or wait, no, wait. No, wait. Ring-closing metathesis typically uses an olefin, perhaps with substituents on either end, so that when the metathesis occurs, the ends come together to form a ring.

Wait, wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The product is a cyclohexene, which has a ring of six members with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 3,4, and 5. So the numbering goes 1 (double bond starts here), 2 (maybe a CH2), 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (isopropyl), and 6 would be CH2 perhaps. So the ring is six-membered, with substituents at 3,4,5.

The starting material for ring-closing metathesis would be a diene, right? So when the metathesis happens, two double bonds in the diene would reorganize, forming a ring. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ring-closing metathesis usually starts with a diene, but perhaps it's a mono-alkene with substituents on each end that, when the metathesis occurs, the ends connect to form a ring.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to think that the starting material is a dialkene, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of substituents on each end of a diene to form a ring. The general setup is that each end of the diene has substituents that will become attached to the other end. So, for example, if you have a molecule with two double bonds (but wait, that's not possible unless it's conjugated?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diene where the ends can undergo metathesis to form a ring. Wait, maybe the starting molecule is a diene with substituents at each end that will cyclize when the metathesis occurs.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a molecule that has two double bonds, or perhaps a diene that will form a ring upon metathesis. Alternatively, perhaps it's a molecule with two alkenes, but in a way that the ends can come together to form a ring. Let me think about the product structure. The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

So the cyclohexene has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. The substituents are at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So positions 1 and 2 are the double bond. Then, positions 3 and 4 each have methyl groups, and position 5 has an isopropyl.

So the ring is six-membered. Now, the starting material must have a structure that, when the metathesis happens, forms this ring. Let me consider how.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst (like Grubbs) facilitates the breaking and reforming of the double bonds. So, the starting material is likely a diene where the two double bonds (or perhaps one double bond with substituents) are positioned such that upon metathesis, the ends connect to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene, and the metathesis forms a six-membered ring. So, the starting material has two double bonds, perhaps at positions 1 and 7 (octa-1,7-diene) or something like that.

Wait, let's consider the options. The options are four different octadienes.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So, the product is a cyclohexene. So the starting material must have substituents that, when the ends are connected, form the substituents in the cyclohexene.

Let me imagine the starting material as an octadiene. The idea is that the two ends (from the double bonds) will undergo metathesis to form the ring. So, perhaps the diene is such that when the two ends are joined, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Let's take option A: octa-1,7-diene. So positions 1 and 2 are a double bond, and positions 7 and 8 are another double bond. The substituents are at 3 and 4 (methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl).

Wait, so during metathesis, the two double bonds (1-2 and 7-8) would undergo a process where the ends are swapped. So the ends at 1 and 8 would come together, and the ends at 2 and 7 would also come together. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each end will determine where the ring forms.

Wait, another approach: in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst will break both double bonds. So each end of the molecule will swap partners, leading to a new ring.

So, for example, if the starting material is a diene, and each end has substituents, then the ring will form when the substituents are connected.

Wait, maybe the structure would look like this: the starting material is a molecule where positions 1 and 2 are a double bond, and positions 7 and 8 are another double bond. So, positions 1,2 and 7,8 are double bonds. Then, during ring-closing metathesis, the double bonds are broken, and the ends are joined.

Wait, but that might form a ring. So let's imagine the molecule is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, perhaps the substituents are placed such that when the ends are connected, the substituents are in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with substituents at positions that, when the metathesis forms the ring, those substituents end up at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Let me think about the product: cyclohex-1-ene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So, in the product, the substituents are at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (isopropyl). So, the ring has six carbons. So the starting material must be a linear molecule with substituents that, when connected, form this arrangement.

Let me think about the positions. If I have a diene that's octa-1,7-diene, then the molecule is eight carbons long. So positions 1-2 and 7-8 are double bonds.

The substituents are at 3,4,5: so that's positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

Wait, so in the starting material, the substituents are at specific positions. When the metathesis occurs, the ends (the double bonds) are broken, and the substituents from each end are connected.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So:

Positions 1-2: double bond.

Positions 7-8: double bond.

Between positions 3 and 4: two methyl groups.

Position 5: isopropyl.

So the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)) ... wait, no, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the ring-closing metathesis process.

In ring-closing metathesis, two alkenes in a single molecule undergo a redistribution. So, for a cyclohexene, the molecule should have a structure where when the two ends (the alkenes) undergo metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, the numbering goes as follows:

1 (double bond start), 2, 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (isopropyl), 6 (end of ring).

But wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond between 1 and 2. So, positions 3 and 4 are adjacent to that, and position 5 is opposite.

So, the starting molecule must have the substituents arranged such that when the two ends (each with an alkene) undergo metathesis, the substituents are positioned correctly.

Let me model this. Suppose the starting material is an octadiene. For ring-closing, the two alkenes are at the ends. So, the structure might be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's too long.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's two double bonds at positions 1 and 7.

Wait, wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8.

So, the molecule would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, but in such a molecule, positions 1-2 and 7-8 are double bonds. So the molecule is eight carbons long.

Wait, but when the ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two alkenes would exchange partners. So the ends (positions 1 and 8) would form bonds.

Wait, but that would form a six-membered ring because the starting material is eight carbons; if you form a ring by connecting 1 and 8, that would be a seven-membered ring, but the product is cyclohexene, six-membered.

Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps the starting material has two double bonds which are spaced in such a way that the ring formed is six-membered.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the two double bonds are separated by a certain number of carbons. For a six-membered ring, the diene would need to have four carbons between the two double bonds. Because when the metathesis occurs, the ends connect, forming a ring.

Wait, let me think. For a six-membered ring, the two ends of the diene should be separated by four single bonds. Because when you form the ring, each double bond contributes two carbons, plus the four in between. Let me count.

Wait, no. Let's think about the number of atoms between the two ends. If the starting material is an octadiene, positions 1-2 and 6-7, for example. Then the number of carbons between the two alkenes would be 6-2=4 (positions 3,4,5,6). Wait, but in an octadiene, if the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7, then the distance between the two is four carbons (positions 3,4,5,6). So when metathesis occurs, the two double bonds are broken, and the ends are connected. So the ring formed would be 1-2, then 3,4,5,6,7,8? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with two double bonds that are four carbons apart, which would form a six-membered ring upon metathesis.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is an octa-1,6-diene. Let me see.

So, for example, if the starting material is an octa-1,6-diene, the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me try to count the carbons. Octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7.

So the molecule would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that's eight carbons. So the positions are 1-2 (double bond), then 3,4,5,6 (single bonds), then 6-7 (another double bond), and 8 is a CH2.

But wait, that's not possible because octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7, meaning between positions 6 and 7. So the molecule would be eight carbons long.

But when ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two ends (the ends of the double bonds) would form new bonds. So the 1 end connects to the 7 end, and the 2 end connects to the 6 end. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about how the substituents are arranged in the starting material.

The product has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, the substituents should be positioned such that when the ring forms, they end up at these positions.

Let me imagine the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene (option A). So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that's eight carbons with double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. So positions 1-2 and 7-8 are double bonds.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (1-2 and 7-8) would break, and the ends would connect. So the 1 and 8 carbons would form bonds, and the 2 and 7 carbons would form bonds. But that would form a ring of 8 - (2 + 2) = 4? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the product is six-membered. So the starting material must have two double bonds such that when they undergo metathesis, the ring formed has six members. So the number of atoms between the two double bonds should be four, perhaps.

Wait, let's count the number of atoms between the two double bonds. If the starting material is an octa-2,6-diene (option B), then the double bonds are at positions 2-3 and 6-7. The number of single bonds between the double bonds would be positions 3,4,5,6, which is four single bonds. So, the distance between the two double bonds is four carbons (positions 4,5,6,7?), wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the number of carbons between the two double bonds would be 6-3=3 single bonds? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the product structure again. The product is cyclohexene, which has six carbons. So the starting material must have a diene that, when connected, forms six carbons in the ring.

So, the starting material would be a diene with two double bonds—each at one end. So, for example, an octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at the ends, and when they undergo metathesis, the ring formed would have six members.

Wait, let's think: starting material is octa-1,6-diene.

Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

So the molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that's eight carbons. So when metathesis occurs, the 1 and 7 carbons (from the ends of each double bond) would form a bond, and the 2 and 6 carbons would form another bond. Wait, but that would form a ring with 7 carbons? Because between 1 and 7, there are 6 bonds (since 1-2, 3,4,5,6,7). So that would form a seven-membered ring, which is not what we want.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the general process. Ring-closing metathesis forms a ring by breaking and reforming the double bonds.

The product is a cyclohexene, so the ring has six members. The starting material must have a diene (two double bonds) that, when the ends connect, form a six-membered ring. So, the diene must be such that when the ends are connected, the number of atoms in the ring is six.

This would mean that the starting material is a diene with four single bonds between the two double bonds. Because each double bond contributes two carbons, and four single bonds add four, making 2 + 4 + 2 = 8, but wait, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the number of atoms between the two double bonds is four, which would make the ring six-membered.

Wait, each double bond is two carbons. So, if the two double bonds are separated by four single bonds, that would be a total of 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms. But that would form an eight-membered ring, which is more than the six-membered product. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the number of atoms between the two double bonds is three single bonds. So, two double bonds (each two carbons) and three single bonds between them, totaling 2+3+2=7, which would give a seven-membered ring. That's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to imagine that the number of carbons between the two double bonds is four, but including the double bond carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that's eight carbons and wouldn't form a six-membered ring.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents. The substituents in the product are at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents are in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at those positions.

Looking at option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So starting material has substituents at 3 and 4 (both methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). The double bonds are at 1,2 and 7,8.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 8) would form a bond, and the other ends (2 and 7) would form a bond. So the ring would be formed by connecting 1 to 8 and 2 to 7.

Wait, but that would result in a seven-membered ring, because the chain would be from 1 to 8, which is 8-1+1=8 carbons? Wait, no. Wait, the ring would have the number of carbons equal to the number of carbons between the two ends. So, if we have a starting material of 8 carbons with double bonds at 1,2 and 7,8, then the ring formed would have 8 - (2 + 2) = 4? No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, the ring size is determined by the number of carbons between the two double bonds. So, if the two double bonds are at 1,2 and 7,8, the number of carbons between them is 7-2=5, but that would be positions 3,4,5,6,7, which is five carbons. So adding the two double bonds (each two carbons), that's 5 + 2*2=9, which doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the Grubbs mechanism. In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst breaks the two double bonds and swaps the substituents. So, for example, if the starting material is a diene with groups A and B on one end, and groups C and D on the other end, after metathesis, the structure would have A connected to C and B connected to D, forming a ring.

So, considering substituents on each end.

In the product, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, these substituents must be on the ends that will form the ring.

Wait, the product has substituents at 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, substituents at positions 3,4,5 would need to end up adjacent when the ring is formed.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is such that when the ends are joined, the substituents at 3,4,5 become the substituents at the 3,4,5 positions of the cyclohexene.

Let me consider option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, with double bonds at 2 and 6.

Wait, octa-2,6-diene: double bonds at 2-3 and 6-7.

So positions 2-3 and 6-7 are double bonds. The substituents are at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (isopropyl).

So when the ring-closing occurs, the ends at 2 and 7 would form bonds. So the ring would be formed by connecting the 2 and 7 positions.

Wait, but then the substituents at 3,4,5 would be inside the ring.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the product structure again. The product is cyclohex-1-ene. So positions 1 and 2 are the double bond. The substituents at 3,4,5 are all connected in the ring.

So, when the starting material is converted into the product via metathesis, the substituents that are on the ends of the diene will end up at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the substituents in the starting material that, when the ends are joined, form the substituents in the product.

In the product, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which are adjacent positions. In the starting material, these substituents must be on adjacent carbons that will end up adjacent in the ring.

Looking back at the options, option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5, which are adjacent. So when the ring forms, these substituents would be placed in positions that are adjacent in the ring.

Wait, but then the diene in option B is at positions 2 and 6. So the two double bonds are at the 2-3 and 6-7 positions. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So, after metathesis, the two ends (positions 2 and 7) would form bonds, creating a ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would become part of the ring.

Wait, but how would that place the substituents? Let me imagine the ring formation. If the starting material is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)) - wait, perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has the substituents in the middle, and the ring forms by connecting the ends, bringing those substituents into the ring.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the product and work backward.

The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, in the ring, substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

So, looking at the starting material, the substituents should be positioned so that when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4,5.

In option B, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which are in the middle of the chain.

So, when the ring forms by joining positions 2 and 7 (from the two double bonds), the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle of the ring, which is positions 3,4,5.

Hmm, that seems possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents in the starting material are at positions adjacent to the double bonds, so that when the ring forms, they end up in the correct positions.

Wait, another approach: the product has a cyclohexene ring, which is formed by connecting two ends of the starting material. The substituents in the product are at positions 3,4,5, which are in the middle of the ring.

So, in the starting material, the substituents must be positioned such that when the ends are connected, they end up in the middle.

Looking at option B, which has substituents at 3,4,5 and double bonds at 2 and 6.

So, the starting material would be:

CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the substituents right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option B, which is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (at 2-3 and 6-7) would break, and the ends would form new bonds. So, the 2 end would connect to the 7 end, and the 3 end would connect to the 6 end.

Wait, but that would form a seven-membered ring, which isn't what we need.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another approach. The key point is that during ring-closing metathesis, the positions of the substituents must end up in the correct spots.

In the product, the substituents are at 3,4,5.

In the starting material, the substituents should be in positions that are two carbons away from each end of the diene. Because when the ring forms, those substituents will be two carbons away from the new double bond.

Wait, the product has a double bond at position 1, so the substituents are on positions 2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents at positions that are two away from each end. So, for a six-membered ring, the substituents would be at positions 3,4,5, which are three positions from each end.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Because when the metathesis occurs, the ends (2 and 6) would form bonds, and the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

In this case, the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

So, when the metathesis occurs, the 1 and 7 ends would form bonds, and the 2 and 6 ends would form bonds.

Wait, but that would form a six-membered ring, as follows:

The chain is 8 carbons long.

The ring would be formed by connecting 1 and 7, which are at the two ends. So the ring would consist of positions 1,2,3,4,5,6, which is six carbons. Wait, no, that's seven carbons because 1 to 7 is seven positions.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of carbons in the starting material and the ring.

The product is a six-membered ring. The starting material must have a diene that, when the ends are connected, forms a ring with six members. So, the starting material must have four carbons between the two double bonds.

Because each double bond is two carbons, and four in between, totaling 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 carbons. So an eight-carbon starting material with two double bonds separated by four single bonds.

So, the diene is at 1,2 and 6,7 positions. So, octa-1,6-diene.

Looking at the options, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So, the substituents are at 3,4,5, and the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

So, when the metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) form bonds, and the ends (2 and 6) form bonds. This would create a six-membered ring.

The substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

So, this would match the product structure.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the product and the options provided. The product is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). Ring-closing metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds to form a ring, so the starting material must be a diene with substituents positioned such that, upon metathesis, they end up at the correct positions in the product.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, with substituents at 3, 4, and 5. If metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) would form bonds, creating a seven-membered ring. This does not match the six-membered cyclohexene product.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7, with substituents at 3, 4, and 5. If metathesis occurs, the ends (2 and 6) would form bonds, creating a six-membered ring. However, the substituents at 3, 4, and 5 would not align correctly with the substituents in the product.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7, with substituents at 3, 4, and 5. When metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) form bonds, and the substituents at 3, 4, and 5 are positioned correctly to match the substituents in the product. This forms a six-membered ring with the desired structure.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, but the substituents are at positions 4, 5, and 6. If metathesis occurs, the substituents would not align correctly with those in the product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **option C**, as it has the appropriate substituents and double bonds to form the six-membered cyclohexene ring with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5.

**Answer: C**
