Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres, and it's about the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature and the energy levels. The Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) assumption is given, so I can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight and k is Boltzmann's constant. 

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the energy levels as E1 and E2, where E1 is higher than E2 (since they're talking about excitation, I think the higher level is more excited). Wait, no, the question says the photosphere of star 1 has iron atoms twice as excited. So star_1 has twice the excitation in a specific energy level. So the ratio n1/n2 (or whatever the ratio is) would be 2.

Wait, the ratio is n_upper / n_lower. So if star_1's atoms are more excited, the number in the upper level is higher. Let me think: the question says "twice as excited", so maybe the population in the upper level is twice as much compared to the lower level, but I need to get the ratio right.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The population ratio is n_i / n_j. So if star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2, the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. So for star_1, let's say (n_i / n_j) = 2 * (n_i' / n_j') where the primes are for star_2.

Wait, no, the problem states that the excitation is "twice as excited" in star_1 compared to star_2. So that ratio is 2:1. So for star_1, n_i / n_j = 2 * (n_i' / n_j').

But wait, the problem could be interpreted as (n_i)_1 = 2 * (n_i)_2. Hmm, but it's about the specific energy level, so maybe it's the ratio of the same energy levels in each star's photosphere. So if star_1 has twice as excited, meaning (n_i / n_j) is twice as much for star_1 as for star_2.

But I think the way to model this is using the Boltzmann equation for each star. Let me denote the ratio as x = (n_i / n_j) for each star. So for star 1, x1 = 2 x2, because the excitation is twice as high.

Wait, no. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited" as star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n_i / n_j) for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. So x1 = 2 x2.

But let me write the Boltzmann equations for each star.

For star 1: x1 = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T1) )

For star 2: x2 = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T2) )

Assuming that ΔE is the same for both stars because it's the same energy levels in iron. Also, the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, so they can be factored out.

Taking the ratio x1 / x2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Simplify that: x1/x2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But since x1 = 2 x2, then x1/x2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, let's rearrange that.

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) )

Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yes.

Then, let's write it as ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but the question gives us ΔE, which is 1.38e-23 J, but I don't think we need to plug it in because the options don't have numbers. So the equation is ln(2) equals something in terms of T1 and T2.

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). But wait, the equation I have is ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). But the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps there's an assumption that ΔE/(k) is 1? Or perhaps I have to express it without the constants.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again: the problem says the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So the ratio (n_i / n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So x1 = 2 x2.

From the Boltzmann equation, the ratio for each star is x = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Taking x1/x2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which equals 2.

So ln(2) = ΔE/(k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Which can be written as ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2)

Hmm, but the options don't include any terms with ΔE or k. So perhaps the question is assuming that the energy difference is such that (ΔE/(k)) equals 1, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor in the equation.

Wait, wait, another approach. Let me think about the ratio of the excitation temperatures. The excitation temperature is a concept where you can write the population ratio as exp( -ΔE/(k T_exc) ), so T_exc is sometimes used. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the excitation is given, so the ratio of the ratios is 2. Let me think about it again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the ratio of the exponentials. So, for each star, we have:

x1 = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

x2 = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Dividing these, x1/x2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is 2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take ln both sides: ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 )

But the problem states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same number given here. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. Oh! So that ratio becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that should be correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, that's exactly what we have here.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars, star_1 and star_2, based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation, which describes the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels under the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) assumption, is used:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of populations is given as:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_i}{n_j} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Let \(x_1 = \frac{n_i}{n_j} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1}\) and \(x_2 = \frac{n_i}{n_j} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}\). Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
x_1 = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad x_2 = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio \(x_1 / x_2\):

\[
\frac{x_1}{x_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \(x_1 / x_2 = 2\), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and Boltzmann's constant \(k\) is \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
