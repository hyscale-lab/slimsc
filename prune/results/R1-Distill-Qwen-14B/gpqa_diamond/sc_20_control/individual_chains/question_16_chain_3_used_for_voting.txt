Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter or some kind of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Wait, this is an alkene with a substituent on each carbon. The Z configuration means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But wait, can a double bond cause optical activity? I think double bonds can have E/Z isomerism, but that's not the same as optical activity. Optical activity requires a chiral center. So this molecule—does it have any chiral centers? The structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Let me draw it: the first carbon has Cl, CH2, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be ClCH2C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the first carbon after the double bond is CH2Cl attached to a C(CH3)=CH2. So the first carbon (the one with Cl) is CH2Cl attached to a double bond. Let me think: the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the carbons are Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the first carbon (Cl) is connected to CH2, the second carbon (C(CH3)) is double-bonded to CH2. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but C1 is Cl attached to CH2, which is attached to C2 which is connected to CH(CH3) and double bond. So C2 is CH(CH3), double bond to CH2. Does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The first carbon (C1) is CH2Cl attached to C2. C2 is CH(CH3) attached to C1 and C3. C3 is CH2 because double bond is between C1 and C2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is CH2Cl attached to C2, which is connected via double bond to C1 (which has a CH2 group). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about whether any carbon is a stereocenter. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different groups attached. Let me see the structure again: it's (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, but since it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and the double bond is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, CH2Cl is connected to C2. So C2 is CH(CH3), connected via double bond to C1, which is CH2Cl. So C1 is CH2Cl=C(CH3)-CH2? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's getting me confused. Wait, perhaps I should number from the other end. Butane has four carbons; but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, so CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with double bond. So it's CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with double bond between C1 and C2: CH2Cl=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's if it's 1-ene. So the correct structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with double bond between C1 and C2: CH2Cl=CH-CH2-CH3. But the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the substituents around the double bond would be ClCH2 and CH(CH3) on each end. So the double bond is CH2Cl–CH(CH3). Then, the substituents on each double bond carbon are:

C1: CH2Cl (so two H's and a Cl?), wait no, CH2Cl would have Cl, two H's, and a double bond to C2.

C2: CH(CH3) attached to double bond, so on C2, it's connected to CH3, two H's, and the double bond to C1.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think about the structure again. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure would be:

CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but that's possible? Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So putting a Cl on the first C and a methyl on the second C: CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl=CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but butane is four carbons, so but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2. So the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but that would be three carbons: CH2Cl, C(CH3)=CH2. Hmm, so the molecule is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. But then, how many substituents are on each carbon? On C1, we have CH2Cl and the double bond to C2. On C2, we have CH(CH3), and the double bond to C1, and perhaps a CH2 group? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because the molecule has a double bond, but if the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, then it's not a chiral center. Wait, C1 has two CH2 groups (because it's CH2Cl and maybe another CH2?), no. Alternatively, perhaps for this molecule, the Cl is on C1, which is connected via double bond to C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, connected to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), and the double bond. So each of these carbons has what substituents? C1: Cl, two H's, and double bond. C2: a methyl, two H's (maybe?), and double bond. So each of these carbons in the double bond has two substituents (Cl and H on C1; methyl and H on C2). So the double bond itself doesn't create a chiral center. So, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Looking at the carbons, perhaps the CH(CH3) is attached to C2. Wait, but in this molecule, is there a carbon with four different groups attached?

Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the C(CH3) is connected to C1 (CH2Cl), and the CH2 group is on the other side. So in the case of the double bond, the groups on each side are Cl–CH2– and CH(CH3)–. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical activity. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So I think this molecule is not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: Okay, this one's a bit complex. Let me try to parse the name. It's a hexahydro derivative, so it's a ring structure with six-membered rings perhaps. The substituents are chloromethylene at position 8, and the configuration is (3aR,7aS,E). So there's a double bond with E configuration, which might imply some kind of geometry. Now, the question is whether this compound has a chiral center. The name includes (3aR,7aS), which suggests that carbons 3a and 7a have specific configurations. So these are stereocenters because they have R and S designations. So the molecule has two stereocenters, which makes it chiral. Additionally, the E configuration in the double bond doesn't directly affect chirality, but the presence of stereocenters does. Therefore, this compound is chiral and should exhibit optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When we have 2 and 3 methyl groups, it becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The configurations are 2R and 3S. Let me draw this. Carbon 2 is R configuration: the substituents would be, around C2, the groups are CH3, CH(CH3), COOH, and another group. Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the CH(CH3) carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents? Let me think. Each of C2 and C3 has:

- C2: connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, because succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups to C2 and C3 would make them CH(CH3). So each of those carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), two CH3 groups? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to two methyl groups, and two other carbons (C1 and C3 for C2, and C2 and C4 for C3). Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups? No, wait. The structure is:

- C1: COOH
- C2: CH(CH3)
- C3: CH(CH3)
- C4: COOH

So for C2, the substituents are:

- Two CH3 groups (since it's CH(CH3))
- Connected to C1 (which is a COOH group)
- Connected to C3 (which is another CH(CH3))
Wait, no, each CH(CH3) has a CH3, two H's, and two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3). Wait, but for C2, the substituents would be:

Group 1: COO− (from C1)
Group 2: CH(CH3) (from C3)
Group 3: CH3 (from the methyl)
Group 4: H?

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So in succinic acid, the C2 and C3 are each connected to:

C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? Or perhaps it's:

C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (which is a carboxylic acid group), C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), and two hydrogens. Wait, that would mean only three different groups: CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). No, that's not correct. Let me clarify.

Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, each becomes CH(CH3). So each of those carbons is connected to:

For C2:

- One COOH (from C1)
- One CH(CH3) (from C3)
- One CH3
- One H

Wait, that can't be. Wait, if it's CH2-CH2, and you add a methyl to each, it becomes CH(CH3)-CH(CH3). So each CH(CH3) is connected to two CH3 groups, the adjacent CH(CH3), and the COOH groups on either side.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out. Let's see:

HOOC - CH(CH3) - CH(CH3) - COOH

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), two CH3 groups, and a hydrogen? Or wait, the structure is:

C1: COOH
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: COOH

So C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So the substituents on C2 are:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, but that would mean two CH3 groups, making the substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and CH3. Wait, no, because each CH(CH3) has a CH3 attached. So substituents on C2 are:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups (from the methyl substituents on C2)
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 has four different groups. Let me think about the groups attached to C2.

C2 is connected to:

1. The carboxylic acid group from C1 (HOOC-)
2. The carboxylic acid group from C4 (because C4 is the same as C2 in this case? No, C4 is the next one. Wait, no, C2 is the second carbon, so C4 is the fourth.)

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine that each C2 and C3 has:

C2: attached to C1 (which is a COOH group), C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), two CH3 groups (as substituents), and a hydrogen. So substituents are: COOH, CH(CH3), two CH3, H. Wait, that would make four substituents. So for C2:

- One substituent: COOH (from C1)
- Second: CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Third: CH3 (substituent)
- Fourth: H

Wait, that sums to four different substituents. Because COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H are all different. So yes, C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 is connected to:

- COOH (from C4)
- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- CH3 (substituent)
- H

So C3 also has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So the molecule has two chiral centers, so it's chiral, hence optically active. So this compound is optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Similar to the previous one, but with both configurations R. So the structure is the same as in number 3, but with both C2 and C3 in R configuration. So again, each of these carbons has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is also chiral and optically active.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the molecule in number 3 and number 4 have the same structure but different configurations. So both are chiral, but their configurations differ, so both will have optical activity. So both 3 and 4 are active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration is R. Let me think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. The hydroxyl is on C1, which is attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the substituents around C1 are: -OH, two adjacent CH2 groups (from the ring), and a ring substituent. Wait, no, the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond at position 3. So C1 is attached to C2 and C6 (assuming the ring is numbered 1 to 6). So the substituents on C1 would be OH, two ring carbons (C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? Or perhaps not.

Wait, but in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a cyclohexene ring where C1 has an -OH group. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is something like:

O
|
C1-OH

Connected to C2 and C6.

So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- CH2 (to C2)
- CH2 (to C6)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. In cyclohexene, each carbon is connected to two others in the ring. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. The substituents on C1 would be:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would make three substituents, which can't be because it's a carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe each carbon in the ring has two other ring carbons and two substituents. So C1 has substituents: OH, and perhaps two CH2 groups, and another substituent. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key here is whether C1 has four different groups attached. If it's (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, then that indicates that C1 is a chiral center. So the presence of the R configuration implies that there's a stereocenter at C1. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The configuration at each of these positions is s (which I think is the same as R or S, but the exact designation isn't as important as whether the substituents are different). So each of these OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) is a stereocenter. So each has four different substituents. Let me think about C1: it's connected to C2, C6, an OH group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons. So perhaps the substituents are:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (since it's cyclohexane, each neighboring carbon is a CH2)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that can't be right. In a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and two hydrogens. But if there's a hydroxyl group on C1, then the substituents would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because each carbon in cyclohexane has two CH2 groups attached (the adjacent carbons), but that would mean that the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen. Wait, that would make two CH2 groups the same, which would mean C1 isn't a chiral center. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps each C in the ring has two adjacent CH2 groups and two substituents. Wait, but in cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent CH2 groups (the ring) and two hydrogen atoms. If an OH group is added, then that replaces a hydrogen. So for C1, substituents are:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- And the remaining substituent is a hydrogen.

So the substituents are: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and H. But two of the substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups). So that would mean C1 is not a chiral center because it only has three different groups attached (OH, CH2, H). So each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have two identical substituents (the adjacent CH2 groups), making them not chiral. Therefore, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons (each CH2), and two hydrogen atoms. When you add an OH group, one of the hydrogens is replaced. So the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- H

So in terms of substituents, the groups are: OH, CH2, CH2, H. So two CH2 groups are the same, making the substituents not all different. Hence, no chirality at C1. Therefore, the molecule (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Hmm, but wait, could the positions of the hydroxyl groups create some kind of asymmetry in the molecule? Even if each individual C isn't a chiral center, maybe the overall molecule isn't symmetric. But I think that for a molecule to be chiral, it must have at least one chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like a plane of symmetry. But in this case, since all three OHs are on the same face (if the configuration is s,s,s), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is meso. Wait, if the molecule has multiple stereocenters but is meso, it wouldn't be chiral.

In this case, let's think about the (1s,3s,5s) configuration. If all three OH groups are on the same face, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups at 1,3,5 positions. If all OHs are on the same face (say, all up), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. Because you could mirror it and get the same structure. So in this case, the molecule is meso, hence not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: So the structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. The structure is: cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3). Wait, but butanone is (CH3)2CO, but in this case, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is:

O
||
C(O) - cyclopentyl
|
CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)

Wait, but wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So it's CH2CH2CH2CO. But when you substitute the first carbon with cyclopentyl, it becomes cyclopentyl-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, wait. Let me think again. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-R

But in this case, R is cyclopentyl. Wait, no, 1-cyclopentyl would be substituent on the first carbon of butanone. So butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-C(O)-

But substituting the first carbon (the C attached to the carbonyl) with cyclopentyl would give:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-, so structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-

But when you substitute the first carbon (the one connected to the carbonyl) with cyclopentyl, it becomes cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the molecule is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the carbonyl is at position 1, with a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH2CH3 group attached.

Wait, but the substituents around the carbonyl carbon (C1) would be:

- Cyclopentyl group
- CH2CH2CH3
- And two oxygen double bonds.

Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two other groups. So the substituents are cyclopentyl and CH2CH2CH3, plus the carbonyl oxygen (double bond) and a hydrogen? No, wait. For a ketone (butanone), the carbonyl is at the end. Wait, n=4 for butanone, so butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-. But substituting the first carbon with cyclopentyl would make it cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to:

- One cyclopentyl group
- One CH2-CH2-CH3 group
- And double-bonded to O.

Wait, that's only three substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of butanone as (CH3)2CO, but in this case, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is:

O
||
C(O)–C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH(CH3))

Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to write the structure properly.

Butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2–C(O)–R

But in this case, R is cyclopentyl. So, the structure is:

Cyclopentyl–C(O)–CH2–CH2–CH2– ?

Wait, but that would be pentan-1-one if the chain is longer, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl group, which is then connected to a CH2CH(CH3) group. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(O)–cyclopentyl
|
CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

No, the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the butanone part is four carbons, with substituents at position 1 and 3.

So butan-1-one is:

R–C(O)–CH2–CH2–CH3

Wait, but that's incorrect. Butan-1-one is actually (CH3)2CO, but wait, no— wait, butanone is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3, which is 2-butanone. So butan-1-one would be CH2=CH–C(O)–CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO. So the structure is:

CH2–CH2–CH2–C(O)–R

But in the given compound, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the substituents are at positions 1 and 3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(O)–(cyclopentyl)
|
CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think again. The name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the main chain is butan-1-one: four carbons with the carbonyl at position 1. So the structure is:

O
||
C(O)–R1–R2–R3–R4

But wait, no, butan-1-one is:

R–CH2–CH2–CH2–C(O)–R'

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is at the end. So butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-, but that's a ketone, so it's (CH2)2-C(O)-CH3. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up butanone structure. Butanone can be 2-butanone (which is more common), but 1-butanone would have the carbonyl at the end. So it would be CH2CH2CH2-C(O)H. But that's not possible because a ketone has two alkyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. So 1-butanone doesn't exist as a ketone. Oh wait, perhaps the name is incorrect. Because butan-1-one would require the carbonyl to be on the first carbon, but that would make it an aldehyde if it's at the end. So perhaps the correct structure for butan-1-one is impossible because it's not a ketone. Hmm, maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone or something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to interpret 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is that the carbonyl is at position 1, with a cyclopentyl group attached to it, and a methyl group at position 3. So the structure would be:

O
||
C(O)–cyclopentyl
|
CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, but that would make the chain longer than four carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The butanone is four carbons, with the carbonyl at position 1. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl–C(O)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, but that's five carbons. I'm not getting this right. Let me focus on whether this molecule has a chiral center. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1, substituents are cyclopentyl and another group. Let me imagine the structure as:

O
||
C(O)–cyclopentyl
|
CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me instead think about whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center. If the molecule has a carbon with four different substituents, then it's chiral.

Looking at the structure again, perhaps the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl, a CH2 group, and another substituent. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center because it has only three substituents (the two from the cyclopentyl and the CH2 chain, plus the double bond). So the carbonyl carbon isn't chiral.

Looking at other carbons. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (let's say C2) would be connected to the carbonyl group, a CH2 group, and perhaps a CH(CH3). So the substituents would be:

- C=O (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH2 groups.

Wait, but that's if the structure is C(O)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

In that case, at C2, substituents are:

- C(O)
- CH(CH3)
- Two CH2 groups.

So substituents are C(O), CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and another CH2 group. Wait, I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps C2 is connected to C1 (C=O), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps C2 is connected to C1 (C=O), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH2 groups. So substituents are:

- C=O (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH2 groups.

If that's the case, then substituents are C=O, CH(CH3), CH2, and CH2. So two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), making C2 not a chiral center.

Looking at C3: substituents would be C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), CH(CH3), and perhaps another substituent. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is connected to a methyl group, so substituents would be:

- C2 (CH2)
- C4 (CH2)
- CH3 (from the methyl)
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

If that's the case, substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H. So four different groups, making C3 a chiral center.

Wait, but if C3 is connected to:

- C2 (CH2–)
- C4 (CH2–)
- CH3 (methyl)
- And a hydrogen.

Then, yes, four different groups, so C3 is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center at C3, making it optically active.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at C1, which is connected to cyclopentyl and the rest of the butanone chain. The rest of the chain is:

C1 (C=O) – C2 – C3 (CH(CH3)) – C4.

So C2 is connected to C1 (C=O), C3, and two CH2 groups. So maybe C2 isn't a chiral center. C3 would be connected to C2, C4, CH3, and another group.

Wait, but in butan-1-one, the chain after the carbonyl is three carbons: C1 (C=O), C2, C3, C4. So the structure is:

C=O (C1) – C2 – C3 (CH(CH3)) – C4.

So C3 is connected to C2, C4, a methyl group, and another substituent. What's the substituent on C3? Let's imagine:

C3 is connected to:

- C2 (CH2–)
- C4 (CH2–)
- CH3 (methyl)
- And a hydrogen.

So substituents are: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H. Thus, four different groups, making C3 a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: sometimes, the presence of a plane of symmetry can make a molecule achiral despite having a stereocenter. But in this case, I don't think there's a plane of symmetry because the substituents around C3 are all different.

So, summarizing the seven compounds:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → No chiral centers → Not active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... → Yes, stereocenters → Active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Yes → Active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Yes → Active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → Yes, C1 is chiral → Active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → No chiral centers (meso) → Not active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → Yes, C3 is chiral → Active.

So, counting the active ones:

2,3,4,5,7 → five compounds.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount:

Compounds 2,3,4,5,7 are active. That's five. So the answer would be option A)5.

But wait, I thought earlier that compound 7 has a chiral center, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me revisit that.

In compound 7, if C3 is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. The groups are: C2 (CH2–), C4 (CH2–), CH3, and H. Wait, but if the chain is butanone, then after C3 is C4, which is CH2–. So C3's substituents are:

- From C2: CH2–
- From C4: CH2–
- Methyl: CH3
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would mean two substituents are CH2–, which are the same. So then, C3 has two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), making them the same. So substituents would be:

- CH2 (C2)
- CH2 (C4)
- CH3
- H

Wait, so two substituents are the same (CH2 groups), so C3 isn't a chiral center. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. So compound 7 doesn't have a chiral center, meaning it's not optically active.

So, now the count is:

2,3,4,5 → four active.

Wait, so I need to recount:

1. Not active.
2. Active.
3. Active.
4. Active.
5. Active.
6. Not active.
7. Not active.

So four active compounds. So the answer is D)4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires at least one stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents) or another form of asymmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond and no stereocenters. The substituents on the double-bonded carbons are not all different, so it lacks chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   The molecule contains stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (R) and (S) configurations. These stereocenters make the molecule chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. Each carbon is bonded to four different groups, making it chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to compound 3, this molecule has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3, each with four different substituents. It is also chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group at position 1 is attached to a carbon that has four different substituents: an -OH group, two distinct positions in the cyclohexene ring, and a hydrogen. This makes it a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are symmetrically arranged on the cyclohexane ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite the stereocenters.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a stereocenter. Other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents, so there are no stereocenters.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5. This gives a total of **4 optically active compounds**.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter or some kind of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Wait, this is an alkene with a substituent on each carbon. The Z configuration means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But wait, can a double bond cause optical activity? I think double bonds can have E/Z isomerism, but that's not the same as optical activity. Optical activity requires a chiral center. So this molecule—does it have any chiral centers? The structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Let me draw it: the first carbon has Cl, CH2, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be ClCH2C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the first carbon after the double bond is CH2Cl attached to a C(CH3)=CH2. So the first carbon (the one with Cl) is CH2Cl attached to a double bond. Let me think: the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the carbons are Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the first carbon (Cl) is connected to CH2, the second carbon (C(CH3)) is double-bonded to CH2. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but C1 is Cl attached to CH2, which is attached to C2 which is connected to CH(CH3) and double bond. So C2 is CH(CH3), double bond to CH2. Does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The first carbon (C1) is CH2Cl attached to C2. C2 is CH(CH3) attached to C1 and C3. C3 is CH2 because double bond is between C1 and C2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is CH2Cl attached to C2, which is connected via double bond to C1 (which has a CH2 group). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about whether any carbon is a stereocenter. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different groups attached. Let me see the structure again: it's (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, but since it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and the double bond is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, CH2Cl is connected to C2. So C2 is CH(CH3), connected via double bond to C1, which is CH2Cl. So C1 is CH2Cl=C(CH3)-CH2? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's getting me confused. Wait, perhaps I should number from the other end. Butane has four carbons; but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, so CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with double bond. So it's CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with double bond between C1 and C2: CH2Cl=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's if it's 1-ene. So the correct structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with double bond between C1 and C2: CH2Cl=CH-CH2-CH3. But the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the substituents around the double bond would be ClCH2 and CH(CH3) on each end. So the double bond is CH2Cl–CH(CH3). Then, the substituents on each double bond carbon are:

C1: CH2Cl (so two H's and a Cl?), wait no, CH2Cl would have Cl, two H's, and a double bond to C2.

C2: CH(CH3) attached to double bond, so on C2, it's connected to CH3, two H's, and the double bond to C1.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think about the structure again. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure would be:

CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but that's possible? Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So putting a Cl on the first C and a methyl on the second C: CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl=CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but butane is four carbons, so but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2. So the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but that would be three carbons: CH2Cl, C(CH3)=CH2. Hmm, so the molecule is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. But then, how many substituents are on each carbon? On C1, we have CH2Cl and the double bond to C2. On C2, we have CH(CH3), and the double bond to C1, and perhaps a CH2 group? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because the molecule has a double bond, but if the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, then it's not a chiral center. Wait, C1 has two CH2 groups (because it's CH2Cl and maybe another CH2?), no. Alternatively, perhaps for this molecule, the Cl is on C1, which is connected via double bond to C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, connected to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), and the double bond. So each of these carbons has what substituents? C1: Cl, two H's, and double bond. C2: a methyl, two H's (maybe?), and double bond. So each of these carbons in the double bond has two substituents (Cl and H on C1; methyl and H on C2). So the double bond itself doesn't create a chiral center. So, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Looking at the carbons, perhaps the CH(CH3) is attached to C2. Wait, but in this molecule, is there a carbon with four different groups attached?

Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the C(CH3) is connected to C1 (CH2Cl), and the CH2 group is on the other side. So in the case of the double bond, the groups on each side are Cl–CH2– and CH(CH3)–. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical activity. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So I think this molecule is not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: Okay, this one's a bit complex. Let me try to parse the name. It's a hexahydro derivative, so it's a ring structure with six-membered rings perhaps. The substituents are chloromethylene at position 8, and the configuration is (3aR,7aS,E). So there's a double bond with E configuration, which might imply some kind of geometry. Now, the question is whether this compound has a chiral center. The name includes (3aR,7aS), which suggests that carbons 3a and 7a have specific configurations. So these are stereocenters because they have R and S designations. So the molecule has two stereocenters, which makes it chiral. Additionally, the E configuration in the double bond doesn't directly affect chirality, but the presence of stereocenters does. Therefore, this compound is chiral and should exhibit optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When we have 2 and 3 methyl groups, it becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The configurations are 2R and 3S. Let me draw this. Carbon 2 is R configuration: the substituents would be, around C2, the groups are CH3, CH(CH3), COOH, and another group. Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the CH(CH3) carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents? Let me think. Each of C2 and C3 has:

- C2: connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, because succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups to C2 and C3 would make them CH(CH3). So each of those carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), two CH3 groups? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to two methyl groups, and two other carbons (C1 and C3 for C2, and C2 and C4 for C3). Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups? No, wait. The structure is:

- C1: COOH
- C2: CH(CH3)
- C3: CH(CH3)
- C4: COOH

So for C2, the substituents are:

- Two CH3 groups (since it's CH(CH3))
- Connected to C1 (which is a COOH group)
- Connected to C3 (which is another CH(CH3))
Wait, no, each CH(CH3) has a CH3, two H's, and two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3). Wait, but for C2, the substituents would be:

Group 1: COO− (from C1)
Group 2: CH(CH3) (from C3)
Group 3: CH3 (from the methyl)
Group 4: H?

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So in succinic acid, the C2 and C3 are each connected to:

C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? Or perhaps it's:

C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (which is a carboxylic acid group), C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), and two hydrogens. Wait, that would mean only three different groups: CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). No, that's not correct. Let me clarify.

Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, each becomes CH(CH3). So each of those carbons is connected to:

For C2:

- One COOH (from C1)
- One CH(CH3) (from C3)
- One CH3
- One H

Wait, that can't be. Wait, if it's CH2-CH2, and you add a methyl to each, it becomes CH(CH3)-CH(CH3). So each CH(CH3) is connected to two CH3 groups, the adjacent CH(CH3), and the COOH groups on either side.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out. Let's see:

HOOC - CH(CH3) - CH(CH3) - COOH

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), two CH3 groups, and a hydrogen? Or wait, the structure is:

C1: COOH
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: COOH

So C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So the substituents on C2 are:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, but that would mean two CH3 groups, making the substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and CH3. Wait, no, because each CH(CH3) has a CH3 attached. So substituents on C2 are:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups (from the methyl substituents on C2)
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 has four different groups. Let me think about the groups attached to C2.

C2 is connected to:

1. The carboxylic acid group from C1 (HOOC-)
2. The carboxylic acid group from C4 (because C4 is the same as C2 in this case? No, C4 is the next one. Wait, no, C2 is the second carbon, so C4 is the fourth.)

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine that each C2 and C3 has:

C2: attached to C1 (which is a COOH group), C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), two CH3 groups (as substituents), and a hydrogen. So substituents are: COOH, CH(CH3), two CH3, H. Wait, that would make four substituents. So for C2:

- One substituent: COOH (from C1)
- Second: CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Third: CH3 (substituent)
- Fourth: H

Wait, that sums to four different substituents. Because COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H are all different. So yes, C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 is connected to:

- COOH (from C4)
- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- CH3 (substituent)
- H

So C3 also has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So the molecule has two chiral centers, so it's chiral, hence optically active. So this compound is optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Similar to the previous one, but with both configurations R. So the structure is the same as in number 3, but with both C2 and C3 in R configuration. So again, each of these carbons has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is also chiral and optically active.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the molecule in number 3 and number 4 have the same structure but different configurations. So both are chiral, but their configurations differ, so both will have optical activity. So both 3 and 4 are active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration is R. Let me think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. The hydroxyl is on C1, which is attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the substituents around C1 are: -OH, two adjacent CH2 groups (from the ring), and a ring substituent. Wait, no, the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond at position 3. So C1 is attached to C2 and C6 (assuming the ring is numbered 1 to 6). So the substituents on C1 would be OH, two ring carbons (C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? Or perhaps not.

Wait, but in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a cyclohexene ring where C1 has an -OH group. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is something like:

O
|
C1-OH

Connected to C2 and C6.

So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- CH2 (to C2)
- CH2 (to C6)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. In cyclohexene, each carbon is connected to two others in the ring. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. The substituents on C1 would be:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would make three substituents, which can't be because it's a carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe each carbon in the ring has two other ring carbons and two substituents. So C1 has substituents: OH, and perhaps two CH2 groups, and another substituent. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key here is whether C1 has four different groups attached. If it's (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, then that indicates that C1 is a chiral center. So the presence of the R configuration implies that there's a stereocenter at C1. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The configuration at each of these positions is s (which I think is the same as R or S, but the exact designation isn't as important as whether the substituents are different). So each of these OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) is a stereocenter. So each has four different substituents. Let me think about C1: it's connected to C2, C6, an OH group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons. So perhaps the substituents are:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (since it's cyclohexane, each neighboring carbon is a CH2)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that can't be right. In a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and two hydrogens. But if there's a hydroxyl group on C1, then the substituents would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because each carbon in cyclohexane has two CH2 groups attached (the adjacent carbons), but that would mean that the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen. Wait, that would make two CH2 groups the same, which would mean C1 isn't a chiral center. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps each C in the ring has two adjacent CH2 groups and two substituents. Wait, but in cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent CH2 groups (the ring) and two hydrogen atoms. If an OH group is added, then that replaces a hydrogen. So for C1, substituents are:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- And the remaining substituent is a hydrogen.

So the substituents are: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and H. But two of the substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups). So that would mean C1 is not a chiral center because it only has three different groups attached (OH, CH2, H). So each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have two identical substituents (the adjacent CH2 groups), making them not chiral. Therefore, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons (each CH2), and two hydrogen atoms. When you add an OH group, one of the hydrogens is replaced. So the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- H

So in terms of substituents, the groups are: OH, CH2, CH2, H. So two CH2 groups are the same, making the substituents not all different. Hence, no chirality at C1. Therefore, the molecule (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Hmm, but wait, could the positions of the hydroxyl groups create some kind of asymmetry in the molecule? Even if each individual C isn't a chiral center, maybe the overall molecule isn't symmetric. But I think that for a molecule to be chiral, it must have at least one chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like a plane of symmetry. But in this case, since all three OHs are on the same face (if the configuration is s,s,s), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is meso. Wait, if the molecule has multiple stereocenters but is meso, it wouldn't be chiral.

In this case, let's think about the (1s,3s,5s) configuration. If all three OH groups are on the same face, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups at 1,3,5 positions. If all OHs are on the same face (say, all up), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. Because you could mirror it and get the same structure. So in this case, the molecule is meso, hence not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: So the structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. The structure is: cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3). Wait, but butanone is (CH3)2CO, but in this case, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is:

O
||
C(O) - cyclopentyl
|
CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)

Wait, but wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So it's CH2CH2CH2CO. But when you substitute the first carbon with cyclopentyl, it becomes cyclopentyl-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, wait. Let me think again. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-R

But in this case, R is cyclopentyl. Wait, no, 1-cyclopentyl would be substituent on the first carbon of butanone. So butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-C(O)-

But substituting the first carbon (the C attached to the carbonyl) with cyclopentyl would give:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-, so structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-

But when you substitute the first carbon (the one connected to the carbonyl) with cyclopentyl, it becomes cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the molecule is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the carbonyl is at position 1, with a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH2CH3 group attached.

Wait, but the substituents around the carbonyl carbon (C1) would be:

- Cyclopentyl group
- CH2CH2CH3
- And two oxygen double bonds.

Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two other groups. So the substituents are cyclopentyl and CH2CH2CH3, plus the carbonyl oxygen (double bond) and a hydrogen? No, wait. For a ketone (butanone), the carbonyl is at the end. Wait, n=4 for butanone, so butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-. But substituting the first carbon with cyclopentyl would make it cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to:

- One cyclopentyl group
- One CH2-CH2-CH3 group
- And double-bonded to O.

Wait, that's only three substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of butanone as (CH3)2CO, but in this case, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is:

O
||
C(O)–C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH(CH3))

Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to write the structure properly.

Butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2–C(O)–R

But in this case, R is cyclopentyl. So, the structure is:

Cyclopentyl–C(O)–CH2–CH2–CH2– ?

Wait, but that would be pentan-1-one if the chain is longer, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl group, which is then connected to a CH2CH(CH3) group. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(O)–cyclopentyl
|
CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

No, the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the butanone part is four carbons, with substituents at position 1 and 3.

So butan-1-one is:

R–C(O)–CH2–CH2–CH3

Wait, but that's incorrect. Butan-1-one is actually (CH3)2CO, but wait, no— wait, butanone is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3, which is 2-butanone. So butan-1-one would be CH2=CH–C(O)–CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO. So the structure is:

CH2–CH2–CH2–C(O)–R

But in the given compound, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the substituents are at positions 1 and 3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(O)–(cyclopentyl)
|
CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think again. The name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the main chain is butan-1-one: four carbons with the carbonyl at position 1. So the structure is:

O
||
C(O)–R1–R2–R3–R4

But wait, no, butan-1-one is:

R–CH2–CH2–CH2–C(O)–R'

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is at the end. So butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-, but that's a ketone, so it's (CH2)2-C(O)-CH3. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up butanone structure. Butanone can be 2-butanone (which is more common), but 1-butanone would have the carbonyl at the end. So it would be CH2CH2CH2-C(O)H. But that's not possible because a ketone has two alkyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. So 1-butanone doesn't exist as a ketone. Oh wait, perhaps the name is incorrect. Because butan-1-one would require the carbonyl to be on the first carbon, but that would make it an aldehyde if it's at the end. So perhaps the correct structure for butan-1-one is impossible because it's not a ketone. Hmm, maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone or something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to interpret 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is that the carbonyl is at position 1, with a cyclopentyl group attached to it, and a methyl group at position 3. So the structure would be:

O
||
C(O)–cyclopentyl
|
CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, but that would make the chain longer than four carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The butanone is four carbons, with the carbonyl at position 1. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl–C(O)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, but that's five carbons. I'm not getting this right. Let me focus on whether this molecule has a chiral center. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1, substituents are cyclopentyl and another group. Let me imagine the structure as:

O
||
C(O)–cyclopentyl
|
CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me instead think about whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center. If the molecule has a carbon with four different substituents, then it's chiral.

Looking at the structure again, perhaps the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl, a CH2 group, and another substituent. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center because it has only three substituents (the two from the cyclopentyl and the CH2 chain, plus the double bond). So the carbonyl carbon isn't chiral.

Looking at other carbons. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (let's say C2) would be connected to the carbonyl group, a CH2 group, and perhaps a CH(CH3). So the substituents would be:

- C=O (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH2 groups.

Wait, but that's if the structure is C(O)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

In that case, at C2, substituents are:

- C(O)
- CH(CH3)
- Two CH2 groups.

So substituents are C(O), CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and another CH2 group. Wait, I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps C2 is connected to C1 (C=O), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps C2 is connected to C1 (C=O), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH2 groups. So substituents are:

- C=O (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH2 groups.

If that's the case, then substituents are C=O, CH(CH3), CH2, and CH2. So two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), making C2 not a chiral center.

Looking at C3: substituents would be C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), CH(CH3), and perhaps another substituent. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is connected to a methyl group, so substituents would be:

- C2 (CH2)
- C4 (CH2)
- CH3 (from the methyl)
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

If that's the case, substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H. So four different groups, making C3 a chiral center.

Wait, but if C3 is connected to:

- C2 (CH2–)
- C4 (CH2–)
- CH3 (methyl)
- And a hydrogen.

Then, yes, four different groups, so C3 is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center at C3, making it optically active.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at C1, which is connected to cyclopentyl and the rest of the butanone chain. The rest of the chain is:

C1 (C=O) – C2 – C3 (CH(CH3)) – C4.

So C2 is connected to C1 (C=O), C3, and two CH2 groups. So maybe C2 isn't a chiral center. C3 would be connected to C2, C4, CH3, and another group.

Wait, but in butan-1-one, the chain after the carbonyl is three carbons: C1 (C=O), C2, C3, C4. So the structure is:

C=O (C1) – C2 – C3 (CH(CH3)) – C4.

So C3 is connected to C2, C4, a methyl group, and another substituent. What's the substituent on C3? Let's imagine:

C3 is connected to:

- C2 (CH2–)
- C4 (CH2–)
- CH3 (methyl)
- And a hydrogen.

So substituents are: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H. Thus, four different groups, making C3 a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: sometimes, the presence of a plane of symmetry can make a molecule achiral despite having a stereocenter. But in this case, I don't think there's a plane of symmetry because the substituents around C3 are all different.

So, summarizing the seven compounds:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → No chiral centers → Not active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... → Yes, stereocenters → Active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Yes → Active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Yes → Active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → Yes, C1 is chiral → Active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → No chiral centers (meso) → Not active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → Yes, C3 is chiral → Active.

So, counting the active ones:

2,3,4,5,7 → five compounds.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount:

Compounds 2,3,4,5,7 are active. That's five. So the answer would be option A)5.

But wait, I thought earlier that compound 7 has a chiral center, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me revisit that.

In compound 7, if C3 is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. The groups are: C2 (CH2–), C4 (CH2–), CH3, and H. Wait, but if the chain is butanone, then after C3 is C4, which is CH2–. So C3's substituents are:

- From C2: CH2–
- From C4: CH2–
- Methyl: CH3
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would mean two substituents are CH2–, which are the same. So then, C3 has two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), making them the same. So substituents would be:

- CH2 (C2)
- CH2 (C4)
- CH3
- H

Wait, so two substituents are the same (CH2 groups), so C3 isn't a chiral center. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. So compound 7 doesn't have a chiral center, meaning it's not optically active.

So, now the count is:

2,3,4,5 → four active.

Wait, so I need to recount:

1. Not active.
2. Active.
3. Active.
4. Active.
5. Active.
6. Not active.
7. Not active.

So four active compounds. So the answer is D)4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires at least one stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents) or another form of asymmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond and no stereocenters. The substituents on the double-bonded carbons are not all different, so it lacks chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   The molecule contains stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (R) and (S) configurations. These stereocenters make the molecule chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. Each carbon is bonded to four different groups, making it chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to compound 3, this molecule has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3, each with four different substituents. It is also chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group at position 1 is attached to a carbon that has four different substituents: an -OH group, two distinct positions in the cyclohexene ring, and a hydrogen. This makes it a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are symmetrically arranged on the cyclohexane ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite the stereocenters.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a stereocenter. Other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents, so there are no stereocenters.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5. This gives a total of **4 optically active compounds**.
