Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But the specifics here are a bit tricky.

Let me read the problem again. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma for the electron is 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. So they're approaching each other.

After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The energies of both photons are the same. Oh, and the directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. So they’re both moving to the right but in opposite vertical directions. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Wait, so the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. That means their angle relative to each other is measured between their paths. Since both are in the right direction but one is above and the other is below, the angle between them would be something like twice the angle each makes with the horizontal.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of momentum conservation. Because in such collisions, momentum has to be conserved. Both particles are moving along the same line before collision, so their momenta should add up, and the photons' momenta after should add up to the same total.

Let me recall: the total momentum before the collision is the sum of the electron and positron's momenta. Since they're moving towards each other, their directions are opposite.

Wait, wait! The electron is moving from the left towards the right. The positron is moving from the right towards the left. So their velocities are opposite. But their directions are along the horizontal axis.

Wait, no, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is towards the left, same as the electron's velocity? Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says: the electron is moving from the left, so to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so to the left. Or wait, no, wait. The wording says: moving along the horizontal axis, from the left (electron), and from the right (positron). Oh, so the electron is moving to the right, and the positron is moving to the left. So they're approaching each other.

So their momenta are opposite in direction. So when they collide, their total momentum is the sum of their individual momenta.

But wait, since they have different Lorentz factors, their energies and momenta will be different.

Let me calculate the momentum of each.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given as 4 for the electron, so gamma_e =4. Similarly, gamma_p =2 for the positron.

Momentum p is gamma * m * v. But wait, in terms of gamma and mass, p = gamma m v. But for electrons and positrons, their rest mass is the same, m_e c² is the rest energy.

Alternatively, since for each particle, p = gamma * m * v, but another way, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can express p in terms of gamma and m.

Alternatively, using the relation p = gamma m v, but I think it's more convenient to express in terms of relativistic momentum in terms of the rest mass and gamma.

Wait, another approach: the relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. But for electrons and positrons, their rest mass is m_e, same for both.

But since their velocities are opposite, I need to calculate their momenta in opposite directions.

Wait, let's set the direction: let's take the electron's direction as positive. So the positron is moving in the negative direction.

So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (which would be negative since it's in the opposite direction).

Wait, but wait! The positron's velocity is directed to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the initial total momentum is p_e (to the right) plus p_p_left (to the left). Wait, no: the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is towards the left. So in terms of momentum, the positron's momentum is negative.

So for momentum, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.

But I need to find the directions. Since they're moving towards each other, their velocities are opposite.

But wait, the Lorentz factors are given as 4 and 2. So gamma_e =4, gamma_p=2.

Wait, but how do I find their velocities? Because gamma depends on velocity. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the momenta directly using the relation between gamma and momentum.

Another approach: For a particle, the momentum can be expressed as p = gamma m v. And since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), I can relate p and gamma.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute their energies and then use conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that after annihilation, two photons are produced with the same energy. So each photon has energy E_photon.

The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron. Since they are each other's antiparticles, their rest mass energies are same, 0.511 MeV each. But wait, their kinetic energies plus rest mass energies contribute to the total.

Wait, but since they are moving, their total energy is gamma * m_e c².

So the electron's total energy is gamma_e * m_e c² =4 * m_e c².

The positron's total energy is gamma_p * m_e c² =2 * m_e c².

So the total energy before collision is (4 + 2) m_e c²=6 m_e c².

After collision, the two photons have energies E1 and E2, but the problem states E1=E2. So each has energy 3 m_e c²? Because 2 photons, each has 3, so 6 total. So E_photon =3 m_e c².

Wait, wait, wait. Because m_e c² is the rest energy, 0.511 MeV. So the electron's energy is 4 * 0.511=2.044 MeV, and the positron's is 2*0.511=1.022 MeV. So total energy is 3.066 MeV. If the photons have the same energy, each should be 1.533 MeV. But wait, that's not matching with the initial idea.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In particle physics, when an electron and positron annihilate, they produce two gamma photons. Because of conservation of momentum and energy.

In this problem, the two photons have the same energy. So the energy of each photon is half the total energy. But wait, the total energy is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies.

So the total energy before is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c².

Gamma_e=4, gamma_p=2. So total energy is (4 + 2) m_e c²=6 m_e c².

So each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

But wait, each photon's energy is 3 m_e c². Hmm.

But the photons are emitted in opposite directions? Or same direction? Wait, no. The problem says each photon is moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So both are moving to the right, but one is angled upwards and the other downwards. So their momenta are in different directions.

Wait, but let me think about conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is along the horizontal axis, the total final momentum must also be along that axis. Because before collision, the particles are moving along the x-axis, so any momentum after must also be along x-axis.

So the photons' momenta must add up along the x-axis. But photons have momentum in the direction of their motion, and their momentum is E/c in that direction.

Since the photons have the same energy E, their momenta are both E/c in magnitude. But their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So the components of their momenta along the x-axis will be E/(c) * cos(theta), where theta is the angle each makes with the x-axis.

But wait, the two photons have the same energy, so same momentum magnitude, but their angles are symmetric above and below the x-axis.

Because the problem states one is upper-right and the other lower-right, so their angle with the x-axis is theta and -theta, perhaps.

Wait, but wait. If the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right, their angles with respect to the x-axis are theta and (360 - theta) perhaps? Or more accurately, symmetric above and below the x-axis.

Wait, but let's model this. Let me denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis as theta and -theta (if the other is moving in the opposite vertical direction, but same horizontal direction).

Wait, but wait no. If both are moving to the right, upper-right and lower-right, then their angles are theta and -theta with respect to the x-axis.

So for each photon, their momentum vectors are (p_x, p_y) and (p_x, -p_y). Because both are moving to the right (same x-component), but upper and lower in y.

So the sum of the momenta would be (2 p_x, 0), which needs to match the initial total momentum.

But the initial total momentum is the sum of the electron and positron's momenta.

Wait, but let's clarify. The electron is moving along the x-axis to the right, and the positron is moving to the left (since it's moving from the right direction). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, so initial momentum is p_e (right) plus p_p (left) in terms of direction. So let's compute the magnitude.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p

But because the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative.

So the initial total momentum P_initial is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative) if we're taking right as positive.

Wait, but wait! The positron's velocity is to the left, so p_p is negative.

Wait, but how do we find v_e and v_p? Since gamma_e and gamma_p are given, but we need to relate velocity to gamma.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute the momenta in terms of gamma.

Because for a particle, p = gamma * m v.

And we know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Alternatively, we can express v in terms of gamma.

Let me try to compute v_e and v_p.

For electron: gamma_e =4.

So gamma_e =4=1/sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²)

So 1/gamma_e^2 = 1 - v_e²/c²

So 1/(16) =1 - v_e²/c² => v_e²/c²=1 -1/16=15/16.

So v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly for positron: gamma_p=2.

gamma_p=2=1/sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²)

So 1/4=1 -v_p^2/c^2.

v_p^2/c^2 =1 -1/4=3/4.

v_p= c*sqrt(3/4)=c*(sqrt(3)/2)≈0.866 c.

Now, the electron's momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

=4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.

Wait, because v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute again.

gamma_e=4. So:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16)=c * sqrt(15/16)=c * (sqrt(15)/4).

So p_e=4 * m_e * (c * sqrt(15)/4 )= m_e c sqrt(15).

Similarly, positron's momentum p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.

v_p= c * sqrt(1 -1/gamma_p^2)=c * sqrt(1-1/4)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2 c.

So p_p=2 * m_e * (c * sqrt(3)/2 )= m_e c sqrt(3).

But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum P_initial is p_e (right) + p_p (left) = m_e c sqrt(15) - m_e c sqrt(3) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the electron's momentum is positive (to the right), and the positron's is negative (to the left). So the initial momentum is p_e - p_p, because p_p is in the opposite direction.

So P_initial = m_e c sqrt(15) - m_e c sqrt(3) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, wait, actually, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the initial momentum is p_e (positive) + (-p_p) (since p_p is its magnitude). So P_initial = p_e - p_p?

Wait, no, because the positron's momentum is negative. So when you add, it's p_e (right) + p_p (left), which is p_e - p_p.

So yes, P_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. The electron's velocity is to the right, so p_e is positive. The positron's velocity is to the left, so p_p is negative. So P_initial = p_e + p_p (because p_p is negative).

So P_initial = m_e c sqrt(15) + (- m_e c sqrt(3)) )= m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, the two photons have momenta p1 and p2. Each has energy E_photon =3 m_e c², since total energy is 6 m_e c², so each photon has 3 m_e c².

The momentum of each photon is E/c = (3 m_e c²)/c =3 m_e c.

So each photon has momentum magnitude p_photon=3 m_e c.

But their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So each photon's momentum vector is (p_x, p_y) and (p_x, -p_y).

So the sum of their momenta should equal the initial momentum P_initial.

So, for the x-components: 2 p_x = P_initial.

Because both photons have the same x-component, and their y-components cancel out.

Wait, but wait, no. The sum of the y-components should be zero because the initial momentum has no y-component. So p1y + p2y =0.

Since each photon's y-component is p_y and -p_y, their sum is zero.

So for the x-components, p1x + p2x= P_initial.

But since the photons are symmetric in y, the x-component for each photon is the same.

So, each photon's x-component is (P_initial) /2.

Because 2 * p_photon_x = P_initial.

So p_photon_x= (P_initial)/2.

But each photon's momentum magnitude is 3 m_e c.

So, the x-component is 3 m_e c * cos(theta), where theta is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis (since they are symmetric, same magnitude of theta).

So, 3 m_e c * cos(theta) = (P_initial)/2.

But P_initial is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, let me plug that in.

3 m_e c cos(theta) = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

3 cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 2.

So,

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / (6 )

Hmm, let me compute that value.

Calculating sqrt(15): approx 3.87298.

sqrt(3): approx 1.73205.

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = approx 3.87298 -1.73205=2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6≈0.35682.

So cos(theta)≈0.35682.

Taking arccos: theta≈69 degrees.

Wait, but arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69 degrees.

Wait, maybe exactly 69.5 or something. Let me check using calculator.

But wait, another approach: Let me compute (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6.

sqrt(15)=3.872983346, sqrt(3)=1.732050808.

Subtract: 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 = 2.140932538.

Divide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 = 0.3568220897.

So cos(theta)=0.356822. So theta is arccos(0.356822).

Calculating that: let me think. Cos(60 degrees)=0.5, cos(90)=0, so 0.3568 is between 60 and 90. Let me compute it.

Using a calculator, arccos(0.356822) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, 69 degrees?

Wait, cos(60)=0.5.

cos(70)= approx 0.3420.

Wait, wait, 0.3568 is a bit higher than 0.3420 (which is 70 degrees). So the angle would be a bit less than 70 degrees, perhaps around 69 degrees.

Wait, but wait: 0.3568 is between cos(69) and cos(68). Let me think:

cos(69)= approx 0.3584.

Hmm, wait, that's close.

Wait, if I compute cos(69 degrees):

69 degrees: cos(69)=0.3584.

Our value is 0.3568. So it's slightly less than 69 degrees.

So theta≈68.5 degrees.

But wait, the problem is asking for the angle between the two photons.

Since each photon is at theta and -theta, the angle between them is 2*theta.

Wait, no. Because if one is at theta above x-axis, the other is theta below. So the angle between them is 2 theta.

So, if theta is about 69 degrees, the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.

Wait, let me compute 2*68.5=137, so approximately 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

So the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_e = 4 \).
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_p = 2 \).
   - After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy \( E_{\text{photon}} \), moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions.

2. **Conservation Laws**:
   - **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
     \]
     Since the photons have equal energy, each photon has energy:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.
     \]

   - **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using relativistic momentum:
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e, \quad p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p,
     \]
     where \( v_e \) and \( v_p \) are the velocities of the electron and positron, respectively. From the Lorentz factor \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), the velocities are calculated as:
     \[
     v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = c \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}}, \quad v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = c \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}.
     \]
     Substituting these into the momentum expressions:
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e c \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = m_e c \sqrt{15}, \quad p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e c \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
     \]
     Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. The total initial momentum is:
     \[
     P_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - Each photon has energy \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2 \), so its momentum magnitude is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c.
     \]
   - The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, making angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) with the x-axis. Their momentum components are:
     \[
     p_{x,1} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{y,1} = p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta,
     \]
     \[
     p_{x,2} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{y,2} = -p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta.
     \]
     The total momentum after annihilation is:
     \[
     P_{\text{final}} = (p_{x,1} + p_{x,2}, p_{y,1} + p_{y,2}) = (2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, 0).
     \]
     By conservation of momentum, \( P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{initial}} \), so:
     \[
     2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]

4. **Solving for \( \theta \)**:
   - Substituting \( p_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c \):
     \[
     2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
     \]
     \[
     6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
     \]
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
     \]
   - Approximating:
     \[
     \sqrt{15} \approx 3.873, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732,
     \]
     \[
     \cos\theta \approx \frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.357.
     \]
     \[
     \theta \approx \arccos(0.357) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

5. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The photons are symmetrically placed around the x-axis, one at \( +\theta \) and the other at \( -\theta \). The angle between them is:
     \[
     \phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
