Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the setup is that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. 

We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the T1 calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so let me break this down. Let me think about what I know. In nuclear fission, when a nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, they usually have some kinetic energy because the process is exothermic, and they fly apart due to the Coulomb repulsion. But in this problem, they are probably considering the energy released in the rest mass, so maybe we're dealing with relativistic effects here.

The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So that's the total energy before fission. After fission, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So the remaining 1% must have been converted into kinetic energy or other forms like binding energy or radiation, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so probably not considering any other particles except the two fragments.

Wait, wait. The rest mass of the system after fission is 0.99 M. So the initial energy was Mc² = 300 GeV. The rest mass after is 0.99 M, so their rest mass energy is 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV. So the mass defect is 3 GeV, which must have been converted into kinetic energy and possibly other energies like gamma rays or neutrinos, but the problem seems to focus on the kinetic energy of the fragments.

Assuming all the mass defect goes into kinetic energy, the total kinetic energy of both fragments would be 3 GeV. But wait, in reality, actually, in fission, the energy released is about 3% of the initial mass energy, so this seems consistent.

So the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is 3 GeV. But wait, the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So I need to find T1 correctly using relativity, and then compare it to the non-relativistic (classical) approximation.

First, let me figure out the masses of the two fragments. The initial mass is M. After fission, the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum: 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is twice that, so 0.66 M. Wait, but 0.66 + 0.33 is 0.99, which is correct.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.33 M times 2 is 0.66 M, plus 0.33 M is 0.99 M. Yes, that's right.

But wait, the initial mass was M, so the rest mass after is 0.99 M, which is 0.99 * M. So m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M.

Wait, no, wait again. Because the sum is m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. And m1 = 2 m2.

So m1 = 2 m2 → m1 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. So m1 = 0.66 M. So yes, m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M.

But wait, the rest mass energy of the initial is 300 GeV. So the mass of the initial nucleus is M = 300 GeV / c². But since I'm working in units where c=1, probably, so M = 300 GeV.

Wait, but in reality, I have to be careful with units. Let's see.

So, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV / c². But in the problem, when it says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M, that's in terms of the rest masses. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So, now, in the rest frame of the initial nucleus (since it's at rest before fission), the two fragments will move in opposite directions with some velocities. Because of conservation of momentum, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So since momentum p = gamma m v, but in the rest frame, initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after must be zero. So m1 v1 = m2 v2. Wait, but because m1 is twice m2, so m1 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

Wait, but velocity is in opposite directions, so probably using vectors, the velocities would have opposite signs.

But perhaps it's easier to consider the energy and momentum conservation. Let me think about the energies.

In the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the energy before is just the rest mass energy, 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has rest mass energy (m1 c² and m2 c²) plus kinetic energy (K1 and K2). So the total energy after is (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2) = (m1 + m2) c² + (K1 + K2) = 0.99 M c² + (K1 + K2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV + (K1 + K2) = 297 GeV + (K1 + K2).

But the initial energy is 300 GeV. So 300 GeV = 297 GeV + (K1 + K2). Therefore, K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV.

Now, in non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But in reality, when velocities are significant (i.e., when the fragments are moving at speeds where relativistic effects are non-negligible), we have to use the relativistic expressions for kinetic energy and momentum.

In the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the fragments move with some velocities. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m1) as v1, and the other (m2) as v2, but in opposite directions. So, from conservation of momentum, the momentum of each must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Momentum is p = gamma m v. So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But wait, because m1 = 2 m2, and the direction of velocities is opposite, so if v1 is positive, v2 is negative. So in magnitude, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 |v2|.

But perhaps it's better to write it as gamma1 m1 v1 + gamma2 m2 v2 = 0, but since v2 is negative, so maybe handling it as vectors.

Alternatively, since they have to balance, the momentum magnitudes must satisfy gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since m1 = 2 m2, we can write:

gamma1 * 2 m2 * v1 = gamma2 * m2 * v2.

Cancel m2:

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But what else do we know? The kinetic energies are K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c^2, and K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c^2.

Wait, because relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

So, K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

Another approach: perhaps using the fact that the total energy is conserved and momentum is conserved, I can set up equations to solve for velocities or gamma factors.

But this might get complicated. Let me think of another approach. Maybe using the invariant quantity in relativity, the total energy squared minus (momentum c)^2 equals (rest mass c^2)^2.

Wait, but for each fragment, the invariant is (E_i)^2 = (p_i c)^2 + (m_i c^2)^2.

In the initial frame, the total momentum is zero, so the vector sum of the two momenta must be zero. So p1 = -p2.

So, |p1| = |p2|.

So, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, and p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal. So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 |v2|.

But given that m1 = 2 m2, this becomes:

gamma1 * 2 m2 * v1 = gamma2 * m2 * |v2|

Cancel m2: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 |v2|.

But since the fragments are moving in opposite directions, |v2| = v2 (assuming v2 is positive) and v1 is positive. Wait, not sure, but perhaps it's better to write v2 as negative. So, let me write v2 = - u, where u is positive, so the velocities are in opposite directions.

So then, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 (-u). And since p1 + p2 =0,

gamma1 m1 v1 - gamma2 m2 u = 0 → gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 u.

But m1 = 2 m2, so:

gamma1 * 2 m2 v1 = gamma2 m2 u → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 u.

So, 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 u.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the most straightforward path. Maybe I can relate the kinetic energies.

We have K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²
K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c²

We also have from momentum:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 u. (since p1 = p2, but opposite direction, but in magnitude, they're equal.)

Wait, but the velocities v1 and u are in opposite directions. So, perhaps v1 = u, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no, in this case, wait. Let me think: if the initial nucleus is at rest, and it splits into two fragments, they must move in opposite directions with velocities such that their momenta cancel.

But in terms of magnitudes, their momenta must be equal, but their velocities depend on their masses and their gamma factors.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the total kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass energy. Wait, 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy, but the rest mass energies are about 297 GeV, so 3 GeV is about 1% of that. So, non-relativistic approximation might be acceptable, but the problem is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the non-relativistic approximation.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, and the sum of rest masses is 297 GeV, so the energy released is 3 GeV, which is 1% of 300 GeV. So, 3 GeV divided by 297 GeV is about 1% of the rest mass energy. So the kinetic energies are about 1% of the rest mass energy. So, the velocities would be low, perhaps non-relativistic.

Wait, but in that case, why would the relativistic calculation and the non-relativistic approximation give a significant difference? Because for small velocities, the kinetic energy in relativity is approximately (1/2) m v² plus higher-order terms. So the difference between the correct relativistic KE and the non-relativistic approximation would be small, but perhaps the problem is expecting a certain value.

Alternatively, maybe the velocities are non-negligible in a relativistic sense because the mass is split into 2:1, leading to higher speeds for the lighter fragment.

Wait, perhaps the velocities are not that small, so the relativistic effects are noticeable. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as an explosion where the two fragments are pushed apart with equal and opposite momenta, and their kinetic energies sum to 3 GeV.

But let me think: since the rest masses sum to 0.99 M, the total rest mass is 0.99 M, and the initial rest mass was M. So the energy gained is 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV (since M c² is 300 GeV). So 3 GeV is the total KE, split between the two fragments.

But the KE is 3 GeV, so each fragment's KE would be a fraction of that.

But how to find T1, the KE of the more massive fragment?

Wait, the more massive fragment is m1 = 0.66 M, the lighter is m2=0.33 M. So their rest mass energies are 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV, and 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So, in the rest frame, their kinetic energies are K1 and K2, with K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

In the non-relativistic approximation, the KEs would be (1/2) m v². But perhaps in reality, the velocities are such that we need to use relativistic expressions.

But perhaps using the center-of-momentum frame here would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in the initial rest frame, the velocities are small enough that the non-relativistic approximation is close, but we need to find the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as a system where the two fragments are moving apart with equal and opposite momenta, so the total momentum is zero. Then, each fragment's kinetic energy can be found using relativistic expressions.

So, let me set up the equations.

Let me denote:

E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² = rest energy + K1
E2 = gamma2 * m2 c² = rest energy + K2

And the momentum of each fragment is:

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1
p2 = gamma2 m2 v2

Since momentum must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, p1 = -p2.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

But since I'm considering magnitudes, I can write |gamma1 m1 v1| = |gamma2 m2 v2|.

But v2 is in the opposite direction, so perhaps I can take v2 = - (gamma1 m1 v1 / (gamma2 m2 )).

But perhaps it's easier to express v2 in terms of v1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio of the velocities. Since the momentum magnitudes are equal,

gamma1 m1 |v1| = gamma2 m2 |v2|.

But from the problem setup, m1 = 2 m2. So,

gamma1 (2 m2) |v1| = gamma2 m2 |v2|

Simplify: 2 gamma1 |v1| = gamma2 |v2|.

Hmm, but without knowing the relation between v1 and v2, this may not help directly.

Wait, another approach: in the non-relativistic case, KE is (1/2) m v². So perhaps in that approximation, the velocities would be v1 ≈ sqrt(2 K1 / m1), and v2 ≈ sqrt(2 K2 / m2).

But in reality, the velocities are higher due to relativistic effects, so the KE would be higher than the non-relativistic calculation.

Wait, but I'm supposed to compare the correct T1 with the non-relativistic T1. So perhaps I can calculate T1 relativistically and T1_nonrel, then find the difference.

But I'm not sure how to proceed, so maybe I can assume that since the KE is small compared to rest mass energy, the non-relativistic approximation is valid, but perhaps the difference comes from the fact that when the KE is not zero, the rest mass is effectively reduced? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that in the initial rest frame, the total energy is 300 GeV, and the total energy after is 297 GeV plus 3 GeV of KE. So, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV.

But how to find the individual KEs.

Wait, perhaps using the energy and momentum conservation to find the velocities.

Let me write down the energy and momentum equations.

The initial energy is E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has energy E1 and E2, where E1 = (m1 c²) gamma1, E2 = (m2 c²) gamma2.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Momentum is conserved, so:

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

And p1 + p2 = 0 → gamma1 m1 v1 + gamma2 m2 v2 = 0.

But since the velocities are in opposite directions, perhaps v2 = - (gamma1 m1 v1) / (gamma2 m2 )

Given m1 = 2 m2,

v2 = - (gamma1 (2 m2) v1) / (gamma2 m2 )

= - (2 gamma1 v1) / gamma2.

Hmm.

So, v2 is proportional to v1 but in the opposite direction.

But how to proceed. Maybe I can express the energies and momenta in terms of v1, and then find equations to solve.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between energy and momentum.

For each fragment,

E_i^2 = (p_i c)^2 + (m_i c²)^2.

So,

E1^2 = (p1 c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2,

E2^2 = (p2 c)^2 + (m2 c^2)^2.

But p1 = -p2, so |p1| = |p2| = p.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of momentum for each fragment.

So,

E1 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Additionally, the sum of kinetic energies is K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

K1 = E1 - m1 c^2,

K2 = E2 - m2 c^2.

So,

(E1 - m1 c^2) + (E2 - m2 c^2) = 3 GeV.

Which simplifies to E1 + E2 - (m1 + m2) c^2 = 3 GeV.

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, and M c^2 = 300 GeV, so (m1 + m2) c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV = 297 GeV + 3 GeV.

Which matches.

So, now I have two equations:

1. E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

2. E1 = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m1 c^2)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m2 c^2)^2 )

But m1 = 2 m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait, M = 300 GeV / c², so m1 = 0.66 M = 0.66 * 300 GeV / c² = 198 GeV / c².

m2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV / c² = 99 GeV / c².

So,

m1 c^2 = 198 GeV,

m2 c^2 = 99 GeV.

So,

E1 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (198)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (99)^2 )

Wait, because m c^2 is in GeV, so when squared, it's (GeV)^2.

So,

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + 198^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + 99^2 )

So, the sum E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Let me denote x = p c. Then,

E1 = sqrt( x^2 + 198^2 )

E2 = sqrt( x^2 + 99^2 )

So,

sqrt(x^2 + 198^2) + sqrt(x^2 + 99^2) = 300.

Let me write this equation as:

sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300.

This looks like a solvable equation for x.

Let me denote A = 198, B =99.

So,

sqrt(x² + A²) + sqrt(x² + B²) = 300.

Let me call the first term S = sqrt(x² + A²), the second term T = sqrt(x² + B²).

So S + T =300.

I can square both sides:

S² + 2 S T + T² = 300².

But S² = x² + A²,

T² = x² + B².

So,

x² + A² + 2 S T + x² + B² = 90000.

Simplify,

2 x² + A² + B² + 2 S T = 90000.

Now,

A=198, B=99.

So A² = 39204, B²=9801.

Sum 39204 + 9801 = 49005.

So,

2 x² + 49005 + 2 S T =90000 →

2 x² + 2 S T = 90000 -49005 =40995.

Divide both sides by 2:

x² + S T = 20497.5.

Now, from S + T=300,

We can express S T = (S + T)^2 - (S² + T²) ) / 2.

Wait, S T = [ (S + T)^2 - (S² + T²) ] / 2.

We have S + T =300, and S² + T² = 2 x² + A² + B² = 2 x² + 49005.

So,

S T = [300² - (2 x² +49005)] / 2.

= [90000 - 2 x² -49005] / 2.

Compute 90000 -49005 =40995.

So,

S T = (40995 - 2 x² ) / 2.

Substituting back into the earlier equation:

x² + (40995 - 2 x² ) / 2 =20497.5.

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominator:

2 x² + 40995 - 2 x² = 40995.

Wait, that's:

2 x² +40995 - 2 x² = 40995 → 40995 =40995.

Which is an identity. Hmm, that suggests that the equation reduces to an identity, meaning that our approach may not be sufficient, and I need another strategy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it numerically since the equation is sqrt(x² +198²) + sqrt(x² +99²) =300.

Let me denote y = x².

So,

sqrt(y + 198²) + sqrt(y +99²) =300.

Let me call this equation (1).

Let me denote sqrt(y + 198²) = a, sqrt(y +99²) =b.

So a + b=300.

Squaring both sides,

a² + 2 a b + b² = 90000.

But a² = y + 198²= y + 39204,

b² = y +99²= y + 9801.

So a² + b² = 2 y + 49005.

So,

2 y +49005 + 2 a b =90000 → 2 y =90000 -49005 -2 a b → 2 y=40995 - 2 a b → y= (40995/2) - a b.

But a + b=300 → a=300 -b.

So,

y= 20497.5 - (300 -b) b.

= 20497.5 -300 b + b².

But also, from equation (1), a= sqrt(y + 39204),

and since a=300 -b,

300 -b = sqrt( y + 39204 ).

Square both sides:

(300 -b)^2 = y + 39204.

Expand:

90000 -600 b + b² = y +39204.

But y=20497.5 - 300 b + b².

Substitute:

90000 -600 b + b² = (20497.5 -300 b + b² ) + 39204.

Simplify RHS:

20497.5 +39204 =59701.5.

So,

90000 -600 b + b² =59701.5 -300 b + b².

Cancel b² from both sides:

90000 -600 b =59701.5 -300 b.

Bring all terms to left:

90000 -600b -59701.5 +300b =0 → (90000-59701.5) + (-600b +300b)=0 → 30298.5 -300b=0 → 300b=30298.5 → b=30298.5 /300 → b=100.995 GeV.

Wait, wait, but b is sqrt(y +99²) GeV? Wait, no, in our setup, y is x², which is (p c)^2.

Wait, maybe I should be careful with the units. Let me see.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach numerically.

Let me make an initial guess for x. Let me assume that x is small compared to 198 and 99. But wait, 3 GeV is the KE, so 3 GeV is 3 * 1e9 eV, but the rest masses are in hundreds of GeV. So perhaps x is small, so the sqrt terms can be approximated.

Wait, but let me try to compute sqrt(x^2 +198^2) + sqrt(x^2 +99^2) =300.

Assume that x is small compared to 198 and 99, so sqrt(x^2 + A^2) ≈ A + x²/(2 A).

So,

sqrt(x²+198²) ≈198 + x²/(2*198),

sqrt(x² +99²) ≈99 + x²/(2*99).

So their sum ≈198 +99 + x² (1/(2*198) +1/(2*99)) )= 297 + x² ( (1/(396) ) + (1/(198)) ) ) = 297 + x² ( (1 + 2)/(396) ) )=297 + x² (3/(396))=297 + x² (1/132).

Set this equal to 300:

297 + x²/(132) ≈300 → x²/(132) =3 → x²=396 →x= sqrt(396) ≈19.8997 GeV/c.

Wait, but wait, this is a rough approximation, but let's see if it gets us close.

Now, let me compute the actual sum with x=19.8997:

sqrt(19.8997^2 + 198^2 ) = sqrt(396 + 39204) = sqrt(39600) = 199 GeV.

sqrt(19.8997^2 +99^2 )= sqrt(396 +9801)= sqrt(102, 997) ≈101 GeV.

Wait, 199 +101=300. So that works. So the approximation worked.

So x= sqrt(396) GeV/c.

So p = x/c = sqrt(396)/(c) GeV/c. Wait, no, x is p c, so x = p c → p = x/c → but in units where c=1, p=x.

Wait, perhaps I should think in natural units where c=1, so x = p.

Thus, p=19.8997 GeV.

Now, with p known, we can find E1 and E2.

E1 = sqrt( p² + m1² ) = sqrt(396 + (198)^2 ) → sqrt(396 +39204) = sqrt(39600)=199 GeV.

E2= sqrt(396 +99^2 )=sqrt(396 +9801)=sqrt(10197)≈100.995 GeV.

So,

E1=199 GeV,

E2=100.995 GeV.

So the kinetic energies are:

K1= E1 -198 GeV=199 -198=1 GeV.

K2=E2 -99 GeV=100.995 -99=1.995 GeV.

So total KE: 1 +1.995=2.995 GeV≈3 GeV, which matches.

So, the more massive fragment (m1) has K1=1 GeV.

But wait, that's the correct relativistic calculation. Now, let me compute what the non-relativistic approximation would give.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

But velocities can be found from momentum: p = m v.

So, for m1:

p1= m1 v1 → v1= p1/(m1).

Similarly, v2= p2/(m2).

But since p1 = p2 (in magnitude) and m2=0.5 m1,

v2= p/(0.5 m1 )= 2 p/(m1 )= 2 v1.

So, v2 =2 v1.

But in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be:

K1_nonrel= (1/2) m1 v1^2,

K2_nonrel= (1/2) m2 v2^2 = (1/2)(0.5 m1)( (2 v1)^2 )= (1/2)(0.5 m1)(4 v1^2 )= (1/2)(0.5 *4 m1 v1^2 )= (1/2)(2 m1 v1^2 )= m1 v1^2.

So,

K1_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v1^2,

K2_nonrel = m1 v1^2.

Total non-rel KE: (3/2) m1 v1^2 =3 GeV (since the actual KE is 3 GeV, but this is non-relativistic, so maybe it's different).

Wait, but wait, in reality, the sum of the KEs is 3 GeV. But in the non-relativistic approach, if we're assuming that the KEs are (1/2) m v², then their sum should also be 3 GeV. So,

(3/2) m1 v1^2 =3 GeV → m1 v1^2 =2 GeV.

But since m1 =198 GeV/c²,

v1^2 =2 GeV / (198 GeV/c²) ) * c² → v1²= (2 GeV) * c² / 198 GeV → v1²= (2/198) c².

So,

v1= c * sqrt(2/198 ) ≈c * sqrt(0.010101)≈c * 0.1005.

But in reality, from the relativistic calculation, the K1 is 1 GeV. Let me compute what the non-relativistic K1 would be.

K1_nonrel= (1/2) m1 v1^2.

But m1=198 GeV/c²,

v1²= (2 GeV c² ) / (198 GeV ) ) → v1²= (2 c² )/(198 ) → (1/99) c².

So,

K1_nonrel= 0.5 *198 GeV/c² * (1/99) c² ) → 0.5 * (198/99 ) GeV → 0.5 *2 GeV=1 GeV.

Wait, but that's the same as the correct relativistic calculation. Hmm, that can't be right because the non-relativistic and relativistic results are the same. But that's not possible because with relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is higher than the non-relativistic approximation. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, no, perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the calculation is done under the assumption that velocities are small, so gamma is approximately 1. But in this case, the KE is small, so maybe the non-relativistic approximation is accurate, leading to the same value.

Wait, but the relativistic K1 was 1 GeV, and the non-relativistic K1 is also 1 GeV. So the difference would be zero. But that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the non-relativistic case. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should not have assumed that the sum of non-relativistic KEs equals 3 GeV. Because in reality, in the relativistic case, the sum of KEs is 3 GeV, but in the non-relativistic case, the sum might not be 3 GeV but something else.

Wait, no, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M, so the energy released is 1%, which is 3 GeV. So in reality, the sum of the KEs is 3 GeV.

But perhaps in the non-relativistic approximation, the energy comes from the mass defect, but the way the velocities are determined is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would treat the problem as the two fragments moving with velocities such that their momenta are equal and opposite, but using non-relativistic equations.

So, in non-relativistic case, p = m v.

So,

m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Since m1=2 m2, v2= 2 v1.

So,

v2=2 v1.

The total KE would be (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2².

= (1/2)(2 m2) v1² + (1/2) m2 (2 v1 )².

= (1/2)(2 m2 v1² ) + (1/2)(m2 *4 v1² )

= m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² =3 m2 v1².

But m1 + m2 =0.99 M → 2 m2 +m2 =3 m2 =0.99 M → m2=0.33 M.

But M=300 GeV/c², so m2=0.33 *300=99 GeV/c².

So,

3 m2 v1² =3 *99 * v1² =297 v1^2.

But the total KE is 3 GeV, so 297 v1^2=3 → v1²=3/297=1/99 → v1=1/sqrt(99) c≈0.1005 c.

So,

K1_nonrel= (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)(198 GeV/c²)( (1/99) c² )= (1/2)(198 * (1/99)) GeV → (1/2)(2 GeV )=1 GeV.

Which again gives the same result as the relativistic case. So the difference would be zero, but that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is to find the difference between the correct T1 and the T1 calculated using the classical approximation.

In this case, both give T1=1 GeV, so the difference is zero. But that's not among the options, which are 2,5,10,20 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the non-relativistic approach gives the same result.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is calculated as (1/2) m v², but the correct approach uses the relativistic formula which is higher.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should redo the non-relativistic calculation without assuming the sum of KEs is 3 GeV.

Wait, no, because the problem says the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so the energy release is 3 GeV, which goes into the KEs. So both relativistic and non-relativistic cases have KEs summing to 3 GeV.

But earlier calculation shows that in both cases, K1=1 GeV, so the difference is zero. Which isn't an option. So I must have done something wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps the error is in the initial assumption that the non-relativistic case sums to 3 GeV. Because in reality, in non-relativistic case, the mass defect is treated differently.

Wait, perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect, which is 3 GeV. So in non-relativistic case, the KE is 3 GeV, split between the fragments according to their masses.

Wait, but how?

Wait, in non-relativistic, the total KE is 3 GeV, but how is it split between the two fragments.

In non-relativistic case, the fragments would have velocities v1 and v2 such that m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Since m1=2 m2, v2=2 v1.

The KE for each fragment would be (1/2) m v^2.

So,

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2,

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2^2 = (1/2) m2 (2 v1 )^2 = (1/2)(4 m2 v1^2 )= 2 m2 v1^2.

So,

K1 + K2 = (1/2)(2 m2) v1^2 +2 m2 v1^2 = m2 v1^2 + 2 m2 v1^2 =3 m2 v1^2.

Set equal to 3 GeV:

3 m2 v1^2=3 GeV → m2 v1^2=1 GeV.

Since m2 =99 GeV/c²,

v1^2= (1 GeV )/(99 GeV/c² )= (1/99) c² → v1= c/sqrt(99) ≈0.1005 c.

So,

K1= (1/2) *198 GeV/c² * ( (1/99) c^2 )= (1/2) * (198/99 ) GeV → (1/2)*2 GeV=1 GeV.

Same result again. Hmm.

But according to the correct relativistic approach, K1 is 1 GeV. So the difference between correct and non-relativistic is zero. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem states that the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 =0.99 M.

The initial rest mass energy is M c^2=300 GeV. So the mass defect is 1% of 300 GeV, which is 3 GeV. Which is the energy released, going into kinetic energy.

But wait, perhaps the mass defect is actually (M - (m1 +m2 )) c^2 =3 GeV. So that's correct.

In the relativistic calculation, K1 came out to be 1 GeV, which is correct.

In the non-relativistic calculation, it's also 1 GeV, so difference is zero. But the options don't have zero.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would give a different result. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is calculated as the work done, which is the mass defect multiplied by c², but when the fragments are moving, their kinetic energy may be less than the mass defect.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach assumes that the entire mass defect goes into the kinetic energy, but distributed in a way that doesn't account for relativistic effects.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would calculate the kinetic energy of each fragment based on the average velocity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Let me think about the correct approach.

In the correct relativistic case, the KE of the more massive fragment is 1 GeV.

In the non-relativistic approximation, perhaps it's calculated as (1/2) m v², but the velocity is higher, leading to a higher KE.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that in non-relativistic case, K1 is also 1 GeV. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach doesn't account for the fact that the fragments' velocities must be balanced in momentum, leading to a lower KE than the relativistic case.

Wait, no, earlier calculation shows same value. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the relativistic KE is higher than the non-relativistic, leading to a positive difference.

Wait, but in the calculation, both give 1 GeV. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the assumption that in the non-relativistic case, the sum of KEs is 3 GeV. Maybe the non-relativistic approach doesn't account for the fact that some energy is lost as binding energy or radiation, but the problem states to ignore electrons, so perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the fragments' kinetic energies are calculated based on the assumption that the total energy after fission is (m1 +m2) c² + KE, but the rest mass energy is M c². So, in non-relativistic, the KE would be (M - (m1 +m2 )) c² =3 GeV, but distributed between the fragments.

But how?

In non-relativistic, the KE is split based on mass and velocity.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would model the energy as (m1 +m2) c² + KE = M c² → KE=3 GeV.

But in non-relativistic, the KEs are K1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2, K2=(1/2) m2 v2^2.

And from momentum, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2 ) v1 = 2 v1.

So,

K2 = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 *4 v1^2 = 2 m2 v1^2.

So,

K1 + K2 = (1/2) m1 v1^2 +2 m2 v1^2.

But m1=2 m2, so,

= (1/2)(2 m2) v1^2 +2 m2 v1^2 = m2 v1^2 + 2 m2 v1^2 =3 m2 v1^2.

Set to 3 GeV:

3 m2 v1^2 =3 GeV → m2 v1^2=1 GeV.

v1^2 =1 GeV / m2.

But m2=99 GeV/c²,

v1^2= (1 GeV )/(99 GeV/c² )= (1/99) c^2.

So,

v1= c/ sqrt(99) ≈0.1005 c.

Then,

K1= (1/2) m1 v1^2 = (1/2)(198 GeV/c²)( (1/99) c^2 )= (1/2)(198/99) GeV → (1/2)(2) GeV=1 GeV.

Same result again.

So, the non-relativistic K1 is 1 GeV, same as the relativistic case.

So the difference would be zero, which isn't an option.

But the problem says to find the difference. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the energy in the center of momentum frame, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing the fact that the rest mass energy is not just the initial mass, but the fragments have their own rest masses.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the relativistic calculation gives K1=1 GeV, but the non-relativistic would give a different value.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would not account for the fact that the fragments are moving, so their rest mass is less than the initial mass, leading to a higher KE.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Since in all methods, the relativistic and non-relativistic K1 are the same, perhaps the correct answer is zero difference, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the problem in natural units where c=1.

So,

M=300 GeV,

m1=0.66 M=198 GeV,

m2=0.33 M=99 GeV.

The energy after fission is 297 GeV + K1 + K2=300 GeV → K1 + K2=3 GeV.

In the relativistic case, solving gives K1=1 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, same.

So difference is zero. But no option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant the difference between the correct and non-relativistic T1, but perhaps the non-relativistic T1 is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Let me assume that the non-relativistic approach would not consider the increase in mass due to kinetic energy, so it would calculate the velocity based purely on the mass defect.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would calculate the kinetic energy as the work done, which is the mass defect times c², but distributed proportionally.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would say that the more massive fragment has more KE because it's heavier.

But according to the correct relativistic calculation, the more massive fragment has less KE than the lighter one, which seems counterintuitive.

Wait, but in our calculation, m1 is 198 GeV, m2 is 99 GeV. The more massive fragment has K1=1 GeV, and K2=2 GeV.

Wait, that's the opposite of what one might expect. The lighter fragment has more KE because it's moving faster.

Hmm.

But according to the relativistic calculation, that's correct because the lighter fragment has a higher velocity, so its KE is higher.

In the non-relativistic case, the lighter fragment has higher KE because it's moving faster. So perhaps the non-relativistic calculation would give K1_nonrel=1 GeV and K2_nonrel=2 GeV, same as the relativistic case.

Thus, the difference is zero. But again, no option.

I'm really stuck here. Since the options are in MeV, perhaps the difference is small, around a few MeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check:

The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, which is 300,000 MeV.

The correct T1 is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

The non-relativistic T1 is also 1 GeV, so difference is zero.

But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach uses the classical formula for kinetic energy but doesn't account for the fact that the fragments are moving, so their rest mass is higher than the non-relativistic case.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would have T1_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v^2, but the velocity is higher than in the correct relativistic case, leading to a higher T1_nonrel.

But according to my earlier calculation, in non-relativistic case, T1_nonrel=1 GeV, same as correct.

Wait, maybe I should think about the kinetic energy in terms of the energy released.

Energy released is 3 GeV. In the correct relativistic calculation, T1=1 GeV, T2=2 GeV.

In non-relativistic, same.

So the difference is zero. So the correct answer would be zero, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the difference in terms of neglecting relativistic effects, leading to a small difference. For example, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would calculate a higher T1, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocities in the non-relativistic case and the relativistic case, then compute the kinetic energies.

In the non-relativistic case, v1= c/sqrt(99) ≈0.1005 c.

So,

gamma1= 1/sqrt(1 -v1^2 )=1/sqrt(1 - (1/99))=sqrt(99/(98))≈1.00504.

So,

K1_rel= (gamma1 -1) m1 c^2 = (1.00504 -1)*198 GeV=0.00504 *198 GeV≈1.000 GeV.

Which is what I calculated earlier.

In the non-relativistic case, K1_nonrel= (1/2) m1 v1^2 = (1/2)(198 GeV/c²)( (1/99)c² )= (1/2)(2 GeV)=1 GeV.

So, the relativistic K1 is 1 GeV, non-relativistic is also 1 GeV. So the difference is 0 GeV, or 0 MeV. But that's not an option.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1 for the more massive fragment, but I'm getting them the same.

Hmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me think about the initial setup.

Wait, the problem says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M, but perhaps the initial mass is M, and the rest masses after are 99% of M. So the mass defect is 1% of M, which is 3 GeV.

But perhaps in the relativistic case, the total energy includes the rest masses plus kinetic energies, which sum to M c^2.

Which is what I did.

I think I'm stuck. All calculations lead to the same T1 for both cases, which suggests the difference is zero, but that's not an option. Perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial problem statement.

Ah! Wait a minute. The problem says the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So m1 +m2 =0.99 M.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, M is the rest mass of the initial nucleus. So M=300 GeV/c².

So, m1 +m2=0.99 M=0.99 *300 GeV/c²=297 GeV/c².

But earlier, I said m1=2 m2, so 3 m2=297 GeV/c² → m2=99 GeV/c², m1=198 GeV/c².

Yes, that's correct.

So, the rest mass energies are 99 GeV and 198 GeV.

So, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV.

After fission, the rest mass energy is 297 GeV, so the energy released is 3 GeV, which is the sum of the kinetic energies.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem considers the kinetic energy in the center-of-momentum frame, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to ignore the fact that the rest masses sum to 0.99 M, and instead treats the kinetic energy as the entire 3% of the rest mass, but that's not the case.

I'm stuck. Since all methods give the same K1, perhaps the intended answer is that the difference is zero, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is considered as the entire 3 GeV, but distributed in a way that doesn't conserve momentum.

Wait, in non-relativistic, the momentum is conserved, so in that case, the velocity of the more massive fragment is lower, leading to a lower KE.

But earlier calculations show the same KE.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is 2 MeV, option A.

But I can't see how that arises. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the relativistic KE and the non-relativistic KE, then find the difference.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would have T1_nonrel= (1/2) m1 v1^2.

But from the correct relativistic case, v1 is 0.1005 c, which is about 3e8 m/s.

But in reality, the relativistic velocity would be slightly higher, but in this case, the non-relativistic and relativistic KEs are the same.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the actual velocities.

In the relativistic case, p =19.8997 GeV.

In natural units, p=19.8997 GeV.

The velocity v can be found from p = gamma m v.

gamma = E/m → E=199 GeV, m=198 GeV → gamma=199/198≈1.00505.

So,

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -v² ) → 1.00505=1/sqrt(1 -v² ) → sqrt(1 -v² )=1/1.00505≈0.99502 →1 -v²≈0.99007 →v²≈0.00993 →v≈0.09965 c.

Which is very close to the non-relativistic v1=0.1005 c.

So, the velocities are almost the same in both cases. So the KEs would be almost the same.

Thus, the difference between T1_rel and T1_nonrel is negligible, but the options don't have zero.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the KE in the non-relativistic case is calculated as the entire 3 GeV, assuming it's all converted into KE, but distributed based on the masses.

So, perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the KE is distributed as K1= (m1/(m1 + m2 )) *3 GeV.

But m1=198, m2=99, so m1/(m1 +m2 )=198/297=2/3.

So, K1_nonrel= (2/3)*3 GeV=2 GeV.

Then, the correct relativistic K1 is 1 GeV.

So the difference is 2 GeV -1 GeV=1 GeV=1000 MeV.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic case would have K1= (m1/(m1 +m2 )) *3 GeV=2 GeV, but the correct K1 is 1 GeV, so difference is 1 GeV=1000 MeV.

But the options are in MeV, so 1000 MeV is 1 GeV, but the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV.

So perhaps I'm way off.

But perhaps the intended approach is that the non-relativistic KE is 2 GeV, and the correct is 1 GeV, so the difference is 1 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach gives a higher KE for the more massive fragment, but I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the non-relativistic KE is 1 GeV, and the correct is also 1 GeV, so difference is zero, but that's not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which is the sum of the kinetic energies. So the relativistic and non-relativistic calculations must both sum to 3 GeV.

In the correct relativistic case, K1=1 GeV, K2=2 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, the same.

Thus, the difference is zero.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I split the KE.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach would assign the kinetic energy based on the mass ratio, not considering momentum conservation.

In that case, the non-relativistic approach would have K1_nonrel= (m1/(m1 +m2 )) *3 GeV = (198/(297 ))*3= (2/3)*3=2 GeV.

And K2_nonrel=1 GeV.

But wait, that would give K1_nonrel=2 GeV, which is higher than the correct relativistic value of 1 GeV. So the difference would be 1 GeV=1000 MeV, which isn't an option.

But if the non-relativistic approach used that method, the difference would be 1 GeV, but I don't think that's the correct approach.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Since the options are in MeV, and the correct and non-relativistic T1 are the same, perhaps the intended answer is A) 2 MeV. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies again, but considering the mass defect.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the velocities again.

In the correct relativistic case, p=19.8997 GeV.

v=pc/E = (19.8997 GeV c) / (199 GeV c² ) → unit: m/s.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta = v/c.

Beta = (pc)/(E) = (19.8997 GeV )/(199 GeV ) ≈0.1000.

So, beta≈0.1.

In the non-relativistic case, beta is 0.1005.

So, the difference in beta is about 0.0005.

So, the difference in kinetic energy would be small.

The relativistic KE is K= (gamma -1) m c².

gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2 )=1/sqrt(1-0.01)=1/sqrt(0.99)≈1.005037.

So,

K_rel= (1.005037 -1 ) *198 GeV=0.005037 *198≈1.00 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case,

K_nonrel= (1/2) m v^2=0.5 *198 GeV/c² * (0.1 c )^2.

=0.5 *198 GeV/c² *0.01 c²=0.5 *198 *0.01 GeV=0.99 GeV.

So,

K_rel=1.00 GeV,

K_nonrel=0.99 GeV.

Thus, the difference is 0.01 GeV=10 MeV.

So the correct answer would be 10 MeV, option C.

Ah, this makes sense. So the relativistic KE is a bit higher than the non-relativistic, leading to a difference of about 10 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an atomic nucleus of mass \( M \), initially at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, undergoing spontaneous fission into two fragments. The more massive fragment has twice the rest mass of the lighter one, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass \( M \). The task is to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) of the more massive fragment and the kinetic energy calculated using the non-relativistic approximation.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - After fission, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is \( 0.99 M \), meaning the energy released is \( 1\% \) of \( M c^2 \), which is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This energy is entirely converted into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

2. **Mass Distribution**:
   - Let the rest masses of the two fragments be \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2 m_2 \).
   - From \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M \), we find:
     \[
     m_1 = 0.66 M, \quad m_2 = 0.33 M.
     \]
   - In natural units (\( c = 1 \)), \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:
   - The total kinetic energy of the two fragments is \( K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the kinetic energies of the more massive and lighter fragments, respectively.
   - Using relativistic energy and momentum conservation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated to be:
     \[
     K_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

4. **Non-Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:
   - In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is given by \( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \).
   - The velocities of the fragments are determined from momentum conservation, and the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated to be approximately:
     \[
     K_1^{\text{non-rel}} \approx 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

5. **Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)**:
   - The difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies of the more massive fragment is:
     \[
     \Delta T_1 = K_1 - K_1^{\text{non-rel}} = 1 \, \text{GeV} - 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) and the non-relativistic approximation is **10 MeV**.

**Answer: C**
