Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and it's a bit tricky, but let me think through it step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully and then try to break down each part.

So, the problem involves a mixture X of two equimolar liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives a single hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably a saturated compound. Importantly, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.

Hmm, so let me start by identifying what each part is saying.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means that the substance has unsaturated bonds like double or triple bonds. Because bromine (Br2) adds across these bonds, causing the color to disappear. So X has at least one of its components with double or triple bonds.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. Oh wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction, forming mixture Y. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, what reaction with Pt and heat would cause that? Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or some kind of elimination-addition reaction.

Wait, or maybe it's a hydrogenation reaction? But the problem says that hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. Oh wait, no, the initial treatment is with Pt when heated; I think that might be a catalyst for some reaction, perhaps hydrogenation or dehydrogenation.

Wait, but mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y doesn't have double bonds anymore, perhaps they've been hydrogenated or something. But wait, if X had double bonds and Y doesn't, maybe X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes a single product.

Wait, but the mixture X is treated with Pt and heated, leading to Y. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is hydrogenation. Because Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if X is a mixture of two alkenes, and upon hydrogenation, they add hydrogen. But wait, the problem says that when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. Similarly, Y when hydrogenated also gives Z.

Wait, the question says, "Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z." So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product Z. So Z must be the fully hydrogenated version of both X and Y.

Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate what that implies. The mass percent of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. Because 14.28% is about 1/7 of 100% (since 100/7 ≈14.2857). So, the formula might be something like CnHm, where the H mass is 14.28%.

Wait, the mass fraction is (mass of H) / (mass of Z) = 14.28% = 1/7. So if Z is CnHm, then:

Mass of H = (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) * 100% = 14.28%

So,

(m) / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Let me rearrange this:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m

m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n

0.8572m = 1.7136n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) n ≈ 2n

Wait, 1.7136 divided by 0.8572 is roughly 2, because 0.8572 * 2 is 1.7144. So m ≈2n.

So the formula is approximately CnH2n, which would be an alkene. Wait, but Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it must be a fully saturated compound, probably an alkane. Because hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes.

Wait, but if Z is an alkane, then the formula is CnH2n+2. Hmm, but earlier calculation suggests CnH2n. That contradicts.

Wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me recompute.

Mass of H is 14.28% of Z.

Let Z be CnHm.

Total molar mass = 12n + m.

Mass of H is m * 1 g/mol.

So,

(m) / (12n + m) ) * 100% = 14.28%

So,

m / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m

Bring terms together:

m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n

0.8572 m = 1.7136n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572 ) * n

Calculating 1.7136 / 0.8572:

Divide numerator and denominator by 1.7136:

1 / (0.8572 / 1.7136)

0.8572 /1.7136 is approximately 0.5, since 1.7136 is about 2*0.8568.

So 1.7136/0.8572 ≈ 2. So m ≈2n.

So Z is CnH2n. But that's an alkene, which would have a double bond. But wait, Z is the product of hydrogenation, which adds H2 across double bonds. So if Z is the product, then X and Y must have had double bonds that are hydrogenated to single bonds in Z.

Wait, but Z is a single product from both X and Y hydrogenation. So perhaps X and Y are different alkenes that hydrogenate to the same alkane. But that's only possible if X and Y are isomers, perhaps, that upon hydrogenation give the same product.

Wait, but alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes. So if Z is an alkane, then m = 2n + 2. But that doesn't fit with m≈2n earlier. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in my initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps Z is an alkene, but that can't be because it's a product of hydrogenation, which would saturate the bonds. So, wait, maybe Z is cyclohexane or something else.

Wait, let me think again. Let me try to find a molecule where the H mass fraction is 14.28%. Let me compute it for a specific molecule.

For example, ethane is C2H6. The H mass is 6 g/mol. The molar mass is 12*2 +6=30 g/mol. So (6/30)*100 =20%. Not 14.28%.

What about propane? C3H8. H is 8 g. 8/(36+8)=8/44≈18.18%. Close but not 14.28.

What about butane? C4H10. H is 10; molar mass 58. 10/58≈17.24%. Still higher than 14.28%.

Pentane: C5H12. 12/(60+12)=12/72=16.66%... Not matching.

Hmm, maybe it's a different molecule. How about cyclopropane? C3H6. Molar mass 42. H is 6. 6/42=14.2857% exactly. Oh! So Z is cyclopropane.

Yes, that makes sense. So Z is cyclopropane, which is a three-membered ring with each carbon bonded to two others and one hydrogen each. So the formula is C3H6.

So, m=6, n=3. And the mass fraction of H is 6/(36+6)=6/42=1/7≈14.2857%, which matches the given data.

So Z is cyclopropane.

Now, mixture Y, when hydrogenated, gives Z. So Y must have a double bond that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclopropane. Wait, but cyclopropane is a ring. So how would hydrogenation form a ring?

Wait, wait. Hydrogenation is adding hydrogen across double bonds. If Y is a cyclopropane derivative, but that doesn't make sense because Y is a mixture of two liquids. Alternatively, perhaps Y contains an alkene that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclopropane.

Wait, perhaps Y has a ring structure, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, X is treated with Pt and heated, leading to Y via a disproportionation reaction. Then, hydrogenation of Y gives Z.

Wait, but if Z is C3H6 (cyclopropane), then the hydrogenation of Y must produce cyclopropane. So Y must be a dihydrogenated cyclopropane, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe Y is a diene or another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material for Y is such that when hydrogenated, it forms cyclopropane. Wait, but cyclopropane is an alkane, so perhaps Y is an alkene that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane.

Wait, no. Hydrogenation adds hydrogen to make single bonds; cyclopropane already has single bonds. So perhaps Y is a dihydrogenated compound? Hmm, that's not quite right.

Wait, perhaps Y is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond elsewhere. For example, if Y is a cyclopropane ring with a substituent that has a double bond. But then, hydrogenation would add hydrogen to that substituent.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the initial part. Mixture X is two equimolar liquids that decolorize bromine, so they have double bonds. When treated with Pt and heat, undergo a disproportionation reaction to form Y.

Wait, what's a common reaction that occurs with Pt as a catalyst? Maybe dehydrogenation or hydrogenation. But Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation (adding H2) or sometimes for dehydrogenation (removing H2, like in some elimination reactions).

Wait, if X is an alkene and Y is a dihydrogenated version, but that wouldn't make sense because Y wouldn't have double bonds anymore. Wait, but in the problem statement, Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which would suggest that Y has no double bonds. So X has double bonds, Y doesn't, which would fit with X being hydrogenated to Y. But wait, the problem says that X is treated with Pt and heated to form Y, which is a result of a disproportionation. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if X and Y are different dihydrogenated forms, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach it differently.

Since Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), and hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, then X and Y must be such that when hydrogenated, they become cyclopropane. But wait, cyclopropane doesn't have any double bonds, so how would X and Y hydrogenate to it? Unless X and Y are alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe X has a double bond that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. So X is perhaps 1,2-dihydrocyclopropane? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cyclopropane with a double bond elsewhere. Wait, but cyclopropane itself doesn't have a double bond. Maybe X has a ring with a substituent that has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond, such as a cyclopropane ring with a substituent that's an alkene.

Wait, perhaps X is a diene that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclopropane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two dienes or alkenes that, when hydrogenated, become cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane has three carbons. So maybe X is a mixture of two compounds that upon hydrogenation become cyclopropane. But how? That's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe X and Y are alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is a three-membered ring, so if X is a three-carbon alkene, hydrogenation would yield propane. But that's not cyclopropane. So perhaps X is a cyclopropane with a double bond in the ring, which upon hydrogenation would become a single bond.

Wait, but cyclopropane itself is all single bonds. So maybe X isn't a cyclopropane but a different structure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X consists of 1,3-butadiene and another diene. Upon hydrogenation, they form butane and another alkane, but that doesn't lead to cyclopropane.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another angle. The mixture X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each of which has double bonds (since they decolorize bromine). When treated with Pt and heat, they undergo a disproportionation, leading to Y, which doesn't have double bonds (so Y is fully hydrogenated).

Wait, but then when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. But Y doesn't have any double bonds, so hydrogenation wouldn't change it. Unless Y is something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but another type of reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that X is treated with Pt and heated, leading to Y via a disproportionation. So what reactions involve Pt and lead to disproportionation?

One possibility is the oxidation of alcohols. For example, in the presence of Pt, an alcohol might oxidize to a ketone or aldehyde, but that's probably not a disproportionation reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the dehydrogenation of a dihydro compound to form a ring. For example, cyclopropane can be formed from a dihydro compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and when treated with Pt, undergoes some kind of rearrangement or ring formation.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition upon reaction with Pt, forming a cyclopropane derivative. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon addition of hydrogen (catalyzed by Pt), form a cyclopropane ring. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, let me think about the structure of Z again. Z is cyclopropane, C3H6. So perhaps X and Y are alkenes that when hydrogenated yield cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane has three carbons. So if X is a three-carbon alkene, hydrogenation would give propane (C3H8), but that's not cyclopropane. Hmm, maybe X is a cyclopropane with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial mixture X consists of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane. But that seems unlikely because hydrogenation would add H2 across double bonds, not form rings.

Wait, maybe X consists of a cyclopropane with a double bond. For example, maybe it's a norbornene-like structure, but that's more complex than I think a problem would expect.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that are isomers. When hydrogenated, both become the same cyclopropane. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of cyclopropane derivatives. For example, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a dihydrogenated cyclopropane, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the hydrogenation part again. If both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is cyclopropane, then X and Y must be such that upon hydrogenation, they all become cyclopropane. So perhaps X is an alkene that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclopropane, and Y is another compound that also hydrogenates to cyclopropane.

Wait, but to get cyclopropane from hydrogenation, the starting material would have to have a ring with a double bond. Oh, wait! Maybe X is a cyclopropane with a double bond in the ring. Such as a bicyclic compound. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a three-carbon chain. When hydrogenated, each would become propane, but that's not cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of 1,3-dienes or something else.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. So perhaps each component in X contributes a certain number of hydrogens.

But wait, X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each with double bonds. Let's say each component is an alkene.

For example, if each component is propene (C3H6), then each molecule has 6 H. Two moles would contribute 12 H. But the option D is 12, but we have two components, so perhaps I'm not considering both parts correctly.

Wait, no, the question is about the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. So if X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each of which is an alkene.

Let me assume that each component in X is an alkene, say, each has n carbons and 2n hydrogens (since alkenes are CnH2n). But wait, when hydrogenated, each would become CnH2n+2.

But if hydrogenation of X gives Z (cyclopropane, C3H6), then X must be a mixture of alkenes that upon hydrogenation give C3H6. That would imply that each component in X is a three-carbon alkene, because adding two hydrogens (from H2) would give C3H8 (propane). But that's not the case because Z is C3H6. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives cyclopropane. But cyclopropane has three carbons. So perhaps each component in X is a three-carbon alkene. Let's see:

If each component is propene (C3H6), then hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules (four H atoms) across the double bond, turning it into propane (C3H8). But that's not cyclopropane. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe X is a mixture of 1,2-dienes or something else. Alternatively, perhaps X consists of a cyclopropane ring with a double bond.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two cycloalkenes. For example, cyclopropane with a double bond adjacent to the ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So each component in X has only isolated double bonds, not conjugated. So if X has two alkenes, each with a single double bond, and no conjugated.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the structure of Y. Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction of X. So perhaps X has a compound that can both oxidize and reduce. Common examples are reactions where one molecule is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of H2O2, it disproportionates into O2 and H2O, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and upon treatment with Pt and heat, they undergo some kind of isomerization or rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of a diene and another compound, which upon reaction forms Y through a reaction that involves both addition and elimination.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, and the reaction with Pt and heat causes them to form a cyclopropane ring. For instance, if they undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition, forming a cyclopropane derivative. But I'm not certain about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps X consists of ethylene and another alkene. Upon heating with Pt, they undergo some kind of reaction to form a cyclopropane and other products. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that undergo a coupling reaction upon Pt catalysis, but that would form a larger molecule, which doesn't fit with the idea that Y is a mixture of two liquids.

Hmm, maybe I should try to think about the structures of X and Y. Let me hypothesize that X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with a three-carbon chain. So, perhaps propene (C3H6) and another alkene. Upon hydrogenation, each would become propane (C3H8), but that's not cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the fact that Y does not decolorize bromine suggests it has no double bonds. So Y must be a fully saturated compound. Then, when Y is hydrogenated, it produces Z. But Y is already saturated, so hydrogenation wouldn't change it. Unless Y has another type of unsaturation, like a triple bond or a ring that can open upon hydrogenation.

Wait a minute! If Y has a triple bond, then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a double bond. But Z doesn't decolorize bromine, implying Z has no double bonds. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a ring (like cyclopropane) which upon hydrogenation would open the ring. Hmm, but cyclopropane is already a ring with single bonds. Hydrogenation wouldn't add anything to it because there are no double bonds. So if Y is cyclopropane, hydrogenation wouldn't change it. But in the problem, when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe Y contains a triple bond. So, for example, Y is a propyne (HC≡CCH3). When hydrogenated, it would become propane (C3H8). But then Z would be propane. But the mass fraction of hydrogen in propane is (8)/(58.08) ≈13.78%, which is close to 14.28%, but not exact. Wait, let me calculate it accurately.

Propane is C3H8. Molar mass is 3*(12) +8 = 36 +8=44 g/mol. Hydrogen mass is 8 g. 8/44 = 0.1818, which is 18.18%. That's not 14.28%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a cyclopropyl group with a substituent that can be hydrogenated.

Wait, another idea: perhaps Y contains a benzene ring, which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. But then the mass fraction calculation would be different. Let me check.

Cyclohexane is C6H12. Hydrogen mass is 12 g. Molar mass is 6*12 +12=84. 12/84=0.142857, which is exactly 14.2857%. Oh! So Z is cyclohexane.

Wait, that's a better fit. So Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). Which would make sense because when Y is hydrogenated, it gives cyclohexane.

So, let me recast the problem with this in mind.

Z is cyclohexane, C6H12. So when X and Y are hydrogenated, they produce cyclohexane.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, produce cyclohexane. So each component in X is an alkene that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. So each component in X must be a cyclohexene derivative. But wait, cyclohexene is C6H10, which upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12.

So, X could be a mixture of two different dienes or alkenes that upon hydrogenation become cyclohexane. Alternatively, X could be a mixture of two cyclohexene isomers.

Wait, but the problem says that X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, so perhaps each is a mono-alkene that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. But that would require each component in X to be a cyclohexene (C6H10). Because when hydrogenated, adding two H atoms would give C6H12.

So, if X is a mixture of two different cyclohexenes (cis and trans, for example), each with one double bond, then hydrogenation would yield cyclohexane.

Similarly, when X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So Y must be a mixture of two other compounds that don't have double bonds (so they don't decolorize bromine). But upon hydrogenation, they also give cyclohexane.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it's fully saturated. So Y must be a mixture of two alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons). But when hydrogenated, they become cyclohexane. That doesn't make sense because alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions. Unless Y has triple bonds or rings that can hydrogenate.

Wait, but if Y has triple bonds, hydrogenation would add H2 to form double bonds, which would then decolorize bromine again. Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y must be fully saturated (all single bonds).

Hmm, perhaps Y contains a ring with triple bonds, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe Y has rings that upon hydrogenation open up. For example, if Y is cyclopropane, hydrogenation wouldn't change it. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps Y contains a dihydro derivative of a ring. Wait, perhaps Y is a norbornene derivative, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes that when hydrogenated form cyclohexane. But that would require Y to have a structure that can become cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkenes that are more substituted than those in X. Wait, but X is the starting material that decolorizes bromine. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let me assume that X is a mixture of two cyclohexenes (cis and trans), which upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. When X is heated with Pt, perhaps it undergoes a reaction to form Y, which is a mixture of two other compounds.

But Y doesn't have double bonds, so perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane. But that doesn't make sense because alkanes don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkenes that are more complex, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe Y contains a triple bond. For example, if Y is a mixture of two propyne derivatives, which upon hydrogenation would become propane derivatives. But again, I'm not seeing the connection to cyclohexane.

Hmm. Let me think about the hydrogenation part again. If both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane, then X and Y must have structures that upon hydrogenation form cyclohexane. So, X and Y must be alkenes that when hydrogenated become cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different cyclohexenes, each adding H2 to form cyclohexane. And Y is a mixture of two different alkenes, perhaps more substituted, that also add H2 to form cyclohexane.

But the problem states that Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which would mean Y doesn't have any double bonds. So that can't be. So perhaps Y isn't an alkene.

Wait, maybe Y is a mixture of two alkanes that have rings, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes with triple bonds. But that doesn't fit because alkanes don't have triple bonds.

Wait, perhaps Y contains a ring with a triple bond, but that's a bit unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two cyclohexanes with substituents that can be hydrogenated. Wait, but cyclohexane is already a ring; adding more H2 wouldn't change it.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the initial mixture X again. If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, then each of these alkenes must be a ring-opened cyclohexane. For example, if X is cis and trans 1-cyclohexene, which upon hydrogenation would form cyclohexane.

So, X would consist of two isomeric cyclohexenes. When X is treated with Pt and heated, perhaps it undergoes a reaction that forms Y, which is a mixture of two other compounds.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it's fully saturated. So Y must be a mixture of two alkanes. But then hydrogenation of Y wouldn't change anything, so that can't be right because Y's hydrogenation gives Z (cyclohexane). So that's a contradiction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are in a conjugated system, but the problem states that X has no conjugated multiple bonds. So that rules out conjugated dienes.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes, each with six carbons. For example, 1-hexene and 2-hexene. Upon hydrogenation, each would become hexane. But that would imply that Z is hexane, not cyclohexane.

But let's calculate the H mass fraction for hexane. Hexane is C6H14. Molar mass is 6*12 +14=86. Hydrogen mass is 14. 14/86≈16.28%, which is higher than 14.28%. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps Z is a different compound. Wait, earlier I thought Z was cyclopropane, but then the mass fraction didn't fit with a cyclohexane scenario. Let me double-check.

Wait, for cyclohexane (C6H12), the mass of H is 12 g. Molar mass is 6*12 +12=84 g/mol. So 12/84=0.142857, which is exactly 14.2857%. So that's correct.

So Z is cyclohexane.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, become cyclohexane. So each component in X is a cyclohexene (C6H10). So when hydrogenated, each becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane).

Now, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine (so no double bonds).

So Y must be a mixture of two alkanes or other fully saturated compounds.

Wait, but when Y is hydrogenated, it also gives cyclohexane. But Y is fully saturated, so that's puzzling. Unless Y has a triple bond or some other unsaturation that can be hydrogenated.

Wait, maybe Y contains a triple bond. For example, if Y is a mixture of two propyne (C3H4) derivatives, but that doesn't seem to fit with the cyclohexane scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps Y contains a benzene ring. Benzene upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, but Y is a mixture of two liquids, maybe two different substituted benzene rings. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Y is a mixture of two different alkenes that are more substituted than those in X. But then Y would still decolorize bromine, which it doesn't.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think about the number of H atoms in X.

Each component in X is a cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 H atoms per molecule. Since X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each component contributes 10 H atoms. So two components would have 20 H atoms in total for one mole of each.

Wait, but the options are 16, 18, 22, 12. So 20 isn't an option. Hmm, that suggests perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps each component in X has a different number of H atoms. For example, if one component is C4H8 and the other is C2H4. Wait, but that would sum to different H counts.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Suppose each component in X is a different alkene that when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. So, for example, X could be a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene upon hydrogenation would become cyclohexane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes, each with six carbons, but that would mean each has 12 H (C6H12?), but that can't be because alkenes are CnH2n, so C6H10.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the total H atoms in each component. Let me think: each component in X is an alkene with formula CnH2n. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes CnH2n+2.

If Z is C6H12, then 2n+2=12 → n=5. So each component in X is C5H10 (pentene). So when hydrogenated, each becomes C5H12 (pentane). But that doesn't fit with Z being cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the structures. Let me approach it from the hydrogenation standpoint. If X's components are alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane, then each component must be a cyclohexene (C6H10). So each molecule has 10 H atoms. Since X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each component contributes 10 H atoms. So for one mole of each, the total H is 10 + 10 =20. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps each component isn't C6H10, but something else.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a different diene, which upon hydrogenation adds two H2 molecules, giving more H.

Wait, if X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene, each upon hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules (four H atoms) to become cyclohexane. So each component would have to be C6H8, because adding 4 H would make C6H12. So each component in X is C6H8 (a diene). So each has 8 H atoms, and two components would have 16 H in total.

Ah, so the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X would be 16. So the answer would be option A) 16.

But let me confirm this. If each component in X is a diene (C6H8), then upon hydrogenation (adding 4 H atoms), it becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane). That fits.

So, each component in X has 8 H atoms. Two equimolar components would contribute 8 +8=16 H atoms in total. So the answer is 16, option A.

Additionally, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Since Y doesn't decolorize bromine, it's fully saturated. So Y must be a mixture of two alkanes.

But wait, if Y is a mixture of two alkanes, then hydrogenation wouldn't change them, so how does Y hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane)? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps Y isn't alkanes but something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y contains triple bonds or aromatic rings that can be hydrogenated.

Wait, another thought: if Y contains a benzene ring, then hydrogenation would turn it into cyclohexane. But benzene is C6H6. So let's see: if Y is a mixture of two benzene derivatives, upon hydrogenation, they become cyclohexane.

But benzene is C6H6. So when hydrogenated, it becomes C6H12. So Z would be cyclohexane.

So, if X is a mixture of two dienes (C6H8), hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. X treated with Pt and heat undergoes a reaction to form Y, which is a mixture of two benzene rings or something else.

Wait, but benzene is an aromatic compound, which is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So if Y is a mixture of two benzene derivatives, but the problem states that Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it can't have double bonds. Hmm, that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two fully saturated compounds, but then how does hydrogenation of Y produce cyclohexane? Unless Y contains a triple bond that upon hydrogenation becomes a single bond, forming cyclohexane. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two cyclopropane derivatives, but that doesn't fit with the hydrogenation product.

I'm getting a bit stuck again, but considering the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is 16 hydrogen atoms in X, given that each component is a diene (C6H8) contributing 8 H each. So two components would have 16 H atoms.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information**:  
   - Mixture X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes).  
   - Upon treatment with platinum and heat, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y is fully saturated.  
   - Hydrogenation of both X and Y in the presence of platinum produces a single hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent.  
   - Z does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is fully saturated.  
   - There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

2. **Identifying Z**:  
   - The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which corresponds to a compound where the mass of hydrogen divided by the molar mass equals approximately 1/7.  
   - For Z, this calculation leads to the formula **C₆H₁₂**, which is cyclohexane.  

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**:  
   - Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, produce Z (C₆H₁₂). This implies that the components of X and Y must be unsaturated compounds that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane.  
   - Since Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the starting materials X and Y must be alkenes or alkynes that add hydrogen to form this structure.  

4. **Structure of X**:  
   - X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, both of which are alkenes. These alkenes must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).  
   - A plausible structure for the components of X is **1,3-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**, which is a conjugated diene. Upon hydrogenation, 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) adds two molecules of H₂ to form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).  

5. **Hydrogen Content in X**:  
   - Each component of X (e.g., 1,3-cyclohexadiene) has 8 hydrogen atoms.  
   - Since X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two components is **8 + 8 = 16**.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **16**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and it's a bit tricky, but let me think through it step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully and then try to break down each part.

So, the problem involves a mixture X of two equimolar liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives a single hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably a saturated compound. Importantly, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.

Hmm, so let me start by identifying what each part is saying.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means that the substance has unsaturated bonds like double or triple bonds. Because bromine (Br2) adds across these bonds, causing the color to disappear. So X has at least one of its components with double or triple bonds.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. Oh wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction, forming mixture Y. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, what reaction with Pt and heat would cause that? Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or some kind of elimination-addition reaction.

Wait, or maybe it's a hydrogenation reaction? But the problem says that hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. Oh wait, no, the initial treatment is with Pt when heated; I think that might be a catalyst for some reaction, perhaps hydrogenation or dehydrogenation.

Wait, but mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y doesn't have double bonds anymore, perhaps they've been hydrogenated or something. But wait, if X had double bonds and Y doesn't, maybe X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes a single product.

Wait, but the mixture X is treated with Pt and heated, leading to Y. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is hydrogenation. Because Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if X is a mixture of two alkenes, and upon hydrogenation, they add hydrogen. But wait, the problem says that when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. Similarly, Y when hydrogenated also gives Z.

Wait, the question says, "Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z." So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product Z. So Z must be the fully hydrogenated version of both X and Y.

Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate what that implies. The mass percent of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. Because 14.28% is about 1/7 of 100% (since 100/7 ≈14.2857). So, the formula might be something like CnHm, where the H mass is 14.28%.

Wait, the mass fraction is (mass of H) / (mass of Z) = 14.28% = 1/7. So if Z is CnHm, then:

Mass of H = (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) * 100% = 14.28%

So,

(m) / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Let me rearrange this:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m

m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n

0.8572m = 1.7136n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) n ≈ 2n

Wait, 1.7136 divided by 0.8572 is roughly 2, because 0.8572 * 2 is 1.7144. So m ≈2n.

So the formula is approximately CnH2n, which would be an alkene. Wait, but Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it must be a fully saturated compound, probably an alkane. Because hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes.

Wait, but if Z is an alkane, then the formula is CnH2n+2. Hmm, but earlier calculation suggests CnH2n. That contradicts.

Wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me recompute.

Mass of H is 14.28% of Z.

Let Z be CnHm.

Total molar mass = 12n + m.

Mass of H is m * 1 g/mol.

So,

(m) / (12n + m) ) * 100% = 14.28%

So,

m / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m

Bring terms together:

m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n

0.8572 m = 1.7136n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572 ) * n

Calculating 1.7136 / 0.8572:

Divide numerator and denominator by 1.7136:

1 / (0.8572 / 1.7136)

0.8572 /1.7136 is approximately 0.5, since 1.7136 is about 2*0.8568.

So 1.7136/0.8572 ≈ 2. So m ≈2n.

So Z is CnH2n. But that's an alkene, which would have a double bond. But wait, Z is the product of hydrogenation, which adds H2 across double bonds. So if Z is the product, then X and Y must have had double bonds that are hydrogenated to single bonds in Z.

Wait, but Z is a single product from both X and Y hydrogenation. So perhaps X and Y are different alkenes that hydrogenate to the same alkane. But that's only possible if X and Y are isomers, perhaps, that upon hydrogenation give the same product.

Wait, but alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes. So if Z is an alkane, then m = 2n + 2. But that doesn't fit with m≈2n earlier. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in my initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps Z is an alkene, but that can't be because it's a product of hydrogenation, which would saturate the bonds. So, wait, maybe Z is cyclohexane or something else.

Wait, let me think again. Let me try to find a molecule where the H mass fraction is 14.28%. Let me compute it for a specific molecule.

For example, ethane is C2H6. The H mass is 6 g/mol. The molar mass is 12*2 +6=30 g/mol. So (6/30)*100 =20%. Not 14.28%.

What about propane? C3H8. H is 8 g. 8/(36+8)=8/44≈18.18%. Close but not 14.28.

What about butane? C4H10. H is 10; molar mass 58. 10/58≈17.24%. Still higher than 14.28%.

Pentane: C5H12. 12/(60+12)=12/72=16.66%... Not matching.

Hmm, maybe it's a different molecule. How about cyclopropane? C3H6. Molar mass 42. H is 6. 6/42=14.2857% exactly. Oh! So Z is cyclopropane.

Yes, that makes sense. So Z is cyclopropane, which is a three-membered ring with each carbon bonded to two others and one hydrogen each. So the formula is C3H6.

So, m=6, n=3. And the mass fraction of H is 6/(36+6)=6/42=1/7≈14.2857%, which matches the given data.

So Z is cyclopropane.

Now, mixture Y, when hydrogenated, gives Z. So Y must have a double bond that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclopropane. Wait, but cyclopropane is a ring. So how would hydrogenation form a ring?

Wait, wait. Hydrogenation is adding hydrogen across double bonds. If Y is a cyclopropane derivative, but that doesn't make sense because Y is a mixture of two liquids. Alternatively, perhaps Y contains an alkene that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclopropane.

Wait, perhaps Y has a ring structure, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, X is treated with Pt and heated, leading to Y via a disproportionation reaction. Then, hydrogenation of Y gives Z.

Wait, but if Z is C3H6 (cyclopropane), then the hydrogenation of Y must produce cyclopropane. So Y must be a dihydrogenated cyclopropane, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe Y is a diene or another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material for Y is such that when hydrogenated, it forms cyclopropane. Wait, but cyclopropane is an alkane, so perhaps Y is an alkene that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane.

Wait, no. Hydrogenation adds hydrogen to make single bonds; cyclopropane already has single bonds. So perhaps Y is a dihydrogenated compound? Hmm, that's not quite right.

Wait, perhaps Y is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond elsewhere. For example, if Y is a cyclopropane ring with a substituent that has a double bond. But then, hydrogenation would add hydrogen to that substituent.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the initial part. Mixture X is two equimolar liquids that decolorize bromine, so they have double bonds. When treated with Pt and heat, undergo a disproportionation reaction to form Y.

Wait, what's a common reaction that occurs with Pt as a catalyst? Maybe dehydrogenation or hydrogenation. But Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation (adding H2) or sometimes for dehydrogenation (removing H2, like in some elimination reactions).

Wait, if X is an alkene and Y is a dihydrogenated version, but that wouldn't make sense because Y wouldn't have double bonds anymore. Wait, but in the problem statement, Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which would suggest that Y has no double bonds. So X has double bonds, Y doesn't, which would fit with X being hydrogenated to Y. But wait, the problem says that X is treated with Pt and heated to form Y, which is a result of a disproportionation. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if X and Y are different dihydrogenated forms, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach it differently.

Since Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), and hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, then X and Y must be such that when hydrogenated, they become cyclopropane. But wait, cyclopropane doesn't have any double bonds, so how would X and Y hydrogenate to it? Unless X and Y are alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe X has a double bond that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. So X is perhaps 1,2-dihydrocyclopropane? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cyclopropane with a double bond elsewhere. Wait, but cyclopropane itself doesn't have a double bond. Maybe X has a ring with a substituent that has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond, such as a cyclopropane ring with a substituent that's an alkene.

Wait, perhaps X is a diene that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclopropane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two dienes or alkenes that, when hydrogenated, become cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane has three carbons. So maybe X is a mixture of two compounds that upon hydrogenation become cyclopropane. But how? That's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe X and Y are alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is a three-membered ring, so if X is a three-carbon alkene, hydrogenation would yield propane. But that's not cyclopropane. So perhaps X is a cyclopropane with a double bond in the ring, which upon hydrogenation would become a single bond.

Wait, but cyclopropane itself is all single bonds. So maybe X isn't a cyclopropane but a different structure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X consists of 1,3-butadiene and another diene. Upon hydrogenation, they form butane and another alkane, but that doesn't lead to cyclopropane.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another angle. The mixture X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each of which has double bonds (since they decolorize bromine). When treated with Pt and heat, they undergo a disproportionation, leading to Y, which doesn't have double bonds (so Y is fully hydrogenated).

Wait, but then when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. But Y doesn't have any double bonds, so hydrogenation wouldn't change it. Unless Y is something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but another type of reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that X is treated with Pt and heated, leading to Y via a disproportionation. So what reactions involve Pt and lead to disproportionation?

One possibility is the oxidation of alcohols. For example, in the presence of Pt, an alcohol might oxidize to a ketone or aldehyde, but that's probably not a disproportionation reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the dehydrogenation of a dihydro compound to form a ring. For example, cyclopropane can be formed from a dihydro compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and when treated with Pt, undergoes some kind of rearrangement or ring formation.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition upon reaction with Pt, forming a cyclopropane derivative. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon addition of hydrogen (catalyzed by Pt), form a cyclopropane ring. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, let me think about the structure of Z again. Z is cyclopropane, C3H6. So perhaps X and Y are alkenes that when hydrogenated yield cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane has three carbons. So if X is a three-carbon alkene, hydrogenation would give propane (C3H8), but that's not cyclopropane. Hmm, maybe X is a cyclopropane with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial mixture X consists of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane. But that seems unlikely because hydrogenation would add H2 across double bonds, not form rings.

Wait, maybe X consists of a cyclopropane with a double bond. For example, maybe it's a norbornene-like structure, but that's more complex than I think a problem would expect.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that are isomers. When hydrogenated, both become the same cyclopropane. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of cyclopropane derivatives. For example, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a dihydrogenated cyclopropane, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the hydrogenation part again. If both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is cyclopropane, then X and Y must be such that upon hydrogenation, they all become cyclopropane. So perhaps X is an alkene that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclopropane, and Y is another compound that also hydrogenates to cyclopropane.

Wait, but to get cyclopropane from hydrogenation, the starting material would have to have a ring with a double bond. Oh, wait! Maybe X is a cyclopropane with a double bond in the ring. Such as a bicyclic compound. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a three-carbon chain. When hydrogenated, each would become propane, but that's not cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of 1,3-dienes or something else.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. So perhaps each component in X contributes a certain number of hydrogens.

But wait, X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each with double bonds. Let's say each component is an alkene.

For example, if each component is propene (C3H6), then each molecule has 6 H. Two moles would contribute 12 H. But the option D is 12, but we have two components, so perhaps I'm not considering both parts correctly.

Wait, no, the question is about the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. So if X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each of which is an alkene.

Let me assume that each component in X is an alkene, say, each has n carbons and 2n hydrogens (since alkenes are CnH2n). But wait, when hydrogenated, each would become CnH2n+2.

But if hydrogenation of X gives Z (cyclopropane, C3H6), then X must be a mixture of alkenes that upon hydrogenation give C3H6. That would imply that each component in X is a three-carbon alkene, because adding two hydrogens (from H2) would give C3H8 (propane). But that's not the case because Z is C3H6. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives cyclopropane. But cyclopropane has three carbons. So perhaps each component in X is a three-carbon alkene. Let's see:

If each component is propene (C3H6), then hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules (four H atoms) across the double bond, turning it into propane (C3H8). But that's not cyclopropane. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe X is a mixture of 1,2-dienes or something else. Alternatively, perhaps X consists of a cyclopropane ring with a double bond.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two cycloalkenes. For example, cyclopropane with a double bond adjacent to the ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So each component in X has only isolated double bonds, not conjugated. So if X has two alkenes, each with a single double bond, and no conjugated.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the structure of Y. Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction of X. So perhaps X has a compound that can both oxidize and reduce. Common examples are reactions where one molecule is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of H2O2, it disproportionates into O2 and H2O, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and upon treatment with Pt and heat, they undergo some kind of isomerization or rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of a diene and another compound, which upon reaction forms Y through a reaction that involves both addition and elimination.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, and the reaction with Pt and heat causes them to form a cyclopropane ring. For instance, if they undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition, forming a cyclopropane derivative. But I'm not certain about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps X consists of ethylene and another alkene. Upon heating with Pt, they undergo some kind of reaction to form a cyclopropane and other products. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that undergo a coupling reaction upon Pt catalysis, but that would form a larger molecule, which doesn't fit with the idea that Y is a mixture of two liquids.

Hmm, maybe I should try to think about the structures of X and Y. Let me hypothesize that X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with a three-carbon chain. So, perhaps propene (C3H6) and another alkene. Upon hydrogenation, each would become propane (C3H8), but that's not cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the fact that Y does not decolorize bromine suggests it has no double bonds. So Y must be a fully saturated compound. Then, when Y is hydrogenated, it produces Z. But Y is already saturated, so hydrogenation wouldn't change it. Unless Y has another type of unsaturation, like a triple bond or a ring that can open upon hydrogenation.

Wait a minute! If Y has a triple bond, then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a double bond. But Z doesn't decolorize bromine, implying Z has no double bonds. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a ring (like cyclopropane) which upon hydrogenation would open the ring. Hmm, but cyclopropane is already a ring with single bonds. Hydrogenation wouldn't add anything to it because there are no double bonds. So if Y is cyclopropane, hydrogenation wouldn't change it. But in the problem, when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe Y contains a triple bond. So, for example, Y is a propyne (HC≡CCH3). When hydrogenated, it would become propane (C3H8). But then Z would be propane. But the mass fraction of hydrogen in propane is (8)/(58.08) ≈13.78%, which is close to 14.28%, but not exact. Wait, let me calculate it accurately.

Propane is C3H8. Molar mass is 3*(12) +8 = 36 +8=44 g/mol. Hydrogen mass is 8 g. 8/44 = 0.1818, which is 18.18%. That's not 14.28%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a cyclopropyl group with a substituent that can be hydrogenated.

Wait, another idea: perhaps Y contains a benzene ring, which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. But then the mass fraction calculation would be different. Let me check.

Cyclohexane is C6H12. Hydrogen mass is 12 g. Molar mass is 6*12 +12=84. 12/84=0.142857, which is exactly 14.2857%. Oh! So Z is cyclohexane.

Wait, that's a better fit. So Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). Which would make sense because when Y is hydrogenated, it gives cyclohexane.

So, let me recast the problem with this in mind.

Z is cyclohexane, C6H12. So when X and Y are hydrogenated, they produce cyclohexane.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, produce cyclohexane. So each component in X is an alkene that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. So each component in X must be a cyclohexene derivative. But wait, cyclohexene is C6H10, which upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12.

So, X could be a mixture of two different dienes or alkenes that upon hydrogenation become cyclohexane. Alternatively, X could be a mixture of two cyclohexene isomers.

Wait, but the problem says that X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, so perhaps each is a mono-alkene that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. But that would require each component in X to be a cyclohexene (C6H10). Because when hydrogenated, adding two H atoms would give C6H12.

So, if X is a mixture of two different cyclohexenes (cis and trans, for example), each with one double bond, then hydrogenation would yield cyclohexane.

Similarly, when X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So Y must be a mixture of two other compounds that don't have double bonds (so they don't decolorize bromine). But upon hydrogenation, they also give cyclohexane.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it's fully saturated. So Y must be a mixture of two alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons). But when hydrogenated, they become cyclohexane. That doesn't make sense because alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions. Unless Y has triple bonds or rings that can hydrogenate.

Wait, but if Y has triple bonds, hydrogenation would add H2 to form double bonds, which would then decolorize bromine again. Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y must be fully saturated (all single bonds).

Hmm, perhaps Y contains a ring with triple bonds, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe Y has rings that upon hydrogenation open up. For example, if Y is cyclopropane, hydrogenation wouldn't change it. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps Y contains a dihydro derivative of a ring. Wait, perhaps Y is a norbornene derivative, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes that when hydrogenated form cyclohexane. But that would require Y to have a structure that can become cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkenes that are more substituted than those in X. Wait, but X is the starting material that decolorizes bromine. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let me assume that X is a mixture of two cyclohexenes (cis and trans), which upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. When X is heated with Pt, perhaps it undergoes a reaction to form Y, which is a mixture of two other compounds.

But Y doesn't have double bonds, so perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane. But that doesn't make sense because alkanes don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkenes that are more complex, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe Y contains a triple bond. For example, if Y is a mixture of two propyne derivatives, which upon hydrogenation would become propane derivatives. But again, I'm not seeing the connection to cyclohexane.

Hmm. Let me think about the hydrogenation part again. If both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane, then X and Y must have structures that upon hydrogenation form cyclohexane. So, X and Y must be alkenes that when hydrogenated become cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different cyclohexenes, each adding H2 to form cyclohexane. And Y is a mixture of two different alkenes, perhaps more substituted, that also add H2 to form cyclohexane.

But the problem states that Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which would mean Y doesn't have any double bonds. So that can't be. So perhaps Y isn't an alkene.

Wait, maybe Y is a mixture of two alkanes that have rings, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes with triple bonds. But that doesn't fit because alkanes don't have triple bonds.

Wait, perhaps Y contains a ring with a triple bond, but that's a bit unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two cyclohexanes with substituents that can be hydrogenated. Wait, but cyclohexane is already a ring; adding more H2 wouldn't change it.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the initial mixture X again. If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, then each of these alkenes must be a ring-opened cyclohexane. For example, if X is cis and trans 1-cyclohexene, which upon hydrogenation would form cyclohexane.

So, X would consist of two isomeric cyclohexenes. When X is treated with Pt and heated, perhaps it undergoes a reaction that forms Y, which is a mixture of two other compounds.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it's fully saturated. So Y must be a mixture of two alkanes. But then hydrogenation of Y wouldn't change anything, so that can't be right because Y's hydrogenation gives Z (cyclohexane). So that's a contradiction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are in a conjugated system, but the problem states that X has no conjugated multiple bonds. So that rules out conjugated dienes.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes, each with six carbons. For example, 1-hexene and 2-hexene. Upon hydrogenation, each would become hexane. But that would imply that Z is hexane, not cyclohexane.

But let's calculate the H mass fraction for hexane. Hexane is C6H14. Molar mass is 6*12 +14=86. Hydrogen mass is 14. 14/86≈16.28%, which is higher than 14.28%. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps Z is a different compound. Wait, earlier I thought Z was cyclopropane, but then the mass fraction didn't fit with a cyclohexane scenario. Let me double-check.

Wait, for cyclohexane (C6H12), the mass of H is 12 g. Molar mass is 6*12 +12=84 g/mol. So 12/84=0.142857, which is exactly 14.2857%. So that's correct.

So Z is cyclohexane.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, become cyclohexane. So each component in X is a cyclohexene (C6H10). So when hydrogenated, each becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane).

Now, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine (so no double bonds).

So Y must be a mixture of two alkanes or other fully saturated compounds.

Wait, but when Y is hydrogenated, it also gives cyclohexane. But Y is fully saturated, so that's puzzling. Unless Y has a triple bond or some other unsaturation that can be hydrogenated.

Wait, maybe Y contains a triple bond. For example, if Y is a mixture of two propyne (C3H4) derivatives, but that doesn't seem to fit with the cyclohexane scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps Y contains a benzene ring. Benzene upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, but Y is a mixture of two liquids, maybe two different substituted benzene rings. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Y is a mixture of two different alkenes that are more substituted than those in X. But then Y would still decolorize bromine, which it doesn't.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think about the number of H atoms in X.

Each component in X is a cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 H atoms per molecule. Since X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each component contributes 10 H atoms. So two components would have 20 H atoms in total for one mole of each.

Wait, but the options are 16, 18, 22, 12. So 20 isn't an option. Hmm, that suggests perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps each component in X has a different number of H atoms. For example, if one component is C4H8 and the other is C2H4. Wait, but that would sum to different H counts.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Suppose each component in X is a different alkene that when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. So, for example, X could be a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene upon hydrogenation would become cyclohexane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes, each with six carbons, but that would mean each has 12 H (C6H12?), but that can't be because alkenes are CnH2n, so C6H10.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the total H atoms in each component. Let me think: each component in X is an alkene with formula CnH2n. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes CnH2n+2.

If Z is C6H12, then 2n+2=12 → n=5. So each component in X is C5H10 (pentene). So when hydrogenated, each becomes C5H12 (pentane). But that doesn't fit with Z being cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the structures. Let me approach it from the hydrogenation standpoint. If X's components are alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane, then each component must be a cyclohexene (C6H10). So each molecule has 10 H atoms. Since X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, each component contributes 10 H atoms. So for one mole of each, the total H is 10 + 10 =20. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps each component isn't C6H10, but something else.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a different diene, which upon hydrogenation adds two H2 molecules, giving more H.

Wait, if X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene, each upon hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules (four H atoms) to become cyclohexane. So each component would have to be C6H8, because adding 4 H would make C6H12. So each component in X is C6H8 (a diene). So each has 8 H atoms, and two components would have 16 H in total.

Ah, so the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X would be 16. So the answer would be option A) 16.

But let me confirm this. If each component in X is a diene (C6H8), then upon hydrogenation (adding 4 H atoms), it becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane). That fits.

So, each component in X has 8 H atoms. Two equimolar components would contribute 8 +8=16 H atoms in total. So the answer is 16, option A.

Additionally, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Since Y doesn't decolorize bromine, it's fully saturated. So Y must be a mixture of two alkanes.

But wait, if Y is a mixture of two alkanes, then hydrogenation wouldn't change them, so how does Y hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane)? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps Y isn't alkanes but something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y contains triple bonds or aromatic rings that can be hydrogenated.

Wait, another thought: if Y contains a benzene ring, then hydrogenation would turn it into cyclohexane. But benzene is C6H6. So let's see: if Y is a mixture of two benzene derivatives, upon hydrogenation, they become cyclohexane.

But benzene is C6H6. So when hydrogenated, it becomes C6H12. So Z would be cyclohexane.

So, if X is a mixture of two dienes (C6H8), hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. X treated with Pt and heat undergoes a reaction to form Y, which is a mixture of two benzene rings or something else.

Wait, but benzene is an aromatic compound, which is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So if Y is a mixture of two benzene derivatives, but the problem states that Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it can't have double bonds. Hmm, that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two fully saturated compounds, but then how does hydrogenation of Y produce cyclohexane? Unless Y contains a triple bond that upon hydrogenation becomes a single bond, forming cyclohexane. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two cyclopropane derivatives, but that doesn't fit with the hydrogenation product.

I'm getting a bit stuck again, but considering the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is 16 hydrogen atoms in X, given that each component is a diene (C6H8) contributing 8 H each. So two components would have 16 H atoms.


The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information**:  
   - Mixture X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes).  
   - Upon treatment with platinum and heat, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y is fully saturated.  
   - Hydrogenation of both X and Y in the presence of platinum produces a single hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent.  
   - Z does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is fully saturated.  
   - There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

2. **Identifying Z**:  
   - The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which corresponds to a compound where the mass of hydrogen divided by the molar mass equals approximately 1/7.  
   - For Z, this calculation leads to the formula **C₆H₁₂**, which is cyclohexane.  

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**:  
   - Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, produce Z (C₆H₁₂). This implies that the components of X and Y must be unsaturated compounds that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane.  
   - Since Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the starting materials X and Y must be alkenes or alkynes that add hydrogen to form this structure.  

4. **Structure of X**:  
   - X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, both of which are alkenes. These alkenes must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).  
   - A plausible structure for the components of X is **1,3-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**, which is a conjugated diene. Upon hydrogenation, 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) adds two molecules of H₂ to form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).  

5. **Hydrogen Content in X**:  
   - Each component of X (e.g., 1,3-cyclohexadiene) has 8 hydrogen atoms.  
   - Since X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two components is **8 + 8 = 16**.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **16**.
