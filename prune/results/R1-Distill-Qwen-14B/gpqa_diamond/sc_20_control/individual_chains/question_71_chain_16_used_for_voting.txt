Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to how much light they receive from their star. Since they're in orbital resonance, their periods are in a specific ratio, which probably affects their distances from the star.

The question says the planets are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, Planet_2 is twice that, and so on up to Planet_5. Wait, but how does that translate to their distances from the star?

Oh right, Kepler's third law! The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P^2 is proportional to a^3. So if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes, I can then find the ratio of their distances, which affects their equilibrium temperatures.

Equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. But since all planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out. So T is proportional to sqrt(1/a), because the star's temperature and radius would be the same for all planets. Wait, actually, the formula I remember is T = T_eff * (R/(2a))^0.5. Oh wait, T is the planet's equilibrium temperature, and T_eff is the star's effective temperature. But since all planets are around the same star, T_eff is the same for each, so they don't affect the ratio.

So the key is the ratio of their distances. Let's figure out the semi-major axis ratios. Let me denote the period of Planet_1 as P1, so P2 = 2P1, P3 = 2.5 P1, P4=3.5 P1, P5=5 P1.

Using Kepler's law: (P1^2)/(a1^3) = (P2^2)/(a2^3) = ... So the ratio a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3). Wait, let me think. Because P^2 is proportional to a^3. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So the ratio a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3).

Wait, for Planet_4 and Planet_2, we need a4 and a2.

So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Since P4 is 3.5 P1 and P2 is 2 P1, P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75.

So (1.75)^(2/3). Hmm, what's 1.75 as a fraction? It's 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Wait, 7/4 is 1.75.

I can compute this. Let's see, 1.75^(1/3) is approximately, since 1.75^3 is around 5.359. So the cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2, but wait, that's not precise. Alternatively, maybe using logarithms.

Alternatively, think about 7^(2/3) / 4^(2/3). So 7^(2/3) is approximately, 7^0.6667. Let's see: 7^0.5 is about 2.6458, 7^(2/3) is higher. Let me compute: 7^(1/3) is about 1.913, so squared is about 3.66. 4^(2/3) is (4^(1/3))^2; 4^(1/3) is about 1.5874, squared is about 2.5198.

So 3.66 / 2.5198 ≈ 1.453. So a4 is approximately 1.453 times a2. So a4/a2 ≈ 1.453.

Wait, but wait, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but wait, another approach: the formula T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), as I thought earlier. So the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

Therefore, the ratio T4 / T2 is sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt(1/(a4/a2)) ) = 1 / sqrt(a4/a2).

Wait, let me double-check. If a4 is larger than a2, then T4 is lower than T2. So the ratio T4/T2 would be less than 1.

Wait, let me re-derive this. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (L/(16πa²)) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since L and T_star are the same, and albedo is same, so T is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) ) = 1/(a^0.5). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of a.

So T4 = k / sqrt(a4), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), so T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4).

Which is sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( 1/(a4/a2) ) = 1/sqrt(a4/a2).

So from earlier, a4/a2 is about 1.453, so sqrt(1.453) ≈ 1.205. So T4/T2 is 1/1.205 ≈ 0.8298, which is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let's recalculate the a4/a2 ratio.

P4 is 3.5 P1, P2 is 2 P1. So P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75.

a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute 1.75^(1/3) first.

The cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So 1.2^3 is about 1.728. So 1.75 is about 1.2 * (1.75/1.728)^(1/3). Let me compute 1.75 / 1.728 ≈ 1.013. So the cube root of 1.013 is approximately 1.004. So 1.2 * 1.004 ≈ 1.205. So 1.75^(1/3) ≈ 1.205. Then squared is (1.205)^2 ≈ 1.452. So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452.

So sqrt(a2/a4) is sqrt(1/1.452) = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829. So yes, about 0.83. So option C is correct.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between orbital periods and distances from Kepler's third law. The orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, and the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star.

### Step 1: Relating orbital periods to distances
From Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so the distance \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). For Planet_4 and Planet_2:
- \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \), \( P_2 = 2P_1 \)
- \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3} \)

### Step 2: Calculating \( (1.75)^{2/3} \)
- \( 1.75 = \frac{7}{4} \), so \( (1.75)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{2/3} \).
- Approximating:
  - \( 7^{1/3} \approx 1.913 \), \( 7^{2/3} \approx 3.659 \),
  - \( 4^{1/3} \approx 1.587 \), \( 4^{2/3} \approx 2.519 \),
  - \( \frac{7^{2/3}}{4^{2/3}} \approx \frac{3.659}{2.519} \approx 1.453 \).

Thus, \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.453 \).

### Step 3: Relating equilibrium temperatures to distances
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{a} \), so:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\frac{a_4}{a_2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{a_4}{a_2}}}.
\]
Substituting \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.453 \):
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1.453}} \approx \frac{1}{1.205} \approx 0.83.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \), corresponding to option **C**.

Wait, for Planet_4 and Planet_2, we need a4 and a2.

So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Since P4 is 3.5 P1 and P2 is 2 P1, P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75.

So (1.75)^(2/3). Hmm, what's 1.75 as a fraction? It's 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Wait, 7/4 is 1.75.

So 3.66 / 2.5198 ≈ 1.453. So a4 is approximately 1.453 times a2. So a4/a2 ≈ 1.453.

Wait, but wait, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but wait, another approach: the formula T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), as I thought earlier. So the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

Therefore, the ratio T4 / T2 is sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt(1/(a4/a2)) ) = 1 / sqrt(a4/a2).

Wait, let me double-check. If a4 is larger than a2, then T4 is lower than T2. So the ratio T4/T2 would be less than 1.

Wait, let me re-derive this. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (L/(16πa²)) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since L and T_star are the same, and albedo is same, so T is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) ) = 1/(a^0.5). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of a.

So T4 = k / sqrt(a4), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), so T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4).

Which is sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( 1/(a4/a2) ) = 1/sqrt(a4/a2).

So from earlier, a4/a2 is about 1.453, so sqrt(1.453) ≈ 1.205. So T4/T2 is 1/1.205 ≈ 0.8298, which is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let's recalculate the a4/a2 ratio.

P4 is 3.5 P1, P2 is 2 P1. So P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75.

a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute 1.75^(1/3) first.

The cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So 1.2^3 is about 1.728. So 1.75 is about 1.2 * (1.75/1.728)^(1/3). Let me compute 1.75 / 1.728 ≈ 1.013. So the cube root of 1.013 is approximately 1.004. So 1.2 * 1.004 ≈ 1.205. So 1.75^(1/3) ≈ 1.205. Then squared is (1.205)^2 ≈ 1.452. So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452.

So sqrt(a2/a4) is sqrt(1/1.452) = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829. So yes, about 0.83. So option C is correct.

The orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, and the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star.

### Step 1: Relating orbital periods to distances
From Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so the distance \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). For Planet_4 and Planet_2:
- \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \), \( P_2 = 2P_1 \)
- \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3} \)

### Step 2: Calculating \( (1.75)^{2/3} \)
- \( 1.75 = \frac{7}{4} \), so \( (1.75)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{2/3} \).
- Approximating:
  - \( 7^{1/3} \approx 1.913 \), \( 7^{2/3} \approx 3.659 \),
  - \( 4^{1/3} \approx 1.587 \), \( 4^{2/3} \approx 2.519 \),
  - \( \frac{7^{2/3}}{4^{2/3}} \approx \frac{3.659}{2.519} \approx 1.453 \).

Thus, \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.453 \).

### Step 3: Relating equilibrium temperatures to distances
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{a} \), so:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\frac{a_4}{a_2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{a_4}{a_2}}}.
\]
Substituting \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.453 \):
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1.453}} \approx \frac{1}{1.205} \approx 0.83.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \), corresponding to option **C**.
