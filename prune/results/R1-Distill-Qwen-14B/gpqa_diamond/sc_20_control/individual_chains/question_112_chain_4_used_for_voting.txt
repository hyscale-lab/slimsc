Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm.

So the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, wait, "proportional" means I have to normalize it, right? Because the coefficients probably don't sum to 1. So the first thing I need to do is find the normalization factor. 

Let me write down the state. Let's call the normalization factor N. So |alpha> = N[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>]. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So I need to compute the inner product.

The inner product is N^* squared times ( (1-i)(2+i) ) + (2+i)(1-i) )? Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The inner product would be sum over the components. So |alpha> is a vector in a two-dimensional space. So the components are (1+i) and (2-i). So the inner product is (1-i) (1+i)* + (2+i) (2 - i)*? No, wait, no. Wait, the inner product in Dirac notation is <a|b> = sum (a_i^* b_i). So when I compute |alpha> inner product |alpha>, it would be (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i), all multiplied by N squared. Let me calculate that.

Wait, let's compute each term. First term: (1-i)(1+i) is (1)(1) + (1)(i) + (-i)(1) + (-i)(i) = 1 + i -i -i². i squared is -1, so that's 1 - (-1) = 2. So first term is 2.

Second term: (2 + i)(2 - i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1)=5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the inner product is 7*N² =1. So N²=1/7. So N is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

So now, the state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2-i)/sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is about an operator with matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the matrix representation of this operator is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out.

Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, corresponding to |up> and |down>. So for i=1, j=2, A_12 = hbar/2. For i=2, j=1, A_21 = hbar/2. All the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0. So the matrix looks like this:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, but that's a 2x2 matrix. So the operator is represented by this matrix in the basis {|up>, |down>}.

Wait, now the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Oh wait, no: the operator has its own eigenstates, and when we measure this operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitude of the state in each eigenstate.

Wait, but wait. The operator is given, and the state is |alpha>. So to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of this operator, right?

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Because when you measure an operator, the possible results are its eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state you're measuring.

So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonals. Let's write that matrix again:

A = (hbar/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]

Because the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, but I can factor that out. So A = (hbar/2) * [[0 1], [1 0]]

Wait, no, because the matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j. So yes, A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X swaps the basis states. The Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], so A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, since they're just scaled by a scalar. The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so when you multiply by (hbar/2), the eigenvalues become (hbar/2) and -(hbar/2).

But wait, actually, no. Let me correct that. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. So when you have an operator A = c * σ_x, where c is a scalar, the eigenvalues of A are c*(1) and c*(-1).

So here, c is hbar/2. So the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2) and -(hbar/2).

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. These states are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So let's find the eigenstates of A. Because I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates to find the probabilities.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenstates of A would be the same, but scaled by the same factors. Because the matrix is scaled by a scalar, the eigenstates remain the same.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x> as I said.

So now, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, and then the coefficients' squares will give me the probabilities.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, I can compute the probabilities by projecting |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

So the probability P_+ of measuring +hbar/2 is |< +x | alpha > |^2, and the same for the negative eigenvalue.

Alternatively, since the operator is A = (hbar/2) σ_x, the state |alpha> can be written in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients.

So let me compute the components.

First, let me write |+x> and |−x> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So to find the projection of |alpha> onto |+x>, I compute < +x | alpha >.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] |alpha> 

Since |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) (a^* + b^* )

Similarly, the projection onto |−x> is (1/sqrt(2)) ( a^* - b^* )

So let's compute a and b. a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a^* is (1-i)/sqrt(7). Similarly, b is (2 − i)/sqrt(7), so b^* is (2 + i)/sqrt(7).

So a^* + b^* = [ (1 - i) + (2 + i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3 + 0i) / sqrt(7) = 3/sqrt(7)

So < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) * (3/sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )= 3/sqrt(14)

The modulus squared is (9)/(14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, a^* - b^* is [ (1 -i) - (2 +i) ] / sqrt(7) = (1 -i -2 -i ) / sqrt(7) = (-1 - 2i)/sqrt(7)

So < −x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1 - 2i)/sqrt(7) = (-1-2i)/( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (-2)^2 ] / (2 *7) ) = (1 +4)/(14) ) = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the sum of these probabilities is 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, so that's correct. So the probabilities are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. Let's check the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. Hmm, but wait the average value is also given.

Wait, the average value is the expectation value of A in the state |alpha>.

The expectation value <A> is < alpha | A | alpha >.

But since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, this becomes (hbar/2) <alpha | σ_x | alpha >.

But σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, whose expectation in a state is equal to (a^* b + b^* a ), because σ_x in the computational basis has off-diagonal elements. Alternatively, for a general state a|up> + b|down>, the expectation of σ_x is (a b^* + a^* b ) / ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ), but since |alpha> is normalized, |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Wait, let me compute < sigma_x >. sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. So the expectation value is:

<sigma_x> = <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [a^* b + b^* a ].

Wait, because sigma_x in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you act on |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, you get a |down> + b |up>. So the inner product with <alpha| is a^* <up| down> + b^* <up| up> + a^* <down| down> + b^* <down| up>?

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute <alpha| sigma_x | alpha>.

So |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, so sigma_x |alpha> = a |down> + b |up>.

Then, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = a^* <up| down> + a^* <up| up> * b^* ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as a* b + b* a. Because when you compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>, you get <a^* b^*; a^* b^*; the cross terms.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = (a^* <up| + b^* <down|) sigma_x (a |up> + b |down> )

Sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So sigma_x |alpha> = a sigma_x |up> + b sigma_x |down> = a |down> + b |up>.

Then, <alpha | sigma_x |alpha> = a^* <up| (a |down> + b |up> ) + b^* <down| (a |down> + b |up> )

So that's a^* a <up| down> + a^* b <up| up> + b^* a <down| down> + b^* b <down| up>.

But <up| down> is zero, and <up| up> is 1, same for <down| down> is 1, and <down| up> is zero.

So this simplifies to a^* b * 1 + b^* a * 1 = (a^* b + b^* a ).

So <sigma_x> = a^* b + b^* a.

Hmm, let's compute a and b.

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So a^* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7)
b^* is (2 + i)/sqrt(7)

So a^* b = [ (1 - i)(2 - i) ] / 7
And b^* a = [ (2 + i)(1 + i) ] /7

Compute a^* b:

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
=2 -i -2i + i^2
=2 -3i -1 (since i^2=-1)
=1 -3i

So a^* b = (1 - 3i)/7.

Similarly, b^* a:

(2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 +2*i + i*1 +i*i
=2 + 2i +i +i^2
=2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

So b^* a = (1 +3i)/7.

Adding a^* b and b^* a:

(1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, the expectation value of A (which is (hbar/2) sigma_x) is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Now let's look at the probabilities again. The probabilities were 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. That matches the average value we found.

Option C: 0.28 (which is 2/7) and 0.72? No, that's not matching.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 (≈0.3571). So the first option's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to these.

So looking at the options, option A has the probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Alternatively, let me check if any other options have these values.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Yes, that's what we have.

But wait, let me recheck the probabilities. I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, earlier, I found that the projection onto |+x> was 3/sqrt(14), so the modulus squared is 9/14 ≈ 0.6428, and the other is 5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let's compute 9/14: 14/14=1, so 9/14 ≈0.642857, which is about 0.64. The other is approximately 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. That's the closest, but let me check the other options.

Option D: 0.61 and 0.29. Hmm, not matching.

Option B: 0.54 and 0.46. No, doesn't match.

So option A has the correct average value and the probabilities close to 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait, in the calculation, the projection onto |+x> was 3/sqrt(14), which squared is 9/14, which is about 0.6428, which rounds to 0.64. So the first option's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which fits.

So the correct answer is option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.

But wait, looking at the options, option A's average is hbar/7, which is exactly what I calculated.

Wait, but looking back, I thought option A is the correct one. But let me think about why the sum of probabilities is 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which is correct.

So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization condition is \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( N = 1/\sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \hbar/2 \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) for \( i = j \). This operator can be expressed as \( A = (\hbar/2) \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), scaled by the factor \( \hbar/2 \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues of \( A \), we compute the projections of \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). The projection onto \( |+x\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1-i) + (2+i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \) is the modulus squared of this projection:

\[
P(+\hbar/2) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429.
\]

Similarly, the projection onto \( |-x\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1-i) - (2+i) \right) = \frac{-1-2i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue \( -\hbar/2 \) is:

\[
P(-\hbar/2) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (-2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

The average value of \( A \) is given by the expectation value \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Since \( A = (\hbar/2) \sigma_x \), this becomes:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in \( |\alpha\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = a^* b + b^* a,
\]

where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Substituting:

\[
a^* = \frac{1-i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad b^* = \frac{2+i}{\sqrt{7}},
\]

\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7}, \quad b^* a = \frac{(2+i)(1+i)}{7}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a^* b = \frac{1-3i}{7}, \quad b^* a = \frac{1+3i}{7}.
\]

Adding these:

\[
a^* b + b^* a = \frac{1-3i + 1+3i}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options:

- Probabilities: \( P(+\hbar/2) \approx 0.64 \), \( P(-\hbar/2) \approx 0.36 \).
- Average value: \( \langle A \rangle = \hbar/7 \).

This matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
