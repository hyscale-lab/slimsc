Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, right, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I remember that the operator P itself would be the vector sum of these components, right? So P = Px * x + Py * y + Pz * z. But wait, in quantum mechanics, operators are represented by their matrices, and the direction n is along some vector in the x-z plane. 

The direction vector n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. That probably means it's something like (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z, φ is zero or π or something, so maybe it's just (x, 0, z) components. Hmm, maybe the direction can be parameterized with an angle θ from the z-axis. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps. 

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P along n. So the operator in the direction of n would be P·n. So, the operator we're interested in is P_n = (P·n) where n is a unit vector. 

Breaking it down, P·n would be Px * n_x + Py * n_y + Pz * n_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = (Px * n_x) + (Pz * n_z). 

Each of these components (Px, Py, Pz) are matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, let's write each component as matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, substituting n_x and n_z, which should satisfy n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1 because it's a unit vector. Let me say n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. 

So, P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's distribute the terms:

The matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me check that. The first element is (0 * sinθ) + (1 * cosθ) = cosθ. Because for the (1,1) element, it's sinθ * (from Px which has 0 in the (1,1)) plus cosθ * (from Pz which has 1 in (1,1)). Similarly, the (1,2) element is sinθ * 1 (from Px) + cosθ * 0 (from Pz) = sinθ. The (2,1) element is sinθ * 1 (since Px's (2,1) is 1) plus cosθ * 0 (Pz's (2,1) is 0) = sinθ. The (2,2) element is sinθ *0 (from Px) + cosθ*(-1) (from Pz) = -cosθ. So yes, the matrix is correct.

So the matrix for P_n is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, we have to solve the eigenvalue equation: P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Let me denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

I can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the matrix equation becomes:

[ cosθ * a + sinθ * b ] = a
[ sinθ * a - cosθ * b ] = b

So, writing the two equations:

1) cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2) sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let's rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0
a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0 --> equation 1a

Equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0
sinθ a - b (cosθ + 1) = 0 --> equation 2a

So, from equation 1a and 2a, we have a system:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a - ( cosθ + 1 ) b = 0

This is a homogeneous system, and for a non-trivial solution, the determinant must be zero. But since we're looking for eigenvectors, and we have a consistent system, perhaps we can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps solving equation 1a and equation 2a for a and b.

Let me take equation 1a: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
=> (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b
=> a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Similarly, equation 2a: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0
Substituting a from above:
sinθ [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b - (cosθ +1) b = 0
[ (sinθ)^2 / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b - (cosθ +1) b =0

Factor out b:
[ (sin²θ)/(1 - cosθ) ) - (cosθ +1) ] = 0

Let me simplify this expression.

Note that sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ)
So, (sin²θ)/(1 - cosθ) = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ)/(1 - cosθ) )= 1 + cosθ

So, [ (1 + cosθ) - (cosθ + 1) ] = 0 --> 0 =0. So the equation holds, which means our substitution is correct.

So, from equation 1a, a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b
= cot(θ/2) * b

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Let me choose b as a parameter, say b = 1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors are only defined up to a scalar multiple). Then a = cot(θ/2).

But wait, wait. Wait, if θ is the angle in the x-z plane, perhaps θ is measured from the z-axis. So, when θ=0, the direction is along +z, and θ=π/2 would be along +x.

Wait, but in this problem, the direction is arbitrary in x-z. So, the eigenvector should depend on θ. So, the eigenvector is [a, b], with a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Let me write this as [a; b] = [ cot(θ/2); 1 ] multiplied by b. So, the general eigenvector is proportional to (cot(θ/2), 1).

But wait, wait. Let me double-check this. Because when we compute a = cot(θ/2), that's (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)).

So the components are a = (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)), and b=1.

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize. So the length squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So, |a|^2 + |b|^2 = [ cos²(θ/2) / sin²(θ/2) ) ] + 1 = [ cos² + sin² ] / sin² + 1? Wait, no. Wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, |a|^2 + |b|^2 = (cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2)) + 1.

Let me compute this:

= [ cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ] / sin²(θ/2)
= [1] / sin²(θ/2)
= 1 / sin²(θ/2)

So the normalization factor is sqrt(1/sin²(θ/2)) ) = 1/sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) * (1/sin(θ/2)), 1 * (1/sin(θ/2)) ) ].

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Let's see. The components are (a, b) = (cot(θ/2), 1). The normalization factor is 1/sqrt( |a|^2 + |b|^2 )

So |a|² = cot²(θ/2) = [cos²(θ/2)]/[sin²(θ/2)]
|b|² =1

So |a|² + |b|² = [cos² + sin²]/sin² = [1]/sin²(theta/2) 

So normalization factor is sqrt( sin^2(theta/2) ) = sin(theta/2), since theta is between 0 and pi, so sin(theta/2) is positive.

Wait, no. The sum is 1/sin²(theta/2), so the square root is 1/sin(theta/2). So the normalization factor is 1/sin(theta/2). So each component is multiplied by 1/sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector becomes:

a = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * [1/sin(theta/2)] = cos(theta/2) / sin²(theta/2)
b = 1 * [1/sin(theta/2)] = 1/sin(theta/2)

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me recompute.

Wait, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1/sin²(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2 )

b = 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

So the components become [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, that's a much simpler expression. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because when I have a = cot(theta/2), and b =1, and normalization factor is 1/sqrt( (cot^2(theta/2) ) +1 ) 

Because |a|² + |b|² = cot²(theta/2) +1 = [ cos²(theta/2) / sin²(theta/2) ] + 1 = [ cos² + sin² ] / sin² = 1/sin²(theta/2)

So the square root is 1/sin(theta/2). So each component is multiplied by sin(theta/2).

So, a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

b = 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

Yes, that's correct. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's likely the answer.

Wait, but let me recheck because I might have made a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

We have the matrix P_n:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

And we're looking for eigenvectors with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, we set up the equation (P_n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

Wait, wait, wait no. Wait, the equation is (P_n - λ I) |v> =0. So lambda is +ħ/2.

So the matrix P_n - (ħ/2) I is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ ] ] - (ħ/2) I 

Which is (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ-1, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the equations are:

(ħ/2) [ (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b ] = 0
(ħ/2) [ sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b ] = 0

Which simplifies to:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

From the first equation:
(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b
=> a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b

Which is what I had earlier. So then, when I normalized, I get the components as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates but for a 2-component vector, so that's probably for a spin-1 system, but our problem is spin-1/2, so option C is more likely correct.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, but that might be for a specific direction, like along x or z. Wait, for example, if theta is 90 degrees, then cos(theta/2) is cos(45) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(theta/2) is sqrt(2)/2. So the vector would be (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), but that's not matching option D.

Alternatively, perhaps when theta is zero, the direction is along z. Then the eigenvector would be (1, 0), which is correct because along z, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, and the + value is (1,0). Similarly, for theta=pi/2, direction is along x, the eigenvector would be (0,1), but wait, no, because along x, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are (1,0) for + and (0,1) for -? Wait, no, let's think. 

Wait, the P_x operator is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]. So its eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The eigenvectors for + are (0,1), because P_x |0,1> = (ħ/2) (1,0) which is (ħ/2) |0,1> only if I'm not mistaken. Wait, wait, let's compute.

Wait, if |v> is (0,1), then P_x|v> = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0;1] = (ħ/2) [1; 0] = (ħ/2) |1,0>, which is not the same as |v> = (0,1). Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the eigenvectors for P_x. So, the matrix Px is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], so the equation (Px - (ħ/2) I)|v> =0.

Which gives: (ħ/2)[ [ -1, 1 ], [1, -1 ] ] |v> =0.

The equations are: (-1) a + 1 b = 0, and 1 a + (-1) b =0. Both equations are a = b. So the eigenvector is (1,1), which after normalization becomes (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) ). So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 has eigenvector (1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)).

But according to my earlier result, when theta is pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector from option C would be cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, which is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is (1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)) when normalized. So that's correct.

Similarly, for theta =0, direction is along z. Then the eigenvector would be (1,0), which is correct because Pz has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for (1,0) and -ħ/2 for (0,1).

So option C seems correct.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our calculation. The other options don't fit. So the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the $x$-$z$ plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the $x$-$z$ plane and can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle measured from the $z$-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction of $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta$. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the resulting matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0.
\]

Substituting $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ and simplifying, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
= 0.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$,
2. $\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0$.

From the first equation, we find $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. Substituting this into the second equation confirms the consistency of the solution. The eigenvector is then proportional to $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ after normalization. Normalization ensures that the components satisfy $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$, leading to the normalized eigenvector:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is inconsistent with the spin-1/2 system and the derived components.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ introduces incorrect normalization factors.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, right, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I remember that the operator P itself would be the vector sum of these components, right? So P = Px * x + Py * y + Pz * z. But wait, in quantum mechanics, operators are represented by their matrices, and the direction n is along some vector in the x-z plane. 

The direction vector n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. That probably means it's something like (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z, φ is zero or π or something, so maybe it's just (x, 0, z) components. Hmm, maybe the direction can be parameterized with an angle θ from the z-axis. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps. 

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P along n. So the operator in the direction of n would be P·n. So, the operator we're interested in is P_n = (P·n) where n is a unit vector. 

Breaking it down, P·n would be Px * n_x + Py * n_y + Pz * n_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = (Px * n_x) + (Pz * n_z). 

Each of these components (Px, Py, Pz) are matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, let's write each component as matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, substituting n_x and n_z, which should satisfy n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1 because it's a unit vector. Let me say n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. 

So, P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's distribute the terms:

The matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me check that. The first element is (0 * sinθ) + (1 * cosθ) = cosθ. Because for the (1,1) element, it's sinθ * (from Px which has 0 in the (1,1)) plus cosθ * (from Pz which has 1 in (1,1)). Similarly, the (1,2) element is sinθ * 1 (from Px) + cosθ * 0 (from Pz) = sinθ. The (2,1) element is sinθ * 1 (since Px's (2,1) is 1) plus cosθ * 0 (Pz's (2,1) is 0) = sinθ. The (2,2) element is sinθ *0 (from Px) + cosθ*(-1) (from Pz) = -cosθ. So yes, the matrix is correct.

So the matrix for P_n is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, we have to solve the eigenvalue equation: P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Let me denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

I can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the matrix equation becomes:

[ cosθ * a + sinθ * b ] = a
[ sinθ * a - cosθ * b ] = b

So, writing the two equations:

1) cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2) sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let's rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0
a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0 --> equation 1a

Equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0
sinθ a - b (cosθ + 1) = 0 --> equation 2a

So, from equation 1a and 2a, we have a system:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a - ( cosθ + 1 ) b = 0

This is a homogeneous system, and for a non-trivial solution, the determinant must be zero. But since we're looking for eigenvectors, and we have a consistent system, perhaps we can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps solving equation 1a and equation 2a for a and b.

Let me take equation 1a: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
=> (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b
=> a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Similarly, equation 2a: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0
Substituting a from above:
sinθ [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b - (cosθ +1) b = 0
[ (sinθ)^2 / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b - (cosθ +1) b =0

Factor out b:
[ (sin²θ)/(1 - cosθ) ) - (cosθ +1) ] = 0

Let me simplify this expression.

Note that sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ)
So, (sin²θ)/(1 - cosθ) = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ)/(1 - cosθ) )= 1 + cosθ

So, [ (1 + cosθ) - (cosθ + 1) ] = 0 --> 0 =0. So the equation holds, which means our substitution is correct.

So, from equation 1a, a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b
= cot(θ/2) * b

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Let me choose b as a parameter, say b = 1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors are only defined up to a scalar multiple). Then a = cot(θ/2).

But wait, wait. Wait, if θ is the angle in the x-z plane, perhaps θ is measured from the z-axis. So, when θ=0, the direction is along +z, and θ=π/2 would be along +x.

Wait, but in this problem, the direction is arbitrary in x-z. So, the eigenvector should depend on θ. So, the eigenvector is [a, b], with a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Let me write this as [a; b] = [ cot(θ/2); 1 ] multiplied by b. So, the general eigenvector is proportional to (cot(θ/2), 1).

But wait, wait. Let me double-check this. Because when we compute a = cot(θ/2), that's (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)).

So the components are a = (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)), and b=1.

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize. So the length squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So, |a|^2 + |b|^2 = [ cos²(θ/2) / sin²(θ/2) ) ] + 1 = [ cos² + sin² ] / sin² + 1? Wait, no. Wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, |a|^2 + |b|^2 = (cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2)) + 1.

Let me compute this:

= [ cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ] / sin²(θ/2)
= [1] / sin²(θ/2)
= 1 / sin²(θ/2)

So the normalization factor is sqrt(1/sin²(θ/2)) ) = 1/sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) * (1/sin(θ/2)), 1 * (1/sin(θ/2)) ) ].

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Let's see. The components are (a, b) = (cot(θ/2), 1). The normalization factor is 1/sqrt( |a|^2 + |b|^2 )

So |a|² = cot²(θ/2) = [cos²(θ/2)]/[sin²(θ/2)]
|b|² =1

So |a|² + |b|² = [cos² + sin²]/sin² = [1]/sin²(theta/2) 

So normalization factor is sqrt( sin^2(theta/2) ) = sin(theta/2), since theta is between 0 and pi, so sin(theta/2) is positive.

Wait, no. The sum is 1/sin²(theta/2), so the square root is 1/sin(theta/2). So the normalization factor is 1/sin(theta/2). So each component is multiplied by 1/sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector becomes:

a = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * [1/sin(theta/2)] = cos(theta/2) / sin²(theta/2)
b = 1 * [1/sin(theta/2)] = 1/sin(theta/2)

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me recompute.

Wait, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1/sin²(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2 )

b = 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

So the components become [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, that's a much simpler expression. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because when I have a = cot(theta/2), and b =1, and normalization factor is 1/sqrt( (cot^2(theta/2) ) +1 ) 

Because |a|² + |b|² = cot²(theta/2) +1 = [ cos²(theta/2) / sin²(theta/2) ] + 1 = [ cos² + sin² ] / sin² = 1/sin²(theta/2)

So the square root is 1/sin(theta/2). So each component is multiplied by sin(theta/2).

So, a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

b = 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

Yes, that's correct. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's likely the answer.

Wait, but let me recheck because I might have made a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

We have the matrix P_n:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

And we're looking for eigenvectors with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, we set up the equation (P_n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

Wait, wait, wait no. Wait, the equation is (P_n - λ I) |v> =0. So lambda is +ħ/2.

So the matrix P_n - (ħ/2) I is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ ] ] - (ħ/2) I 

Which is (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ-1, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the equations are:

(ħ/2) [ (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b ] = 0
(ħ/2) [ sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b ] = 0

Which simplifies to:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

From the first equation:
(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b
=> a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b

Which is what I had earlier. So then, when I normalized, I get the components as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates but for a 2-component vector, so that's probably for a spin-1 system, but our problem is spin-1/2, so option C is more likely correct.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, but that might be for a specific direction, like along x or z. Wait, for example, if theta is 90 degrees, then cos(theta/2) is cos(45) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(theta/2) is sqrt(2)/2. So the vector would be (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), but that's not matching option D.

Alternatively, perhaps when theta is zero, the direction is along z. Then the eigenvector would be (1, 0), which is correct because along z, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, and the + value is (1,0). Similarly, for theta=pi/2, direction is along x, the eigenvector would be (0,1), but wait, no, because along x, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are (1,0) for + and (0,1) for -? Wait, no, let's think. 

Wait, the P_x operator is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]. So its eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The eigenvectors for + are (0,1), because P_x |0,1> = (ħ/2) (1,0) which is (ħ/2) |0,1> only if I'm not mistaken. Wait, wait, let's compute.

Wait, if |v> is (0,1), then P_x|v> = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0;1] = (ħ/2) [1; 0] = (ħ/2) |1,0>, which is not the same as |v> = (0,1). Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the eigenvectors for P_x. So, the matrix Px is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], so the equation (Px - (ħ/2) I)|v> =0.

Which gives: (ħ/2)[ [ -1, 1 ], [1, -1 ] ] |v> =0.

The equations are: (-1) a + 1 b = 0, and 1 a + (-1) b =0. Both equations are a = b. So the eigenvector is (1,1), which after normalization becomes (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) ). So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 has eigenvector (1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)).

But according to my earlier result, when theta is pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector from option C would be cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, which is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is (1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)) when normalized. So that's correct.

Similarly, for theta =0, direction is along z. Then the eigenvector would be (1,0), which is correct because Pz has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for (1,0) and -ħ/2 for (0,1).

So option C seems correct.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our calculation. The other options don't fit. So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the $x$-$z$ plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the $x$-$z$ plane and can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle measured from the $z$-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction of $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta$. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the resulting matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0.
\]

Substituting $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ and simplifying, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
= 0.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$,
2. $\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0$.

From the first equation, we find $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. Substituting this into the second equation confirms the consistency of the solution. The eigenvector is then proportional to $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ after normalization. Normalization ensures that the components satisfy $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$, leading to the normalized eigenvector:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is inconsistent with the spin-1/2 system and the derived components.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ introduces incorrect normalization factors.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
