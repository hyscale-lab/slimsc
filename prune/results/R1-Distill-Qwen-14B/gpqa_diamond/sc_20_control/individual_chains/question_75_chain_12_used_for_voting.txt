Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me start by going through the problem again.

The researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse where GADD45G is overexpressed. They've introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. But when they tested the expression, it didn't work as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and found an issue.

Looking at the possible options:

Option A says there's a missense mutation in the HA sequence. That could mean the HA tag isn't properly formed, so the protein might not be recognized by antibodies used for detection. But wait, the question says they used affinity purification. If the HA tag is messed up, the protein might not be purified, so expression wouldn't be detected.

Option B suggests the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the mRNA before the end. If the construct has a premature stop codon, the protein would be truncated and not functional. But how does that relate to the sequence given?

Option C talks about the lack of a linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag isn't properly attached or if the linker is missing, maybe the protein is being degraded. But the sequence seems to have the HA tag at the beginning. I'm not sure about this one.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in mice. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But in the plasmid, the sequence is for the construct in the mouse. Wait, but CHO cells are hamster cells, not mouse. Oh, but the question says they transfected the plasmid into CHO cells. If the construct is for mouse, would the stop codon matter? Let me think about the mRNA and the presence of stop codons.

Looking at the given sequence: it's the plus strand, which is the same as the mRNA (except T instead of U). Let me scan for any stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA). Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me look for any of the stop codons.

Looking through the sequence: I'll go through in triplets. Let's see:

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let's see:

Looking at the sequence in the plus strand, which is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. Wait, wait, the given sequence is the coding (sense) strand. So the mRNA would be the same as this, except T becomes U.

So looking for UAA, UAG, UGA in the mRNA. Let me scan the sequence.

Looking through the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTG GAA GAA GTC ...

Wait, here's a TGA in positions 18-20. The sequence has "TACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

So looking for any of the stop codons. Let me look for TGA in the plus strand, which would be UGA in mRNA. Let me see:

Looking at the sequence:

... CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GCC A ...

Wait, at the very end, the sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So the last part is GAG TGA. So that's two triplets: GAG and TGA.

So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct ends with TGA. That would be a stop codon in the mRNA, right?

Wait, but the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. If the HA is correctly added, then the entire coding sequence should be after the ATG. But if the construct has a stop codon in the middle, that would truncate the protein.

Wait, but looking at the given sequence, does it include a stop codon elsewhere? Let's see.

Looking at the beginning: ATG is the start. Then TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), etc.

Wait, earlier in the sequence, at position... let me count. Let's see:

The initial part:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTG GAA ...

Ah, here at the early part (after some ATGs), there's TGA. So TGA is a stop codon. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation here, leading to a truncated protein.

Wait, so the construct has a premature stop codon, causing the protein to be made only up to that point. So the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but the GADD45G is cut off early.

So why is that happening? Because the construct has a stop codon in the middle. But why is that there?

Looking back, the user modified the coding sequence to add the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct should start with the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. But if in their construct, after some codons, there's a TGA (UGA in mRNA), that would cause the ribosome to stop, leading to a truncated protein.

So the problem is that the construct includes a premature stop codon, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early. So that's option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but why is there a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence? Maybe the construct was designed incorrectly. Perhaps they inserted the HA tag without properly considering reading frame or introduced a stop codon.

So the presence of TGA in the coding sequence (which becomes UGA in mRNA) causes a premature stop, leading to no full-length protein being made. So the expression is low or undetectable because the protein is truncated and perhaps not functional, so the detection methods (like Western blot with HA antibodies) wouldn't pick up much.

So the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but looking again, the sequence given is the plus strand. So in the mRNA, it's the same as the plus strand except T becomes U. So the TGA in the construct becomes UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would stop there.

So yes, the issue is that the construct has a premature stop codon, causing early termination. So the expression is low because the protein isn't made to full length, so the overexpression isn't observed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an HA tag in a transgenic mouse model. However, the overexpression is not observed, and the sequence of the plus strand of the construct is provided. Upon analyzing the sequence, a premature stop codon (TGA in the plus strand, which translates to UGA in the mRNA) is identified early in the coding sequence. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein. Consequently, the full-length GADD45G protein is not produced, and the overexpression is not observed. 

The presence of this premature stop codon is likely due to an error in the design or construction of the construct, which introduces the stop codon into the coding sequence. This issue aligns with the observation that the ribosome terminates translation early, preventing the production of the full-length protein.
