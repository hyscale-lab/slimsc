Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbons in total. 

First, I need to understand the structure based on the given information. The compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring, which means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The FTIR data says there's a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents must include a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The aromatic ring is 6-membered, like benzene. Di-substituted means two substituents. The carbonyl group could be part of a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or something else. The halogen is attached directly to the aromatic ring, making it an aryl halide. So, the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but then the total number of carbons is 8. Let me count. The benzene ring has 6 carbons. So, the substituents should contribute 2 carbons. Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, if the substituents are, for example, a carbonyl group as part of a methyl group, but wait, let's think again.

Wait, the substituents: each substituent is attached to the ring. Let's consider that each substituent contributes to the total carbon count. For example, one substituent is a carbonyl group. Wait, but how? A carbonyl group could be part of a ketone, like R-CO-R'. Let me think about possible substituents.

If one substituent is a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone group, like a methyl ketone. But wait, methyl group is CH3, so that's one substituent. Then, the other substituent is a halogen. But wait, that would only add 1 carbon (the carbonyl group as part of a ketone, like O=C-R where R is a substituent attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe I should think of the substituents as being -COX and -X, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen. Let me think of possible structures.

Another approach: Let's think about the substituents. Suppose one substituent is a carbonyl group as part of an acyl group, like an acetyl group (COCH3), and the other substituent is a halogen, say Cl or Br. But wait, that would add more than just 2 carbons. Let me count: benzene is 6 carbons. The acetyl group is O-CO-CH3, so that's two carbons (the CO and CH3). Then the halogen substituent is just one atom, not a carbon. So, total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. That fits the total of 8 carbons.

So, the structure would be di-substituted benzene with an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen (like Cl or Br) attached. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached directly, like as a ketone, but that would require more carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen. But wait, a carbonyl itself is a group that's connected to the ring. For example, if one substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), that's a carbonyl, and another is Cl. Then, the aldehyde substituent would be -CHO (which is one carbon plus the aldehyde group). But then, the total carbons would be 6 (ring) +1 (CHO) =7, plus the Cl substituent, which doesn't add a carbon. So that's only 7 carbons, but the compound has 8. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the substituents are an acyl group (like O-CO-CH3) and Cl. So, in that case, the acetyl group contributes 2 carbons, and the Cl contributes nothing. So 6 + 2 = 8. That fits.

So the structure is benzene with an acetyl group and a Cl substituent. Now, where are these substituents attached? Di-substituted rings can have substituents in various positions, like para, meta, or ortho. Depending on that, the NMR will look different.

But the question is about the NMR data. Let's think about each option.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). 

Hmm. 9.9 is a very deshielded proton, possibly an aldehyde proton. But wait, an aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But wait, if the substituent is an acetyl group (-COCH3), then the CH3 would be around 2.1 ppm as a singlet. But in option A, there's a singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H), which might be something else. Wait, but the aldehyde would have one proton, so 1H as a singlet. But in this case, that's at 9.9. But wait, if the substituent is a ketone, like a COCH3, then the CH3 would be around 2.1 ppm, but the aromatic protons would be split depending on substituents.

Alternatively, the aldehyde group would only give a singlet for the H, but in option A, the aldehyde would be present, but I'm not sure if that matches the substituent scenario.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm (each 2H, d). That might be for something like an ethylene group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps a CH2-O-CH2 situation, like in an ether or ester. But where would that come into play? If the substituent was a carbonyl group, maybe as an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted with a methylene group adjacent to something else. But I'm not seeing how this connects to the given substituents.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H suggests a CH3 group attached to something deshielding, like a carbonyl. Like a COCH3 group. So, that might fit if one substituent is COCH3 (acetyl group). The aromatic protons here are in a doublet pattern, which suggests they're adjacent to substituents. So if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. Wait, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the aromatic protons would be in a pattern depending on where the substituents are. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the ring would have symmetry, leading to two sets of doublets. So, for example, if one substituent is at position 1 and the other at position 4, then the H's at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and H's at 3 and 5 would be equivalent, leading to two doublets.

So, for option C, the aromatic peaks at 7.8 and 7.6 are each doublets, with 2H each. So that suggests two sets of equivalent protons. That makes sense for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. And the 2.3 ppm peak would be the CH3 attached to the carbonyl group.

So, in this case, the structure would be benzene with an acetyl group (COCH3) and a halogen in the para position. That would give the aromatic protons as two doublets each integrating to 2H. So the NMR would match option C.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 1H singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton, but in a di-substituted benzene, perhaps in a meta position relative to substituents. The 4.8 and 4.6 ppm with doublets could be adjacent to oxygen, perhaps part of an ether or ester. The 1.3 ppm singlet (2H) is a bit unusual. Maybe a CH2 group attached to something else. Not sure how this fits in with a carbonyl and a halogen substituent.

So, going back to the problem. The substituents are a carbonyl group (probably as an acetyl) and a halogen. So, the NMR should show the aromatic protons as two doublets (if para) or some other pattern. The acetyl group would give a singlet around 2.3 ppm for the CH3.

Looking at option C, that's exactly the case. So the aromatic peaks are two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted ring. The 2.3 ppm is the CH3 from the acetyl group. That would fit the structure of benzene with COCH3 and Cl in para positions, for example.

Wait, but the FTIR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents are COCH3 and Cl. So, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, the COCH3 as singlet, and the Cl as no protons. So option C's NMR would match that.

Wait, but in the question, the substituents are a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen. So, the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a -X (X is halogen). So, the structure is benzene with substituents -COCH3 and -X (like Cl or Br).

Therefore, the NMR should have:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets (if para), each 2H.

- A singlet for the COCH3 group at ~2.3 ppm.

Looking at option C, that's exactly the case. So option C's data would match this structure.

Other options don't seem to fit. For example, option A has a singlet at 9.9, which would be an aldehyde H. But that would require the substituent to be -CHO, which would add only one carbon. But that would make the total carbons 7 (6 +1), but the compound has 8. So that can't be.

Option B has signals that don't include any aromatic protons, which doesn't make sense because the compound is aromatic.

Option D has a singlet aromatic proton, which would suggest a meta substitution, but then the substituents would have to be in such positions that only one H is left, but it's more complicated. Plus, the other peaks don't fit the substituents.

So, the correct answer must be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. The FTIR data indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group (likely an acetyl group, -COCH3) and a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br). The total carbon count matches: 6 carbons from the benzene ring, 2 carbons from the acetyl group, and the halogen does not contribute to the carbon count.

The NMR data must reflect this structure. The aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (e.g., -COCH3 and -X) would appear as two doublets, each integrating to 2H, due to the symmetry of the molecule. The acetyl group would contribute a singlet at ~2.3 ppm for the CH3 protons. 

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton (-CHO), which would only contribute 1 carbon. This does not match the total carbon count of 8. Additionally, the singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H) is inconsistent with the expected CH3 group of the acetyl group. **Eliminated**.

- **Option B**: The signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm (2H, d) suggest protons adjacent to oxygen, possibly from an ether or ester group. However, this is inconsistent with the presence of a carbonyl group and a halogen as substituents. **Eliminated**.

- **Option C**: The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm (2H each), consistent with a para-substituted benzene. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the CH3 group of the acetyl group (-COCH3). This matches the expected structure. **Correct**.

- **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H) suggests a single aromatic proton, which would imply a meta-substitution pattern. However, the other signals (e.g., 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm) do not align with the expected substituents. **Eliminated**.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene with an acetyl group and a halogen.
