Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break down the target molecule first. So, the structure has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH. Also, there's another cyclohexyl group attached to that same carbon (so it's like a cyclohexyl-(CH2OH)-cyclohexane), and then a carbaldehyde group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane with a substituent that's CH2OH connected to another cyclohexane, and a formyl (CHO) group somewhere else on the main ring.

Wait, actually, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the cyclohexane has a -CHO group. Then, at position 1 (which would be adjacent to the CHO), there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. That substituent is a CH2OH group attached to the cyclohexane ring, and that's connected to the main ring at position 1.

So, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and another substituent which is a CH2OH attached to another cyclohexane. So, the main chain is something like cyclohexane with a -CHO and a -(cyclohexyl-CH2OH) group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is an alkyne group, so the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So, the molecule is cyclohexane with a triple bond leading to a hydrogen.

I need to figure out the sequence of reagents to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about the transformations needed.

First, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexyl-ethynyl compound. I'm trying to get a more substituted structure with a hydroxyl group and a formyl group.

Let me outline the steps needed. Maybe I should start by considering the possible functional group transformations.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be functionalized. One common approach with terminal alkynes is to perform a hydration. But for that, I need the right conditions. Alternatively, maybe I can do some kind of alkyne addition or substitution.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first reagent in all options is NaNH2, which is a strong base. And the second reagent varies. Hmm. Oh, wait, maybe the first step is deprotonation to form a cyclohexynide.

NaNH2 is used to deprotonate alkynes, forming acetylides. So, if I have ethynylcyclohexane, treating it with NaNH2 would deprotonate the triple bond, giving a cyclohexylacetylide. Then, alkyl halides can be used in an alkylation.

Looking at the options, the second reagent in options A and C is methyl chloride, which is CH3Cl. So, perhaps the first step is forming the acetylide, then methylating it.

Wait, but wait, ethynylcyclohexane is HC≡C-Cyclohexane. Deprotonating would give Cyclohexyl-C≡^-Na^+. Then, when you add a methylating agent like CH3Cl, the acetylide would attack, giving Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, that's 1-propynylcyclohexane? Or wait, maybe it becomes substituted at the sp-hybridized carbon.

Wait, no. The ethynyl group is CH2C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no. Wait, ethynyl is a substituent where the cyclohexane is attached to the triple bond. So, it's cyclohexane-C≡CH. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH group attached.

When you deprotonate that, you get cyclohexylacetylide: cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) can alkylate the acetylide. So, the acetylide's carbon attacks CH3Cl, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, the product would be 1-propynylcyclohexane or 1-cyclohexylpropyne? Hmm, not entirely sure about the naming, but the structure is now a longer alkyne.

Wait, but if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (which is CH2CH2-C≡CH, no, wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH). So, after deprotonation and alkylation with CH3Cl, the product is C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

So, now the molecule is 1-propynylcyclohexane or 3-cyclohexyl-1-propyne?

Not sure about the exact name, but the structure is a cyclohexane with a propynyl group (a three-carbon alkyne).

But what's the next step? Looking at the target molecule, perhaps we need to add a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne can be hydrogenated. Hydrogenation of a triple bond can yield either an alkene or an alkane, depending on the conditions.

In the options, some steps involve H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. Option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is probably a hydrogenation catalyst. So maybe after the alkyne is alkylated, we hydrogenate it to make a single bond.

Wait, let's think about the possible steps.

Option C: after NaNH2 and methyl chloride (steps 1 and 2), then H2/Pd-CaCO3. Then O3/(CH3)2S, then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but that might be a bit confusing. Let me think about each option's steps.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group can be used to form a ketone or another functional group.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, and a formyl group on another cyclohexane. So perhaps the ethynyl group can be transformed into a carbonyl, then further functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into an enol, then into a ketone via oxidation. Not sure.

Wait, let me think of the target structure again. The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a diol after hydration. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of alkyne reduction to a cis-alkene, then dihydroxylation to form a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some oxidation.

Wait, but I'm probably overcomplicating. Let's think about each step in the options.

Looking at the options, they all have four steps except option A, which has three. Hmm, but perhaps I should check each one.

Option A: Steps 1-3 are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2, followed by H2SO4 and HgSO4, H2O. Wait, but step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Wait, but that's the same as the same step in a different option? Or perhaps I misread.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liquid NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-CaCO3; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liquid NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, let's go through each option.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

Option C's first step is NaNH2, then methyl chloride. So, as I thought before, deprotonate to form cyclohexylacetylide, then alkylate with methyl chloride to make cyclohexyl-propynyl (C6H11-C≡C-CH3).

Then, step 2 is hydrogenation. H2 with Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond. The triple bond would become a single bond, but wait, under H2 and Pd, an alkyne would become an alkane? Or would it become an alkene if using Lindlar's catalyst? Wait, Pd is usually for alkene hydrogenation, but in the presence of a poison like quinoline, it's for cis addition. Without poison, Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Wait, no. Let me correct: the hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd typically gives an alkane, but if using a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's, it gives cis-alkene. Without the poison, it's more likely to go all the way to the alkane. Wait, but depending on conditions, sometimes it might stop at the alkene. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps using a different catalyst, like Na/NH3, would give a trans-alkene.

Wait, but in option C, the second step is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, Pd with CaCO3 is probably a standard catalyst for hydrogenation. So, the alkyne would be hydrogenated to a single bond. So, after alkylation, the molecule is C6H11-C≡C-CH3, and after hydrogenation, it would become C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, cyclohexylpropane? Wait, that would be a three-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but that's just a straight chain. Now, what's next in option C: step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into carbonyl groups. But if the molecule after hydrogenation is a straight chain, perhaps only a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do much. Wait, unless the molecule has a double bond.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm missing something. After the alkyne is hydrogenated, it becomes a single bond, so no double bond. Ozonolysis would require a double bond. So, perhaps the product after hydrogenation does have a double bond. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation step is not complete.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation stops at the alkene. So, if the alkyne C6H11-C≡C-CH3 is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, maybe it goes to the cis-alkene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated in a different way.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted to an enol ether or something else. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated to a longer chain and then functionalized in another way.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group and a -CH2OH group attached to another cyclohexane.

Wait, but how do we get the -CHO group? Maybe oxidation of a secondary alcohol? But where would that come from.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group. Let's think. For example, oxidative cleavage of an alkyne can give a diketone, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: the ethynyl group can be subjected to hydration to form a ketone. Terminal alkynes can be hydrolyzed to ketones under certain conditions. Wait, no, wait: the hydration of a terminal alkyne (HC≡CR) typically gives a ketone (R-C-OH), but that's under acidic or catalytic conditions.

Wait, but in the presence of HgSO4 and H2SO4, maybe. So, for example, the hydration of propyne (HC≡CCH3) with H2SO4 and HgSO4 would give acetone (propan-2-one). So, perhaps ethynylcyclohexane, when treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4, would form cyclohexanone? Wait, no, because ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. Hydration would produce C6H11-C(OH)CH3. Wait, that's not exactly right. Because the triple bond is between cyclohexane and H, so hydration would add an -OH to the triple bond, giving cyclohexylacetaldehyde. Wait, no, maybe.

Wait, let's get this straight. The structure is C6H11-C≡CH. So, the triple bond is between C6H11 and H. So, hydration would add an -OH across the triple bond. So, the product would be C6H11-C(OH)H. But wait, that's an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, and when you hydrate it, you get R-CHO.

Ah, right! So, ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH) when treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration) would produce cyclohexylacetaldehyde (C6H11-CHO). That's a formyl group attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the formyl group is on the cyclohexane, which matches this. So, perhaps the first step is to hydrate the alkyne into a formyl group.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first steps are NaNH2, then something else. So, perhaps the initial steps involve making a longer chain, then some functional group transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation to form an acetylide, then alkylation, then hydrogenation to form a longer chain, then ozonolysis to break it into smaller fragments with carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think. Option C's steps: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → make the acetylide and methylate to get C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But that would break a double bond, but if the molecule is now a single bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So, this doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't go all the way. Wait, maybe the Pd catalyst stops at the alkene. So, the triple bond becomes a cis-alkene. So, after step 2, the molecule would be C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond? No, wait. If H2 and Pd are used, the alkyne would first hydrogenate to an alkene, then to an alkane. But if the reaction is stopped at the alkene, perhaps via a poisoned catalyst, but in option C, the catalyst is Pd with CaCO3, which I think is more for alkene hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step's possible reaction.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → form acetylide and methylate → C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate alkyne to alkane: C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Wait, but this molecule is fully saturated. Ozonolysis needs a double bond. So, this doesn't make sense. So option C can't be correct because ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

So, perhaps I can eliminate option C.

Looking at option D: steps are 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liquid NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol: that would deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then methylate with methanol? Wait, wait, methanol is the methylating agent? But in the presence of a base like NaNH2, would that work? Or, wait, maybe the acetylide would attack methanol as an electrophile. So, CH3O- would be the source of the methyl group. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the methyl chloride is the methylating agent, but in option D, it's methanol.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is making the acetylide, and step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, used for deprotonation, perhaps for elimination reactions. But I'm not sure how that would help here.

Option B: steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride → acetylide and ethylation. Then Li/NH3, then O3/H2O, then NH4OH.

Hmm. So, ethylation would give a longer chain. Then, Li in NH3 is a strong base, maybe for elimination to form a double bond, or for alkyne deprotonation? Not sure.

Wait, maybe after ethylation, we have C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then using Li in NH3 (a strong base) could induce elimination, forming a triple bond again. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or another structure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this problem by considering the target's structure and the necessary functional group transformations.

The target has a formyl group (-CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) attached to a cyclohexane ring. Additionally, the hydroxymethyl is connected to another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps we need to form a diol from the alkyne, then perform some oxidation and alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group via hydration, then further functionalized.

Wait, but in the options, the initial steps involve NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which suggests alkyne alkylation. So, maybe the ethynyl group is extended to a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated or oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the process involves forming a ketone or another functional group, then performing oxidation or alkylation.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl, which is attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is transformed into a bromide, which is then used in a nucleophilic substitution.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about each option's steps.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, the alkyne is deprotonated to an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But wait, if the acetylide is treated with methanol (CH3OH), would that lead to alkylation? Because the acetylide would attack the methyl group in CH3OH. So, the product would be C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH? Hmm, but I'm not sure about that because typically, alkylation uses alkyl halides, not alcohols, unless under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in option D is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base and can induce elimination. So, if the first step methylated the acetylide, perhaps the second step would deprotonate and cause the elimination of the OH, forming a triple bond again. Not sure.

Option B has steps 1 and 2 as NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liquid NH3. So, ethyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, giving a longer alkyne. Then Li/NH3 is a strong base, which could induce elimination, maybe forming a triple bond again, or perhaps a ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 is used for a conjugate addition or for forming a Grignard-like reagent.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the target's structure and see what steps are needed.

The target has a formyl group (-CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is also attached to another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group, then further functionalized.

Wait, if we take ethynylcyclohexane and hydrate it to form cyclohexylacetaldehyde (C6H11-CHO), that could be a starting point. But in the options, the first step is NaNH2, which suggests deprotonation and alkylation, not hydration.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have HgSO4 and H2SO4 as the first step. So perhaps the initial steps are building a longer chain, which is then cleaved to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene via hydrogenation, then dihydroxylation to form a diol, which can then be functionalized.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing a clear path.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first alkylated to form a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated to form a longer chain, and then ozonolysis is used to break the chain into a carbonyl group.

Wait, so let's say after alkylation, the molecule is C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenated to C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. Ozonolysis would require a double bond, but this molecule is a single bond. So that's not possible.

Wait, unless the hydrogenation step doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond, but leaves a double bond. But that's only possible with a poisoned catalyst. But option C's step 2 is H2/Pd, which is probably not poisoned.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via hydration. Wait, but I think that's done with different conditions, like H2O and HgSO4/H2SO4, but that's not the first step in any of the options.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence starts with deprotonation and alkylation, then hydrogenation, then ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and then further oxidation or something.

Wait, let's take option D. Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then react with methanol. So, the product would be C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe this would eliminate the hydroxyl group, forming a triple bond again, giving back the alkynyl group. But that seems counterproductive.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Grignard-like reaction. But I'm not sure.

Option B: after alkylation with ethyl chloride, giving C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2 is Li in NH3. Perhaps this induces elimination, forming a triple bond again, or maybe a ring formation.

Wait, another thought: maybe the sequence forms a cyclohexane ring with a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated, and then functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to alkylate the alkyne, hydrogenate it to a single bond, then perform ozonolysis to break a double bond into carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me reevaluate.

Option C steps: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → get C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond → C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But the molecule is now a single bond, so ozonolysis won't do anything. So, this can't be correct.

Hmm. So, perhaps option D?

Option D: steps 1 and 2: acetylide formation followed by reaction with methanol. Then, Li in NH3. Then, ozonolysis and workup.

Wait, if step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, the acetylide would react with CH3OH, giving C6H11-C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH? Not sure about that. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe this would eliminate the hydroxyl group, forming a triple bond again, giving back C6H11-C≡CH. Then, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S, which would cleave any double bonds, but if the molecule is again an alkyne, that won't help. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 is used for a Birch reduction or some kind of elimination.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use a different method. Let's think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Perhaps the formyl group is obtained by oxidizing a secondary alcohol. So, we need a secondary alcohol somewhere in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then further functionalized.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a diol via dihydroxylation, then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But that seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to some kind of addition to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, maybe the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide.

2. Alkylate it with methyl chloride to get a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

4. Ozonolyze the alkane to form carbonyl groups.

But that doesn't make sense as ozonolysis requires a double bond.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis is used to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think again. If the alkyne is alkylated to C6H11-C≡C-CH3, then hydrogenated with H2 and a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar's) to form a cis-alkene: C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? No, because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So, hydrogenation would convert C6H11-C≡C-CH3 into C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 (no double bond). So, no double bond, so ozonolysis won't work.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, then cleaved. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol via hydration, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but I don't see any steps involving that in the options.

Wait, looking at option D again. Step 4 is NH4OH, which is used in the workup after ozonolysis. So, perhaps the ozonolysis is followed by reductive workup to form aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is extended via alkylation.

2. The extended alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane.

3. Ozonolysis is done, but that doesn't work without a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the target structure again.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So, the structure is like cyclohexane with a substituent that is -(cyclohexyl-CH2OH) and a CHO.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a formyl group, then some alkylation occurs to add the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, if step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, making the acetylide and methylating it. Then, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation to make a single bond, then step 3 is oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH. That suggests that a cyclohexane ring is attached via a CH2OH group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is transformed into a CH2OH group.

Wait, perhaps through a series of steps. For example, alkyne to carbonyl, then to alcohol, then to something else.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group via hydration. So, step 1 would be HgSO4 and H2SO4 to form a ketone or aldehyde. Then, further steps would add the cyclohexyl group.

But looking at the options, the first reagent is NaNH2, not the hydration conditions. So perhaps the initial steps are not about hydration.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of each option's sequence.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylate the acetylide to form a longer alkyne.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → perhaps deprotonate and eliminate, forming a triple bond again, but with a longer chain.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of a diene? But I'm not sure.

4. NH4OH → workup to form carbonyl groups.

Hmm, not making sense.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → acetylide and methylate to form C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH.

Step 2: Li/liquid NH3 → strong base, maybe eliminate the hydroxyl, forming a triple bond again or perhaps an alkyne.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → no double bond, so nothing.

Hmm. Not helpful.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → form C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a diene? Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions. So, maybe the molecule C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 would lose two protons to form a double bond, becoming C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH2 → no, probably not.

Wait, wait. If the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3, and Ba(OH)2 is used, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton, leading to elimination. But where would the elimination be? Maybe there's a possibility of forming a cyclohexene if the chain is long enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step in option A doesn't go to completion, leaving a double bond. Then, Ba(OH)2 would cause elimination, but I'm not sure.

Then, step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which are conditions for hydrating an alkyne to a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but if the molecule is a diene, perhaps it's hydrolyzed, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, Ba(OH)2 would cause some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes, but that's under different conditions.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about the correct way to introduce the formyl and hydroxymethyl groups.

The target has a formyl group (-CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) attached to a cyclohexane, and the hydroxymethyl is attached to another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a formyl group via hydration. That would give cyclohexylacetaldehyde. Then, perhaps some kind of alkylation to introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but how? Maybe using a Grignard reagent or some alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first extended via alkylation, then after some functionalization, the formyl and hydroxymethyl groups are introduced.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not sure. Let me re-examine.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond: C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But since it's a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. So, this can't be right.

So, option C is out.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → acetylide + CH3OH → product could be C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → strong base, perhaps eliminate the OH group, forming a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → needs a double bond, but if step 2 left us with an alkyne, no.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Make the acetylide and alkylation to extend the chain.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups.

But in the options, none of the steps directly address this except maybe option C, but with the problem that ozonolysis requires a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene (using a poisoned catalyst), then ozonolysis is done to break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, let's say after step 2 in option C, the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no, because after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene (using a poisoned catalyst to stop at the alkene).

3. Ozonolysis to break the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to make the final product.

So, looking for an option that has alkylation, hydrogenation to alkene, ozonolysis, and workup.

Option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3. If the catalyst is poisoned, it would stop at the alkene. But in option C, the catalyst isn't specified as poisoned. So perhaps that's not the case.

Looking at the options, the only option with O3 and then NH4OH (a workup) is option D and option B.

Option B:

Steps:

1. Alkylation to form longer alkyne.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the alkene.

4. NH4OH → workup to form carbonyl groups.

So, let's see:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe elimination to form a triple bond again, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is used to deprotonate and form a stronger base for elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, if the alkyne is C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3, and Li in NH3 is used, perhaps it induces elimination, forming a double bond. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond, giving C6H11-C=C-CH2CH3. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the molecule would break into two parts: C6H11-C=O and O=C-CH2CH3. But that doesn't seem to fit the target structure.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is with methyl chloride, then hydrogenation to form a single bond, but that doesn't fit either.

At this point, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the correct answer as option C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via some kind of addition.

Wait, if the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, perhaps via something like LiAlH4. But I don't see such steps in the options.

Alternatively, the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to nucleophilic addition to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But again, the steps don't clearly show this.

Hmm. Given the time I've spent, I think option C is the correct one. Wait, but why? Because after ozonolysis, perhaps it forms a carbonyl group which can be used to form the formyl group.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll have to go with option C.

The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) attached to another cyclohexane. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride form the acetylide and alkylate it, resulting in C6H11-C≡C-CH3.  
   - Step 2: H2/Pd hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, yielding C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.  
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but it is unclear how it would lead to the desired functional groups.  
   - Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, and H2O are hydration conditions, but the sequence does not align with forming the target molecule.  
   - **Issue**: Ozonolysis is missing, and the steps do not introduce the hydroxymethyl group or the formyl group effectively.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride alkylate the acetylide, forming C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 is a strong base, possibly inducing elimination or forming a triple bond again, but this does not lead to the desired functional groups.  
   - Step 3: O3/H2O performs ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond after step 2.  
   - Step 4: NH4OH is a workup step, but the sequence does not produce the target structure.  
   - **Issue**: The steps do not clearly form the hydroxymethyl or formyl groups.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride form the acetylide and alkylate it, resulting in C6H11-C≡C-CH3.  
   - Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, yielding C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.  
   - Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S performs ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond, making this step ineffective.  
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.  
   - **Issue**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent in this sequence.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol form the acetylide and methylate it, resulting in C6H11-C≡C-CH2OH.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 is a strong base, possibly eliminating the hydroxyl group or forming a triple bond again.  
   - Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S performs ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond.  
   - Step 4: NH4OH is a workup step, but the sequence does not produce the target structure.  
   - **Issue**: The steps do not clearly form the hydroxymethyl or formyl groups.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly produce the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite the unresolved issues with the ozonolysis step.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break down the target molecule first. So, the structure has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH. Also, there's another cyclohexyl group attached to that same carbon (so it's like a cyclohexyl-(CH2OH)-cyclohexane), and then a carbaldehyde group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane with a substituent that's CH2OH connected to another cyclohexane, and a formyl (CHO) group somewhere else on the main ring.

Wait, actually, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the cyclohexane has a -CHO group. Then, at position 1 (which would be adjacent to the CHO), there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. That substituent is a CH2OH group attached to the cyclohexane ring, and that's connected to the main ring at position 1.

So, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and another substituent which is a CH2OH attached to another cyclohexane. So, the main chain is something like cyclohexane with a -CHO and a -(cyclohexyl-CH2OH) group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is an alkyne group, so the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So, the molecule is cyclohexane with a triple bond leading to a hydrogen.

I need to figure out the sequence of reagents to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about the transformations needed.

First, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexyl-ethynyl compound. I'm trying to get a more substituted structure with a hydroxyl group and a formyl group.

Let me outline the steps needed. Maybe I should start by considering the possible functional group transformations.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be functionalized. One common approach with terminal alkynes is to perform a hydration. But for that, I need the right conditions. Alternatively, maybe I can do some kind of alkyne addition or substitution.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first reagent in all options is NaNH2, which is a strong base. And the second reagent varies. Hmm. Oh, wait, maybe the first step is deprotonation to form a cyclohexynide.

NaNH2 is used to deprotonate alkynes, forming acetylides. So, if I have ethynylcyclohexane, treating it with NaNH2 would deprotonate the triple bond, giving a cyclohexylacetylide. Then, alkyl halides can be used in an alkylation.

Looking at the options, the second reagent in options A and C is methyl chloride, which is CH3Cl. So, perhaps the first step is forming the acetylide, then methylating it.

Wait, but wait, ethynylcyclohexane is HC≡C-Cyclohexane. Deprotonating would give Cyclohexyl-C≡^-Na^+. Then, when you add a methylating agent like CH3Cl, the acetylide would attack, giving Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, that's 1-propynylcyclohexane? Or wait, maybe it becomes substituted at the sp-hybridized carbon.

Wait, no. The ethynyl group is CH2C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no. Wait, ethynyl is a substituent where the cyclohexane is attached to the triple bond. So, it's cyclohexane-C≡CH. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH group attached.

When you deprotonate that, you get cyclohexylacetylide: cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) can alkylate the acetylide. So, the acetylide's carbon attacks CH3Cl, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, the product would be 1-propynylcyclohexane or 1-cyclohexylpropyne? Hmm, not entirely sure about the naming, but the structure is now a longer alkyne.

Wait, but if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (which is CH2CH2-C≡CH, no, wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH). So, after deprotonation and alkylation with CH3Cl, the product is C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

So, now the molecule is 1-propynylcyclohexane or 3-cyclohexyl-1-propyne?

Not sure about the exact name, but the structure is a cyclohexane with a propynyl group (a three-carbon alkyne).

But what's the next step? Looking at the target molecule, perhaps we need to add a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne can be hydrogenated. Hydrogenation of a triple bond can yield either an alkene or an alkane, depending on the conditions.

In the options, some steps involve H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. Option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is probably a hydrogenation catalyst. So maybe after the alkyne is alkylated, we hydrogenate it to make a single bond.

Wait, let's think about the possible steps.

Option C: after NaNH2 and methyl chloride (steps 1 and 2), then H2/Pd-CaCO3. Then O3/(CH3)2S, then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but that might be a bit confusing. Let me think about each option's steps.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group can be used to form a ketone or another functional group.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, and a formyl group on another cyclohexane. So perhaps the ethynyl group can be transformed into a carbonyl, then further functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into an enol, then into a ketone via oxidation. Not sure.

Wait, let me think of the target structure again. The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a diol after hydration. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of alkyne reduction to a cis-alkene, then dihydroxylation to form a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some oxidation.

Wait, but I'm probably overcomplicating. Let's think about each step in the options.

Looking at the options, they all have four steps except option A, which has three. Hmm, but perhaps I should check each one.

Option A: Steps 1-3 are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2, followed by H2SO4 and HgSO4, H2O. Wait, but step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Wait, but that's the same as the same step in a different option? Or perhaps I misread.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liquid NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-CaCO3; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liquid NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, let's go through each option.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

Option C's first step is NaNH2, then methyl chloride. So, as I thought before, deprotonate to form cyclohexylacetylide, then alkylate with methyl chloride to make cyclohexyl-propynyl (C6H11-C≡C-CH3).

Then, step 2 is hydrogenation. H2 with Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond. The triple bond would become a single bond, but wait, under H2 and Pd, an alkyne would become an alkane? Or would it become an alkene if using Lindlar's catalyst? Wait, Pd is usually for alkene hydrogenation, but in the presence of a poison like quinoline, it's for cis addition. Without poison, Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Wait, no. Let me correct: the hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd typically gives an alkane, but if using a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's, it gives cis-alkene. Without the poison, it's more likely to go all the way to the alkane. Wait, but depending on conditions, sometimes it might stop at the alkene. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps using a different catalyst, like Na/NH3, would give a trans-alkene.

Wait, but in option C, the second step is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, Pd with CaCO3 is probably a standard catalyst for hydrogenation. So, the alkyne would be hydrogenated to a single bond. So, after alkylation, the molecule is C6H11-C≡C-CH3, and after hydrogenation, it would become C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, cyclohexylpropane? Wait, that would be a three-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but that's just a straight chain. Now, what's next in option C: step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into carbonyl groups. But if the molecule after hydrogenation is a straight chain, perhaps only a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do much. Wait, unless the molecule has a double bond.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm missing something. After the alkyne is hydrogenated, it becomes a single bond, so no double bond. Ozonolysis would require a double bond. So, perhaps the product after hydrogenation does have a double bond. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation step is not complete.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation stops at the alkene. So, if the alkyne C6H11-C≡C-CH3 is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, maybe it goes to the cis-alkene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated in a different way.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted to an enol ether or something else. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated to a longer chain and then functionalized in another way.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group and a -CH2OH group attached to another cyclohexane.

Wait, but how do we get the -CHO group? Maybe oxidation of a secondary alcohol? But where would that come from.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group. Let's think. For example, oxidative cleavage of an alkyne can give a diketone, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: the ethynyl group can be subjected to hydration to form a ketone. Terminal alkynes can be hydrolyzed to ketones under certain conditions. Wait, no, wait: the hydration of a terminal alkyne (HC≡CR) typically gives a ketone (R-C-OH), but that's under acidic or catalytic conditions.

Wait, but in the presence of HgSO4 and H2SO4, maybe. So, for example, the hydration of propyne (HC≡CCH3) with H2SO4 and HgSO4 would give acetone (propan-2-one). So, perhaps ethynylcyclohexane, when treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4, would form cyclohexanone? Wait, no, because ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. Hydration would produce C6H11-C(OH)CH3. Wait, that's not exactly right. Because the triple bond is between cyclohexane and H, so hydration would add an -OH to the triple bond, giving cyclohexylacetaldehyde. Wait, no, maybe.

Wait, let's get this straight. The structure is C6H11-C≡CH. So, the triple bond is between C6H11 and H. So, hydration would add an -OH across the triple bond. So, the product would be C6H11-C(OH)H. But wait, that's an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, and when you hydrate it, you get R-CHO.

Ah, right! So, ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH) when treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration) would produce cyclohexylacetaldehyde (C6H11-CHO). That's a formyl group attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the formyl group is on the cyclohexane, which matches this. So, perhaps the first step is to hydrate the alkyne into a formyl group.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first steps are NaNH2, then something else. So, perhaps the initial steps involve making a longer chain, then some functional group transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation to form an acetylide, then alkylation, then hydrogenation to form a longer chain, then ozonolysis to break it into smaller fragments with carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think. Option C's steps: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → make the acetylide and methylate to get C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But that would break a double bond, but if the molecule is now a single bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So, this doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't go all the way. Wait, maybe the Pd catalyst stops at the alkene. So, the triple bond becomes a cis-alkene. So, after step 2, the molecule would be C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond? No, wait. If H2 and Pd are used, the alkyne would first hydrogenate to an alkene, then to an alkane. But if the reaction is stopped at the alkene, perhaps via a poisoned catalyst, but in option C, the catalyst is Pd with CaCO3, which I think is more for alkene hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step's possible reaction.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → form acetylide and methylate → C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate alkyne to alkane: C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Wait, but this molecule is fully saturated. Ozonolysis needs a double bond. So, this doesn't make sense. So option C can't be correct because ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

So, perhaps I can eliminate option C.

Looking at option D: steps are 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liquid NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol: that would deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then methylate with methanol? Wait, wait, methanol is the methylating agent? But in the presence of a base like NaNH2, would that work? Or, wait, maybe the acetylide would attack methanol as an electrophile. So, CH3O- would be the source of the methyl group. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the methyl chloride is the methylating agent, but in option D, it's methanol.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is making the acetylide, and step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, used for deprotonation, perhaps for elimination reactions. But I'm not sure how that would help here.

Option B: steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride → acetylide and ethylation. Then Li/NH3, then O3/H2O, then NH4OH.

Hmm. So, ethylation would give a longer chain. Then, Li in NH3 is a strong base, maybe for elimination to form a double bond, or for alkyne deprotonation? Not sure.

Wait, maybe after ethylation, we have C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then using Li in NH3 (a strong base) could induce elimination, forming a triple bond again. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or another structure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this problem by considering the target's structure and the necessary functional group transformations.

The target has a formyl group (-CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) attached to a cyclohexane ring. Additionally, the hydroxymethyl is connected to another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps we need to form a diol from the alkyne, then perform some oxidation and alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group via hydration, then further functionalized.

Wait, but in the options, the initial steps involve NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which suggests alkyne alkylation. So, maybe the ethynyl group is extended to a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated or oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the process involves forming a ketone or another functional group, then performing oxidation or alkylation.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl, which is attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is transformed into a bromide, which is then used in a nucleophilic substitution.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about each option's steps.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, the alkyne is deprotonated to an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But wait, if the acetylide is treated with methanol (CH3OH), would that lead to alkylation? Because the acetylide would attack the methyl group in CH3OH. So, the product would be C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH? Hmm, but I'm not sure about that because typically, alkylation uses alkyl halides, not alcohols, unless under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in option D is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base and can induce elimination. So, if the first step methylated the acetylide, perhaps the second step would deprotonate and cause the elimination of the OH, forming a triple bond again. Not sure.

Option B has steps 1 and 2 as NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liquid NH3. So, ethyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, giving a longer alkyne. Then Li/NH3 is a strong base, which could induce elimination, maybe forming a triple bond again, or perhaps a ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 is used for a conjugate addition or for forming a Grignard-like reagent.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the target's structure and see what steps are needed.

The target has a formyl group (-CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is also attached to another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group, then further functionalized.

Wait, if we take ethynylcyclohexane and hydrate it to form cyclohexylacetaldehyde (C6H11-CHO), that could be a starting point. But in the options, the first step is NaNH2, which suggests deprotonation and alkylation, not hydration.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have HgSO4 and H2SO4 as the first step. So perhaps the initial steps are building a longer chain, which is then cleaved to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene via hydrogenation, then dihydroxylation to form a diol, which can then be functionalized.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing a clear path.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first alkylated to form a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated to form a longer chain, and then ozonolysis is used to break the chain into a carbonyl group.

Wait, so let's say after alkylation, the molecule is C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenated to C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. Ozonolysis would require a double bond, but this molecule is a single bond. So that's not possible.

Wait, unless the hydrogenation step doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond, but leaves a double bond. But that's only possible with a poisoned catalyst. But option C's step 2 is H2/Pd, which is probably not poisoned.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via hydration. Wait, but I think that's done with different conditions, like H2O and HgSO4/H2SO4, but that's not the first step in any of the options.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence starts with deprotonation and alkylation, then hydrogenation, then ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and then further oxidation or something.

Wait, let's take option D. Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then react with methanol. So, the product would be C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe this would eliminate the hydroxyl group, forming a triple bond again, giving back the alkynyl group. But that seems counterproductive.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Grignard-like reaction. But I'm not sure.

Option B: after alkylation with ethyl chloride, giving C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2 is Li in NH3. Perhaps this induces elimination, forming a triple bond again, or maybe a ring formation.

Wait, another thought: maybe the sequence forms a cyclohexane ring with a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated, and then functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to alkylate the alkyne, hydrogenate it to a single bond, then perform ozonolysis to break a double bond into carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me reevaluate.

Option C steps: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → get C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond → C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But the molecule is now a single bond, so ozonolysis won't do anything. So, this can't be correct.

Hmm. So, perhaps option D?

Option D: steps 1 and 2: acetylide formation followed by reaction with methanol. Then, Li in NH3. Then, ozonolysis and workup.

Wait, if step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, the acetylide would react with CH3OH, giving C6H11-C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH? Not sure about that. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe this would eliminate the hydroxyl group, forming a triple bond again, giving back C6H11-C≡CH. Then, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S, which would cleave any double bonds, but if the molecule is again an alkyne, that won't help. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 is used for a Birch reduction or some kind of elimination.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use a different method. Let's think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Perhaps the formyl group is obtained by oxidizing a secondary alcohol. So, we need a secondary alcohol somewhere in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then further functionalized.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a diol via dihydroxylation, then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But that seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to some kind of addition to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, maybe the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide.

2. Alkylate it with methyl chloride to get a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

4. Ozonolyze the alkane to form carbonyl groups.

But that doesn't make sense as ozonolysis requires a double bond.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis is used to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think again. If the alkyne is alkylated to C6H11-C≡C-CH3, then hydrogenated with H2 and a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar's) to form a cis-alkene: C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? No, because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So, hydrogenation would convert C6H11-C≡C-CH3 into C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 (no double bond). So, no double bond, so ozonolysis won't work.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, then cleaved. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol via hydration, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but I don't see any steps involving that in the options.

Wait, looking at option D again. Step 4 is NH4OH, which is used in the workup after ozonolysis. So, perhaps the ozonolysis is followed by reductive workup to form aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is extended via alkylation.

2. The extended alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane.

3. Ozonolysis is done, but that doesn't work without a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the target structure again.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So, the structure is like cyclohexane with a substituent that is -(cyclohexyl-CH2OH) and a CHO.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a formyl group, then some alkylation occurs to add the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, if step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, making the acetylide and methylating it. Then, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation to make a single bond, then step 3 is oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH. That suggests that a cyclohexane ring is attached via a CH2OH group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is transformed into a CH2OH group.

Wait, perhaps through a series of steps. For example, alkyne to carbonyl, then to alcohol, then to something else.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group via hydration. So, step 1 would be HgSO4 and H2SO4 to form a ketone or aldehyde. Then, further steps would add the cyclohexyl group.

But looking at the options, the first reagent is NaNH2, not the hydration conditions. So perhaps the initial steps are not about hydration.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of each option's sequence.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylate the acetylide to form a longer alkyne.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → perhaps deprotonate and eliminate, forming a triple bond again, but with a longer chain.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of a diene? But I'm not sure.

4. NH4OH → workup to form carbonyl groups.

Hmm, not making sense.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → acetylide and methylate to form C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH.

Step 2: Li/liquid NH3 → strong base, maybe eliminate the hydroxyl, forming a triple bond again or perhaps an alkyne.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → no double bond, so nothing.

Hmm. Not helpful.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → form C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a diene? Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions. So, maybe the molecule C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 would lose two protons to form a double bond, becoming C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH2 → no, probably not.

Wait, wait. If the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3, and Ba(OH)2 is used, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton, leading to elimination. But where would the elimination be? Maybe there's a possibility of forming a cyclohexene if the chain is long enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step in option A doesn't go to completion, leaving a double bond. Then, Ba(OH)2 would cause elimination, but I'm not sure.

Then, step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which are conditions for hydrating an alkyne to a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but if the molecule is a diene, perhaps it's hydrolyzed, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, Ba(OH)2 would cause some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes, but that's under different conditions.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about the correct way to introduce the formyl and hydroxymethyl groups.

The target has a formyl group (-CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) attached to a cyclohexane, and the hydroxymethyl is attached to another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a formyl group via hydration. That would give cyclohexylacetaldehyde. Then, perhaps some kind of alkylation to introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but how? Maybe using a Grignard reagent or some alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first extended via alkylation, then after some functionalization, the formyl and hydroxymethyl groups are introduced.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not sure. Let me re-examine.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond: C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But since it's a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. So, this can't be right.

So, option C is out.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → acetylide + CH3OH → product could be C6H11-C≡C-CH2-OH.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → strong base, perhaps eliminate the OH group, forming a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → needs a double bond, but if step 2 left us with an alkyne, no.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Make the acetylide and alkylation to extend the chain.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups.

But in the options, none of the steps directly address this except maybe option C, but with the problem that ozonolysis requires a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene (using a poisoned catalyst), then ozonolysis is done to break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, let's say after step 2 in option C, the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no, because after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene (using a poisoned catalyst to stop at the alkene).

3. Ozonolysis to break the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to make the final product.

So, looking for an option that has alkylation, hydrogenation to alkene, ozonolysis, and workup.

Option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3. If the catalyst is poisoned, it would stop at the alkene. But in option C, the catalyst isn't specified as poisoned. So perhaps that's not the case.

Looking at the options, the only option with O3 and then NH4OH (a workup) is option D and option B.

Option B:

Steps:

1. Alkylation to form longer alkyne.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the alkene.

4. NH4OH → workup to form carbonyl groups.

So, let's see:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe elimination to form a triple bond again, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is used to deprotonate and form a stronger base for elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, if the alkyne is C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3, and Li in NH3 is used, perhaps it induces elimination, forming a double bond. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond, giving C6H11-C=C-CH2CH3. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the molecule would break into two parts: C6H11-C=O and O=C-CH2CH3. But that doesn't seem to fit the target structure.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is with methyl chloride, then hydrogenation to form a single bond, but that doesn't fit either.

At this point, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the correct answer as option C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via some kind of addition.

Wait, if the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, perhaps via something like LiAlH4. But I don't see such steps in the options.

Alternatively, the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to nucleophilic addition to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But again, the steps don't clearly show this.

Hmm. Given the time I've spent, I think option C is the correct one. Wait, but why? Because after ozonolysis, perhaps it forms a carbonyl group which can be used to form the formyl group.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll have to go with option C.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) attached to another cyclohexane. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride form the acetylide and alkylate it, resulting in C6H11-C≡C-CH3.  
   - Step 2: H2/Pd hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, yielding C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.  
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but it is unclear how it would lead to the desired functional groups.  
   - Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, and H2O are hydration conditions, but the sequence does not align with forming the target molecule.  
   - **Issue**: Ozonolysis is missing, and the steps do not introduce the hydroxymethyl group or the formyl group effectively.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride alkylate the acetylide, forming C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 is a strong base, possibly inducing elimination or forming a triple bond again, but this does not lead to the desired functional groups.  
   - Step 3: O3/H2O performs ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond after step 2.  
   - Step 4: NH4OH is a workup step, but the sequence does not produce the target structure.  
   - **Issue**: The steps do not clearly form the hydroxymethyl or formyl groups.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride form the acetylide and alkylate it, resulting in C6H11-C≡C-CH3.  
   - Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, yielding C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.  
   - Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S performs ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond, making this step ineffective.  
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.  
   - **Issue**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent in this sequence.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol form the acetylide and methylate it, resulting in C6H11-C≡C-CH2OH.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 is a strong base, possibly eliminating the hydroxyl group or forming a triple bond again.  
   - Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S performs ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond.  
   - Step 4: NH4OH is a workup step, but the sequence does not produce the target structure.  
   - **Issue**: The steps do not clearly form the hydroxymethyl or formyl groups.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly produce the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite the unresolved issues with the ozonolysis step.

**Answer: C**
