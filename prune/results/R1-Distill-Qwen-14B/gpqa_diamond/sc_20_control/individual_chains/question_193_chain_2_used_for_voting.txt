Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars varies with distance, given that it varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. But wait, I think it's more precise to say that plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance in parsecs.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, 1/plx becomes r. So 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5. Wait, no. Let me think again. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 = (r)^5. So N ∝ r^5? Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So plx is 1/r. So plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, I'm getting confused because I have to think about how N changes with distance when we consider a range of distances.

Wait, no, wait. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Because N ∝ 1/plx^5 is same as N ∝ (plx)^-5. Since plx is 1/r, then (plx)^-5 = (1/r)^-5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance). Oh, wait, I think the question is asking about the change in the number of stars with distance. So the number of stars in a region depends on the volume, but in this case, it's given as 1/plx^5. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about differential number. Like, how many stars are there per unit distance. So if we have N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a shell at radius r with thickness dr is what's being considered.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πr²) multiplied by the volume element (like dr) and the density. But in this case, the density is given in terms of parallax. Wait, maybe the given relation is the number per unit volume? Or per unit area?

Wait, perhaps the question is simplifying things. Let's see. The number of stars N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So for a given region, as r increases, the number of stars (per what?) increases as r^5.

But wait, the options don't have r^5 as a correct answer for the change with distance. Wait, the options are for how the number changes with distance, per unit range.

Wait, the problem says, how does the number of stars in that region change with distance (per unit range of distance, r). Hmm, maybe it's about the differential number of stars per unit distance. So, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr is proportional to r^5 * dr. So the change in number with distance (dN/dr) would be proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with distance as r^5. So the answer would be option B, which is ~ r^5.

Wait, but wait another possibility: If the number of stars is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases as distance increases, and the rate is r^5. So the change in the number of stars with respect to r is proportional to r^5. So the answer is B) ~ r^5.

I think that's the correct approach. So the number of stars in the region increases with the fifth power of the distance. So the correct option is B.

The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relation, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

This shows that the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( r^5 \). The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the number of stars increases with distance at a rate proportional to \( r^5 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
