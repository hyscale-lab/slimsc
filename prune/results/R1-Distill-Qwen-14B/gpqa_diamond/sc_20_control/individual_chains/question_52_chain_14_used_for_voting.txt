Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question concerns the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume the photosphere is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the overall temperature is lower (5500 K), and the ratio (n1/n2, say) decreases. So without spots, the temperature is higher (6000 K), and the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Let me think. The ratio depends exponentially on temperature. If the temperature is higher, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio increases. So when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is lower. So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so when the Teff is 5500 K, the ratio is lower than when it's 6000 K. So without spots, the ratio is higher, so the factor is the ratio of the two ratios: (n1/n2 at 6000K) divided by (n1/n2 at 5500K). So that factor would be greater than 1.

But wait, what's the exact dependence? Let me write down the formula. The ratio is proportional to exp( (E)/(k T) ), assuming E is the energy difference from level 2 to level 1. Wait, no, let me get the levels right. Let's say level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So E2 > E1. So the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. Then the ratio n1 /n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, that's right. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. So when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so the ratio n1/n2 is lower.

So the factor we're looking for is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Which would be [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ].

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so it's exp[ (ΔE/k)( 1/5500 - 1/6000 ) ) ]

Wait, because when you divide the two exponentials, you subtract their exponents. So:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] ) / exp( [ -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ] ) = exp( [ ΔE/(k) ) ( 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ) ] )

Wait, because:

exp(-a) / exp(-b) = exp( (b - a) )

So here, a is ΔE/(k*6000), and b is ΔE/(k*5500). So it's exp( [ (ΔE/(k*5500)) - (ΔE/(k*6000)) ] )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

So the exponent is (ΔE / k) ( (6000 - 5500) ) / (5500 * 6000) ) )

Because 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (5500 * 6000) )

Wait, 6000-5500 is 500.

So that's 500 divided by (5500 * 6000) ), which is 500/(33,000,000) ) = 5/(330,000) ) = 1/(66,000).

Wait, 5500 * 6000 is 33,000,000.

Hmm. Alternatively, 500/(5500*6000) ) = 1/( (5500*6000)/500 ) ) = 1/( (5500/500)*6000 ) )

Wait, 500/5500 is 1/11, so 5500/500 is 11. So 11 * 6000 = 66,000. So 1/66,000.

So the exponent is (ΔE / k) * (1/(66,000)) )

But wait, ΔE is related to the wavelength of the transition. The energy difference can be found using E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Given that the wavelength is 1448 Ångströms. Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = hc/(λ). Let's compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1.448e-7 m

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = ?

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.9878e-25 divided by 1.448e-7: so 1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.372. Then 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18. So yeah, 1.372e-18 J.

Now, we can compute ΔE/(k) where k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) ≈ 1.372 / 1.38 * 1e5 ≈ (0.994) * 1e5 ≈ 99,400 K.

Wait, 1e5 is 100,000, so 99,400. So about 99,400 K approximately.

So going back to the exponent: (ΔE/(k)) * (1/66,000) ) = (99,400) / 66,000 ≈ 1.506.

So the exponent is about 1.506.

So the ratio factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

What's e^1.5? e is about 2.718, so e^1 is 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648. So e^1.5 is about 4.48. But wait, the exponent is 1.506, which is a bit more than 1.5, so maybe around 4.5.

Wait, let me compute e^1.506.

Using a calculator approximation.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, ln(5)=1.609.

So 1.506 is just a bit above ln(4.5), which is 1.504. So e^1.506 is approximately 4.5, maybe 4.51.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. The formula for the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), correct.

2. When the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K) and the ratio decreases, which makes sense because the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. Without spots (6000 K), the exponent is less negative, so the ratio is higher.

3. The factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) )

4. Calculated that exponent as approximately 1.506, leading to e^1.506 ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5.

Looking at the options: option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.

The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The energy difference between the levels corresponds to a transition wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), and the photosphere is assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy difference \( \Delta E \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength \( \lambda \) by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the exponent
The exponent in the factor is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx \frac{1}{66,000}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{66,000} = \frac{99,400}{66,000} \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506).
\]

Using \( e^{1.5} \approx 4.48 \) and noting that \( 1.506 \) is slightly larger than \( 1.5 \), we approximate:

\[
\text{Factor} \approx 4.5.
\]

### Final Answer
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately **4.5**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question concerns the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume the photosphere is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the overall temperature is lower (5500 K), and the ratio (n1/n2, say) decreases. So without spots, the temperature is higher (6000 K), and the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Let me think. The ratio depends exponentially on temperature. If the temperature is higher, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio increases. So when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is lower. So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so when the Teff is 5500 K, the ratio is lower than when it's 6000 K. So without spots, the ratio is higher, so the factor is the ratio of the two ratios: (n1/n2 at 6000K) divided by (n1/n2 at 5500K). So that factor would be greater than 1.

But wait, what's the exact dependence? Let me write down the formula. The ratio is proportional to exp( (E)/(k T) ), assuming E is the energy difference from level 2 to level 1. Wait, no, let me get the levels right. Let's say level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So E2 > E1. So the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. Then the ratio n1 /n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, that's right. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. So when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so the ratio n1/n2 is lower.

So the factor we're looking for is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Which would be [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ].

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so it's exp[ (ΔE/k)( 1/5500 - 1/6000 ) ) ]

Wait, because when you divide the two exponentials, you subtract their exponents. So:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] ) / exp( [ -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ] ) = exp( [ ΔE/(k) ) ( 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ) ] )

Wait, because:

exp(-a) / exp(-b) = exp( (b - a) )

So here, a is ΔE/(k*6000), and b is ΔE/(k*5500). So it's exp( [ (ΔE/(k*5500)) - (ΔE/(k*6000)) ] )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

So the exponent is (ΔE / k) ( (6000 - 5500) ) / (5500 * 6000) ) )

Because 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (5500 * 6000) )

Wait, 6000-5500 is 500.

So that's 500 divided by (5500 * 6000) ), which is 500/(33,000,000) ) = 5/(330,000) ) = 1/(66,000).

Wait, 5500 * 6000 is 33,000,000.

Hmm. Alternatively, 500/(5500*6000) ) = 1/( (5500*6000)/500 ) ) = 1/( (5500/500)*6000 ) )

Wait, 500/5500 is 1/11, so 5500/500 is 11. So 11 * 6000 = 66,000. So 1/66,000.

So the exponent is (ΔE / k) * (1/(66,000)) )

But wait, ΔE is related to the wavelength of the transition. The energy difference can be found using E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Given that the wavelength is 1448 Ångströms. Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = hc/(λ). Let's compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1.448e-7 m

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = ?

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.9878e-25 divided by 1.448e-7: so 1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.372. Then 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18. So yeah, 1.372e-18 J.

Now, we can compute ΔE/(k) where k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) ≈ 1.372 / 1.38 * 1e5 ≈ (0.994) * 1e5 ≈ 99,400 K.

Wait, 1e5 is 100,000, so 99,400. So about 99,400 K approximately.

So going back to the exponent: (ΔE/(k)) * (1/66,000) ) = (99,400) / 66,000 ≈ 1.506.

So the exponent is about 1.506.

So the ratio factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

What's e^1.5? e is about 2.718, so e^1 is 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648. So e^1.5 is about 4.48. But wait, the exponent is 1.506, which is a bit more than 1.5, so maybe around 4.5.

Wait, let me compute e^1.506.

Using a calculator approximation.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, ln(5)=1.609.

So 1.506 is just a bit above ln(4.5), which is 1.504. So e^1.506 is approximately 4.5, maybe 4.51.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. The formula for the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), correct.

2. When the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K) and the ratio decreases, which makes sense because the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. Without spots (6000 K), the exponent is less negative, so the ratio is higher.

3. The factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) )

4. Calculated that exponent as approximately 1.506, leading to e^1.506 ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5.

Looking at the options: option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The energy difference between the levels corresponds to a transition wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), and the photosphere is assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy difference \( \Delta E \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength \( \lambda \) by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the exponent
The exponent in the factor is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx \frac{1}{66,000}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{66,000} = \frac{99,400}{66,000} \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506).
\]

Using \( e^{1.5} \approx 4.48 \) and noting that \( 1.506 \) is slightly larger than \( 1.5 \), we approximate:

\[
\text{Factor} \approx 4.5.
\]

### Final Answer
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately **4.5**.

Answer: C
