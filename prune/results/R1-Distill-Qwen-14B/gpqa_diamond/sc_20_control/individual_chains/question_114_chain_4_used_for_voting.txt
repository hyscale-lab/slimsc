Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The first part is about a reaction involving butan-2-one, which is also known as methylacetone. The reagents used are NaCN and something called A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN—oh wait, I remember when ketones react with cyanide. I think it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, right, a cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with hydrogen cyanide, but sometimes in the presence of an acid catalyst.

So the reaction is probably the addition of HCN to the ketone. And for that, usually, a protic acid like H3O+ is used as a catalyst. So reagent A in the first reaction must be H3O+. That's either option A or B. Let me check the options. Option A for A is H3O+, yes. Option B also has H3O+ for A.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (which is H2O) to give a certain acid. Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Oh, that's the hydrolysis of nitriles. But how?

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. The typical conditions for converting nitriles to carboxylic acids involve strong acid. Wait, but sometimes it's done in two steps: first to the amide under basic conditions, then acid hydrolysis. Or maybe it's a hydrolysis using H2O with an acid catalyst.

Wait, so what's the reagent B? The reaction is: nitrile group becomes a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile. What are the conditions for that?

In acidic conditions, H2O and H+ (like HCl) would protonate the nitrile. Or maybe it requires a strong acid. Alternatively, another possibility is using a peracid for oxidation, but that doesn't fit here. Wait, no, oxidation of nitriles usually leads to amides or acids, depending on the conditions.

Wait, the reagent in the second reaction is B, and it's given as H2O. Oh wait, no, looking back: the second reaction's reagent is B, which is H2O. Wait, no, the question says, the second reaction is with B (H2O). Oh wait, perhaps the reagent is aqueous conditions with an acid. Or maybe it's an acid in water.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must have involved adding two oxygen atoms in a way that the nitrile becomes -COOH. How does that happen?

I think the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under strong acidic conditions. Alternatively, using HCl as a catalyst in the presence of water. So reagent B would be HCl. Because in the first reaction, the catalyst was H3O+ (which is part of HCl or maybe H2SO4), but in the second reaction, the catalyst would be HCl.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl. Option C has B as HCl as well. Wait, options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl
Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So the first reaction's reagent A is H3O+, which is in options A and B. The second reaction's B would be HCl if it's an acid catalyzed hydrolysis. So looking at the options, option A and C have B as HCl. But option A's A is H3O+, which fits the first reaction.

So for the first reaction, the cyanohydrin formation requires H3O+ as a catalyst. So A is H3O+. Then for the second reaction, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, which requires acid, so B is HCl.

So that would point to option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Another possibility for the second reaction: could it be using H3O+ again? Or maybe H2SO4? But in the options, B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, the second reaction's reagent is B, which is H2O. No, wait the question says the reagent is B (H2O). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the second reaction again.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the reagent is B, which is H2O. Hmm, no, I think the way the question is written, the reagent is B, which is one of the options for B. The part in parentheses says (H2O) but maybe that's part of the reaction condition. So the reagent is B, and the reaction is in H2O. So the actual reagent is B, which could be acid or something else.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid can be done with H2O under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, you would use HCl as the catalyst. Under basic conditions, you might use a base like KOH or NaOH. But then, the product would be a sodium salt of the acid, which would need to be acidified to get the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the product here is the carboxylic acid, so the reaction must be under acidic conditions. So the reagent B would be HCl (as an acid catalyst) in water. So the second reaction uses H2O and HCl as the reagent. So reagent B is HCl.

So putting it together, the first step uses A = H3O+ (so option A or B), and the second uses B = HCl (so options A or C).

Looking at the options, only option A has A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

Wait, but what about option C? It has A = NaHSO3. Can that be?

Wait, in the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. The product is a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is that the ketone is attacked by the cyanide ion. To generate the cyanide ion, NaCN is used. But to get the protons, an acid is needed.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The reaction between ketones and NaCN is typically done in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+ (which is what H2SO4 can provide). So I think for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+.

So the first part of the question uses H3O+, which is option A or B.

The second part uses HCl as the catalyst (B), so option A.

So the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, facilitating the nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (proton source) is the suitable catalyst for this reaction, ruling out options C and D.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This process requires acidic conditions, with HCl commonly used as the catalyst in water. Thus, HCl is the appropriate reagent for the second reaction, ruling out option B.

Combining these observations, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
