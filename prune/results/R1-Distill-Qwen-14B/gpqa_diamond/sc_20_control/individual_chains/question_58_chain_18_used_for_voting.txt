Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics. 

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or something. So, theories that are finite, meaning they don't have these divergences, wouldn't need regularization. Or maybe some theories have such good behavior that regularization isn't necessary?

Let me go through each option. 

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. From what I've heard, string theories don't have the same kind of divergences as point particle theories because they're based on strings. But wait, do they still require regularization? Maybe not because the underlying structure is different. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has something to do with asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the strong force becomes weak. But wait, QCD calculations can lead to things like Landau poles and other divergences, especially when dealing with things like beta functions. So they probably need regularization. Or wait, when you calculate loop diagrams in QCD, you often get divergences that need to be handled, so you use techniques like dimensional regularization or lattice methods. So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I think QED is a renormalizable theory. But does that mean it doesn't need regularization? No, because even though it's renormalizable, the calculations can have divergences. Like when calculating loop diagrams, you have to regularize them before renormalizing. So QED does require regularization steps. But wait, once you do the renormalization, the infinities cancel out, making the theory finite. But the process of regularization is still part of the calculations. So QED does need regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't have the same issues with divergences as quantum theories. Wait, in Maxwell's equations, you have things like point charges leading to infinite fields at the charge's location. But in classical E&M, you can use concepts like the method of images or other techniques to deal with these. But do they require regularization in the same sense as quantum field theories? I think regularization is more about handling divergences in integrals when quantizing fields. Classical E&M doesn't have these divergences in the same way, because it's not a quantum theory. So maybe classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization because it's not done in the context of quantum field theory.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So which of these theories is free from the need for regularization methods?

So putting it all together:

- QED and QCD require regularization because they are quantum field theories with divergences.
- Superstring theory might not require regularization as much because it's a different approach, but I'm not certain.
- Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory, so it doesn't really use regularization in the quantum sense. But does it have any divergences that need handling? Like in the case of point charges, but those are handled classically, not via regularization techniques.

The question is about which theory 'never' requires regularization. So, the only option that's a classical theory is D. So the answer would be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, but let me make sure. Do any of the quantum theories not require regularization? Like, maybe superstring theory somehow doesn't, but I thought all quantum theories need it. Or maybe string theories do require some form of regularization, but maybe not in the same way as QED and QCD.

Alternatively, perhaps all the options except classical E&M are quantum theories that require regularization. So the correct answer is D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. Unlike point particle theories, string theories avoid some divergences due to their extended nature. However, regularization techniques are still sometimes used in string theory calculations, though they may not be as necessary as in other quantum field theories. This leaves some ambiguity.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, involves divergences in loop calculations, particularly in handling infinities and beta functions. Regularization techniques, such as dimensional regularization or lattice methods, are commonly used in QCD to manage these divergences. Thus, QCD requires regularization.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is a renormalizable theory, meaning infinities in calculations can be canceled out. However, regularization is still a necessary step in the process of renormalization, as loop diagrams produce divergences that must be handled. Therefore, QED requires regularization.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical electrodynamics is a classical theory and does not involve the quantum divergences that require regularization. While it may deal with classical divergences (e.g., infinite fields around point charges), these are handled using classical techniques, not regularization. Since regularization is specific to quantum field theories, classical electrodynamics never requires it.

Given this analysis, the only theory that never requires regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
