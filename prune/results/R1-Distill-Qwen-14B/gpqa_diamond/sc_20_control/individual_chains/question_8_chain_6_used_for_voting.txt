Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is about white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes based on the resistance levels of the mutants.

The data given are the resistance percentages relative to the wild type. Wild type is 100%, so any lower percentage means more susceptibility. Let me list out the data:

- g1: 75% (so 25% susceptibility, which is lower than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (so 50% susceptibility)
- g1g3: 10% (so 90% susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0%

So, our goal is to figure out the interaction among these genes. The options suggest some possibilities about which is a transcription factor, pleiotropy, epistasis, or redundancy.

From what I remember, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutation depends on gene A's presence. Also, epistatic relationships can be determined by how the double mutants behave compared to the single mutants.

Also, a transcription factor usually acts upstream, regulating other genes. So if a transcription factor is knocked out (say, G2), that might affect the expression of other genes downstream, like G1 or G3.

Let me think about each single mutant. The control is 100%, so:

- g1 has 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, meaning the plant is less resistant. So G1 might be a positive factor for resistance. But not as bad as g2 and g3.

- g2 has 0% resistance. So knocking out G2 completely eliminates resistance. That's a big effect. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that's essential for the resistance pathway.

- g3 has 50% resistance. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance by half. So G3 is also involved but perhaps not as crucial as G2.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% resistance. So both G1 and G2 knocked out. The resistance is as bad as g2. Hmm. So in the absence of G2, maybe G1 doesn't matter? Because g2 alone is 0%, so when both are knocked out, it's still 0%. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would mean G1 isn't expressed either. Wait, but in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2?

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then knocking out G2 would cause G1 to not be expressed. So in the double mutant g1g2, since G2 is already knocked out, G1's knockout wouldn't affect anything else. So the resistance would be the same as g2, which is 0%. That's exactly what the data shows. So that could be a clue that G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So the combined effect is more severe than either alone. So their functions might contribute additively or something else.

Now, the double mutant g2g3 has 0% resistance. Same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, adding the knockout of G3 doesn't change the resistance. That suggests that G3's function is only relevant if G2 is present. Because in the absence of G2, G3 doesn't contribute anything. So G3's function is downstream of G2, perhaps. Or maybe G3 is regulated by G2.

So putting this together, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Let's see.

Because in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 would not be expressed. So the resistance would be as bad as if all of them are knocked out. So let's see: if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in g2, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. But in the single mutants, g1 and g3, their resistance is 75% and 50%, respectively.

So G1's knockout (g1) reduces resistance to 75%, and G3's (g3) to 50%. So G1 contributes more to the resistance than G3.

Now, in the double mutant g1g3, they have 10% resistance. That's lower than either single mutant. So perhaps when both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is lower than each alone, meaning that they have additive effects. So maybe they function in parallel pathways.

But wait, considering that G2 is a transcription factor, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance of g2 is 0%, which is more severe than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0%. Which is same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, G1's status doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the phenotype of G1 is only visible when G2 is present. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, looking at g3g2: also 0%, same as g2. So G3 is epistatic to G2? No, wait. Because when G2 is knocked out (g2), any other gene's knockout doesn't change the resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well? Or, more accurately, G2 is upstream of G3, so the effect of G3 depends on G2 being present. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but that depends on the epistatic relationship. Epistasis is when the mutation in one gene masks the effect of another gene. So if G2 is upstream, then the presence of a functional G2 is necessary for G3's effect to be seen. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

But how does that fit with the data? Let's see: when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%. If we also knock out G3 (g2g3), the resistance is still 0%. So in this case, G3's mutation doesn't add anything to the phenotype because G2 is already knocked out. So G3's effect is only seen when G2 is present.

So that suggests that G3 is epistatic to G2? Or G2 is epistatic to G3? Hmm, I think the term is that G2 is epistatic to G3 because G2's mutation masks the effect of G3. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in a typical epistasis scenario, if you have two genes, A and B, and the phenotype of a mutation in B only shows when A is functional. Then, the mutation in A is epistatic to B. So, for example, if you have coat color in dogs: suppose A is for pigment production and B is for color (like B for black, b for brown). If A is knocked out, the coat is white regardless of B. So the presence of A is required for B to have any effect. So in this case, A is epistatic to B.

In our case, when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0% regardless of G3's status. So G2's mutation (g2) masks the effect of G3. So G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but what about the double mutants g1g3 and g2g3?

g1g3 is 10% resistance. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, resistance is 10%. So perhaps each contributes some level of resistance, and both are working in a pathway that is independent of G2.

Wait, but that's not possible because the g2 mutant's resistance is 0%, which is worse than g3 (50%) and g1 (75%). So maybe G1 and G3 function in different pathways, both of which are downstream of G2.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, but their effects are additive.

But going back to the options. Let's read the options again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but the question states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. The option says G1 is a transcription factor. From the data, G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance. So it's more likely that G2 is the transcription factor, not G1.

Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then in the g2 mutant, none of the downstream genes would be expressed. So in the double mutant g1g2, it's 0%, same as g2. So that suggests that G2 is upstream of G1.

So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, as per the question statement.

So looking at the options, which one has G2 as the transcription factor?

Looking at options:

A) G1 is TF → No, because G2's knockout has a more severe effect.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter → Not sure.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Hmm.

So the setup is that at least one is a TF upstream of others. We thought G2 is the TF.

Now, looking at the data, the single mutants:

g1:75%, g2:0%, g3:50%.

So in the absence of G2, resistance is gone. So G2 must be a key gene, perhaps the TF.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G1's effect is masked when G2 is knocked out. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g3g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Now, what about the double mutant g1g3, which has 10% resistance.

So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. Each single mutant is 75% and 50%. So in combination, it's worse. So perhaps each contributes additivity. So G1 and G3 might be functioning in parallel pathways. Each provides some level of resistance, and together they provide more.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their effects are additive.

Wait, but in the absence of G2, knocking out G1 doesn't change the resistance beyond what G2 already does. So G2 is upstream.

So considering this, G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream. Now, the question is about their interaction.

Looking at the options:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But I don't think that's what's happening here. The question is about their interaction in the pathway, not about multiple traits.

Alternatively, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, knocking out both would have a more severe effect than knocking out either alone.

In our case, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that suggests that they are contributing to the same process, perhaps in a redundant manner. Because if they were in parallel pathways, each contributing additively, their combined knockout would be worse than either. But if they are in the same pathway, their combined knockout would have a more severe effect.

So in this case, the resistance is 10% when both are knocked out. So maybe they are redundant. So when both are missing, the pathway is completely compromised.

So looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if they are redundant, then knocking out both would be worse than either, which is what we're seeing. So that fits. But then, what about the epistatic relationships between G1 and G3?

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is lower than either single mutant. So if gene redundancy is in effect, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That's consistent with the data.

But also, what about their epistatic relationships? If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1's mutation masks the effect of G3.

But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is lower than either, suggesting that their effects are additive. So that might not fit with epistasis.

Wait, perhaps gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So in that case, the single mutants would have some deficit, but the double mutant would be worse.

Which is exactly what we're seeing: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So the double mutant is worse than either, meaning they are not fully redundant but perhaps contribute in a partially additive way. But in the case of full redundancy, the single mutants would be as bad as the double mutant. But in this case, the single mutants are less bad than the double, so perhaps they are partially redundant or in parallel pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their functions are additive. So the double mutant has worse resistance.

Now, looking back at the options, which one fits.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but redundancy suggests that they can compensate for each other. So in the double mutant, their combined knockout would be worse than each single. But let me think about epistasis between G1 and G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as g1. But in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that suggests that the effects are additive, not epistatic. So perhaps G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but are additive.

So maybe the correct option is D, where G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But wait, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is that G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning that G1's mutation masks G3's effect. But in reality, in the double mutant, the effect is worse than either single, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Let's think: If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the mutation in G3 would mask the effect of G1. But in the data, g1 has 75%, and g3g1 (g1g3) is 10%, which is worse than g1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about what each option says.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But we think G2 is the TF, not G1. So option A is probably wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. But I'm not sure what that implies. So that might mean that G1 and G3 are under the control of the same promoter, perhaps both downstream of G2. But I'm not sure how that affects the resistance levels.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits. But the question is about their interaction in the same pathway. So perhaps this is not the case.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning their functions can compensate for each other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either. Which fits with the data (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, g1g3 is 10%). But wait, if they are redundant, then the single mutants should be as bad as the double. But here, the double is worse, so perhaps they are not fully redundant. Alternatively, perhaps they are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but the question says at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. So G2 is the TF.

Now, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps their functions are additive. So G2 is the TF, which activates both G1 and G3, which in turn contribute to the resistance.

In that case, the epistatic relationships would be that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' status doesn't matter.

So looking at the options, which one has G2 as TF and the right relationship between G1 and G3.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps they are not redundant but additive.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So knocking out both would lead to more susceptibility.

If that's the case, then G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but additive.

Now, looking at the options, which option supports that.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Hmm, but if they're redundant, the single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double. But here, the double is worse, so that's not matching.

Wait, gene redundancy would mean that each gene can perform the same function. So if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So the single mutant would have a mild phenotype, but the double would have severe.

Which matches the data here: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So each contributes, but both are needed for full function. So perhaps they are redundant but not fully. So their combined knockout is worse.

So in that case, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is the TF upstream.

So looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would have a worse effect than either, which is what's seen. So gene redundancy is a possibility.

But then, what about the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in the double mutant, the effect is worse, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic to G1. Let me think: if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the phenotype of G1's mutation would depend on G3's status. But in this case, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, and when G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50%. So the effect of G3's knockout is worse than G1's.

But in the double mutant, the resistance is 10%, worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the epistatic relationships are between G2 and G1, and G2 and G3, but not between G1 and G3.

So, looking back at the options, option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, suggesting they are additive, not epistatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure why they'd show pleiotropy.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, we're only looking at resistance to anthracnose. So maybe G1 and G3 are involved in other traits as well, but that's not relevant to the question.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible relationships.

- G2 is a transcription factor, as it's the most upstream, and its knockout leads to the most severe phenotype.

- G1 and G3 are downstream of G2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway or different.

- The double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, implying that their effects are additive, not epistatic.

So, looking at the options, which one fits.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would be worse than either. So that fits the data. But if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then when G1 is knocked out, G3's effect is masked. But the data shows that when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either, which contradicts that.

So perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, their effects are additive, and G2 is epistatic to both.

So looking at the options, which one has G2 as TF and G1 and G3 in some kind of additive relationship.

Looking at option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Not sure about pleiotropy, but perhaps that's not the case.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But redundancy would require that they can compensate for each other. So, when one is knocked out, the other can take over.

Wait, but in that case, the single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double. But here, the single mutants have worse resistance than the double? No, the double is worse. So that's conflicting.

Wait, no: in the case of redundancy, the double mutant's phenotype is worse than either single mutant. So that fits with the data. So g1g3 is worse than either.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would have a worse phenotype. So that fits.

So for option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but what about the epistatic part? If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in our data, the double mutant is worse than either. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the epistatic part is not correct.

Wait, maybe the 'epistatic towards' in the option is not about the double mutant, but about the hierarchy in epistatic relationships.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning that G1's function is upstream of G3.

Wait, but if G1 is upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would make G3's knockout not matter. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: let's see which option matches all the data.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy might not be relevant here, but maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their mutations are additive. But the option says they show pleiotropy, which is unrelated to the resistance data.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But in this case, the double mutant's phenotype would be worse than either, which is what we have.

But I'm not sure about the epistatic part. Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic statement is incorrect, but the rest fits.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

I think the main point is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. Their combined knockout is worse than each alone.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. So in the double mutant, the resistance is much lower.

But looking at the options, option D says that G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1's mutation would mask G3's effect. But in our data, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' in the option refers to the fact that G1 is epistatic to G3. So in the absence of G1, G3's function is irrelevant. But the data shows that in the absence of both, the resistance is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the option is correct because when G1 is present, it's epistatic to G3, but when G1 is not present, G3's effect can't be seen.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct reasoning.

From the data:

- g2 is 0% → G2 is required for any resistance.

- g1 is 75% → so it contributes to resistance when G2 is present.

- g3 is 50% → same.

- The double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than g1 or g3. So perhaps G1 and G3 contribute additively.

So, G2 is the TF, and when present, activates G1 and G3, which each contribute to resistance. When both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is lower than either alone.

So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance.

But the question is about their interaction, and the options mention redundancy or pleiotropy.

Redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. So if one is missing, the other can take over. But in that case, the double mutant would be as bad as the single mutants. But in our case, the double is worse, so redundancy is not the case.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and their combined knockout leads to additive effects.

In that case, the situation would be that G1 and G3 are part of two different pathways, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

In this case, which option fits?

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Not sure about pleiotropy.

Option A: G1 is TF. Not likely, since G2's knockout is much worse.

Hmm. Maybe none of the options fit perfectly, but the best fit is option D, where G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not confident about the epistasis part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it correctly identifies G2 as the TF, and G1 and G3 as redundant, and correctly states that G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3 when G1 is present. But the data shows that when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests that G3's effect is still present when G1 is knocked out, and vice versa.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their effects are additive.

So in that case, the correct option would be the one where G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that.

Wait, looking at option D again: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But gene redundancy would mean that when one is missing, the other can compensate. So the double mutant would be as bad as the single mutants. But our data shows the double is worse, so that doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct option is C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure about this either.

Wait, maybe I should think about the epistatic relationships based on the double mutants.

If G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, that would explain why in the double mutants with G2, the resistance is same as G2.

So, the epistatic relationships are that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Now, what about G1 and G3? Since their double mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either, they are in additive or redundant pathways.

But looking at the options, the only option that correctly states G2 as TF and G2 epistatic to G1 and G3 is option A, but option A says G1 is TF, which is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct option is option D, even if the epistatic part is not fully accurate.

Wait, what do the options say?

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But gene redundancy would require that their single mutants are as bad as the double. But in our case, the double is worse. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure what pleiotropy would mean in this context.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, even though the reasoning about epistasis is unclear. Because G2 is the TF, and the data supports that.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and among the three, G1 and G3 are functioning in a way that their combined knockout leads to additive effects, making them redundant or in parallel pathways.

But the options don't have that exactly.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I don't think pleiotropy is the case here. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not fully confident. Another approach: look for the answer that correctly identifies G2 as the TF, which is epistatic to G1 and G3, and that G1 and G3 have an additive effect.

Which option fits that?

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But redundancy doesn't fit because the double is worse.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is additive (75% + 50% = 125% → but since it's below 100%, it's not additive. So perhaps they are in the same pathway, and their combined effect is more than either alone. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway. So, the epistatic relationships are that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1 or g3. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, the double mutant would have the same resistance as g1. But in reality, it's worse, so that's not possible.

So perhaps the epistatic relationship is the other way around, that G3 is epistatic to G1. Then, in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as g3. But in data, it's 10%, which is worse than g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the option where G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways, but the epistatic part is not directly applicable.

But I'm not finding a clear option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concept of epistasis in terms of gene function.

If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then their double mutant would not be worse than each single, but perhaps the same as the worse single. But in this case, the double is worse, so perhaps they are in separate pathways.

So, combining the findings:

G2 is the TF, epistatic to G1 and G3.

G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, contributing additively to resistance.

So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive (75% +50% = 125%, but since it's below 100%, maybe it's multiplicative, 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, which is 37.5% → but data is 10%). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

But the data shows 10%, which is much lower. So perhaps their pathway is not independent.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and the double mutant is worse than either. So perhaps G1 is in one part, G3 in another, and both are needed for the pathway.

But I'm not sure.

Well, given the options, I'm going to have to make an educated guess. My initial thought is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, but that their combined knockout is worse than either, which doesn't fit redundancy. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the epistatic part is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the key is to look for which option correctly states that G2 is the TF, and which correctly describes the relationships.

Looking back at the options, option D says G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 have redundancy. But the data doesn't support redundancy because the double is worse. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. I think I've spent enough time, and I'll proceed to select the best option.

The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. Based on the experimental data, the resistance levels of single and double mutants were analyzed to infer the roles of these genes. The key findings and reasoning are as follows:

1. **G2 as the Transcription Factor**:  
   The single mutant g2 shows 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance. This suggests that G2 acts as a transcription factor upstream of other genes, likely regulating their expression. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This means that G2's function is required for the expression of G1 and G3, and its absence masks their effects.

2. **G1 and G3 Contributions**:  
   The single mutants g1 and g3 show resistance levels of 75% and 50%, respectively. This indicates that both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2. The double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance but are not fully redundant.

3. **Epistatic Relationships**:  
   The data shows that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as the resistance of g1g2 and g2g3 is the same as g2. However, the relationship between G1 and G3 is less clear. The double mutant g1g3 has a resistance level worse than either single mutant, indicating that their effects are additive rather than epistatic.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. It states that G1 is the transcription factor, but the data strongly supports G2 as the transcription factor.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. It suggests that G1 and G3 share the same promoter, but there is no evidence in the data to support this.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy is unsupported by the data.  
   - **Option D**: Partially correct. It identifies G2 as the transcription factor and states that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. However, redundancy implies that the double mutant would have the same resistance as the single mutants, which contradicts the data (g1g3 has 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant). Additionally, the claim that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 shows additive effects.

**Conclusion**: While none of the options perfectly fit the data, option D is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and partially aligns with the idea that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. However, the claims about redundancy and epistasis are not fully supported by the data.

ANSWER: D

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is about white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes based on the resistance levels of the mutants.

The data given are the resistance percentages relative to the wild type. Wild type is 100%, so any lower percentage means more susceptibility. Let me list out the data:

- g1: 75% (so 25% susceptibility, which is lower than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (so 50% susceptibility)
- g1g3: 10% (so 90% susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0%

So, our goal is to figure out the interaction among these genes. The options suggest some possibilities about which is a transcription factor, pleiotropy, epistasis, or redundancy.

From what I remember, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutation depends on gene A's presence. Also, epistatic relationships can be determined by how the double mutants behave compared to the single mutants.

Also, a transcription factor usually acts upstream, regulating other genes. So if a transcription factor is knocked out (say, G2), that might affect the expression of other genes downstream, like G1 or G3.

Let me think about each single mutant. The control is 100%, so:

- g1 has 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, meaning the plant is less resistant. So G1 might be a positive factor for resistance. But not as bad as g2 and g3.

- g2 has 0% resistance. So knocking out G2 completely eliminates resistance. That's a big effect. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that's essential for the resistance pathway.

- g3 has 50% resistance. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance by half. So G3 is also involved but perhaps not as crucial as G2.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% resistance. So both G1 and G2 knocked out. The resistance is as bad as g2. Hmm. So in the absence of G2, maybe G1 doesn't matter? Because g2 alone is 0%, so when both are knocked out, it's still 0%. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would mean G1 isn't expressed either. Wait, but in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2?

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then knocking out G2 would cause G1 to not be expressed. So in the double mutant g1g2, since G2 is already knocked out, G1's knockout wouldn't affect anything else. So the resistance would be the same as g2, which is 0%. That's exactly what the data shows. So that could be a clue that G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So the combined effect is more severe than either alone. So their functions might contribute additively or something else.

Now, the double mutant g2g3 has 0% resistance. Same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, adding the knockout of G3 doesn't change the resistance. That suggests that G3's function is only relevant if G2 is present. Because in the absence of G2, G3 doesn't contribute anything. So G3's function is downstream of G2, perhaps. Or maybe G3 is regulated by G2.

So putting this together, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Let's see.

Because in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 would not be expressed. So the resistance would be as bad as if all of them are knocked out. So let's see: if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in g2, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. But in the single mutants, g1 and g3, their resistance is 75% and 50%, respectively.

So G1's knockout (g1) reduces resistance to 75%, and G3's (g3) to 50%. So G1 contributes more to the resistance than G3.

Now, in the double mutant g1g3, they have 10% resistance. That's lower than either single mutant. So perhaps when both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is lower than each alone, meaning that they have additive effects. So maybe they function in parallel pathways.

But wait, considering that G2 is a transcription factor, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance of g2 is 0%, which is more severe than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0%. Which is same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, G1's status doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the phenotype of G1 is only visible when G2 is present. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, looking at g3g2: also 0%, same as g2. So G3 is epistatic to G2? No, wait. Because when G2 is knocked out (g2), any other gene's knockout doesn't change the resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well? Or, more accurately, G2 is upstream of G3, so the effect of G3 depends on G2 being present. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but that depends on the epistatic relationship. Epistasis is when the mutation in one gene masks the effect of another gene. So if G2 is upstream, then the presence of a functional G2 is necessary for G3's effect to be seen. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

But how does that fit with the data? Let's see: when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%. If we also knock out G3 (g2g3), the resistance is still 0%. So in this case, G3's mutation doesn't add anything to the phenotype because G2 is already knocked out. So G3's effect is only seen when G2 is present.

So that suggests that G3 is epistatic to G2? Or G2 is epistatic to G3? Hmm, I think the term is that G2 is epistatic to G3 because G2's mutation masks the effect of G3. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in a typical epistasis scenario, if you have two genes, A and B, and the phenotype of a mutation in B only shows when A is functional. Then, the mutation in A is epistatic to B. So, for example, if you have coat color in dogs: suppose A is for pigment production and B is for color (like B for black, b for brown). If A is knocked out, the coat is white regardless of B. So the presence of A is required for B to have any effect. So in this case, A is epistatic to B.

In our case, when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0% regardless of G3's status. So G2's mutation (g2) masks the effect of G3. So G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but what about the double mutants g1g3 and g2g3?

g1g3 is 10% resistance. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, resistance is 10%. So perhaps each contributes some level of resistance, and both are working in a pathway that is independent of G2.

Wait, but that's not possible because the g2 mutant's resistance is 0%, which is worse than g3 (50%) and g1 (75%). So maybe G1 and G3 function in different pathways, both of which are downstream of G2.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, but their effects are additive.

But going back to the options. Let's read the options again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but the question states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. The option says G1 is a transcription factor. From the data, G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance. So it's more likely that G2 is the transcription factor, not G1.

Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then in the g2 mutant, none of the downstream genes would be expressed. So in the double mutant g1g2, it's 0%, same as g2. So that suggests that G2 is upstream of G1.

So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, as per the question statement.

So looking at the options, which one has G2 as the transcription factor?

Looking at options:

A) G1 is TF → No, because G2's knockout has a more severe effect.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter → Not sure.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Hmm.

So the setup is that at least one is a TF upstream of others. We thought G2 is the TF.

Now, looking at the data, the single mutants:

g1:75%, g2:0%, g3:50%.

So in the absence of G2, resistance is gone. So G2 must be a key gene, perhaps the TF.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G1's effect is masked when G2 is knocked out. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g3g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Now, what about the double mutant g1g3, which has 10% resistance.

So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. Each single mutant is 75% and 50%. So in combination, it's worse. So perhaps each contributes additivity. So G1 and G3 might be functioning in parallel pathways. Each provides some level of resistance, and together they provide more.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their effects are additive.

Wait, but in the absence of G2, knocking out G1 doesn't change the resistance beyond what G2 already does. So G2 is upstream.

So considering this, G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream. Now, the question is about their interaction.

Looking at the options:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But I don't think that's what's happening here. The question is about their interaction in the pathway, not about multiple traits.

Alternatively, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, knocking out both would have a more severe effect than knocking out either alone.

In our case, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that suggests that they are contributing to the same process, perhaps in a redundant manner. Because if they were in parallel pathways, each contributing additively, their combined knockout would be worse than either. But if they are in the same pathway, their combined knockout would have a more severe effect.

So in this case, the resistance is 10% when both are knocked out. So maybe they are redundant. So when both are missing, the pathway is completely compromised.

So looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if they are redundant, then knocking out both would be worse than either, which is what we're seeing. So that fits. But then, what about the epistatic relationships between G1 and G3?

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is lower than either single mutant. So if gene redundancy is in effect, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That's consistent with the data.

But also, what about their epistatic relationships? If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1's mutation masks the effect of G3.

But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is lower than either, suggesting that their effects are additive. So that might not fit with epistasis.

Wait, perhaps gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So in that case, the single mutants would have some deficit, but the double mutant would be worse.

Which is exactly what we're seeing: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So the double mutant is worse than either, meaning they are not fully redundant but perhaps contribute in a partially additive way. But in the case of full redundancy, the single mutants would be as bad as the double mutant. But in this case, the single mutants are less bad than the double, so perhaps they are partially redundant or in parallel pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their functions are additive. So the double mutant has worse resistance.

Now, looking back at the options, which one fits.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but redundancy suggests that they can compensate for each other. So in the double mutant, their combined knockout would be worse than each single. But let me think about epistasis between G1 and G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as g1. But in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that suggests that the effects are additive, not epistatic. So perhaps G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but are additive.

So maybe the correct option is D, where G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But wait, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is that G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning that G1's mutation masks G3's effect. But in reality, in the double mutant, the effect is worse than either single, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Let's think: If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the mutation in G3 would mask the effect of G1. But in the data, g1 has 75%, and g3g1 (g1g3) is 10%, which is worse than g1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about what each option says.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But we think G2 is the TF, not G1. So option A is probably wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. But I'm not sure what that implies. So that might mean that G1 and G3 are under the control of the same promoter, perhaps both downstream of G2. But I'm not sure how that affects the resistance levels.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits. But the question is about their interaction in the same pathway. So perhaps this is not the case.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning their functions can compensate for each other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either. Which fits with the data (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, g1g3 is 10%). But wait, if they are redundant, then the single mutants should be as bad as the double. But here, the double is worse, so perhaps they are not fully redundant. Alternatively, perhaps they are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but the question says at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. So G2 is the TF.

Now, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps their functions are additive. So G2 is the TF, which activates both G1 and G3, which in turn contribute to the resistance.

In that case, the epistatic relationships would be that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' status doesn't matter.

So looking at the options, which one has G2 as TF and the right relationship between G1 and G3.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps they are not redundant but additive.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So knocking out both would lead to more susceptibility.

If that's the case, then G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but additive.

Now, looking at the options, which option supports that.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Hmm, but if they're redundant, the single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double. But here, the double is worse, so that's not matching.

Wait, gene redundancy would mean that each gene can perform the same function. So if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So the single mutant would have a mild phenotype, but the double would have severe.

Which matches the data here: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So each contributes, but both are needed for full function. So perhaps they are redundant but not fully. So their combined knockout is worse.

So in that case, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is the TF upstream.

So looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would have a worse effect than either, which is what's seen. So gene redundancy is a possibility.

But then, what about the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in the double mutant, the effect is worse, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic to G1. Let me think: if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the phenotype of G1's mutation would depend on G3's status. But in this case, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, and when G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50%. So the effect of G3's knockout is worse than G1's.

But in the double mutant, the resistance is 10%, worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the epistatic relationships are between G2 and G1, and G2 and G3, but not between G1 and G3.

So, looking back at the options, option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, suggesting they are additive, not epistatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure why they'd show pleiotropy.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, we're only looking at resistance to anthracnose. So maybe G1 and G3 are involved in other traits as well, but that's not relevant to the question.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible relationships.

- G2 is a transcription factor, as it's the most upstream, and its knockout leads to the most severe phenotype.

- G1 and G3 are downstream of G2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway or different.

- The double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, implying that their effects are additive, not epistatic.

So, looking at the options, which one fits.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would be worse than either. So that fits the data. But if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then when G1 is knocked out, G3's effect is masked. But the data shows that when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either, which contradicts that.

So perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, their effects are additive, and G2 is epistatic to both.

So looking at the options, which one has G2 as TF and G1 and G3 in some kind of additive relationship.

Looking at option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Not sure about pleiotropy, but perhaps that's not the case.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But redundancy would require that they can compensate for each other. So, when one is knocked out, the other can take over.

Wait, but in that case, the single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double. But here, the single mutants have worse resistance than the double? No, the double is worse. So that's conflicting.

Wait, no: in the case of redundancy, the double mutant's phenotype is worse than either single mutant. So that fits with the data. So g1g3 is worse than either.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would have a worse phenotype. So that fits.

So for option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but what about the epistatic part? If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in our data, the double mutant is worse than either. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the epistatic part is not correct.

Wait, maybe the 'epistatic towards' in the option is not about the double mutant, but about the hierarchy in epistatic relationships.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning that G1's function is upstream of G3.

Wait, but if G1 is upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would make G3's knockout not matter. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: let's see which option matches all the data.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy might not be relevant here, but maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their mutations are additive. But the option says they show pleiotropy, which is unrelated to the resistance data.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But in this case, the double mutant's phenotype would be worse than either, which is what we have.

But I'm not sure about the epistatic part. Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic statement is incorrect, but the rest fits.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

I think the main point is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. Their combined knockout is worse than each alone.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. So in the double mutant, the resistance is much lower.

But looking at the options, option D says that G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1's mutation would mask G3's effect. But in our data, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' in the option refers to the fact that G1 is epistatic to G3. So in the absence of G1, G3's function is irrelevant. But the data shows that in the absence of both, the resistance is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the option is correct because when G1 is present, it's epistatic to G3, but when G1 is not present, G3's effect can't be seen.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct reasoning.

From the data:

- g2 is 0% → G2 is required for any resistance.

- g1 is 75% → so it contributes to resistance when G2 is present.

- g3 is 50% → same.

- The double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than g1 or g3. So perhaps G1 and G3 contribute additively.

So, G2 is the TF, and when present, activates G1 and G3, which each contribute to resistance. When both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is lower than either alone.

So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance.

But the question is about their interaction, and the options mention redundancy or pleiotropy.

Redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. So if one is missing, the other can take over. But in that case, the double mutant would be as bad as the single mutants. But in our case, the double is worse, so redundancy is not the case.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and their combined knockout leads to additive effects.

In that case, the situation would be that G1 and G3 are part of two different pathways, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

In this case, which option fits?

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Not sure about pleiotropy.

Option A: G1 is TF. Not likely, since G2's knockout is much worse.

Hmm. Maybe none of the options fit perfectly, but the best fit is option D, where G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not confident about the epistasis part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it correctly identifies G2 as the TF, and G1 and G3 as redundant, and correctly states that G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3 when G1 is present. But the data shows that when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests that G3's effect is still present when G1 is knocked out, and vice versa.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their effects are additive.

So in that case, the correct option would be the one where G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that.

Wait, looking at option D again: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But gene redundancy would mean that when one is missing, the other can compensate. So the double mutant would be as bad as the single mutants. But our data shows the double is worse, so that doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct option is C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure about this either.

Wait, maybe I should think about the epistatic relationships based on the double mutants.

If G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, that would explain why in the double mutants with G2, the resistance is same as G2.

So, the epistatic relationships are that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Now, what about G1 and G3? Since their double mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either, they are in additive or redundant pathways.

But looking at the options, the only option that correctly states G2 as TF and G2 epistatic to G1 and G3 is option A, but option A says G1 is TF, which is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct option is option D, even if the epistatic part is not fully accurate.

Wait, what do the options say?

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But gene redundancy would require that their single mutants are as bad as the double. But in our case, the double is worse. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure what pleiotropy would mean in this context.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, even though the reasoning about epistasis is unclear. Because G2 is the TF, and the data supports that.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and among the three, G1 and G3 are functioning in a way that their combined knockout leads to additive effects, making them redundant or in parallel pathways.

But the options don't have that exactly.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I don't think pleiotropy is the case here. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not fully confident. Another approach: look for the answer that correctly identifies G2 as the TF, which is epistatic to G1 and G3, and that G1 and G3 have an additive effect.

Which option fits that?

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But redundancy doesn't fit because the double is worse.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is additive (75% + 50% = 125% → but since it's below 100%, it's not additive. So perhaps they are in the same pathway, and their combined effect is more than either alone. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway. So, the epistatic relationships are that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1 or g3. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, the double mutant would have the same resistance as g1. But in reality, it's worse, so that's not possible.

So perhaps the epistatic relationship is the other way around, that G3 is epistatic to G1. Then, in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as g3. But in data, it's 10%, which is worse than g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the option where G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways, but the epistatic part is not directly applicable.

But I'm not finding a clear option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concept of epistasis in terms of gene function.

If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then their double mutant would not be worse than each single, but perhaps the same as the worse single. But in this case, the double is worse, so perhaps they are in separate pathways.

So, combining the findings:

G2 is the TF, epistatic to G1 and G3.

G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, contributing additively to resistance.

So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive (75% +50% = 125%, but since it's below 100%, maybe it's multiplicative, 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, which is 37.5% → but data is 10%). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

But the data shows 10%, which is much lower. So perhaps their pathway is not independent.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and the double mutant is worse than either. So perhaps G1 is in one part, G3 in another, and both are needed for the pathway.

But I'm not sure.

Well, given the options, I'm going to have to make an educated guess. My initial thought is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, but that their combined knockout is worse than either, which doesn't fit redundancy. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the epistatic part is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the key is to look for which option correctly states that G2 is the TF, and which correctly describes the relationships.

Looking back at the options, option D says G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 have redundancy. But the data doesn't support redundancy because the double is worse. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. I think I've spent enough time, and I'll proceed to select the best option.


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. Based on the experimental data, the resistance levels of single and double mutants were analyzed to infer the roles of these genes. The key findings and reasoning are as follows:

1. **G2 as the Transcription Factor**:  
   The single mutant g2 shows 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance. This suggests that G2 acts as a transcription factor upstream of other genes, likely regulating their expression. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This means that G2's function is required for the expression of G1 and G3, and its absence masks their effects.

2. **G1 and G3 Contributions**:  
   The single mutants g1 and g3 show resistance levels of 75% and 50%, respectively. This indicates that both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2. The double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance but are not fully redundant.

3. **Epistatic Relationships**:  
   The data shows that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as the resistance of g1g2 and g2g3 is the same as g2. However, the relationship between G1 and G3 is less clear. The double mutant g1g3 has a resistance level worse than either single mutant, indicating that their effects are additive rather than epistatic.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. It states that G1 is the transcription factor, but the data strongly supports G2 as the transcription factor.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. It suggests that G1 and G3 share the same promoter, but there is no evidence in the data to support this.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy is unsupported by the data.  
   - **Option D**: Partially correct. It identifies G2 as the transcription factor and states that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. However, redundancy implies that the double mutant would have the same resistance as the single mutants, which contradicts the data (g1g3 has 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant). Additionally, the claim that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 shows additive effects.

**Conclusion**: While none of the options perfectly fit the data, option D is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and partially aligns with the idea that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. However, the claims about redundancy and epistasis are not fully supported by the data.
