Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about observations of a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. The question is about determining the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth based on the given cosmological parameters.

Wait, I remember that in cosmology, the peak of emission or absorption in the spectrum can tell us something about the redshift of the object. Oh right, because if the peak is observed at a longer wavelength than emitted, it means the object is moving away due to the expansion of the universe. So redshift is involved here.

The peak is at 790 nm. But wait, what's the typical emission line of a quasar? Oh, I think the Lyman-alpha emission line is a prominent one. Wait no, Lyman-alpha is at 121 nm in the rest frame (far UV). But if the peak is at 790 nm, that's much longer. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer series, like H-alpha or something. Wait, H-alpha is about 656 nm in the rest frame, which is optical. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that would imply some redshift. Let me calculate the redshift.

Redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So if the rest is 656 nm and observed is 790 nm, z would be (790/656) - 1 ≈ 1.204 - 1 = 0.204. Alternatively, if the rest peak is elsewhere, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the peak is due to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman-alpha forest, but that's usually at higher redshifts and in the UV. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. That suggests that 790 is the peak, and shorter (bluer) wavelengths have less flux. So perhaps the peak is in the near-infrared, meaning the object is at a certain redshift where the rest frame emission is in the near-IR when observed. Wait, no, wait. The peak is observed in near infrared, which is longer than optical. So if the rest frame emission is in the optical, then the quasar is at a certain redshift.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the Lyman limit or something else. Wait, maybe the peak is part of the quasar's emission line, say the Lyman-alpha line at 121 nm. If observed at 790 nm, that would be a redshift of (790/121) - 1 ≈ 6.52 -1 = z≈5.52. But that's quite a high redshift. But wait, the problem says the peak is in the near-infrared. Wait, is 790 nm near-IR? I think near-IR starts around 700-900 nm, so yes, 790 would be near-IR. So if the rest wavelength is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), then z is 5.52.

But wait, the question states that the flux drops at wavelengths less than 790 nm. So perhaps the peak is at 790, which is the emitted wavelength? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, because if the object is at high redshift, then any emitted optical or UV light would be redshifted into the IR. So the drop-off at shorter observed wavelengths (bluer) could be due to the fact that the quasar's emission in those rest wavelengths is being redshifted beyond what we can observe, or it could be due to something else like dust extinction.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is in the rest frame, and due to the drop in flux at shorter wavelengths, that's because of something like the Lyman break. Wait, the Lyman break occurs when the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium absorbs UV photons beyond a certain wavelength. So if the quasar emits UV light, but because of the expansion of the universe, the UV photons are shifted into the visible or IR. The Lyman break would cause a drop in flux below a certain observed wavelength. So for example, the rest UV emission would stop at 912 Angstroms (91.2 nm), so if the quasar's rest frame has a UV emission, but observed at longer wavelengths, the drop in flux at shorter observed wavelengths would correspond to the Lyman limit.

Wait, let's think. Suppose the quasar's rest frame has a peak at wavelength λ_em. Observed wavelength is λ = λ_em * (1+z). So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, and if the rest frame peak is at λ_rest. For the Lyman limit, λ_rest = 912 Angstroms (0.0912 microns, 91.2 nm). So 790 nm is 0.79 microns. So 0.79 = 0.0912 * (1+z) → (1+z) = 0.79 / 0.0912 ≈ 8.657. So z ≈7.657. But that seems very high. I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is the Lyman-alpha line, which is at 121 nm in rest frame. So 121 nm * (1 + z) = 790 nm → 1+z = 790 / 121 ≈6.528 → z≈5.528. So if the peak is Lyman-alpha at z≈5.53, then the quasar is at that redshift.

But wait, the question says that the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths than 790 nm, so for wavelengths less than 790 nm. If the peak is at 790, and the flux drops below that, that suggests that the emission is only present at longer wavelengths. For the Lyman-alpha scenario, if the quasar is at z=5.53, then the Lyman-alpha emission is at 790 nm. But what about other emission lines or the continuum? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is part of the quasar's continuum, but that's less likely. Another possibility is that the peak is from the Balmer break, which is when the Lyman and Balmer series transitions stop contributing, so the SED (spectral energy distribution) drops in the blue. The Balmer break occurs around 365 nm in the rest frame (for a star with certain temperature), but if the observed Balmer break is at 790 nm, then z would be (790 / 365) -1 ≈2.16 -1 =1.16. So z≈1.16.

Wait, but the flux drops at wavelengths less than 790, which would correspond to the Balmer break if observed at longer wavelengths. So if the rest frame has a drop at a certain wavelength, the observed drop is at 790 nm. So for example, if the rest frame has a drop at 365 nm, then z = (790 / 365) -1 ≈ 2.164 -1 =1.164. So z≈1.16.

But I'm not entirely sure which scenario is correct. Hmm. Alternatively, another approach is to think about the K correction and the fact that the peak is in the near-IR, which may suggest that the quasar's emission is redshifted from the optical or UV.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the comoving distance given a certain redshift. That is, once we determine the redshift from the spectral features, we can compute the comoving distance using the given cosmological parameters.

Wait, the question gives us cosmological parameters: Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0). So with these parameters, we can find the comoving distance for a given redshift.

The comoving distance (for a=1, which is today) is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z') = sqrt(Ω_r (1+z')^4 + Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ). Wait, but in our current universe, Ω_r is negligible (radiation density), so E(z') = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ).

So the comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ)] dz'

But calculating this integral exactly for a given z is a bit complicated. Alternatively, if the redshift is moderate, we can use an approximation or look up standard values.

Wait, I remember that for various redshifts, the comoving distance can be approximated or computed using look-up tables. For example, at z=1, the comoving distance is approximately 2 Gpc for H0=70. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I can recall that when the matter density is Ω_m=0.3 and dark energy Ω_Λ=0.7, the expansion history is such that the universe is expanding, and the comoving distance can be calculated with certain formulas.

But perhaps another approach is to use the age of the universe and other factors. Alternatively, perhaps the peak wavelength is indicative of the quasar's redshift, and from that, we can determine the comoving distance.

Wait, but without knowing the exact rest wavelength of the peak, it's a bit tricky. Let me think about possible rest wavelengths that when redshifted would give 790 nm.

Option 1: The peak is from the Lyman-alpha line at 121 nm. Observed at 790 nm, so z= (790/121) -1≈6.528. That's a high redshift. The comoving distance for z≈6.5 would be quite large. I think for z=2, the comoving distance is around 3 Gpc with H0=70 (or is it more?), but for higher z, it's larger.

Wait, if z is 6.5, then the comoving distance would be much larger than the options given, which are up to 9 Gpc. So perhaps that's not the case.

Option 2: The peak is from the Balmer break in the rest frame. Let's say the rest frame has a break at 365 nm (ultraviolet). Observed at 790 nm, so z≈(790/365)-1≈2.16 -1=1.16.

At z=1.16, what is the comoving distance?

I think for H0=70, the comoving distance for z=1 is roughly about 1.5 Gpc, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, perhaps it's larger.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for comoving distance for a flat universe (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7). There's an approximation formula, but I'm not remembering it exactly.

Alternatively, I can recall that for a flat universe (Ω_m + Ω_Λ =1), the comoving distance can be calculated using the integral:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1/(E(z'))] dz'

Where E(z') = sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ)

But integrating this isn't straightforward. However, I can use some known values or approximate methods.

Alternatively, I can think about the relation between redshift and luminosity distance, but that's more complicated.

Wait, I think for a given redshift, the comoving distance is approximately:

D_c ≈ (c/H0) * (1+z) * (1/(sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ))) )

But this is an approximation, perhaps only valid for certain ranges of z.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use online calculators or standard cosmology tables. But since I can't do that right now, I have to think.

I remember that for z=1, the comoving distance is approximately 2 Gpc with H0=70. Wait, no, wait. Let me think of the Hubble distance, which is c/H0. c is about 3e5 km/s, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 is roughly (3e5)/(70) ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is about 4.285 Gpc.

So comoving distance for z=0.5 would be less than 4.285 Gpc, perhaps around 2 Gpc. For z=1, it's about 4 Gpc. For z=2, about 7 Gpc. For z=3, about 10 Gpc. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps those are luminosity distances, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: use the approximation for the comoving distance in a matter-dominated universe. For Ω_m=1, E(z)=sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3) = (1+z)^(3/2). The integral would be:

D_c = (c/H0) ∫_0^z [1/(1+z')^(3/2)] dz' = (c/H0) * [2(1+z')^(-1/2)] from 0 to z.

Which gives 2(c/H0) [1/sqrt(1+z) - 1]

But our universe isn't matter dominated; it's dark energy dominated now. So this would underestimate or overestimate the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the approximation for a dark energy-dominated universe would be different. But I'm not too sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the age of the universe at a given redshift. The age is given by 1 / H0 * ∫_0^z [1/E(z')] dz' / (1+z').

But again, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, if we consider that the comoving distance D_c is proportional to the integral of 1/E(z') from 0 to z.

In any case, perhaps the options given are 6, 8, 9, 7 Gpc.

If the redshift is around z≈1.5, then comoving distance would be around 5-6 Gpc. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the flux drop-off at shorter wavelengths may be due to the Lyman limit. So the quasar's own Lyman limit is at 912 Angstroms. But if the quasar is at redshift z, then the observed Lyman limit would be at 912*(1+z) Angstroms, which is 912*(1+z) nm. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that, perhaps the Lyman limit is at 790 nm. So 912*(1+z) =790 → (1+z)=790/912≈0.866 → z= -0.134. That can't be right because redshift can't be negative. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, that gives z negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the Lyman limit is at 912 Angstroms, so for the quasar's rest frame, any emitted light below 912 Angstroms is absorbed by the intergalactic medium. So if the quasar emits in the UV (like a star), the observed flux drops at wavelengths below the Lyman break. So in the observed spectrum, the drop-off occurs at a wavelength corresponding to (1+z)*912 Angstroms.

Wait, so if the observed drop-off is at 790 nm, which is 7900 Angstroms, then (1+z)*912=7900 → 1+z=7900/912 ≈8.657 → z≈7.657. That's a very high redshift. But the options given are up to 9 Gpc, which for z=7 would be a very large comoving distance. But let's see what the comoving distance would be.

Wait, wait, for z=7, the comoving distance would be much larger than the options. Because, with H0=70, c/H0 is about 4.28 Gpc. If I multiply by (1+z) for high z, but the integral would have a certain value. But for z=7, the integral would be much larger. So perhaps this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the drop-off is due to the Lyman-alpha forest, but that's more about absorption lines in the quasar's spectrum due to intervening hydrogen, but the question is about the quasar's own spectrum.

So maybe the peak is in the rest frame near-IR.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the peak is in the near-IR because the quasar's emission is from a region that is itself in the near-IR in the rest frame, but that seems unlikely because most quasars emit strongly in UV and optical.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is in the near-IR due to dust reddening, making the observed peak longer than the emitted. But that complicates things, and I think the question is more about cosmological redshift.

Wait, perhaps the peak is a broad emission line. For example, the Mg II emission line is at 279.6 nm in rest frame. If observed at 790 nm, that would be z=(790/279.6) -1 ≈2.823 -1=1.823. So z≈1.82.

At z=1.8, what's the comoving distance?

I think for H0=70, the comoving distance for z≈1.8 might be around 6 Gpc or more. Let me think, I remember that at z=1, it's about 2 Gpc (but I'm not certain). Wait, no, I think that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should recall that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance for z=1 is approximately 2 Gpc. But that can't be right because H0=70 would have c/H0= about 4.28 Gpc, so for z=1, the comoving distance should be larger than that. Hmm, I must be getting confused between comoving distance and other distances like angular diameter distance.

Wait, let's clarify.

The comoving distance is given by D_c = (c/H0) * ∫_0^z [1/E(z')] dz'

E(z') = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ)

So for z=0.5, D_c ≈ (3e5 km/s /70 km/s/Mpc) * ∫_0^0.5 [1/sqrt(0.3*(1+0.5)^3 + 0.7)] dz'

Wait, 3e5 km/s is c. 3e5 /70 is about 4285.7 Mpc, which is 4.285 Gpc.

So for z=0.5, E(z')=sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 + 0.7) ≈ sqrt(0.3*3.375 + 0.7)= sqrt(1.0125 + 0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=≈1.308.

So the integrand is 1/1.308≈0.765.

The integral from 0 to 0.5 of 0.765 dz' is 0.765 * 0.5= 0.3825.

Multiply by 4.285 Gpc: 4.285 * 0.3825 ≈1.64 Gpc.

So for z=0.5, D_c≈1.6 Gpc.

For z=1:

E(z')=sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=≈1.761.

Integral from 0 to 1 of 1/1.761 dz' → (1/1.761) *1 ≈0.568.

So D_c=4.285 *0.568≈2.42 Gpc.

Wait, but this can't be right because I remember that the comoving distance for z=1 should be higher, like around 2 Gpc. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe the integral isn't just 1/E(z') evaluated at a particular value but varies with z. Oh wait, no, the E(z') is evaluated at each z' during the integral, so my approach above is incorrect because I assumed E(z') is constant, which it isn't. So I can't just use a single value for E(z') over the whole integral.

So perhaps it's better to look up a table or use an approximate formula. But without exact data, it's hard.

Wait, another approach: use the approximation formula for the comoving distance.

In a flat universe with Ω_m and Ω_Λ, the comoving distance can be approximated using:

D_c ≈ (c/H0) * [ (2/(1 + Ω_m)) ) * ( (1+z)^(1/2) ) ] 

Wait, no, that's not a correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for a matter dominated universe, but with dark energy, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, I can think that for z <<1, the integral can be approximated as a Taylor expansion, but for higher z, it's better to use numerical integration.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for z=0.5, the comoving distance is about 1.5 Gpc, and for z=1, it's about 2.3 Gpc, for H0=70.

Wait, perhaps I should use an online calculator if I could, but since I can't, I'll proceed with educated guesses.

The question is about the comoving distance of the quasar. The options are A:6, B:8, C:9, D:7.

If the redshift is around z=2, the comoving distance would be higher. Let me think, for z=2, what would D_c be.

Using the integral D_c = (c/H0) * ∫_0^2 [1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7)] dz'

But computing this would require evaluating the integral numerically. Alternatively, I can use standard values.

Wait, I found a reference in my memory: for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance is approximately:

z | D_c (Gpc)
0 | 0
0.5 | ~1.5 Gpc
1 | ~2.3 Gpc
2 | ~3.4 Gpc
3 | ~4.5 Gpc
5 | ~6.5 Gpc
7 | ~8.2 Gpc

But I'm not certain about these numbers. Alternatively, perhaps each doubling of z adds a certain amount. But given that the options are up to 9 Gpc, perhaps a z around 5-6 would give D_c of 6-7 Gpc.

Wait, but the options include 7, 8, etc. So if the redshift is around z=1.5, D_c would be about 3.5 Gpc? That doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, let's think about the peak at 790 nm. Suppose it's the Lyman-alpha line. Then z= (790/121) -1≈6.528.

Then D_c at z=6.5 would be quite large. Looking back at my earlier hypothetical table, I said around 8 Gpc for z=7, but that's just a guess.

So if the redshift is around z=5.5, the comoving distance would be about 6-7 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lick lines, which are in the optical. For example, the H-alpha line is at 656 nm. Observed at 790, so z= (790/656) -1≈0.204.

Then D_c for z=0.2 would be approximately (c/H0) * ∫_0^0.2 [1/E(z')] dz' ≈ (4.285 Gpc) * [approx 0.2 / E_avg], where E_avg is around sqrt(0.3*(1.2)^3 +0.7) = sqrt(0.3*1.728 +0.7)=sqrt(0.5184 +0.7)=sqrt(1.2184)=≈1.103.

So integrand ≈ 1/1.103 ≈0.906. Integral over 0 to 0.2 is 0.2 *0.906≈0.181. So D_c=4.285 * 0.181≈0.775 Gpc. That's about 0.78 Gpc, which is not among the options.

So perhaps the redshift is higher. Let's try another approach.

Assuming that the peak is due to the Lyman-alpha line at 121 nm observed at 790 nm, so z≈5.5.

Then the comoving distance would be:

D_c = (c/H0) * ∫_0^5.5 [1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)] dz'

But without actually calculating the integral, it's hard to get the exact value. But perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from another line. For example, the He II emission line at 164.05 nm. Observed at 790 nm, z = (790/164) -1 ≈4.817 -1=3.817. So z≈3.82.

At z=3.8, the comoving distance would be around 5 Gpc? I'm not sure.

But let's think about the options. If we go with z=5.5, which would give a comoving distance of around 7 Gpc or so. So looking at the options, D is 7 Gpc.

Alternatively, if the peak is from the Lyman series at z≈5.5, then the comoving distance would be about 7 Gpc.

Wait, but I need to make sure. Let me think: for z=5, what's the comoving distance?

Using an online calculator (if I had one), for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, H0=70, z=5.

The comoving distance is around 6.3 Gpc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, according to some online sources I've seen before, for H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 6.3 Gpc.

So if the redshift is z≈5, D_c≈6 Gpc, which matches option A:6 Gpc.

But wait, earlier when I thought of z=5.5, I thought D_c would be about 7, which is option D.

But I'm getting conflicting estimates.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the Balmer break, leading to a redshift of around 1.16, which would give a comoving distance of about 2 Gpc, which doesn't match any of the options. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman-alpha line at z≈5.5, and the comoving distance is around 7 Gpc, making option D the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is in the near-IR because the quasar is at high redshift, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the question says the peak is at 790 nm and flux drops at shorter wavelengths. That might indicate that the peak is the Lyman break. So the Lyman break occurs at 912 Angstroms (0.0912 microns, 91.2 nm) in the rest frame. So in the observed frame, the Lyman break would be at (1+z)*91.2 nm.

If the Lyman break is observed at 790 nm, then (1+z)=790/91.2 ≈8.66 → z≈7.66.

The comoving distance at z=7.66 would be significantly large. According to some sources, for z=7, D_c is around 8 Gpc, so for z=7.66, it would be a bit more, say around 8.5 Gpc, which would correspond to option B (8 Gpc) or C (9 Gpc).

But the options don't have 8.5, but 8 and 9 are options.

However, the peak is at 790 nm, which is above the Lyman break. So if the Lyman break is at 790 nm, the emission blueward of that (shorter wavelengths) is absorbed, leading to a drop in flux. So the peak at 790 nm could be the Lyman limit's observed position.

So if z≈7.66, then D_c≈8 Gpc (option B).

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the peak is not the Lyman break. So perhaps I should consider the Lyman-alpha line.

Wait, the question states that the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared. If that's the Lyman-alpha line, then z≈5.5.

So D_c for z=5.5 would be about 6.3 Gpc, which is option A.

But I'm getting conflicting possibilities based on different assumptions about the rest wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the identification of the peak and its relation to the comoving distance.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the peak in the near-infrared suggests that the object is at a high redshift, because high-redshift objects have their optical or UV emission shifted into the near-IR.

So the comoving distance should be on the order of several Gpc. The options are 6,7,8,9.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is around 7 Gpc, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: the given options suggest that the comoving distance is about 7 Gpc.

But without a clear way to determine the redshift precisely, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the location of the quasar, and the peak is due to the Lyman-alpha emission line. So the quasar is at z≈5.5, which would give a comoving distance of about 6-7 Gpc.

But I'm not sure. So perhaps the correct answer is D)7 Gpc.

But I'm not entirely confident, but given the options and the reasoning, I'll go with option D:7 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar from Earth based on its observed spectral features and the given cosmological parameters. The observed peak in the near-infrared spectrum is at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than this. This suggests that the peak corresponds to a redshifted emission feature, such as the Lyman-alpha line or another prominent emission line.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Identifying the Rest Wavelength**:  
   The observed wavelength of 790 nm could correspond to a redshifted emission line. If the peak is due to the Lyman-alpha line (rest wavelength 121 nm), the redshift \( z \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.53
   \]  
   This high redshift indicates the quasar is at a significant distance from Earth.

2. **Comoving Distance Formula**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz'
   \]  
   where \( c \) is the speed of light, \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), and \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \). For \( z \approx 5.5 \), the integral must be evaluated numerically, as \( E(z') = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda} \) varies with \( z' \).

3. **Approximating the Comoving Distance**:  
   Using standard cosmological models and approximations for a flat universe (\( \Omega_m + \Omega_\Lambda = 1 \)), the comoving distance for \( z \approx 5.5 \) is estimated to be around 7 Gpc. This aligns with the given options and the expected scale of distances at such redshifts.

4. **Alternative Scenarios**:  
   - If the peak corresponds to the Balmer break or other emission lines (e.g., H-alpha at 656 nm), the redshift would be lower (\( z \approx 0.2 \)), resulting in a much smaller comoving distance, which does not match the options.  
   - If the peak is due to the Lyman break (rest wavelength 912 Å), the redshift would be even higher (\( z \approx 7.66 \)), leading to a comoving distance closer to 8 Gpc. However, the observed peak at 790 nm is more consistent with the Lyman-alpha line rather than the Lyman break.

### Conclusion:
Given the observed peak at 790 nm and the associated redshift \( z \approx 5.5 \), the comoving distance of the quasar is most consistent with 7 Gpc. This corresponds to option D.
