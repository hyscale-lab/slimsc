Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit, c. So to find the relative speed between them, I can't just subtract 0.6c and 0.5c; I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Right, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So here, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. Plugging in, I get (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: (0.6 * 0.5) is 0.3, so 0.3c² divided by c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c. So roughly 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that's one part done.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. The system's total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each has energy given by gamma * m * c², right? Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 = 3.4641 mc².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc². So about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is less. So the correct choice is C. Wait, let me double-check the math.

Gamma for 0.6c: v=0.6c, v²=0.36 c². 1 - v²/c²=0.64, sqrt is 0.8. So gamma is 1.25. E1=2m *1.25 c²=2.5mc². Correct.

Gamma for 0.5c: v²=0.25 c², 1 - 0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=~0.866, so gamma is about 1.1547. E2=3m * 1.1547 c²=3.4641 mc². So sum is approx 5.964, which rounds to 5.96 mc². So yes, option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut
Mass = \( 2m \), speed = \( 0.6c \). Calculate \( \gamma_1 \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Energy of the first astronaut:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut
Mass = \( 3m \), speed = \( 0.5c \). Calculate \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy of the second astronaut:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
