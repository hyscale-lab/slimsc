Okay, let me try to work through this physics problem. So, the question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator follows Hooke's law, F = -kx, and it has maximum speed at the equilibrium point. But this is a relativistic version, so I guess we have to consider special relativity effects here.

The problem is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's think about how to approach this.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's because the potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA², and when it converts to kinetic energy, (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA², so v = sqrt(kA²/m). So that's option C, but since this is relativistic, option C is probably incorrect.

Relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I assume that the equation for energy in special relativity must come into use. The total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But wait, in this oscillator, the energy is oscillating between kinetic and potential.

Wait, but in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is still V = (1/2)kx², right? Or is it different? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, the question says it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx, so the potential is indeed (1/2)kx².

But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy at any point. Wait, no. For a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is conserved. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², the potential energy at maximum displacement. But wait, in the relativistic case, when the mass is at maximum displacement x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, so all energy is potential. But wait, the potential energy in relativistic terms is (1/2)kA², same as before? Hmm, maybe that's the case.

Wait, no, because if the motion is relativistic, the mass increases due to gamma. So the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kA² anymore. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx². The kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc². So when the oscillator is at x = 0, it's moving fastest, so kinetic energy is maximum. At x = A, it stops for a moment, so kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential.

So the total energy E at any point is (1/2)kA² (because that's the maximum potential energy) equals the kinetic plus potential energy at any other point.

Wait, but wait: in the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, because of the kinetic energy dependence on gamma, the total energy might be different. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using relativistic equations. Let me try to set up the equation.

The oscillator's equation in relativity isn't straightforward. The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is different. I'm trying to recall the equation. Oh right, the equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator often uses a modified potential, but maybe in this problem, it's kept as F = -kx, so the usual potential.

The equation of motion would be similar to the relativistic equation.

Wait, the force equation is F = d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum, p = γ m v. So F = d/dt (γ m v) = -k x.

This leads to a more complicated differential equation. But perhaps there's a way to find the maximum speed without solving that.

At maximum speed, the acceleration is zero? Because the force is -k x, so when x is zero, the force is zero, hence the acceleration is zero, so the velocity is maximum. So the maximum speed occurs when x = 0.

So, when x=0, the potential energy is zero (since V = 1/2 k x²). The kinetic energy is maximum, so E = (γ - 1) m c².

But wait, the total energy of the oscillator must be equal to the maximum potential energy when x = A, which is (1/2)k A². So in that case, when x = A, the kinetic energy is zero (since velocity is zero), so E = (1/2)k A².

Wait, but in the relativistic case, when x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)k A². So E = (1/2)k A². But when x = 0, E is the kinetic energy, which is (γ - 1) m c².

So setting them equal: (1/2)k A² = (γ - 1) m c².

But wait, at x = 0, the mass is moving at maximum speed v_max, so γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²).

So substituting, E (total) equals (γ - 1) m c². And E is also (1/2)k A².

So,

(1/2)k A² = (γ - 1) m c².

Rearranging:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me compute that:

(1/2)k A² = (γ - 1) m c².

Multiply both sides by 2:

k A² = 2 (γ - 1) m c².

Divide both sides by 2 m c²:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) ) = (γ - 1)/ c² * 2 c²?

Wait, let me correct. Let's go back.

(1/2 k A²) = (gamma -1) m c^2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

k A² = 2 (gamma -1) m c².

Then,

gamma -1 = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me let’s write this as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable for simplicity. Let me call it B.

So,

gamma = 1 + B.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ) = 1 + B.

But B is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a dimensionless quantity. Let's now solve for v.

Take the reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + B).

Square both sides:

1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + B)^2.

Rearrange:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + B)^2] = [ (1 + B)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + B)^2.

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2B + B² - 1 ) = 2B + B².

So,

v²/c² = (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2.

Factor numerator: B(2 + B).

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ B(2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2.

But B is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so let me substitute back.

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + k A²/(2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²) )^2.

Let me simplify this expression.

Let me compute the numerator inside the brackets:

First term: (k A²)/(2 m c²) multiplied by (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)).

Let me write B = (k A²)/(2 m c^2), so numerator becomes B*(2 + B) = 2 B + B^2.

Denominator is (1 + B)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (2 B + B^2) ] / (1 + B)^2.

Factor numerator: B (2 + B) = same as before.

Wait, but maybe there's a better way to handle this. Let me think:

We have B = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A^2) / (2 m c²).

So, let me compute 2B + B²:

= 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) + (k A^2/(2 m c²))^2.

= (k A^2)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Hmm, but maybe that's not helpful. Let's think about the expression for v^2:

v^2 = c² [ (2 B + B²) ] / (1 + B)^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this differently.

Alternatively, let's factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, 2B + B² = B (2 + B) = B (B + 2).

Denominator: (1 + B)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ B (B + 2) ] / (1 + B)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as c^2 multiplied by [ B (B + 2) ] / (B + 1)^2.

But perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, let me think about the denominator (1 + B)^2 and the numerator B (B + 2).

Hmm, perhaps express it as:

[ B (B + 2) ] / (1 + B)^2 = [ B (B + 2) ] / (B + 1)^2.

Alternatively, expand (B + 2) as (B + 1) + 1.

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let me write B = (k A^2)/(2 m c²) = [k A^2/(2 m)] ] / c².

Wait, because (k A²)/(2 m) is the same as the non-relativistic sqrt(k A²/m) squared, which is v_classical_max^2.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, v_max^2 = (k A^2)/m, so (k A^2)/(2 m) is (v_classical_max)^2 / 2.

Not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe we can write the expression for v_max in terms of B.

Wait, let me think about the options. The options include terms like 1/(1 - kA²/(2m)) etc. Let me look at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m))^2 )

Hmm, not sure. Let me compute the expression we have for v^2.

v^2 = c^2 [ B (B + 2) ] / (1 + B)^2.

But B is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ B (B + 2) ] / (1 + B)^2.

Let me compute this.

Let me substitute B = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + 2 ) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor out 2 from the numerator's second term.

Wait, the numerator is B*(B + 2). Let me see:

= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + 2 ]

= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * [ (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2) ) ]

= [ (k A^2) (k A^2 + 4 m c^2) ) ] / (4 m^2 c^4).

Denominator: (1 + B)^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 / (4 m² c^4).

So, putting it together,

v^2/c^2 = [ [ (k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2) ) / (4 m² c^4) ) ] ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ]

The denominators 4 m² c^4 cancel out.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can factor it differently.

Wait, let me factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: k A^2 ( k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 ( k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator as k A^2 ( (k A^2) + 4 m c^2 ), and the denominator as ( (k A^2) + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Wait, maybe we can write the numerator in terms of denominator terms.

Wait, denominator is (k A^2 + 2 m c^2)^2.

Hmm, not sure. Let me think about whether any of the options match this.

Looking at option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2m))^2 )

Hmm, let me compute the expression inside the sqrt in option A.

sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 )).

Wait, but in our expression, v^2/c^2 is equal to [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2)] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me think in terms of gamma.

Earlier, we had gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me solve for v.

Let me write gamma as 1 + delta, where delta is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = 1 + delta.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/(gamma) = sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Square both sides:

1/(gamma^2) = 1 - v²/c².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(gamma^2).

But gamma = 1 + delta, so:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/( (1 + delta)^2 )

= [ (1 + delta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + delta)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 delta + delta^2) - 1 = 2 delta + delta^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 delta + delta^2) / (1 + delta)^2.

Which brings us back to what we had earlier.

So, plugging delta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), we get:

v^2/c^2 = [ 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) + ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ] / ( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator:

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ) ] / ( ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2) )^2 )

Wait, denominator is ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2) )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) )

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe instead of getting into algebra, I should look at the options and see which one matches this.

Wait, let me see the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m))^2 )

Hmm, let me compute the expression inside the sqrt.

Compute 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m))^2.

Wait, (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)) is in the denominator, squared.

But our expression for v^2/c^2 is [2 delta + delta^2 ]/(1 + delta)^2, where delta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, perhaps in option A, the denominator is 1 - (k A^2)/(2m). Wait, but our expression has 2 m c^2 in the denominator, so unless c=1, this would be different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back.

Wait, in the equation E = (1/2) k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

Oh, wait a second. Is E the total energy? Or is the potential energy (1/2)k A²?

Wait, in classical mechanics, the total energy is (1/2)k A². But in relativity, the kinetic energy is different. So perhaps I should think in terms of conserved energy.

Wait, perhaps I should model the energy correctly. The potential energy is (1/2)k x², as before. The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So when the oscillator is at x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and potential energy is maximum: (1/2)k A².

So the total energy E is (1/2)k A².

At any other point, x = 0, velocity is maximum. So kinetic energy is E = (gamma -1) m c².

So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is what I had earlier.

So, moving on, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which implies,

gamma = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Because,

gamma = 1 + [k A²/(2 m c²)] = [2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2).

So,

gamma = (2 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2).

Hmm, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ) = (2 m c^2 +k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me invert both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (2 m c^2) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2).

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = (4 m² c^4)/( (2 m c^2 +k A^2)^2 ).

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - (4 m² c^4)/( (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 )

= [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2)^2 -4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2)^2.

Expand numerator:

(2 m c^2)^2 + 2*(2 m c^2)(k A^2) + (k A^2)^2 - 4 m² c^4.

= 4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 + k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4.

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel.

So,

=4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4.

Factor numerator:

= k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2)] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Hmm, which is the same as before.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - k A^2/(2 m))^2 )

Wait, let's compute the expression inside the sqrt for option A.

Compute 1 + [1 / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m))^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m).

= (2 m -k A^2 ) / (2 m )

So,

1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m))^2 = (2 m )^2 / (2 m -k A^2 )^2.

So,

1 + [ (4 m^2 )/( (2 m -k A^2 )^2 ) ].

= [ (2 m -k A^2 )^2 +4 m^2 ] / (2 m -k A^2 )^2.

Expand numerator:

(4 m^2 -4 m k A^2 +k² A^4 ) +4 m²

= 8 m^2 -4 m k A^2 +k² A^4.

So,

expression in option A is sqrt( [ (8 m^2 -4 m k A^2 +k² A^4) ] / (2 m -k A^2 )^2 )

Which is sqrt( (k² A^4 -4 m k A^2 +8 m^2 ) ) / |2 m -k A^2 |.

Hmm, it's not clear this matches our earlier expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at option D.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let's compute that.

Inside the sqrt:

1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

= [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Numerator expansion:

1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + (k A^2)^2/( (2 m c^2)^2 ) -1.

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ].

Denominator: [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]^2 = (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ).

So,

expression becomes:

[ (k A^2/(m c^2 )) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= [ (4 m² c^4 (k A^2)/(m c^2 )) +4 m² c^4 (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

= [ 4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Which matches our earlier expression: v^2/c^2 = [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Which is exactly the same as the expression inside option D's square root.

So, option D's expression is sqrt( [ (4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ) multiplied by c.

Wait, no. Wait, option D is:

sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which we found equals sqrt( [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

= c * [ sqrt(4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4) ] / ( 2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Factor inside the sqrt:

= sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) )

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ]^(1/2 )

But,

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, wait, perhaps that's the same as option D.

Wait, let me compute the expression in option D:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which we determined is equal to c * sqrt( [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

But I'm not sure, but given that the expression in option D's sqrt matches the expression for v^2/c^2, that would imply that option D is the correct expression.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-express the numerator and denominator.

Our expression for v^2/c^2 is [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Which is the same as [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) * 2 m c^2 + k^2 A^4 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] no, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write:

[4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] = k A^2 (4 m c² +k A^2 )

Denominator is (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

No, perhaps I should just see which option matches this.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which, as we saw, equals c * sqrt( [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

But that's the same as c * [ sqrt( (4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4) ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, perhaps that's not matching any of the options directly, but perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let me think about when the relativistic effects are small.

If k A^2 is much smaller than 2 m c^2, then the denominator in the gamma becomes approximately 1, and the maximum speed would approach sqrt( (k A^2)/(m) ), which is the non-relativistic case. Let's check the options in that limit.

So, when k A^2 << 2 m c^2, we can approximate.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m))^2 )

Wait, in denominator of the fraction: (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)).

If k A² is much smaller than 2m, then 1 - (k A^2)/(2m) ≈ 1. So,

1/(1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x when x <<1.

So,

1 + 1/(1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 + 1 + 2x = 2 + 2 x.

Wait, but that's not right. Let me recompute.

Wait, when x is small, 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x + x^2 + ... So,

1/(1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + ... 

So,

1 + 1/(1 -x )^2 ≈ 2 + 2x for small x.

So, sqrt(2 + 2x ) ≈ sqrt(2 (1 + x )) ≈ sqrt(2) (1 + x/2).

So,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt(2) (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m)) ).

Hmm, but in the non-relativistic limit, v_max should be sqrt(k A^2/m) = (k A^2/m )^(1/2) = sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m) )

But in option A, when k A² is small,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt(2) (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m) )

Which would give a speed much larger than c if c is not 1. So this can't be correct, because in reality, when velocities are small, v_max should approach sqrt(k A^2/m ), which is much less than c.

So option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, in the denominator, (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

If k A^2 is much smaller than 2 m c^2,

then 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x.

So,

1 + 1/(1 - x) ) ≈ 1 + (1 + x ) ) = 2 +x.

So,

sqrt(2 +x ) ≈ sqrt(2) (1 + x/(4) )

So,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt(2) (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) )

Which again, for small (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), gives a speed of about c * sqrt(2), which is larger than c, which is not possible in the non-relativistic limit. So option B can't be correct.

Option C: v_max = sqrt( (k A^2)/m )

Which is the non-relativistic case. But since the question is relativistic, this is the classical result, so when relativistic effects are considered, this would be less than the actual speed. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Again, when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is small, let's compute.

Let x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ), which is small.

So,

1/(1 +x )^2 ≈ 1 - 2 x + 3 x² - ... 

So,

1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2 x + 3 x² ) ) 

= 2 x - 3 x².

So,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt( 2 x - 3 x² )

= c * sqrt( 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) - 3 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) - ... )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) )

= sqrt( k A^2/m )

Which is the non-relativistic result. So in the limit x is small, option D gives the correct non-relativistic result. That's a good sign.

So, considering all this, option D seems to be the correct expression for v_max.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \) and maximum amplitude \( A \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations. The total energy of the oscillator is conserved and is given by the potential energy at maximum displacement, \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic, and the relativistic kinetic energy is \( E = (\gamma - 1)m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy at maximum displacement and equilibrium, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)m c^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), substituting this into the equation gives:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}},
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2 - 1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Expanding the numerator:

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{2\frac{kA^2}{2m c^2} + \left(\frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

This matches the expression derived in option D. To confirm, we analyze the non-relativistic limit (\( kA^2 \ll 2m c^2 \)):

1. **Option A**: In the non-relativistic limit, this expression diverges from the expected result, as it suggests a speed significantly exceeding \( c \), which is unphysical.
2. **Option B**: Similarly, this option also suggests a speed exceeding \( c \) in the non-relativistic limit, making it incorrect.
3. **Option C**: This is the classical result for the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator, valid only in the non-relativistic limit. However, the question explicitly involves relativistic effects, so this is incorrect.
4. **Option D**: In the non-relativistic limit, this reduces to the classical result \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), confirming its correctness.

Thus, the correct expression for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by option D.
