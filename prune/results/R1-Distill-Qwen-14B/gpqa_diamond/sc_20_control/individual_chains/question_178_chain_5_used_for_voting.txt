Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. I remember that γ matrices are involved in the Dirac equation. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to recall the concepts.

I think the first thing to do is find the mass dimension of each field and the coupling κ. Because once I have that, I can figure out the dimension of the Lagrangian, and then determine the dimension of κ.

Let me start by recalling the mass dimensions of basic fields. In four spacetime dimensions (since the question mentions renormalizability, which relates to the dimensionality), fermions like ψ have a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the action is dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. Wait, no, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4, because when you integrate it over four dimensions, the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, no, wait. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4. Because the integral is over four dimensions of spacetime, so each term in the Lagrangian (the integrand) must have dimension [mass]^4 to make the whole action dimensionless. So each term in L must have mass dimension 4.

So for a term like L = A ψ̄ ψ, the dimension would be [A] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] = 4. Since [ψ] is 3/2, [ψ̄] is the same as [ψ], so 3/2 each. So [A] = 4 - 3/2 -3/2 = 4 -3 =1. So A has dimension 1.

But in our problem, the term is more complicated: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me break it down. Let's list each component's dimension.

First, the fermion fields ψ and ψ̄. Each has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would have a dimension of 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, but wait, σ is a tensor made from the gamma matrices. The σ_{μν} is constructed from the commutator of gamma matrices, but since the gamma matrices are dimensionless (they are just matrices), the σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the ψ̄ σ ψ part is (3/2) * 2, since ψ̄ and ψ each contribute 3/2. So 3/2 * 2 =3.

Then we have F^{mu nu}, which is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Or perhaps for a non-Abelian field, but let's assume it's Abelian for now. The field strength F is the derivative of the gauge field A. So F_{μν} = ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. Each A has dimension 1. Because the gauge field term in the Lagrangian is like F^2, which has dimension 4. So F has dimension 2 (since F^2 is (mass)^4, so F is (mass)^2).

Wait, more precisely: each term in the field strength F is a derivative of A. The derivative ∂_mu has dimension 1. So F_{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each A has dimension 1, so ∂μ Aν has dimension 2. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, let me confirm. The Lagrangian for electromagnetism is like F^2, which has dimension 4. Since F is antisymmetric and each F_{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each F has dimension 2, because each term is ∂ (dim 1) times A (dim 1), so F is 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) multiplied by F^{μν}.

The dimensions would be [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F^{μν}] = [κ] +3 +2 = [κ] +5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would correspond to options A or C.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the coupling constant's mass dimension. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in four dimensions, a renormalizable interaction must have coupling constants with positive mass dimension. Because when you have a term with more fields, the coupling's dimension must be such that when multiplied by the fields, the total dimension doesn't exceed four.

Wait, the general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian with n fields must have a coupling of dimension d = 4 - (sum of field dimensions). So for each term, the coupling's dimension plus the sum of the fields' dimensions must equal 4.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F^{μν}. Let's count the number of fields: ψ̄, ψ, F. So three fields. Wait, no, F is F^{μν}, which is a tensor, but I think it's a single field. So total of three fields.

Each field's dimension: ψ̄ and ψ are 3/2 each, F is 2. So sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2 =5? Wait, no. Wait, the three fields are ψ̄, ψ, and F.

Wait, ψ̄ σ ψ is two ψ's, each 3/2, and F is 2. So the sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2=3 +2=5. So the coupling κ must have dimension 4 -5= -1.

Which matches what I found before.

But for renormalizability, the coupling must have a positive mass dimension. Because in the Feynman diagrams, each interaction vertex contributes factors of the coupling. But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the degree of divergence of a Feynman diagram is given by D = d - (L + (E/2)*n), where d is the spacetime dimension (4), L is the number of loops, E is the number of lines, and n the number of vertices. But perhaps a better approach is to use the superficial degree of divergence, which is D = 4L - (E - V), where E is the number of propagators, V the number of vertices. Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for superficial degree of divergence. Oh, right: D = 4 - (number of fields)* (mass dimension of each field) summed up, but that's probably not the exact approach.

Alternatively, for a renormalizable theory, all terms in the Lagrangian must have a coupling with positive mass dimension. Because in higher loops, if the coupling has negative dimension, you might get divergences that can't be absorbed by the existing counterterms.

Wait, wait. The mass dimension of the coupling determines the scaling. For a renormalizable theory, the coupling must have a dimension such that the term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So each coupling's dimension is 4 - sum of the fields' dimensions in that term.

If the coupling's dimension is positive, that's okay for renormalizability. Negative dimensions imply that the term is non-renormalizable, as higher order terms would require higher and higher energy scales, making the theory effective rather than fundamental.

So in our case, κ has dimension -1. That's negative. So the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Because the coupling has negative mass dimension, which implies that the interaction becomes stronger at lower energies, which is unphysical. So such a theory would require an infinite number of counterterms, making it non-renormalizable.

Wait, but another way to think: the interaction term is of the form ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let's count the number of fields in the term: ψ̄ (1), ψ (1), F (1). So three fields. In four dimensions, for a term to be renormalizable, the number of fields in each interaction term must be ≤4. Because each field contributes its dimension, and the coupling must have positive dimension. Let me see.

The general rule is that for a term with n fields, the coupling must have dimension [κ] = 4 - sum_{fields} [field].

If [κ] > 0, the term is renormalizable. So in our case, sum of fields is 3/2 (ψ̄) + 3/2 (ψ) + 2 (F) = 3/2 *2 +2=3+2=5. So [κ] =4-5= -1, which is negative. So the term is non-renormalizable.

So the theory (which is just this interaction term here) is non-renormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension.

Putting it all together: κ has mass dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: dim -1, theory renormalizable → incorrect.

Option B: dim 1, theory ren → nope.

Option C: dim -1, theory not ren → correct.

Option D: dim 1, not ren → no.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass Dimensions of Fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The fermion fields $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$ each have mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$, as it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$ (dimension $1$) via derivatives.

### Step 2: Mass Dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension $4$ (since the Lagrangian density has mass dimension $4$). Breaking it down:
- $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension $3$ (from $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$, each with dimension $\frac{3}{2}$).
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$.
- The coupling $\kappa$ contributes an additional dimension.

Thus:
\[
[\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have positive mass dimensions. In this case, $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This implies the interaction term is non-renormalizable, as it requires an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
