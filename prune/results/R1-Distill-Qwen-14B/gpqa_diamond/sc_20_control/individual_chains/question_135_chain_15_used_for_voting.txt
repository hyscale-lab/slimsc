Okay, so I have this question about particle physics. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄ (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between particles. So the boson X is interacting with some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which fermion pairs it can decay into.

First, I think I should figure out which fermions are involved in the interaction. The term in the Lagrangian has ψ_f, which probably stands for fermion fields. The term is λ f f̄ X ψ_f. Wait, wait, maybe I should parse this more carefully. The interaction term is -λff̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, the interaction is between the field f, another f̄ (maybe the same fermion?), and X. Alternatively, perhaps f and ψ_f are different fermions. That's a bit unclear, but perhaps the exact structure isn't crucial for determining the decay modes. Maybe it's more about the possible fermions X can decay into based on mass and coupling.

Wait, the boson X is a boson, so it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decays would be into any fermions where the sum of the fermion masses is less than the mass of X. But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So the maximum possible mass for a single fermion would be 3 GeV, because each fermion in the pair would be up to half of that.

Wait, but what fermions are available? Let's think about the known fermions. Quarks come in different flavors with varying masses. The top quark is the heaviest, but it's way beyond 3 GeV. Let me think: the up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks, and the leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos.

But wait, the X is a boson, so for it to decay into a fermion and antifermion pair, the fermion's mass must be less than or equal to half of X's mass, because each would take up to 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Wait, no. Wait, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to half the X mass, because in the rest frame of X, the fermion and antifermion would each have some energy. The minimum energy each needs is their rest mass energy. So for the decay to be possible kinematically, each fermion's mass must be <= (mass of X)/2. Because if the fermion's mass is more than that, even in the best case (where all the energy goes into their rest mass, which isn't possible because of momentum), the decay is impossible.

Wait, actually, in particle decays, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for X → f f̄, the sum of the f and f̄'s rest masses must be less than or equal to X's mass. But since f and f̄ are the same particle and antiparticle, each has the same rest mass. So 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ m_X / 2.

So for X with mass 6 GeV, each fermion must have mass ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses under 3 GeV?

Let's list the known fermions and their masses (approximate):

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1777 MeV (about 1.777 GeV)
- Neutrinos: ~very small, negligible.

Quarks:
Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
Strange (s): ~95 MeV
Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV (1500 MeV)
Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait, the masses I'm recalling are approximate and might vary based on source. For example, the charm quark is about 1.2-1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5-5 GeV, and top about 173 GeV.

So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Looking at the quarks:

u: 2.2 MeV → yes
d: 4.7 MeV → yes
s: 95 MeV → yes
c: ~1.5 GeV → yes
b: ~4.7 GeV → no, because 4.7 > 3 GeV.
t: way too heavy, so no.

Leptons:

e: 0.511 MeV → yes
μ: 105 MeV → yes
τ: 1.777 GeV → 1.777 < 3 → yes.

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are:

u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ, and their corresponding antiparticles.

Wait, but wait: the Lagrangian given might restrict which fermions are involved. So the interaction term is -λ f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps this is a Yukawa interaction. Typically, Yukawa terms are like L = g ψ ψ φ, where φ is a scalar (like the Higgs), and ψ are fermions. So in this case, X must be a scalar field (since it's a boson), and the interaction is between X and two fermions ψ_f and f. So the fermion f and ψ_f must be the same type, or different? Or perhaps X is a mediator for a four-Fermi interaction or something else. Hmm, perhaps that's more detailed than needed for this question.

But regardless, the problem is about possible decay channels, which depends on the fermion masses and whether the coupling is allowed.

Wait, but the question is about kinematically allowed decays. So kinematics is solely based on mass and energy, not on whether the interaction term exists. So whether a decay is possible depends on whether the energy is sufficient and whether the fermions are present in the theory.

So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where each fermion's mass is ≤ 3 GeV. So from the list, the fermions allowed are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Now, the possible decay channels would be:

Each decay would be into a pair: like e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but wait, in the options, some of the decay channels include b and t, but we know their masses are too high. Let's check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, b quark is ~4.7 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So their mass is 4.7 GeV each. So 2*4.7 =9.4 GeV, which is way more than X's mass (6 GeV). So the decay X → b bbar is not kinematically allowed.

So option A includes b bbar, which is impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, c is about 1.5 GeV, which is allowed. So each c is 1.5 GeV; 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6 GeV. So c cbar is allowed. Similarly for all others in this option.

But wait, the mass of tau is about 1.777 GeV. That's less than 3 GeV, so tau+ tau- is allowed.

So option B includes: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All these fermions are allowed. So their mass pairs are within the X mass.

But wait, the interaction must also allow the decay. If the Lagrangian only couples X to certain fermions, then those decays wouldn't happen. But the question is about kinematics, not about the interaction.

Wait, no, wait. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So it's about whether the decay is possible given the coupling exists. So if X doesn't couple to a particular fermion, that decay isn't possible, regardless of kinematics.

Wait, but the question gives the interaction as L = -λ f f̄ X ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps the interaction is between X and two different fermions, or same? Maybe it's a typo and should be f and f̄, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X couples to a pair of fermions, like a Yukawa coupling.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is between X and a single fermion type. Because in the Lagrangian term, it's -λ f f̄ X ψ_f. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps it should be -λ ψ_f f̄ X ψ_f. But that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-fermion interaction, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps f and ψ_f are different fermions, and X couples to a pair of them.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the possible decays based on the mass. So regardless of the interaction, the possible decay products are the fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the possible decay channels are any fermion pair where each fermion is <=3 GeV in mass. So the allowed fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Thus, the possible decay modes are:

X → e+ e-
X → μ+ μ-
X → τ+ τ-
X → u ū
X → d d̄
X → s s̄
X → c c̄

So looking at the options, option B includes all these except for the top and bottom. Let me check each option again.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So all these fermions are allowed. So option B is a possible answer.

Option C includes t t̄, which is impossible because t is way too heavy (173 GeV each). So C is out.

Option D: includes b bbar, which is impossible. So D is out.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D includes b and others. So D is incorrect.

So the correct options are B, but let me double-check.

Wait, what about the tau? Its mass is about 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so X can decay into tau+ tau-. So option B includes that, which is correct.

So the allowed decays are all fermion pairs where each fermion has mass ≤3 GeV. So the options that include only these are possible.

So the correct answer is option B.

The question involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided in the Lagrangian, \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), suggests that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. However, the kinematics of the decay depends only on the fermion masses and the mass of \( X \), not explicitly on the interaction term.

For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the fermion-antifermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). Since \( X \) has a mass of 6 GeV, the maximum mass of a single fermion is \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (as \( 2m_f \leq m_X \)).

The known fermion masses are approximately:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1777 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 95 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \).

From this, the fermions with masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, the possible decay channels of \( X \) are:
- \( X \to e^+ e^- \),
- \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \),
- \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \),
- \( X \to u \bar{u} \),
- \( X \to d \bar{d} \),
- \( X \to s \bar{s} \),
- \( X \to c \bar{c} \).

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark (\( b \)) has a mass of \( 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed as the fermion masses are \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark (\( t \)) has a mass of \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeding \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. Hence, this option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels of \( X \) based on the fermion masses.

Answer: B
