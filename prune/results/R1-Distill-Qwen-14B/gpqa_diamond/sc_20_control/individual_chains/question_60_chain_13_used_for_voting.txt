Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. Right, so from the perspective of an observer on Earth, the astronaut's time would be moving slower, but from the astronaut's own perspective, the trip would take less time.

Wait, the question is about how long the astronaut experiences the trip. So I need to calculate the proper time, which is the time measured in the moving frame (the spacecraft) because that's the astronaut's perspective.

The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really close to c. I think I should use the time dilation formula or maybe the Lorentz factor.

The formula for time dilation is T' = T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where T is the time measured by the Earth observer (dilated time), and T' is the proper time experienced by the astronaut. But wait, no, I think I might have that backwards. Because the astronaut's clock runs slower from Earth's perspective, so for the astronaut, less time passes.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: Proper time is the shortest time measured between two events (in this case, departure and arrival) and it's measured in the frame where those two events occur at the same place. Since the astronaut is on the spacecraft, they are in the same frame, so their own time is the proper time.

So the Earth observer would see the spaceship moving, so the distance is contracted from their perspective. Wait, no, the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is fixed in Earth's frame, but from the spaceship's frame, Earth is approaching at high speed, so the distance is contracted. So the spaceship's crew would measure a shorter distance.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh wait, wait. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy, but the actual distance isn't given. Hmm, perhaps this is a trick question. Wait, the problem is phrased as a question about how long the astronaut experiences the trip, which depends on the spaceship's speed and the distance, but since distance isn't given, maybe the point is about whether the astronaut can live long enough.

Wait, the average lifetime is 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22 years old. So from Earth's frame, the trip would take much longer, but from the astronaut's frame, it's shorter. But perhaps the trip duration is so long in Earth's frame that the astronaut would die before arriving, but in the spaceship's frame, the time is short enough that the astronaut survives.

Wait, but the question is from the astronaut's perspective. So we need to calculate the proper time, which is the time they experience, and see if it's less than their lifespan.

Wait! The question says: "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?" So the astronaut is 22, and we need to find the time they experience, which is the proper time.

So, first, I need to find the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify it. Oh wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is such that, from the Earth's frame, the time would be longer, but from the astronaut's perspective, it's shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a straightforward time dilation question with a given distance, but the distance isn't provided. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me reread the problem.

The civilization is in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They're sending a spacecraft to Earth. The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987*c. The astronaut is 22 years old. We need to find the time experienced by the astronaut. The options are A-D, with A being that the astronaut dies before reaching.

But without the distance, how can I compute the time? Maybe I'm supposed to assume the distance is the same as the current distance between Earth and the LMC? Or perhaps the problem is more about whether the proper time is under 150 years (the average lifespan) but I don't know the distance.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to be a trick. Since the speed is so close to c, the time for the astronaut will be very short compared to Earth's frame. But without the distance, can I compute this? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the distance is the same as the LMC's distance from Earth as observed in Earth's frame. Let me check: the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. So, if the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, the time from Earth's frame would be (distance)/(speed) = 160,000 ly / 0.99999987c.

But wait, 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year. So time in Earth frame is approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1/0.99999987) ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ about 160,000.00208 years.

But from the astronaut's frame, the time is shorter. The astronaut would experience less time due to time dilation.

The time experienced by the astronaut T' is T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since v is so close to c, gamma is very large. Let me compute it.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² ≈ (1 - 2*(1 - 0.99999987)) c²? Or wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1 - v²/c².

v = 0.99999987 c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = c² * (0.99999974) approximately, but more accurately:

Let me compute (0.99999987)^2:

0.99999987 * 0.99999987 = ?

Well, (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x², where x=0.00000013.

So 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 0.99999974 + negligible.

So, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So gamma = 1 / (5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78.

So, T' = T / gamma.

Wait, no, time dilation is T = gamma * T', where T is the time in Earth's frame (dilated), and T' is the proper time.

So from Earth's frame, the time is T = distance/speed. Assuming the distance is 160,000 ly, and speed is 0.99999987c, which is about 0.99999987 ly/year.

So T ≈ 160,000 ly / 0.99999987 ly/year ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.0021 years.

But let's compute it more accurately. 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 160,000*(1 + 0.00000013) ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013 = 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.02 years.

So T is approximately 160,000 years as observed from Earth.

But the astronaut's proper time is T' = T / gamma.

Gamma is 1960.78.

So T' = 160,000.02 / 1960.78 ≈ let's compute that.

160,000 / 1960.78 = approximately 81.4 years.

Wait, 1960 * 81 is 1960*80=156,800; 1960*1=1960: total 158,760. Hmm, maybe I should do it more precisely.

Wait, 1960.78 * 80 = 156,862.4.

1960.78 * 81 = 156,862.4 + 1960.78 ≈ 158,823.18.

1960.78 * 81.4 = let's compute 81 * 1960.78 = 158,823.18, plus 0.4 * 1960.78 = 784.312. So total 159,607.492.

Wait, but T is 160,000, so 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ 81.4 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years.

The astronaut is 22 years old, so 81 years later would be 103 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so the astronaut would live long enough.

But wait, the options are:

A) Die before reaching

B)72

C)81

D)77

So option C is 81, which matches the calculation. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the time experienced by the astronaut is T' = distance traveled / speed in their frame. Because in their frame, Earth is approaching at v, and the distance is contracted.

Wait, in the astronaut's frame, the distance between Earth and LMC is contracted by a factor of gamma. So proper distance (Earth's frame) is L = 160,000 ly. The contracted length is L' = L / gamma.

So L' = 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ approximately 81.4 ly.

Then the time is L' / v.

v is 0.99999987 c, which is 0.99999987 ly/year.

So T' = L' / v = (81.4 ly) / (0.99999987 ly/year) ≈ 81.4 / 1 = 81.4 years. So same as before.

So from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes about 81 years. So option C is correct.

But wait, the astronaut is 22. 81 years later would be 103, which is under the average lifespan of 150. So the astronaut would survive. So the answer is option C, 81 years.

But wait, the question says "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?" So the time is T' = 81 years.

So the correct answer is C)81 years.

To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey, we need to calculate the proper time, which is the time measured in the astronaut's frame of reference. Due to Einstein's theory of relativity, time dilation and length contraction occur at such high speeds. The spacecraft travels at a velocity \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years (as observed in Earth's frame).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( T \)):**
   The time taken for the journey as observed from Earth is:
   \[
   T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor is given by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \), we find:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026, \quad \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}, \quad \gamma \approx \frac{1}{5.1 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1960.78.
   \]

3. **Proper Time Experienced by the Astronaut (\( T' \)):**
   The proper time is related to the dilated time by:
   \[
   T' = \frac{T}{\gamma}.
   \]
   Substituting \( T \approx 160,000 \, \text{years} \) and \( \gamma \approx 1960.78 \):
   \[
   T' \approx \frac{160,000}{1960.78} \approx 81.4 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Verification Using Length Contraction:**
   In the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted by a factor of \( \gamma \):
   \[
   L' = \frac{L}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{1960.78} \approx 81.4 \, \text{ly}.
   \]
   The time experienced by the astronaut is then:
   \[
   T' = \frac{L'}{v} = \frac{81.4 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 81.4 \, \text{years}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old, they will be 103 years old upon arrival, which is within their average lifespan of 150 years. Therefore, the correct answer is:

So, if the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, the time from Earth's frame would be (distance)/(speed) = 160,000 ly / 0.99999987c.

But wait, 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year. So time in Earth frame is approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1/0.99999987) ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ about 160,000.00208 years.

But from the astronaut's frame, the time is shorter. The astronaut would experience less time due to time dilation.

The time experienced by the astronaut T' is T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since v is so close to c, gamma is very large. Let me compute it.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² ≈ (1 - 2*(1 - 0.99999987)) c²? Or wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1 - v²/c².

v = 0.99999987 c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = c² * (0.99999974) approximately, but more accurately:

Let me compute (0.99999987)^2:

0.99999987 * 0.99999987 = ?

Well, (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x², where x=0.00000013.

So 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 0.99999974 + negligible.

So, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So gamma = 1 / (5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78.

So, T' = T / gamma.

Wait, no, time dilation is T = gamma * T', where T is the time in Earth's frame (dilated), and T' is the proper time.

So from Earth's frame, the time is T = distance/speed. Assuming the distance is 160,000 ly, and speed is 0.99999987c, which is about 0.99999987 ly/year.

So T ≈ 160,000 ly / 0.99999987 ly/year ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.0021 years.

But let's compute it more accurately. 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 160,000*(1 + 0.00000013) ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013 = 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.02 years.

So T is approximately 160,000 years as observed from Earth.

But the astronaut's proper time is T' = T / gamma.

Gamma is 1960.78.

So T' = 160,000.02 / 1960.78 ≈ let's compute that.

160,000 / 1960.78 = approximately 81.4 years.

Wait, 1960 * 81 is 1960*80=156,800; 1960*1=1960: total 158,760. Hmm, maybe I should do it more precisely.

Wait, 1960.78 * 80 = 156,862.4.

1960.78 * 81 = 156,862.4 + 1960.78 ≈ 158,823.18.

1960.78 * 81.4 = let's compute 81 * 1960.78 = 158,823.18, plus 0.4 * 1960.78 = 784.312. So total 159,607.492.

Wait, but T is 160,000, so 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ 81.4 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years.

The astronaut is 22 years old, so 81 years later would be 103 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so the astronaut would live long enough.

But wait, the options are:

A) Die before reaching

B)72

C)81

D)77

So option C is 81, which matches the calculation. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the time experienced by the astronaut is T' = distance traveled / speed in their frame. Because in their frame, Earth is approaching at v, and the distance is contracted.

Wait, in the astronaut's frame, the distance between Earth and LMC is contracted by a factor of gamma. So proper distance (Earth's frame) is L = 160,000 ly. The contracted length is L' = L / gamma.

So L' = 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ approximately 81.4 ly.

Then the time is L' / v.

v is 0.99999987 c, which is 0.99999987 ly/year.

So T' = L' / v = (81.4 ly) / (0.99999987 ly/year) ≈ 81.4 / 1 = 81.4 years. So same as before.

So from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes about 81 years. So option C is correct.

But wait, the astronaut is 22. 81 years later would be 103, which is under the average lifespan of 150. So the astronaut would survive. So the answer is option C, 81 years.

But wait, the question says "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?" So the time is T' = 81 years.

So the correct answer is C)81 years.
