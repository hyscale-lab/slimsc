Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where ε is an energy constant, n is a unit vector, and σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. 

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each of which are 2x2 matrices. The dot product σ · n would then be a combination of these three matrices multiplied by the respective components of n, which is a unit vector, so n = (nx, ny, nz), and nx² + ny² + nz² = 1. 

Wait, right. The operator σ · n would be nxσx + nyσy + nzσz. And since H is this multiplied by ε, H = ε (nxσx + nyσy + nzσz).

I need to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix like this, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler approach because Pauli matrices have some known properties.

Wait, I think that any spin operator in the direction of n would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 when multiplied by the Pauli matrices. But wait, here the Hamiltonian is ε times that operator. Oh wait, wait, no—because the Pauli matrices are usually multiplied by ħ/2 in the spin operator S = (ħ/2) σ, but in this case, the Hamiltonian is ε times σ · n. So let me think.

Wait, let's consider the general case. If H is proportional to σ · n, then the eigenvalues would be the proportional factors multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n. Because σ · n is a combination of the Pauli matrices, and each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when you have a linear combination like aσx + bσy + cσz, what are the eigenvalues of that matrix?

Wait, another approach: the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so H is Hermitian as well. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 Hermitian matrix can be found from its trace and determinant. The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, and the determinant is their product.

But let me think differently. The operator σ · n is a sum of the Pauli matrices scaled by the components of n. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you take a linear combination, the eigenvalues would be the square roots of the sum of squares of the coefficients, but wait, that's not exactly right. Wait, no—actually, for a spin-1/2 system, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1. Because σ · n is a unit vector multiplied by the Pauli matrices, and the magnitude of σ · n is √(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) which is 1 since n is a unit vector. So the eigenvalues would be ±1.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The operator σ · n is a matrix, and its eigenvalues are determined by applying it to any spinor. The maximum eigenvalue of σ · n would be 1, and the minimum would be -1. Because σ · n is a Hermitian matrix with trace 0 (since each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and their sum would have zero trace as well), so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues must be +1 and -1.

So if σ · n has eigenvalues +1 and -1, then H = ε (σ · n) would have eigenvalues ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), so eigenvalues +ε and -ε.

Wait a second, but wait—another thought. Because the Pauli matrices are each scaled by ε in the Hamiltonian. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the factors. So if H is ε times σ · n, then each eigenvalue is multiplied by ε. So if σ ·n has eigenvalues ±1, H has eigenvalues ±ε.

So looking at the options, option B says +ε, -ε. So that would be the answer. 

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the Pauli matrices are multiplied by other constants. Like, the spin operator is (σ · n) times ħ/2. So if H were equal to that, then the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2. But in this problem, H is ε times σ · n, without the ħ/2 factor. So the eigenvalues are ±ε.

So looking at the options:

A) ±1 → No, because the eigenvalues are scaled by ε.

B) ±ε → Yes.

C) ± ε ħ/2 → No, that would be if H had (σ ·n) multiplied by (ε ħ/2), but it's not the case here.

D) ± ħ/2 → No, that would be if ε were 1 and the Hamiltonian were just the spin operator.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are known to be \( \pm 1 \) because \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues determined by the components of \( \vec{n} \). Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are bounded by the magnitude of \( \vec{n} \), which is 1.

When \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is scaled by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \). This follows because the eigenvalues of a scalar multiple of an operator are the scalar multiplied by the eigenvalues of the operator itself.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \( \pm 1 \):** Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \), not \( \pm 1 \).
- **B) \( \pm \varepsilon \):** Correct, as shown by the scaling of the eigenvalues.
- **C) \( \pm \varepsilon \hbar/2 \):** Incorrect, as there is no factor of \( \hbar/2 \) in the Hamiltonian.
- **D) \( \pm \hbar/2 \):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to the eigenvalues of the spin operator \( \vec{S} = (\hbar/2) \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), which is not the case here.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).
