Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

Alright, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think the mass affects the ratio of silicon atoms directly. The question is about elemental abundances determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method, but I don't remember exactly how that works. Maybe it's not necessary for this problem.

The given data are the elemental abundances as [X/Y] values. I remember that [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_Sun. Or wait, maybe it's [X/Y] = log(nX/nY / (nX_sun/nY_sun)). So it's a logarithmic scale. Oh right, the formula is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX_sun/nY_sun). Which simplifies to log10( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) ), because log(a/b) = log a - log b. So [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the star's X/Y ratio to the solar X/Y ratio.

We're given:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So for Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than solar by a factor of 10^0.3.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So for Star_2, the ratio of Mg to Si is higher than solar by 10^0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. H is hydrogen. So Fe abundance relative to H is the same as solar.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Mg abundance relative to H is same as solar.

The solar photosphere composition is given:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the way it's written is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The problem states: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH)=7−12=−5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So for the Sun, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). Wait, but wait. The Sun's [Fe/H] would be zero by definition if we're using the solar value as the reference. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning the Fe abundance relative to H is same as the Sun. So nFe_1 /nH_1 = same as nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but in the problem, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, which I think implies that the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, but let me write down the given data more clearly.

Given:

Star 1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun)

Star 2:
- [Mg/Si]_2= 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2)= log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3
- [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2)= log(nMg_sun/nH_sun)

Wait, no, wait. The [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun). So [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) )

So for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log( (nFe1/nH1)/(nFe_sun/nH_sun) )=0 → (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun).

Same for Star 2: [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

[ Mg/H ]_2=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun).

Our goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need (nSi1/nSi2) or (nSi1)/(nSi2) ?

Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So nSi1/nSi2.

So, to find nSi1 / nSi2, we can express each in terms of other elements.

Let me try expressing nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of other elements.

Starting with Star 1:

From [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

But for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Substituting nFe1 from above:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun *10^0.3) * nFe1.

nFe1 is (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

So,

nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun * 10^0.3) * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1 )

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun * 10^0.3) / nH_sun * nH1 )

Similarly, for Star 2:

From [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

From [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi2 = (nMg2 * nSi_sun) ) / (nMg_sun *10^0.3 )

Substituting nMg2:

nSi2 = ( (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 * nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun *10^0.3 )

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH2 / (10^0.3 )

So, now we have expressions for nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH1 and nH2, and the solar values.

Wait, but we need nSi1/nSi2. So let's compute that.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3) / nH_sun * nH1.

nSi2 = (nSi_sun *1 ) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) *nH2.

So, nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1 ] / [ (nSi_sun / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )) *nH2 ] 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (10^0.3 * nH1) ] / [ (1/(10^0.3)) * nH2 ) ]

Which is (10^0.3 / (1/10^0.3)) ) * (nH1 /nH2 )

= (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) * (nH1/nH2 )

= 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 )

So, nSi1/nSi2 = 10^0.6 * (nH1 /nH2 )

Wait, but I don't know nH1 and nH2. How can I find the ratio of H in the two stars? Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars? No, that can't be right because the stars have different masses. Or maybe the number of H is determined by the star's mass and composition. But I don't think we can assume that.

Wait, but perhaps we can find the hydrogen abundance ratio using other means.

Wait, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0. So nFe1/nH1 = same as solar.

For Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = same as solar.

Wait, but I don't think that directly tells us about nH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH1 and nH2 in terms of the solar abundances.

Wait, considering that the total number density of all elements in a star's photosphere is given by the sum of all species, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the overall metallicity (total heavy elements) is the same as the Sun, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which implies that the iron abundance is the same as the Sun. But what about other elements? Like Mg and Si?

Wait, in Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3, so Si is more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun. But [Fe/H]=0 means the Fe is same as Sun, but H is also the same as Sun? Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) divided by solar. So if [Fe/H]=0, nFe/nH = solar.

So for Star_1, nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

But if [Fe/H]=0, that doesn't necessarily say anything about the overall H abundance. Because nH1 could be different. So, perhaps nH1 is the same as the Sun, but why would that be?

Wait, another approach: the ratio of H in the two stars can be determined from the other given abundances. Let me think.

Wait, in Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1=0, the ratio of Fe to H is the same as the Sun. So the number of Fe atoms per H atom in Star_1 is same as Sun. Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0, so Mg per H is same as Sun.

But how does that help us with H in the stars? Well, maybe we can express the H in each star in terms of other elements.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H doesn't matter because in the expression for nSi1/nSi2, the H terms cancel out. Wait, in the expression I derived earlier:

nSi1/nSi2 = 10^0.6 * (nH1 / nH2 )

So, unless I can find nH1/nH2, I can't get the ratio.

Wait, maybe I can find nH1 and nH2 in terms of other elements.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]=0 → (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

But without knowing the total H, I can't find nH1.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the H abundance can be found from the other given [X/H] values. But in Star 1, only [Fe/H] is given as 0, and Star 2, [Mg/H] is given as 0. So perhaps we need to find another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the overall metallicity (total heavy elements) is the same as the Sun for both stars. But I'm not sure. That would require [X/H] for all X being 0, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH1 and nH2 using other elements. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Let's express everything in terms of [X/H] of each star and see if that helps.

For Star 1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3 → nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3 *nFe1.

Substituting nFe1:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3 * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1 )

Simplify: nSi1 = (nSi_sun * 10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1.

Similarly, for Star 2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2.

So,

(nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

Divide both sides by (nMg_sun):

(1/nH_sun) *nH2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Multiply both sides by nH_sun *nSi_sun:

nH2 *nSi_sun = nH_sun *10^0.3 *nSi2.

So,

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )

Now, let's compute the ratio nSi1/nSi2.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1.

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1 ] / [ (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ) ]

= [ (10^0.3 *nH1 ) / (nH2) ) ] * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) /nH_sun )

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Denominator: (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So, when you take numerator divided by denominator, it's:

(numerator) * (denominator)^-1.

So,

= [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1 ) ] * [ (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nH2 *nSi_sun) ) ]

Simplify:

nSi_sun cancels out.

nH_sun cancels.

So,

= (10^0.3 * nH1 ) * (10^0.3 ) / nH2 )

= 10^(0.3 + 0.3) * (nH1 /nH2 )

=10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 )

Hmm, same as before. So we're back to the same point.

So I need to find nH1/nH2.

How?

Well, perhaps I can use other elements. Let's think about another element in each star to express H.

In Star 1, we have [Fe/H]=0. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun ) *nH1.

But without knowing nH1, can I connect H to another element?

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in each star, the sum of all elements (including H) remains the same as the Sun's.

Wait, but that's assuming that the star has the same overall composition as the Sun, which is not the case. For example, if Star_1 has a higher [Si/Fe], then it has more Si relative to Fe, but what about H?

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the hydrogen to be the same in both stars because the problem doesn't provide [H/Fe] or [H/Mg], but that's a big assumption.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen abundance (nH) is the same in both stars. That would make the ratio nH1/nH2 =1. But I don't know if that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH1 and nH2 from the given data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

But without knowing the total number of elements, I can't find nH1. Unless I model the star as having the same number of atoms as the Sun. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of H in the two stars using the Mg and other elements.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. From earlier, nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

And nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

So,

(nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

Dividing both sides by nMg_sun,

(1/nH_sun) *nH2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Which rearranges to:

nH2 = (nH_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

But again, I don't know nSi2 yet.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should make an assumption that nH1 =nH2, which would make the ratio of H equal to 1, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

If I assume that nH1/nH2 =1, then the ratio nSi1/nSi2 would be 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.9, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH1 and nH2 through another approach.

Wait, another approach: Let's express everything in terms of [X/H] of each star.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3 *nFe1.

Substituting nFe1,

nSi1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1 ) 

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3) /nH_sun * nH1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2.

So,

(nMg_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun,

(1/nH_sun ) *nH2 = (1/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Multiply both sides by nH_sun *nSi_sun:

nH2 *nSi_sun = nH_sun *10^0.3 *nSi2.

So,

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

Now, let's compute the ratio nSi1/nSi2.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1.

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1 ] / [ (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (10^0.3 *nH1) / (nH2) ) ] * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) /nH_sun )

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Denominator is (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So, the ratio is numerator multiplied by reciprocal of denominator.

= (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun *nH1) * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nH2 *nSi_sun) )

Simplify:

nSi_sun cancels.

nH_sun cancels.

10^0.3 *10^0.3 = 10^0.6.

nH1 /nH2.

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 )

Hmm, same as before.

So I'm stuck again unless I can find nH1/nH2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of H in the stars using their masses and the fact that the number of H atoms is proportional to mass and the mean molecular weight.

But wait, that might complicate things because it depends on the star's structure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the number of H atoms is the same in both stars? But that would depend on their masses and compositions.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star is the same as in the Sun. But that's probably incorrect because the stars have different masses.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified by introducing the fact that the ratio of H in the stars can be determined from the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values.

Wait, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, in the Sun, nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5), as we calculated earlier.

So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2 =nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun )

But how can this help us find nH1 and nH2?

Hmm, perhaps if we can find another equation involving nH1 and nH2, we can solve for their ratio.

Wait, but without more data, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the H abundance in both stars is the same as the Sun, i.e., nH1 =nH_sun and nH2 =nH_sun. Then the ratio nH1/nH2 =1.

In that case, nSi1/nSi2 =10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.9, which is option A.

But wait, is it valid to assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars?

Considering that [Fe/H]_1 =0, which implies that the Fe is the same as solar, but if the star has a higher mass, maybe the H content is the same as the Sun. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to make that assumption. Let's think about the options. One of the options is ~3.9, which would correspond to 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has an error, and the correct ratio is 10^0.6, which is 3.98, so the answer would be A.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, earlier, I thought the ratio is 10^0.6 times (nH1/nH2). But if I can find (nH1/nH2) from other data, perhaps it's possible.

Wait, let's think about the mass of the Sun and the stars. The mass of a star is the sum of the masses of all elements. But without knowing the mass fractions, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H ratio is 1.

In that case, the ratio would be ~3.98, which rounds to 3.9 (option A).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the ratio without assuming H is same.

Wait, let's think again.

We have:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1.

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So, nSi1/nSi2 = [ (10^0.3 *nH1) / (nH2) ) ] * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) /nH_sun )

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recompute nSi1/nSi2.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1.

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1 ] / [ (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ) ]

= [ (10^0.3 *nH1 ) / (nH2) ) ] * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) /nH_sun )

Wait, that's because the denominator is (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ), so the reciprocal is (nH_sun *10^0.3 )/(nH2 *nSi_sun ).

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = (10^0.3 *nH1 ) * (10^0.3 *nH_sun ) / (nH2 *nH_sun )

Because,

= [ (10^0.3 *nH1) / (nH2 ) ) ] * [ (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nH2 ) )

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly.

The denominator is (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ), so the reciprocal is (nH_sun *10^0.3 )/(nH2 *nSi_sun ).

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun *nH1 ) * (nH_sun *10^0.3 )/(nH2 *nSi_sun ) )

Now, canceling terms:

nSi_sun cancels.

nH_sun cancels.

So,

= (10^0.3 *10^0.3 ) * (nH1 /nH2 )

= 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 )

So, same as before.

So, without knowing nH1 and nH2, I can't proceed. Therefore, perhaps the only way is to assume that nH1 =nH2, which would make the ratio 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which matches this.

So I think the correct answer is option A.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between the number densities of elements. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Information and Relationships:
1. **Abundance Scales**: The abundance ratios [X/Y] are defined as:
   \[
   [\text{X/Y}] = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_X / n_Y}{n_{X,\odot} / n_{Y,\odot}}\right)
   \]
   where \(n_X\) and \(n_Y\) are the number densities of elements X and Y in the star, and \(n_{X,\odot}\) and \(n_{Y,\odot}\) are the corresponding solar values.

2. **Given Data**:
   - For Star_1:
     - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\), implying:
       \[
       \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Fe1}} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Fe,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3}
       \]
     - \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\), implying:
       \[
       \frac{n_{Fe1}}{n_{H1}} = \frac{n_{Fe,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}}
       \]
   - For Star_2:
     - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\), implying:
       \[
       \frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{Si,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3}
       \]
     - \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), implying:
       \[
       \frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{H2}} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}}
       \]

3. **Solar Values**:
   - From the problem, the solar photospheric composition is:
     \[
     12 + \log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H) = 7.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H) = -4.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_{Fe}/n_H = 10^{-4.5}
     \]
     \[
     12 + \log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H) = 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H) = -5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_{Mg}/n_H = 10^{-5}
     \]

### Derivation of \(n_{Si1}/n_{Si2}\):
1. **For Star_1**:
   Using \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\), we have:
   \[
   n_{Fe1} = \frac{n_{Fe,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H1}
   \]
   Substituting into \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\):
   \[
   n_{Si1} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Fe,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{Fe1}
   \]
   \[
   n_{Si1} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Fe,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{Fe,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H1}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   n_{Si1} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H1}
   \]

2. **For Star_2**:
   Using \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), we have:
   \[
   n_{Mg2} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H2}
   \]
   Substituting into \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\):
   \[
   n_{Si2} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} \cdot 10^{-0.3} \cdot n_{Mg2}
   \]
   \[
   n_{Si2} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} \cdot 10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H2}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   n_{Si2} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot} \cdot 10^{-0.3}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H2}
   \]

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   The ratio \(n_{Si1}/n_{Si2}\) is:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{\frac{n_{Si,\odot} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H1}}{\frac{n_{Mg,\odot} \cdot 10^{-0.3}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H2}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{H1}}{n_{H2}}
   \]

4. **Assumption on Hydrogen Abundance**:
   The problem does not provide explicit information about the hydrogen abundance ratio \(n_{H1}/n_{H2}\). To proceed, we assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, i.e., \(n_{H1}/n_{H2} = 1\). Substituting this:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.6}
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   Using the solar values for silicon and magnesium:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} = \frac{10^{7.5}}{10^{7}} = 10^{0.5}
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{0.5} \cdot 10^{0.6} = 10^{1.1} \approx 12.6
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

Alright, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think the mass affects the ratio of silicon atoms directly. The question is about elemental abundances determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method, but I don't remember exactly how that works. Maybe it's not necessary for this problem.

The given data are the elemental abundances as [X/Y] values. I remember that [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_Sun. Or wait, maybe it's [X/Y] = log(nX/nY / (nX_sun/nY_sun)). So it's a logarithmic scale. Oh right, the formula is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX_sun/nY_sun). Which simplifies to log10( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) ), because log(a/b) = log a - log b. So [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the star's X/Y ratio to the solar X/Y ratio.

We're given:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So for Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than solar by a factor of 10^0.3.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So for Star_2, the ratio of Mg to Si is higher than solar by 10^0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. H is hydrogen. So Fe abundance relative to H is the same as solar.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Mg abundance relative to H is same as solar.

The solar photosphere composition is given:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the way it's written is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The problem states: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH)=7−12=−5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So for the Sun, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). Wait, but wait. The Sun's [Fe/H] would be zero by definition if we're using the solar value as the reference. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning the Fe abundance relative to H is same as the Sun. So nFe_1 /nH_1 = same as nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but in the problem, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, which I think implies that the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, but let me write down the given data more clearly.

Given:

Star 1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun)

Star 2:
- [Mg/Si]_2= 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2)= log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3
- [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2)= log(nMg_sun/nH_sun)

Wait, no, wait. The [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun). So [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) )

So for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log( (nFe1/nH1)/(nFe_sun/nH_sun) )=0 → (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun).

Same for Star 2: [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

[ Mg/H ]_2=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun).

Our goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need (nSi1/nSi2) or (nSi1)/(nSi2) ?

Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So nSi1/nSi2.

So, to find nSi1 / nSi2, we can express each in terms of other elements.

Let me try expressing nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of other elements.

Starting with Star 1:

From [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

But for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Substituting nFe1 from above:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun *10^0.3) * nFe1.

nFe1 is (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

So,

nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun * 10^0.3) * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1 )

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun * 10^0.3) / nH_sun * nH1 )

Similarly, for Star 2:

From [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

From [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi2 = (nMg2 * nSi_sun) ) / (nMg_sun *10^0.3 )

Substituting nMg2:

nSi2 = ( (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 * nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun *10^0.3 )

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH2 / (10^0.3 )

So, now we have expressions for nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH1 and nH2, and the solar values.

Wait, but we need nSi1/nSi2. So let's compute that.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3) / nH_sun * nH1.

nSi2 = (nSi_sun *1 ) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) *nH2.

So, nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1 ] / [ (nSi_sun / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )) *nH2 ] 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (10^0.3 * nH1) ] / [ (1/(10^0.3)) * nH2 ) ]

Which is (10^0.3 / (1/10^0.3)) ) * (nH1 /nH2 )

= (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) * (nH1/nH2 )

= 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 )

So, nSi1/nSi2 = 10^0.6 * (nH1 /nH2 )

Wait, but I don't know nH1 and nH2. How can I find the ratio of H in the two stars? Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars? No, that can't be right because the stars have different masses. Or maybe the number of H is determined by the star's mass and composition. But I don't think we can assume that.

Wait, but perhaps we can find the hydrogen abundance ratio using other means.

Wait, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0. So nFe1/nH1 = same as solar.

For Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = same as solar.

Wait, but I don't think that directly tells us about nH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH1 and nH2 in terms of the solar abundances.

Wait, considering that the total number density of all elements in a star's photosphere is given by the sum of all species, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the overall metallicity (total heavy elements) is the same as the Sun, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which implies that the iron abundance is the same as the Sun. But what about other elements? Like Mg and Si?

Wait, in Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3, so Si is more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun. But [Fe/H]=0 means the Fe is same as Sun, but H is also the same as Sun? Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) divided by solar. So if [Fe/H]=0, nFe/nH = solar.

So for Star_1, nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

But if [Fe/H]=0, that doesn't necessarily say anything about the overall H abundance. Because nH1 could be different. So, perhaps nH1 is the same as the Sun, but why would that be?

Wait, another approach: the ratio of H in the two stars can be determined from the other given abundances. Let me think.

Wait, in Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1=0, the ratio of Fe to H is the same as the Sun. So the number of Fe atoms per H atom in Star_1 is same as Sun. Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0, so Mg per H is same as Sun.

But how does that help us with H in the stars? Well, maybe we can express the H in each star in terms of other elements.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H doesn't matter because in the expression for nSi1/nSi2, the H terms cancel out. Wait, in the expression I derived earlier:

nSi1/nSi2 = 10^0.6 * (nH1 / nH2 )

So, unless I can find nH1/nH2, I can't get the ratio.

Wait, maybe I can find nH1 and nH2 in terms of other elements.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]=0 → (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

But without knowing the total H, I can't find nH1.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the H abundance can be found from the other given [X/H] values. But in Star 1, only [Fe/H] is given as 0, and Star 2, [Mg/H] is given as 0. So perhaps we need to find another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the overall metallicity (total heavy elements) is the same as the Sun for both stars. But I'm not sure. That would require [X/H] for all X being 0, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH1 and nH2 using other elements. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Let's express everything in terms of [X/H] of each star and see if that helps.

For Star 1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3 → nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3 *nFe1.

Substituting nFe1:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3 * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1 )

Simplify: nSi1 = (nSi_sun * 10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1.

Similarly, for Star 2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2.

So,

(nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

Divide both sides by (nMg_sun):

(1/nH_sun) *nH2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Multiply both sides by nH_sun *nSi_sun:

nH2 *nSi_sun = nH_sun *10^0.3 *nSi2.

So,

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )

Now, let's compute the ratio nSi1/nSi2.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1.

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1 ] / [ (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ) ]

= [ (10^0.3 *nH1 ) / (nH2) ) ] * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) /nH_sun )

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Denominator: (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So, when you take numerator divided by denominator, it's:

(numerator) * (denominator)^-1.

So,

= [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1 ) ] * [ (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nH2 *nSi_sun) ) ]

Simplify:

nSi_sun cancels out.

nH_sun cancels.

So,

= (10^0.3 * nH1 ) * (10^0.3 ) / nH2 )

= 10^(0.3 + 0.3) * (nH1 /nH2 )

=10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 )

Hmm, same as before. So we're back to the same point.

So I need to find nH1/nH2.

How?

Well, perhaps I can use other elements. Let's think about another element in each star to express H.

In Star 1, we have [Fe/H]=0. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun ) *nH1.

But without knowing nH1, can I connect H to another element?

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in each star, the sum of all elements (including H) remains the same as the Sun's.

Wait, but that's assuming that the star has the same overall composition as the Sun, which is not the case. For example, if Star_1 has a higher [Si/Fe], then it has more Si relative to Fe, but what about H?

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the hydrogen to be the same in both stars because the problem doesn't provide [H/Fe] or [H/Mg], but that's a big assumption.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen abundance (nH) is the same in both stars. That would make the ratio nH1/nH2 =1. But I don't know if that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH1 and nH2 from the given data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

But without knowing the total number of elements, I can't find nH1. Unless I model the star as having the same number of atoms as the Sun. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of H in the two stars using the Mg and other elements.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. From earlier, nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

And nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

So,

(nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

Dividing both sides by nMg_sun,

(1/nH_sun) *nH2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Which rearranges to:

nH2 = (nH_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

But again, I don't know nSi2 yet.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should make an assumption that nH1 =nH2, which would make the ratio of H equal to 1, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

If I assume that nH1/nH2 =1, then the ratio nSi1/nSi2 would be 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.9, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH1 and nH2 through another approach.

Wait, another approach: Let's express everything in terms of [X/H] of each star.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3 *nFe1.

Substituting nFe1,

nSi1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1 ) 

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3) /nH_sun * nH1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2.

So,

(nMg_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun,

(1/nH_sun ) *nH2 = (1/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Multiply both sides by nH_sun *nSi_sun:

nH2 *nSi_sun = nH_sun *10^0.3 *nSi2.

So,

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

Now, let's compute the ratio nSi1/nSi2.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1.

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun ) *nH1 ] / [ (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (10^0.3 *nH1) / (nH2) ) ] * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) /nH_sun )

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Denominator is (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So, the ratio is numerator multiplied by reciprocal of denominator.

= (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun *nH1) * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nH2 *nSi_sun) )

Simplify:

nSi_sun cancels.

nH_sun cancels.

10^0.3 *10^0.3 = 10^0.6.

nH1 /nH2.

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 )

Hmm, same as before.

So I'm stuck again unless I can find nH1/nH2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of H in the stars using their masses and the fact that the number of H atoms is proportional to mass and the mean molecular weight.

But wait, that might complicate things because it depends on the star's structure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the number of H atoms is the same in both stars? But that would depend on their masses and compositions.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star is the same as in the Sun. But that's probably incorrect because the stars have different masses.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified by introducing the fact that the ratio of H in the stars can be determined from the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values.

Wait, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, in the Sun, nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5), as we calculated earlier.

So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2 =nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun )

But how can this help us find nH1 and nH2?

Hmm, perhaps if we can find another equation involving nH1 and nH2, we can solve for their ratio.

Wait, but without more data, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the H abundance in both stars is the same as the Sun, i.e., nH1 =nH_sun and nH2 =nH_sun. Then the ratio nH1/nH2 =1.

In that case, nSi1/nSi2 =10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.9, which is option A.

But wait, is it valid to assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars?

Considering that [Fe/H]_1 =0, which implies that the Fe is the same as solar, but if the star has a higher mass, maybe the H content is the same as the Sun. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to make that assumption. Let's think about the options. One of the options is ~3.9, which would correspond to 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has an error, and the correct ratio is 10^0.6, which is 3.98, so the answer would be A.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, earlier, I thought the ratio is 10^0.6 times (nH1/nH2). But if I can find (nH1/nH2) from other data, perhaps it's possible.

Wait, let's think about the mass of the Sun and the stars. The mass of a star is the sum of the masses of all elements. But without knowing the mass fractions, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H ratio is 1.

In that case, the ratio would be ~3.98, which rounds to 3.9 (option A).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the ratio without assuming H is same.

Wait, let's think again.

We have:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1.

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So, nSi1/nSi2 = [ (10^0.3 *nH1) / (nH2) ) ] * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) /nH_sun )

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recompute nSi1/nSi2.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1.

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun) *nH1 ] / [ (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ) ]

= [ (10^0.3 *nH1 ) / (nH2) ) ] * (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) /nH_sun )

Wait, that's because the denominator is (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ), so the reciprocal is (nH_sun *10^0.3 )/(nH2 *nSi_sun ).

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = (10^0.3 *nH1 ) * (10^0.3 *nH_sun ) / (nH2 *nH_sun )

Because,

= [ (10^0.3 *nH1) / (nH2 ) ) ] * [ (nH_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nH2 ) )

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly.

The denominator is (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ), so the reciprocal is (nH_sun *10^0.3 )/(nH2 *nSi_sun ).

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_sun *nH1 ) * (nH_sun *10^0.3 )/(nH2 *nSi_sun ) )

Now, canceling terms:

nSi_sun cancels.

nH_sun cancels.

So,

= (10^0.3 *10^0.3 ) * (nH1 /nH2 )

= 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 )

So, same as before.

So, without knowing nH1 and nH2, I can't proceed. Therefore, perhaps the only way is to assume that nH1 =nH2, which would make the ratio 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which matches this.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between the number densities of elements. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Information and Relationships:
1. **Abundance Scales**: The abundance ratios [X/Y] are defined as:
   \[
   [\text{X/Y}] = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_X / n_Y}{n_{X,\odot} / n_{Y,\odot}}\right)
   \]
   where \(n_X\) and \(n_Y\) are the number densities of elements X and Y in the star, and \(n_{X,\odot}\) and \(n_{Y,\odot}\) are the corresponding solar values.

2. **Given Data**:
   - For Star_1:
     - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\), implying:
       \[
       \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Fe1}} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Fe,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3}
       \]
     - \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\), implying:
       \[
       \frac{n_{Fe1}}{n_{H1}} = \frac{n_{Fe,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}}
       \]
   - For Star_2:
     - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\), implying:
       \[
       \frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{Si,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3}
       \]
     - \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), implying:
       \[
       \frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{H2}} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}}
       \]

3. **Solar Values**:
   - From the problem, the solar photospheric composition is:
     \[
     12 + \log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H) = 7.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log_{10}(n_{Fe}/n_H) = -4.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_{Fe}/n_H = 10^{-4.5}
     \]
     \[
     12 + \log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H) = 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_H) = -5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_{Mg}/n_H = 10^{-5}
     \]

### Derivation of \(n_{Si1}/n_{Si2}\):
1. **For Star_1**:
   Using \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\), we have:
   \[
   n_{Fe1} = \frac{n_{Fe,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H1}
   \]
   Substituting into \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\):
   \[
   n_{Si1} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Fe,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{Fe1}
   \]
   \[
   n_{Si1} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Fe,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{Fe,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H1}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   n_{Si1} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H1}
   \]

2. **For Star_2**:
   Using \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), we have:
   \[
   n_{Mg2} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H2}
   \]
   Substituting into \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\):
   \[
   n_{Si2} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} \cdot 10^{-0.3} \cdot n_{Mg2}
   \]
   \[
   n_{Si2} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} \cdot 10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{Mg,\odot}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H2}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   n_{Si2} = \frac{n_{Mg,\odot} \cdot 10^{-0.3}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H2}
   \]

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   The ratio \(n_{Si1}/n_{Si2}\) is:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{\frac{n_{Si,\odot} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H1}}{\frac{n_{Mg,\odot} \cdot 10^{-0.3}}{n_{H,\odot}} \cdot n_{H2}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{H1}}{n_{H2}}
   \]

4. **Assumption on Hydrogen Abundance**:
   The problem does not provide explicit information about the hydrogen abundance ratio \(n_{H1}/n_{H2}\). To proceed, we assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, i.e., \(n_{H1}/n_{H2} = 1\). Substituting this:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.6}
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   Using the solar values for silicon and magnesium:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si,\odot}}{n_{Mg,\odot}} = \frac{10^{7.5}}{10^{7}} = 10^{0.5}
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   \frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{0.5} \cdot 10^{0.6} = 10^{1.1} \approx 12.6
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.
