Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But let's break it down step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The structure has a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, 3, so the numbering is such that the substituents are adjacent. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: 2-(tert-butyl) means the tert-butyl is in position 2. 1-ethoxy is position 1, and 3-nitro is position 3. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). That means the substituents are all meta to each other? Or wait, position 1 and 2 are adjacent, so 1, 2, and 3 are consecutive positions. So it's like 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. So they are all in the ortho and para positions relative to each other. Hmm, that might complicate things because when adding groups, I have to consider the directing effects.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the numbering could vary, but the substituents should be in positions 1, 2, and 3. So when deciding the order of adding substituents, I have to think about the directing groups.

Each substituent is either activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming groups to certain positions. So nitro is a strong meta-directing group. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl group is an activating, but it's a bulky group so it's an ortho/para director, but more likely para because of steric hindrance.

Wait, but when adding substituents, the order in which you add them will determine where each group goes. So my target molecule has three substituents. So the challenge is to decide the sequence of reactions to add them in the right positions.

Let me think about each substituent:

1. tert-butyl: This is a bulky alkyl group. It's an activating group (since alkyl groups are electron-donating via induction and hyperconjugation), so it's an ortho/para director.

2. Ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3): It's an activating group (electron-donating via lone pairs), so it's an ortho/para director.

3. Nitro (NO2): Strongly deactivating (electron-withdrawing), meta director.

So the nitro group is a meta director, which makes it challenging because we have to add it after certain groups that will direct it correctly. Also, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so once added, it could deactivate the ring, affecting where other groups can be added.

So the order of adding substituents is crucial.

Let me think about the possible orders. Option D, for example, starts with nitration. Let's see what each option does.

But wait, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. So we have to perform three substitution reactions, each adding one group.

But wait, no. Let's count the substituents: benzene has three substituents, so three substitution reactions are needed, each adding one group.

But wait, the order of adding these substituents matters. So I need to plan the steps:

First, add one group. Second, add another. Third, add the third.

But which order is best?

One approach is to add the groups in the order that allows the directing effects to place them correctly. Alternatively, sometimes you might have to use a directing group that's temporary.

Wait, another approach is to consider the activating and deactivating groups. Since nitro is deactivating, it's better to add it last because adding it first would make the ring less reactive towards subsequent electrophilic substitutions. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think: Let's say we add the nitro group early. Then, the ring becomes deactivating, which would slow down further substitution. But maybe some groups can be added under forcing conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can add the nitro group after the others because it's the only deactivating group, which would make further substitutions difficult. Hmm.

Wait, but the target molecule has the nitro group in the 3-position relative to ethoxy and tert-butyl. So perhaps the nitro group is added last. Let's think about that.

So first, add ethoxy. Then, add tert-butyl. Then add nitro. Or another order.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so the order might not matter if the substituents are added correctly each time.

Let me consider the positions. The ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, nitro in 3.

Wait, but that's consecutive positions. So perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then tert-butyl in the ortho position, then nitro in the meta position relative to something. Hmm, but nitro is a meta director, so when adding it, we need a substituent that directs it to the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after ethoxy and tert-butyl are in place. Let's think of the sequence:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add tert-butyl group.

3. Add nitro group.

But when adding nitro, the existing groups (ethoxy and tert-butyl) would direct the nitro to a certain position.

Wait, ethoxy is ortho/para-directing, and tert-butyl is ortho/para-directing. So when adding the nitro group, which is meta-directing, but wait, no. Wait, the nitro group is being added as the third group. The existing substituents would direct where the nitro goes.

Wait, no. When adding the nitro group, it's an electrophilic substitution. So the substituents already on the ring will direct the incoming nitro group to certain positions.

So if we have ethoxy and tert-butyl on the benzene, then the nitration would occur in the position that is meta to both of them, or perhaps where they both direct.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration can be done in a way that the substituents guide the nitro group into the correct spot.

But this might get complicated. Maybe it's better to add the nitro group first, then add the ethoxy and tert-butyl. But then the ring is deactivated, making substitution harder.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use a protecting group strategy, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the tert-butyl group first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or any other order.

Wait, let me think about each substituent's effect:

- Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) is a strong activating group, ortho/para director.

- tert-butyl is a bulky activating group, ortho/para.

- Nitro is deactivating, meta director.

So, if I add ethoxy first: benzene becomes ethoxybenzene. Then, the next substitution (tert-butyl) would go into either ortho or para with respect to ethoxy. But the target has tert-butyl in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1). So that's good.

So first ethoxy in position 1, then tert-butyl in position 2.

Now, the third step is adding nitro in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to tert-butyl. Wait, position 3 is meta to ethoxy if ethoxy is in position 1, because positions 1, 3, and 5 would be meta in a benzene ring? Wait, perhaps I should number the benzene correctly.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me imagine the ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, 3.

If I have ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3.

So now, when adding nitro, where would it go?

But wait, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the next substitution is nitro. The existing groups are ethoxy and tert-butyl, which are both activating, ortho/para directors.

So when adding the nitro group, which is an electrophilic substitution, the existing substituents will direct incoming groups.

But the incoming nitro is a meta director, but when you add it as the third group, the existing substituents guide it.

Wait, no. When you have multiple substituents, the positions are determined by the most influential group or the most activating group. But all groups are activating except the nitro group.

Wait, but I'm adding the nitro group as the third step, so the ring has ethoxy and tert-butyl. Both are activating, so they would direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions relative to them.

But the nitro group is being added, which is a meta director, but wait, no, the nitro is the incoming group. Wait, no, the nitro is the electrophile. So during nitration, the existing groups (ethoxy and tert-butyl) will direct the nitro group.

Wait, but the nitro group is the electrophile here. So, the existing substituents (ethoxy and tert-butyl) are activating, so they are ortho/para directors. So the nitro group will be directed to positions that are ortho or para to ethoxy and tert-butyl.

But the target is for the nitro to be in position 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl (position 2) and adjacent to ethoxy (position 1). Hmm, maybe that's the ortho position relative to ethoxy? Wait, position 1 is ethoxy, so position 2 is ortho, position 3 would be meta to ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me try to draw it mentally. Let's number the benzene ring as follows: position 1 is where the ethoxy is attached. Position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (so ortho), and position 3 is next to position 2 (so meta to position 1, but adjacent to position 2). So, when adding the nitro group, where would it go?

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the substituents are in positions 1 and 2. Now, adding nitro as the third substituent. The existing substituents are ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2). Both are activating, ortho/para directors.

So the nitro group can go in positions that are ortho or para to either the ethoxy or tert-butyl.

Hmm. So the ethoxy in position 1 directs incoming groups to positions 2 (ortho), 4 (para), and positions 3 and 5 (meta, but that's for deactivating groups). Wait, no, for activating groups, they direct to ortho and para.

Similarly, the tert-butyl in position 2 directs to positions 1 (ortho—already taken), 3 (ortho), and position 5 (para).

So, the available positions for nitration would be position 3 (directed by tert-butyl's ortho) and position 4 (directed by ethoxy's para). So if we nitrate after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitro group could end up in position 3 or position 4.

But in our target, it's in position 3. So if the nitration is done after ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitro would go to position 3, as directed by the tert-butyl group (since tert-butyl is in 2 and directs ortho to 3 and para to 5).

Wait, but position 3 is ortho to position 2 (tert-butyl), so nitro would be added there. That gives the correct position. So that's good.

So the order would be:

1. Ethoxylation: add ethoxy group.

2. Alkylation: add tert-butyl group.

3. Nitration: add nitro group in position 3.

But wait, how do you perform each of these reactions?

Let's think about each step:

1. Adding ethoxy group: Benzene undergoes nucleophilic substitution under electrophilic conditions. To add an ethoxy group, you can use an ethyl halide with a strong Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3. So Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, ethyl chloride can be used with AlCl3 for Friedel-Crafts. So for the first step, benzene is treated with ethyl chloride and AlCl3 to get ethoxybenzene.

Wait, but wait—ethoxy is an OCH2CH3 group. Oh, wait, no. Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives a benzene with an alkyl group, but I need an ethoxy group, which is an ether. Oh, wait, that's different. Friedel-Crafts would give me C2H5 attached directly to benzene, but I need an OCH2CH3 group.

Ah, that changes things. So to add an ethoxy group, I can't use Friedel-Crafts alkylation because that adds an alkyl group. Instead, I think I need to perform a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene isn't nucleophilic. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a different method.

Wait, another approach: maybe perform a nitration first, but that's a deactivating group, which would make subsequent substitutions harder. But perhaps I can use a directing group strategy, like adding a nitro group first, then doing something else.

Wait, no. Another way to add an ethoxy group is through a substitution reaction. But benzene itself isn't reactive enough for that. But perhaps using a benzene ring that's already activated.

Wait, but initially, benzene is the starting material. To add an ethoxy group, which is an activating group, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly activated ring, which usually isn't the case with benzene. Alternatively, using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps using a phenol group as an intermediate. Because phenol is more reactive towards electrophilic substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using a two-step process through a glycol or something else.

Wait, perhaps using a Williamson ether synthesis approach. But that would involve creating an ether from an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Wait, but how would that apply here? Because benzene is not an alkoxide.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

Another approach: to add an ethoxy group, maybe perform a Friedel-Crafts ethoxylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts typically uses alkyl halides, not aryl ethers. So perhaps that's not possible. Oh wait, no—Friedel-Crafts alkylation uses RX, where X is a leaving group, like Cl. So for ethoxy, that's an OCH2CH3 group, which is an ether, not an alkyl. So perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, maybe electrophilic substitution with an ethoxy group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a meta-directing group to activate the ring towards nucleophilic attack. But without such a group, benzene isn't reactive enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a directing group that's already on the benzene ring. Wait, but for the first substitution, there's nothing else. So this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add the tert-butyl group. Because it's an alkyl group, which can be added via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene plus tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. Then, after that, add the ethoxy group, and then nitro.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the order.

Wait, maybe the first substitution is adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. Then, the next substitution is adding ethoxy, which is an ether group.

Wait, but how do you add an ether group to benzene? That's the same problem as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution). But that requires a good leaving group and a strongly activating meta-directing group. But since benzene is just benzene, I don't think that's possible.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group can be added via a coupling reaction, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question, which seems to involve standard substitution reactions with common reagents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

The options are A, B, C, D, each a sequence of reactions. Each reaction in the sequence is a step. So let's examine each step in the options and see which order makes sense.

Looking at the options, each starts with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So the first step is adding the tert-butyl group. But wait, let me check each option.

Option A: starts with tert-butyl chloride, AlCl3 (step i). Then HNO3/H2SO4 (step ii), which is nitration. Then SO3/H2SO4 (step iii), which is sulfonation.

Wait, but sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. But in our target molecule, we don't have a sulfonic acid group. So option A might not be correct.

Option B: step i is tert-butyl chloride, AlCl3. Step ii is HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration). Step iii is Fe/HCl (which is a reduction, perhaps for nitro group). Then step iv is another nitration. Hmm, that seems odd. Why would you nitrate again? I'm not sure. Let me not get stuck here yet.

Option C: step i is tert-butyl chloride. Step ii is SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation). Step iii is HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration). Then step iv is Fe/HCl (reduction). Hmm, that seems to add a sulfonic group, which isn't in the target.

Option D: step i is HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration). Then Fe/HCl (reduction). Then tert-butyl chloride, AlCl3. Then another nitration, etc. Hmm, that starts with nitration, which would add a nitro group. But then step ii is Fe/HCl, which is a reducing environment. Nitro groups can be reduced to amines, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps looking for the steps that add ethoxy group. Because in all the options, I don't see any steps that introduce an ethoxy group. Wait, but the target molecule has an ethoxy group, so one of the steps must be adding that.

Wait, let me check the options. So looking at each option's steps:

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → adds t-Bu group (Friedel-Crafts)

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis?

vi) H3O+ , H2O, Heat → possibly steam distillation?

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 displacement, like ethoxy group substitution?

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction, maybe of a nitro group.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Wait, this seems complicated. Let me see where the ethoxy group would come in. Step vii is NaOH and EtBr. That's a typical condition for an SN2 reaction. So perhaps EtBr is ethyl bromide, and in the presence of NaOH, it could displace a leaving group. But what leaving group would be present? If previous steps have introduced a nitro group, which is a meta director, and then maybe a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via some displacement. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group comes from a nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not seeing where.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → adds t-Bu

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration

iii) Fe/HCl → reduction (maybe nitro to amine)

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization

vi) H3O+ , H2O, Heat → hydrolysis of diazonium to phenol

vii) NaOH/EtBr → maybe substitution to introduce ethoxy

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

Wait, this seems to involve multiple nitrations and reductions. Not sure.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? Or maybe a different substitution.

vii) H3O+ , H2O, Heat → hydrolysis

viii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution for ethoxy

Hmm, again, not seeing where the ethoxy comes in clearly.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (aminobenzene)

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) H3O+, H2O, Heat → hydrolysis

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution for ethoxy

Wait, but in this case, the ethoxy is added at the end. But the problem is, after nitration, sulfonation, etc., the ring may be too deactivated for Friedel-Crafts. Because the first step is nitration, which adds a deactivating group (nitro), making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts after nitration might not work, as the ring is deactivated. So maybe option D isn't correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the steps again.

Wait, the target molecule has the ethoxy group in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, and nitro in 3. So perhaps the order is:

Add tert-butyl first (position 2). Then add ethoxy (position 1, which is ortho to t-Bu). Then nitrate in position 3 (meta to ethoxy? Or ortho to t-Bu).

Wait, but if I add ethoxy after t-Bu, where would that go?

No, wait, if t-Bu is added first, the ring is activated (since t-Bu is activating), so the next substitution (ethoxy) would go into either ortho or para to t-Bu.

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is adjacent to t-Bu, so ortho. So that's correct.

So the steps would be:

1. Add t-Bu (Friedel-Crafts alkylation)

So benzene → t-Bu benzene.

2. Add ethoxy group. But how? Because benzene is now substituted with t-Bu. So the ring is activated, so electrophilic substitution is possible. But how to introduce the OCH2CH3 group.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I don't see that here. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let's think about the steps in the options.

Looking back, the only way to add the ethoxy group is via a substitution where a leaving group is present. But in the options, the steps that might do that are steps involving NaOH and EtBr, which is an SN2 reaction. For example, in option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. That could be for introducing an ethoxy group, but only if there's a suitable leaving group.

Wait, perhaps one of the substituents is a nitro group which is converted into a diazonium salt, then undergoes hydrolysis to a phenol, which is a strong activating group, and then maybe a substitution.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after a nitro group is converted into a leaving group. For example, nitro → amine → diazonium → hydrolysis to phenol → then another substitution.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after a nitro group is present. But that's possible only with a strongly activated ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an etherification using a phenol. Because phenol is more reactive. For example, if you have phenol, you can perform a nucleophilic substitution with an alkyl halide in presence of a base.

Wait, but in this case, perhaps after adding the nitro group, you reduce it to a phenol (using something like H2/Pd or Fe/HCl), and then perform a nucleophilic substitution to add the ethoxy group.

Wait, but let me think about this step. If I have nitrobenzene, and I reduce it to phenol. Then, phenol can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution with ethyl bromide in presence of a base (like NaOH) to form ethoxyphenol. But that's a possible pathway.

But how does this fit into the options? Let me see.

So the order would be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine (using Fe/HCl and HCl?), but wait, more likely, nitro to amine would require H2/Pd or similar. But in some cases, Fe/HCl can reduce nitro to amine under certain conditions.

Wait, no. Fe/HCl is a typical condition for diazotization. Wait, no, wait. Nitro groups can be reduced to amines using H2 with a catalyst (like H2/Pd or H2/Ni), or using Fe/HCl as a reducing agent. So perhaps, after nitration, the nitro group is reduced to an amine.

3. Then, perform a diazotization (using NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt.

4. Then, hydrolyze the diazonium salt with H3O+ and heat to form a phenol.

5. Then, treat the phenol with ethyl bromide in presence of NaOH to introduce the ethoxy group via nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

But wait, is that possible? Phenol is activating, so it's ortho/para directing. But in nucleophilic substitution, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Phenol isn't very activating for nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, and I should look for the steps in the options that include these transformations.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) H3O+, H2O, Heat → hydrolysis to phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution to add ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

Wait, in step vii, after hydrolysis to phenol, we have phenol with other substituents. Then, step vii would be introducing ethoxy via substitution. But phenol is a good activating group, so perhaps in this case, the substitution is directing the ethoxy group into the correct position.

But the target molecule doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so steps iii (sulfonation) and viii (sulfonation) may not be applicable. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Alternatively, looking at option D:

i) nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts. But wait, the ring now has an amine group, which is activating. However, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, but amines are strongly activating. So after reduction, the ring has an amine group, which is ortho/para directing. So adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts would go into ortho or para to the amine.

But in the target, the t-Bu is at position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1). So perhaps that's possible.

Then, step iv is nitration again. So nitrating the ring that has t-Bu and amine groups. Nitration is an electrophilic substitution. The amine is a strong activating group, so the nitration would occur in positions directed by the amine and t-Bu.

But this seems a bit tangled. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the t-Bu group, then the ethoxy, then nitrate. Let's see which options have this order.

Looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O, Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, step ii adds a sulfonic acid group, which isn't in the target. So option C is probably wrong.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → add nitro.

iii) sulfonate → add SO3H.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

v) dilute H2SO4 → ?

vi) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) nitrate again.

But again, the sulfonate group isn't in the target, so option A is out.

Option D:

i) nitrate → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

iv) nitrate → add another nitro.

v) diazo.

vi) sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

ix) substitution.

This seems to add multiple nitro groups, which isn't desired.

So perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add t-Bu group.

3. Nitrate.

But the problem is adding the ethoxy group. Since I can't find a way to add the ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts, perhaps it's added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after the nitro group is introduced, but that might not be possible due to deactivation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but that's beyond the given options.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the tert-butyl group is added. Let's think about how that could happen.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reactions in each option step by step to see which leads to the correct structure.

Let's take option D:

1. Nitration: benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduction: nitro → amine (aminobenzene).

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation: add t-Bu group. But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. Aminobenzene is strongly activating, so t-Bu can be added in ortho or para to the amine.

4. Nitration: add another nitro group, directed by the amine and t-Bu groups.

But the target has only one nitro group, so this seems off.

Option B:

1. Friedel-Crafts: add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate: add nitro, which would go meta to t-Bu.

3. Reduction: nitro → amine.

4. Nitrate again: but now the ring has t-Bu (activating) and amine (activating), so nitration would occur in positions directed by them.

5. Diazotization: form diazonium salt from nitro group.

Wait, no, after step iii, the ring has t-Bu and nitro groups. Step iii reduces nitro to amine, so now it's t-Bu and amine.

Then step iv nitrates again, adding another nitro group.

Hmm, not matching the target.

Option A:

1. Friedel-Crafts: add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate: adds nitro group.

3. Sulfonate: adds SO3H group.

But target doesn't have sulfonate.

Option C:

1. Friedel-Crafts: t-Bu.

2. Sulfonate: adds SO3H.

But target doesn't have that.

So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a good leaving group. For example, if the ring has a nitro group, which can be converted into a diazonium salt, then hydrolyzed to a phenol, which is a good leaving group under certain conditions. Then, an ethyl halide could substitute into that position.

Wait, but how would that work. Let's think:

If I have a nitro group in a certain position, I can reduce it to an amine, then diazotize and hydrolyze to a phenol. Then, the phenol could be treated with ethyl bromide in a substitution reaction to form the ethoxy group.

But considering the options, perhaps the correct sequence is to:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate, then reduce to amine.

3. Diazotize and hydrolyze to phenol.

4. Substitute phenol with ethoxy.

5. Then nitrate again in the correct position.

But I'm not sure which option does this.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro group.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again (probably in a different position).

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) H3O+ → hydrolyze to phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution to add ethoxy.

But after step vii, they would have the ethoxy group. Then, step viii is sulfonate, which isn't needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but let's think.

Wait, after step vii, which is NaOH and EtBr, the ethoxy group would be added. But where?

The ring after step vi is a phenol. So the phenol has t-Bu and another substituent (from the previous steps). Then in step vii, substitution occurs.

But I'm getting a bit lost.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: the target has three substituents: ethoxy (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3).

The correct order would be to add ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro. Because adding ethoxy first would allow t-Bu to be added in the ortho position, and then nitro in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy. Since Friedel-Crafts can't do that, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added in the last step via SN2 substitution after the ring is activated.

Wait, considering that, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate to add nitro.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize and hydrolyze to phenol.

5. Substitute phenol with ethoxy.

But then I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

After thinking through all this, I'm still a bit confused, but perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, no. Let me think again about option D:

Option D steps:

i) HNO3 → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → nitro → amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts (since amine is activating).

iv) HNO3 → another nitration.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

But the target has only one nitro group, so this seems off.

Hmm.

Another approach: looking for the steps that introduce the ethoxy group. The only steps that seem to do that are steps involving NaOH and EtBr, which is an SN2 condition.

So in option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr → likely substituting a leaving group with ethoxy.

In option B, step vii is same.

In option C, step ix is same.

In option D, step ix is same.

So which of these options correctly introduces the ethoxy group in the right position.

Assuming that the ethoxy group is added via substitution after a leaving group is present.

So, let's say the leaving group is in position 1, and when it's substituted, ethoxy goes there.

But to have a leaving group, perhaps a nitro group is reduced to a phenol, which then can act as a leaving group under certain conditions.

Wait, but phenol isn't a good leaving group. Unless it's converted into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of a strong base, a nitro group can be converted into a nitrophenoxide, which is a better leaving group.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a diazonium salt, which is a good leaving group. Then, in the presence of a base, it can be displaced by an ethoxide.

Wait, but in option A, step iv is NaNO2/HCl → which would form a diazonium salt, then step v is dilute H2SO4, which hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol. Then step vi is H3O+ and heat, which is another hydrolysis step. Then step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which would substitute the phenol with ethoxy.

Wait, but how does that fit.

Alternatively, perhaps in step vii, the ring has a nitro group which is converted into a phenol via steps iv, v, vi.

Wait, let me think about option A.

Option A sequence:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro group.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2 → diazo.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolyze diazo to phenol.

vi) H3O+ → ?

vii) NaOH and EtBr → substitution.

But after step vi, the ring has t-Bu, nitro, and sulfonate groups. Wait, no, step iii is sulfonation. So after step iii, the ring has t-Bu and sulfonate groups.

Wait, then step iv is NaNO2, which would require a nitro group, but step ii added nitro, but step v is after step iv.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too tangled. Maybe I should consider the correct order of substituents.

The target has ethoxy in 1, t-Bu in 2, nitro in 3.

So, the correct order of substitution is:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-Bu.

3. Add nitro.

But the problem is adding the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the ethoxy group is added as the last step via an SN2 displacement, replacing a nitro group. But that seems unlikely because nitro groups are not good leaving groups unless converted into something else.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to a phenol, which is then used in a nucleophilic substitution with ethyl bromide.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate to add nitro.

3. Reduce nitro to phenol.

4. Substitute phenol with ethoxy.

Then, add another nitro group in the correct position.

Wait, but that would require adding the nitro groups in the correct positions, which might not align with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence of reactions is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aminobenzene.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-Bu → t-Bu group added in para to amine.

4. Nitrate again → nitro group added in ortho or meta to t-Bu and amine.

But this is getting too complicated.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the options provided.

The correct target has substituents in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So the nitro group is in the meta position relative to ethoxy and adjacent to t-Bu.

If the ethoxy group is added first, then t-Bu would go ortho to it. Then nitration would be directed by both ethoxy and t-Bu.

But since ethoxy and t-Bu are both activating, ortho/para directors, nitration would occur in a position that's ortho or para to both. But in the target, nitro is adjacent to t-Bu (position 3) and meta to ethoxy (position 3 is meta to 1).

So perhaps the nitro group is added in position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

So the order is ethoxy → t-Bu → nitro.

But how to introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a good leaving group, such as a nitro group.

Wait, but benzene isn't reactive enough for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has a strong electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta to the ethoxy in the target. So perhaps the ethoxy is added after the nitro group, but the nitro is deactivating, making substitution hard.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think I need to go with the option that introduces the ethoxy group via NaOH and EtBr, which is an SN2 substitution.

Looking at the options, option B has:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate → another nitro.

v) diazo.

vi) hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Wait, no, I think the correct option is option B.

Wait, let me think again.

In the target, the nitro group is in position 3. Ethoxy is in position 1, t-Bu in 2.

So, if I add t-Bu first (position 2), then ethoxy would go into position 1 (ortho to t-Bu). Then, nitration would go into position 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-Bu).

So the steps would be:

1. Add t-Bu (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Nitrate.

But how to add ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the t-Bu is added.

So, after adding t-Bu, the ring is activated (t-Bu is activating), so perhaps introducing a leaving group (like NO2) in a position, then substituting it with OCH2CH3.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a nitro group which is then converted into a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps in option B:

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro in position meta to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate → another nitro group.

v) diazo.

vi) hydrolysis to phenol.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

But this doesn't seem to fit the target.

Alternatively, option D:

i) nitrate → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

iv) nitrate → add another nitro.

v) diazo.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) hydrolysis.

ix) substitution.

Hmm.

I think I'm going too far. Perhaps the correct option is option B.

But I'm really unsure. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The order of adding these substituents is critical due to their directing effects during electrophilic aromatic substitution.

### Key Analysis of the Substituents:
1. **tert-butyl group**: An activating, ortho/para-directing group.
2. **Ethoxy group**: An activating, ortho/para-directing group.
3. **Nitro group**: A deactivating, meta-directing group.

### Strategy:
- The ethoxy group is challenging to introduce directly via Friedel-Crafts alkylation because it is an ether, not an alkyl halide. Instead, it can be introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a suitable leaving group (e.g., converting a nitro group to a phenol).
- The tert-butyl group can be added via Friedel-Crafts alkylation as the first step.
- The nitro group must be added last to avoid deactivating the ring prematurely, which would hinder subsequent substitutions.

### Evaluation of the Options:
#### **Option A**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl3**: Adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates the ring, but the nitro group would likely end up in the wrong position.
3. **SO3/H2SO4**: Adds a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
4. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.
5. **Dilute H2SO4**: Hydrolysis, but the sequence is inconsistent with the desired product.
6. **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Additional hydrolysis steps, but unnecessary for the target.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group, but the sequence does not lead to the correct positions for the substituents.
8. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction, but not relevant to the target.
9. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, but the target has only one nitro group.

**Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the introduction of a sulfonic acid group and inconsistent substitution positions.

#### **Option B**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl3**: Adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates the ring, but the nitro group would likely end up in the wrong position.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amine, which is strongly activating.
4. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, but the target has only one nitro group.
5. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.
6. **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis, but unnecessary for the target.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group, but the sequence does not lead to the correct positions for the substituents.
8. **SO3/H2SO4**: Adds a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
9. **Dilute H2SO4**: Additional hydrolysis, but not relevant to the target.

**Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the introduction of a sulfonic acid group and inconsistent substitution positions.

#### **Option C**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl3**: Adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **SO3/H2SO4**: Adds a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
3. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates the ring, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amine, which is strongly activating.
5. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.
6. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, but the target has only one nitro group.
7. **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis, but unnecessary for the target.
8. **Dilute H2SO4**: Additional hydrolysis, but not relevant to the target.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group, but the sequence does not lead to the correct positions for the substituents.

**Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the introduction of a sulfonic acid group and inconsistent substitution positions.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates benzene to form nitrobenzene.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amine, which is strongly activating.
3. **t-BuCl/AlCl3**: Adds the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
4. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, but the target has only one nitro group.
5. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.
6. **SO3/H2SO4**: Adds a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
7. **Dilute H2SO4**: Additional hydrolysis, but not relevant to the target.
8. **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis, but unnecessary for the target.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group, but the sequence does not lead to the correct positions for the substituents.

**Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the introduction of a sulfonic acid group and inconsistent substitution positions.

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option B** is the most plausible, as it includes the necessary steps to introduce the tert-butyl and ethoxy groups, even though it introduces additional groups that are not part of the target molecule.

Answer: B
