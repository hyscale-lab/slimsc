Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and some quantum model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait, I remember that the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, right? So this probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy states.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state—oh right, that's the lowest energy state for a given vibrational mode. So for the molecular vibrations, the fundamental state is the first vibrational level, n=0 maybe? Or is it the ground state overall?

Wait, the question is about absorbing a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think this means moving to the next higher state, but what type of transition is that? Since it's about the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So maybe that's the first energy level, and the next state is the next energy level. But what's the order of these energy levels? Do we have a hierarchy where vibrational changes are higher in energy than rotational changes, or the other way around?

No, wait, actually, in molecular spectroscopy, vibrational transitions generally involve higher energy than rotational ones. Because vibrational energy levels have larger spacing. So for a molecule in its fundamental vibrational state (n=0), the first transition would be to the next vibrational state (n=1), but wait, that's a vibrational transition. Alternatively, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions are possible, but in the non-rigid model, maybe both are considered.

Wait, but the question is about the photon momentum needed. So perhaps the molecule is absorbing a photon that causes a transition from the ground state to the next higher energy state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, the problem specifies that it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So we're looking for the smallest possible energy increment. Because in spectroscopy, transitions can be either electronic, vibrational, or rotational. But in this case, since the model includes both rotation and vibration, the molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies.

But what's the next lowest energy state? I think that in diatomic molecules, the rotational energy levels are closer together than the vibrational ones. So the smallest energy jump would be a change in the rotational state, not the vibrational.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state. Oh, maybe the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either J=1 or n=1. But which has lower energy?

Wait, the energy spacing between rotational levels is given by ΔE_rot = B (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But for the transition, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is B*(1) - B*(0) = B.

For vibrational transitions, the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is (1/2)hw + (3/2)hw - (1/2)hw = no, wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2)hw. So the transition from n=0 to n=1 would require ΔE_vib = hw.

So comparing B (rotational) and hw (vibrational), which is smaller? Because if B is smaller than hw, then the rotational transition would be lower in energy, and thus the photon needed would have lower energy (and hence lower momentum).

So I need to calculate both B and hw, then see which is smaller.

Given the data:

Mx = 20 amu
My = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms
Angular frequency w = 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, so first, let's compute the rotational constant B. B is given by (hbar²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. Right.

So, let's compute μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So Mx + My = 22 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but amu needs to be converted into kg because I is in kg m².

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 20/11 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016 → 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

20/11 = approximately 1.8181818... amu.

Multiply by 1.6605e-27 kg/amu:

1.8181818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

Now, R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is hbar²/(2I). Wait, hbar is Planck's constant over 2π, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for rotational energy levels is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in energy units (J). Or perhaps B is in cm^-1, but in terms of energy, it's E = B J (J+1), where B is in terms of energy.

Alternatively, the rotational constant B is given by (h²)/(8π² I c), but I'm a bit confused—maybe I should look up the formula.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ R². The rotational constant B is defined in spectroscopy as B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), but that's for wavenumbers, I think. Alternatively, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is (h²)/(8 π² I), but then that's in joules.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant B in terms of energy.

So, E_rot = (ħ² / (2 I)) * J (J +1). Because the energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = (ħ² J (J +1))/(2 I), where J is the rotational quantum number.

Wait, ħ is hbar. So, ħ = h/(2π). So, ħ squared is h²/(4π²).

Therefore, E_J = [ (h²/(4 π²)) * J (J+1) ] / (2 I )

= (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I )

So, the rotational constant B is h²/(8 π² I). So, B = h²/(8 π² I).

So, I have I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Let me plug in the numbers.

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

So h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Then, 8 π² is about 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So, denominator is 78.9568 * I = 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 95.29e-46 → 9.529e-45.

Wait, wait, no. 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 = let me compute:

78.9568 * 1.2064 ≈ 95.29 → so 95.29e-46.

So, B = (4.39e-67) / (95.29e-46) ) = (4.39e-67) / (9.529e-45) )

Wait, 4.39e-67 / 9.529e-45 = approx 4.39/9.529 * 1e-22 → 0.4608 * 1e-22 → 4.608e-23 J.

Wait, so B is approximately 4.608e-23 J.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 6.626^2 = approx 43.9, so 43.9e-68 → 4.39e-67.

Denominator is 8 pi^2 I = 8*(9.8696)=78.9568. Multiply by I=1.2064e-46 → 78.9568 *1.2064e-46 → let's compute 78.9568 * 1.2064:

78.9568 * 1.2 = approx 94.748, 78.9568 * 0.0064= approx 0.505. So total approx 95.253 → 95.253e-46.

So denominator is 9.5253e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.5253e-45 = (4.39 /9.5253 ) *1e-22 → 0.4608 *1e-22 → 4.608e-23 J.

So each rotational level J has energy E_J = (ħ² J(J+1))/(2I) = same as (h² J(J+1))/(8 pi² I) ), which is B * J(J+1), where B = h²/(8 pi² I ), which is what I calculated.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be E(1) - E(0) = B*(1*2) - B*(0*1) ) = 2B - 0 = 2B.

But wait, no, E_J = B J (J+1), so E(0) = 0, E(1)= 2B.

So ΔE_rot = 2B = 2*4.608e-23 J = 9.216e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels for J are E_J = B J (J+1), so the transition from J=0 to J=1 would require a photon of energy equal to 2B.

Alternatively, another approach is that the energy spacing between adjacent J levels is (E_{J+1} - E_J) = B*( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) )) = B*( (J^2 + 3J + 2) - (J^2 + J) )) = B*( 2J + 2 ) = 2B (J+1). So for J=0, the spacing is 2B.

So the energy required for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

Now, the vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 is E = h w. Because the vibrational energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) h w. So ΔE_vib = h w (1 + 1/2 -0 -1/2 ) = h w (1) = h w.

Given that w is 4e14 rad/s. So h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, let's compare the two energy changes. The rotational transition requires 9.216e-23 J, the vibrational requires 2.65e-19 J.

So clearly, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon needed would correspond to the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon would need to have the energy corresponding to the lower of the two ΔE's.

So since ΔE_rot is much smaller, the photon's energy is hν = 9.216e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because the photon's energy is related to its momentum. Since for a photon, E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light.

So p = E/c.

So p = (9.216e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 3.072e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are of that magnitude. The options are around 1e-27 to 2e-27 kg·m/s. Hmm, that's way bigger than my calculation.

Wait, am I making a mistake here? Did I compute B correctly?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me double-check.

Wait, B is h²/(8 pi² I), correct?

h is 6.626e-34, h² is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 pi² I. I is 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

So 8 pi² is about 78.9568.

So 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 = 95.25e-46 kg·m².

So denominator is 9.525e-45 kg·m².

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in exponents. Let me compute 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 correctly.

78.9568 * 1.2064 = 95.25.

So 95.25e-46 → 9.525e-45.

So denominator is 9.525e-45.

So B = h²/(8 pi² I) = 4.39e-67 / 9.525e-45.

Compute that:

4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 = (4.39 /9.525) * 1e-22.

4.39 /9.525 ≈ 0.4608.

So 0.4608e-22 J → 4.608e-23 J.

So E_rot = 2B = 9.216e-23 J.

Wait, but the problem is that the photon's momentum would be E/c = 9.216e-23 / 3e8 = 3.072e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are around 1e-27, which is about 1e4 times larger.

Hmm. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia.

Wait, I = μ R².

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

And μ is 20/11 amu, which is approximately 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605 = approx 3.016e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg·m². That's correct.

Hmm. So the calculation of B seems correct. So why is the photon momentum way off from the options?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a rotational transition but a vibrational transition. Because the options are way higher than what I calculated.

Wait, but if the photon is causing a vibrational transition, then the energy is h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, the momentum would be E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.83e-28 is not among the options. The closest would be option B and C, but those are larger.

Wait, so perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so perhaps n=0 and J=0.

If the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon, what is the next state with the lowest possible energy?

Wait, the next state could be either the next vibrational state (n=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (n=0, J=1). Which of these transitions requires less energy?

Because the energy required for a vibrational transition is hw, which is 2.65e-19 J, and the rotational transition is 2B = 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So which transition is possible?

But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions are only allowed when delta J = ±2, but when you have a non-rigid rotor (vibrational-rotational coupling), perhaps other transitions are allowed.

Wait, but perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the selection rules are different. Or maybe the question is only considering vibrational transitions, or only considering rotational.

Wait, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, so perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both. So the molecule's energy is the sum of its rotational and vibrational energies.

But the problem is about moving from the fundamental state to the next state with the lowest energy. So perhaps the next state is the first excited rotational state (J=1) with the same vibrational state (n=0), but that would require the energy of the rotational transition.

Alternatively, maybe the next state is the first vibrational excited state (n=1) but with J=0.

So which has a lower energy? Let's compute both ΔE.

ΔE_rot = 2B ≈9.2e-23 J.

ΔE_vib = hw = 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition requires much less energy, so that must be the next state.

But earlier calculation gives p_photon ≈3.07e-31 kg m/s, but the options are around 1e-27, which is a discrepancy of about 1e4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me re-calculate B.

Alternative approach: Compute the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula for B.

Wait, another way to compute B is using the formula B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), where c is the speed of light, but that would give B in cm^-1 (wavenumbers). But that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy. Let me double-check. The energy levels for rotation are E_J = (ħ² J(J+1))/(2I). So for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = (ħ² (1)(2))/(2I) ) = ( ħ² * 2 )/(2I ) = ħ²/(I).

So, ΔE_rot = ħ^2 / I.

Wait, but I thought earlier that B is h²/(8 pi² I), which is (ħ^2)/(2 I) because ħ = h/(2 pi).

Wait, let me compute:

ħ = h/(2 pi), so ħ^2 = h²/(4 pi²).

So, ΔE_rot = (h²/(4 pi²)) / I.

= h²/(4 pi² I).

Wait, earlier calculation of B was h²/(8 pi² I), which would have been for E_J= B J (J+1) where B is in energy units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me define E_J correctly.

The energy levels for a rigid rotor are given by E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), yes.

So E_1 - E_0 = (ħ² * 2 ) / (2 I ) = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

So substituting ħ = h/(2 pi):

ΔE_rot = (h/(2 pi))² / I = h²/(4 pi² I).

So in this case, I have I=1.2064e-46 kg m².

So h² is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

So: 4.39e-67 / (4 pi² * 1.2064e-46) ) 

4 pi² is about 39.478.

So denominator: 39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.62e-46 → 4.762e-45.

So ΔE_rot = 4.39e-67 /4.762e-45 ≈ (4.39/4.762) * 1e-22.

4.39/4.762 ≈ 0.922.

So 0.922e-22 J → 9.22e-23 J.

Same as before.

So, the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 9.22e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options:

Options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, C) 1.1e-27, D) 1.4e-28.

Hmm, none of these match 3e-31. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is about the vibrational transition. Let's compute the momentum for that.

E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.835e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. So 8.835e-28 is not an option. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, and the photon's energy must account for both. But I don't think that's the case. Usually, a photon causes a transition of a single quantum, either rotational or vibrational, not both.

Wait, maybe the model is such that the molecule's energy is a combination of rotation and vibration, but the next state is a higher rotational state with the same vibrational state.

Hmm. But then, the calculation I did earlier for the rotational transition would be the correct approach, but the answer is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor approximation, not the non-rigid. No, the question says the non-rigid rotor model.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model includes vibrational motion, so the bond length is variable. But in the calculation of the moment of inertia, maybe I should use an average bond length, but I used R=2 angstroms. Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given as R=2 angstroms, but for the vibration, perhaps the reduced mass should be calculated differently, but I don't think so.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the photon's energy corresponds to the transition from the ground vibrational state (n=0) and ground rotational state (J=0) to the next state, which is either n=0, J=1 or n=1, J=0.

So the molecule must have the next higher energy state. The next higher state could be the higher rotational or the higher vibrational, whichever has lower energy.

Wait, but we saw that the energy of the rotational transition is much lower than the vibrational. So the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition.

So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s (since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s).

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transitions but only vibrational. Because in the rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions require certain selection rules, but in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the selection rules are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is the next vibrational state, n=1, regardless of rotation, but that would require higher energy.

But why is the photon's momentum not matching any of the options? Let me think again.

Wait, wait a second. Could the problem be asking about the change in linear momentum of the molecule? No, the question is about the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the photon's momentum differently. Oh wait, no, for a photon, E = pc, so p = E / c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass but in a different way. Or perhaps I should calculate the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers and then convert to energy.

Wait, another approach: compute the rotational constant in wavenumbers (cm^-1) and then find the energy.

B (in cm^-1) = h/(8 pi² c I).

Hmm, let's compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c is 3e8 m/s. I is 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So,

B = h/(8 pi² c I ) 

= (6.626e-34) / (8 *9.8696 *3e8 *1.2064e-46 )

Compute denominator:

8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8 = 2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.2064e-46 = 2.3687e10 *1.2064e-46 = 2.86e-36.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 2.86e-36 → 23.17 cm^-1.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B = 46.34 cm^-1.

But how to convert that into joules? Because 1 cm^-1 is approximately 1.986e-23 J.

So 46.34 cm^-1 *1.986e-23 J/cm^-1 ≈ 9.22e-22 J.

Wait, that's larger than my previous calculation. Oh wait, no, that's 9.22e-22 J, which is 0.922e-21 J.

Wait, earlier I got 9.22e-23 J, so a factor of 100 difference.

Hmm. Let me see where that discrepancy comes from.

Wait, when I compute B in terms of energy earlier, I used E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I). But when B is 23.17 cm^-1, it's in terms of wavenumbers, which are cm^-1.

Wait, 1 cm^-1 corresponds to E = hc cm^-1. So for 1 cm^-1, E = 6.626e-34 J s *3e8 m/s * 1e-2 m/cm → 6.626e-34 *3e8 *0.01 = 2.65e-28 J.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 cm^-1 is E = hc * (cm^-1) → h is in J s, c is m/s → so hc is J m.

So E = hc * cm^-1 = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) * (1 cm^-1)

Wait, 1 cm^-1 = 0.01 m^-1. So E = 6.626e-34 *3e8 * 0.01 = 6.626e-34 *3e6 = 1.9878e-27 J.

So for B=23.17 cm^-1, E_rot = 2 *23.17 * 1.9878e-27 J.

Wait, 23.17 *1.9878e-27 ≈ 46.1e-27 J. Multiply by 2 gives 92.2e-27 → 9.22e-26 J.

Wait, that's 9.22e-26 J, which is much larger than the previous 9.22e-23 J.

This suggests that I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of B expressed in cm^-1.

Because when B is 23.17 cm^-1, each cm^-1 corresponds to 1.986e-23 J.

So E_rot transition is 2 *23.17 cm^-1 → 46.34 cm^-1.

So E = 46.34 * 1.986e-23 J/cm^-1 → 46.34 *1.986e-23 ≈ 9.22e-22 J.

That's 9.22e-22 J, which is larger than the earlier calculation.

So now, the photon's energy is 9.22e-22 J.

Momentum p = E/c =9.22e-22 /3e8 ≈3.07e-29 kg m/s.

But the options are 1e-28 to 2e-27, which is about 1e3 times larger.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's compute the rotational constant B in terms of energy.

The formula for the rotational energy levels is E_J = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1) → E_J = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 pi² I).

So, I have I = μ R².

μ = (20 *2) / (20 +2) amu = 20/11 amu → 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg → μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg → approx 3.016e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = h²/(8 pi² I).

h =6.626e-34 J s.

h²= (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² I → 8*(9.8696) *1.2064e-46 → 78.9568 *1.2064e-46 → 95.25e-46 → 9.525e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 → 4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 =4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 → 4.39 /9.525 is about 0.4608 → 0.4608e-22 → 4.608e-23 J.

So ΔE = 2B =9.216e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.216e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c =9.216e-23 /3e8 =3.072e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way off. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, and my initial calculation was correct, but I miscalculated the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy.

Wait, w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s ≈8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is not present.

So perhaps I've made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Maybe that refers to the ground state of both rotation and vibration, so n=0 and J=0. But the question is about the next state, which could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. The one with lower energy is the rotational transition.

But why the photon's momentum is not matching any option. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the transition to the next state as a vibrational transition, and that the rotational transition is not allowed. But that would require the photon's momentum to be 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the vibrational transition, but the given options are off? Or perhaps I messed up the exponents in calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation of the vibrational energy.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w =4e14 s^-1.

So E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, so 8.8e-28 isn't an option. The closest is option A:1.9e-28.

But that's about a factor of 4.6 difference.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of w. Let me recheck.

Given w =4e14 rad/s. Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the frequency in terms of cm^-1, but no, the calculation is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require 6B.

But earlier, 2B was 9.2e-23 J, 6B would be 2.76e-22 J. Then p_photon would be 9.2e-23 /3e8 → no, wait, 2.76e-22 J → p=9.2e-23 kg m/s.

No, that's still way below the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the momentum of both the photon and the molecule, but that's not the case. The question is about the photon's momentum.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the molecule's mass is the reduced mass. Wait, no, because the photon's momentum doesn't depend on the molecule's mass.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the angular frequency in terms of 2pi, but no, the given w is already in rad/s.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy in terms of the rotational constant R, which is B = h/(8 pi c I), but no, that's for wavenumbers.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the transition that involves both rotation and vibration, so the photon provides enough energy to change both. But that would be a combination, but I don't think that's the usual approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as the first vibrational state (n=1) but that doesn't make sense because the ground state is n=0.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the Raman transition, which allows changes in J by ±2 and involves vibrational and rotational changes, but that's more complex and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of both the rotational and vibrational transitions. But that would be a much higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, when I compute the vibrational transition, p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is about 8.8e-28.

The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is about a factor of 4.6 smaller. Could I have made a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps the bond length is 2 angstroms, but the moment of inertia uses the radius, not the bond length. Oh wait, no, the moment of inertia is μ R², where R is the bond length.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in atomic mass units (amu) without converting to kg. Let me see what happens if I do that.

Wait, no, the formula for I requires mass in kg because the units of I are kg m². So using μ in amu would give wrong units.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the bond length in a different unit.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy using the formula E = (1/2) I ω², where ω is the angular velocity.

But for a diatomic molecule, ω is the rotational angular velocity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is given by E = (ħ²)/(2I), which is the ground state energy (J=0). So the first excited rotational state (J=1) would be E = 2*(ħ²)/(2I) )= (ħ²)/(I) → same as earlier.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one is closest to what I calculate.

Wait, when I calculated the vibrational transition, I got p_photon =8.8e-28 kg m/s.

The options are A)1.9e-28, which is about 1/4 of that.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the given data.

Wait, the given angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. What if it's actually 4e13 rad/s? Then E would be 6.626e-34 *4e13 =2.65e-20 J.

p_photon =2.65e-20 /3e8 =8.83e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in momentum of the molecule, but that doesn't make sense because the molecule's momentum change would be due to the photon's momentum. But the question specifically asks for the photon's momentum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in a different way. Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the moment of inertia is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

But the problem gives Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

Which is 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm not finding any error in the calculations, but the answer isn't among the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to select the closest option, but none of them match.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in the initial approach. Because the question says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which implies that it's a vibration-rotation model, where the bond length can change. So perhaps the energy levels include both vibrational and rotational contributions.

In that model, the energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot.

The ground state is n=0, J=0.

The next state could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1.

Which transition requires less energy?

As before, ΔE_rot is 9.2e-23 J, ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition is lower in energy, so the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition where both J and n change, but I don't think that's the case. Maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first allowed state, which might be a vibrational and rotational change, but that would require more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition from the ground state to the next vibrational state, which requires the photon's energy to be hw. So the momentum is 8.83e-28 kg m/s, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state (n=1, J=0), which requires the vibrational transition. So the photon's energy is hw, and the momentum is E/c.

Which gives p_photon ≈8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, A is 1.9e-28, D is1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.83e-28 is approximately 4.9 times larger than option A, and about 6.3 times larger than option D.

But none of the options match. I'm stuck. Maybe I should re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Perhaps that refers to the state with the lowest energy, which is n=0, J=0. The next state is the first excited state, which could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1.

As before, the lower energy transition is J=1, so the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the correct approach is to go with the vibrational transition, even though it's higher in energy. But that would be the only option that gives an answer in the options' range.

Wait, but the options don't include 8.8e-28. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy of the photon causing a transition to the next state, which is the first state with higher energy, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational.

So comparing the two ΔE's, the rotational ΔE is smaller, so that's the next state.

Thus, the correct photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg m/s, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the given options have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using w in terms of 2π, but no, the given w is already in rad/s.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to be equal to the sum of the rotational and vibrational ground state energies. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require 6B. Let's see.

6B =6 *4.608e-23 =2.765e-22 J.

p_photon=2.765e-22/3e8=9.217e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the momentum of the molecule, not the photon. But the question explicitly asks for the photon's momentum.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is using the formula p = h/wavelength, but wavelength is c/f, but I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, given that the photon's energy is E = h f = h c /lambda, but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the given options and see if any match my calculations.

My initial calculation for the rotational transition gives p_photon =3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s.

Looking at the options, none match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, which requires energy hw, and thus p= h w / c.

So, p = (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (2.65e-19)/3e8≈8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is 1.9e-28, but it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the given w is 4e13 rad/s. Let me recalculate with that.

If w=4e13 rad/s:

E =6.626e-34 *4e13 =2.65e-20 J.

p_photon=2.65e-20/3e8=8.83e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm really not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The closest to my vibrational calculation is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28).

Wait, 8.83e-28 is about 4.6 times option A, which is 1.9e-28. So that's not close.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for Planck's constant. Let me check the exact value. Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J s.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is computed differently. Let me recompute ΔE_rot.

ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) → since E_J= (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I) → ΔE= E_1 - E_0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/I.

So ħ = h/(2 pi).

So ħ² = h²/(4 pi²).

Thus, ΔE_rot = h²/(4 pi² I).

Calculating with I=1.2064e-46 kg m².

h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

4 pi² I =4 *9.8696 *1.2064e-46 → 4*9.8696≈39.478, *1.2064e-46 → 47.6e-46 →4.76e-45.

So ΔE_rot=4.39e-67 /4.76e-45 = 9.22e-23 J.

Same as before.

So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct approach is to select the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, which gives p_photon≈8.8e-28, and see if any options match.

But the only option close is A)1.9e-28 and D)1.4e-28. Since 8.8e-28 is not present, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the vibrational energy calculation.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 s^-1.

E = h w →6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized differently, and the transition is not purely rotational or vibrational, but a combination. But I don't know how to calculate that.

In summary, I think the correct photon's momentum is 8.8e-28 kg m/s, but since that's not an option, I'm probably missing something. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Information and Calculations:
1. **Molecular Parameters**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]

4. **Rotational Constant**:
   The rotational constant \( B \) is given by:
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}
   \]
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
   \[
   B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.608 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The energy difference for a transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.608 \times 10^{-23} = 9.216 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

5. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{9.216 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.072 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]
   This value is far smaller than any of the provided options.

6. **Vibrational Transition**:
   The energy of a photon required for a vibrational transition from \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.6504 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{2.6504 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.835 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]
   This value is approximately \( 4.6 \times 10^1 \) times larger than the closest option, \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, the calculated photon momentum for the rotational transition (\( 3.072 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)) does not match any of the provided options. For the vibrational transition, the calculated momentum (\( 8.835 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)) is also not an exact match but is closest to option **A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)). Given the discrepancy, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and some quantum model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait, I remember that the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, right? So this probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy states.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state—oh right, that's the lowest energy state for a given vibrational mode. So for the molecular vibrations, the fundamental state is the first vibrational level, n=0 maybe? Or is it the ground state overall?

Wait, the question is about absorbing a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think this means moving to the next higher state, but what type of transition is that? Since it's about the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So maybe that's the first energy level, and the next state is the next energy level. But what's the order of these energy levels? Do we have a hierarchy where vibrational changes are higher in energy than rotational changes, or the other way around?

No, wait, actually, in molecular spectroscopy, vibrational transitions generally involve higher energy than rotational ones. Because vibrational energy levels have larger spacing. So for a molecule in its fundamental vibrational state (n=0), the first transition would be to the next vibrational state (n=1), but wait, that's a vibrational transition. Alternatively, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions are possible, but in the non-rigid model, maybe both are considered.

Wait, but the question is about the photon momentum needed. So perhaps the molecule is absorbing a photon that causes a transition from the ground state to the next higher energy state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, the problem specifies that it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So we're looking for the smallest possible energy increment. Because in spectroscopy, transitions can be either electronic, vibrational, or rotational. But in this case, since the model includes both rotation and vibration, the molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies.

But what's the next lowest energy state? I think that in diatomic molecules, the rotational energy levels are closer together than the vibrational ones. So the smallest energy jump would be a change in the rotational state, not the vibrational.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state. Oh, maybe the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either J=1 or n=1. But which has lower energy?

Wait, the energy spacing between rotational levels is given by ΔE_rot = B (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But for the transition, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is B*(1) - B*(0) = B.

For vibrational transitions, the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is (1/2)hw + (3/2)hw - (1/2)hw = no, wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2)hw. So the transition from n=0 to n=1 would require ΔE_vib = hw.

So comparing B (rotational) and hw (vibrational), which is smaller? Because if B is smaller than hw, then the rotational transition would be lower in energy, and thus the photon needed would have lower energy (and hence lower momentum).

So I need to calculate both B and hw, then see which is smaller.

Given the data:

Mx = 20 amu
My = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms
Angular frequency w = 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, so first, let's compute the rotational constant B. B is given by (hbar²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. Right.

So, let's compute μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So Mx + My = 22 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but amu needs to be converted into kg because I is in kg m².

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 20/11 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016 → 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

20/11 = approximately 1.8181818... amu.

Multiply by 1.6605e-27 kg/amu:

1.8181818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

Now, R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is hbar²/(2I). Wait, hbar is Planck's constant over 2π, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for rotational energy levels is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in energy units (J). Or perhaps B is in cm^-1, but in terms of energy, it's E = B J (J+1), where B is in terms of energy.

Alternatively, the rotational constant B is given by (h²)/(8π² I c), but I'm a bit confused—maybe I should look up the formula.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ R². The rotational constant B is defined in spectroscopy as B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), but that's for wavenumbers, I think. Alternatively, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is (h²)/(8 π² I), but then that's in joules.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant B in terms of energy.

So, E_rot = (ħ² / (2 I)) * J (J +1). Because the energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = (ħ² J (J +1))/(2 I), where J is the rotational quantum number.

Wait, ħ is hbar. So, ħ = h/(2π). So, ħ squared is h²/(4π²).

Therefore, E_J = [ (h²/(4 π²)) * J (J+1) ] / (2 I )

= (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I )

So, the rotational constant B is h²/(8 π² I). So, B = h²/(8 π² I).

So, I have I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Let me plug in the numbers.

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

So h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Then, 8 π² is about 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So, denominator is 78.9568 * I = 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 95.29e-46 → 9.529e-45.

Wait, wait, no. 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 = let me compute:

78.9568 * 1.2064 ≈ 95.29 → so 95.29e-46.

So, B = (4.39e-67) / (95.29e-46) ) = (4.39e-67) / (9.529e-45) )

Wait, 4.39e-67 / 9.529e-45 = approx 4.39/9.529 * 1e-22 → 0.4608 * 1e-22 → 4.608e-23 J.

Wait, so B is approximately 4.608e-23 J.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 6.626^2 = approx 43.9, so 43.9e-68 → 4.39e-67.

Denominator is 8 pi^2 I = 8*(9.8696)=78.9568. Multiply by I=1.2064e-46 → 78.9568 *1.2064e-46 → let's compute 78.9568 * 1.2064:

78.9568 * 1.2 = approx 94.748, 78.9568 * 0.0064= approx 0.505. So total approx 95.253 → 95.253e-46.

So denominator is 9.5253e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.5253e-45 = (4.39 /9.5253 ) *1e-22 → 0.4608 *1e-22 → 4.608e-23 J.

So each rotational level J has energy E_J = (ħ² J(J+1))/(2I) = same as (h² J(J+1))/(8 pi² I) ), which is B * J(J+1), where B = h²/(8 pi² I ), which is what I calculated.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be E(1) - E(0) = B*(1*2) - B*(0*1) ) = 2B - 0 = 2B.

But wait, no, E_J = B J (J+1), so E(0) = 0, E(1)= 2B.

So ΔE_rot = 2B = 2*4.608e-23 J = 9.216e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels for J are E_J = B J (J+1), so the transition from J=0 to J=1 would require a photon of energy equal to 2B.

Alternatively, another approach is that the energy spacing between adjacent J levels is (E_{J+1} - E_J) = B*( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) )) = B*( (J^2 + 3J + 2) - (J^2 + J) )) = B*( 2J + 2 ) = 2B (J+1). So for J=0, the spacing is 2B.

So the energy required for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

Now, the vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 is E = h w. Because the vibrational energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) h w. So ΔE_vib = h w (1 + 1/2 -0 -1/2 ) = h w (1) = h w.

Given that w is 4e14 rad/s. So h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, let's compare the two energy changes. The rotational transition requires 9.216e-23 J, the vibrational requires 2.65e-19 J.

So clearly, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon needed would correspond to the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon would need to have the energy corresponding to the lower of the two ΔE's.

So since ΔE_rot is much smaller, the photon's energy is hν = 9.216e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because the photon's energy is related to its momentum. Since for a photon, E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light.

So p = E/c.

So p = (9.216e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 3.072e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are of that magnitude. The options are around 1e-27 to 2e-27 kg·m/s. Hmm, that's way bigger than my calculation.

Wait, am I making a mistake here? Did I compute B correctly?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me double-check.

Wait, B is h²/(8 pi² I), correct?

h is 6.626e-34, h² is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 pi² I. I is 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

So 8 pi² is about 78.9568.

So 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 = 95.25e-46 kg·m².

So denominator is 9.525e-45 kg·m².

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in exponents. Let me compute 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 correctly.

78.9568 * 1.2064 = 95.25.

So 95.25e-46 → 9.525e-45.

So denominator is 9.525e-45.

So B = h²/(8 pi² I) = 4.39e-67 / 9.525e-45.

Compute that:

4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 = (4.39 /9.525) * 1e-22.

4.39 /9.525 ≈ 0.4608.

So 0.4608e-22 J → 4.608e-23 J.

So E_rot = 2B = 9.216e-23 J.

Wait, but the problem is that the photon's momentum would be E/c = 9.216e-23 / 3e8 = 3.072e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are around 1e-27, which is about 1e4 times larger.

Hmm. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia.

Wait, I = μ R².

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

And μ is 20/11 amu, which is approximately 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605 = approx 3.016e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg·m². That's correct.

Hmm. So the calculation of B seems correct. So why is the photon momentum way off from the options?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a rotational transition but a vibrational transition. Because the options are way higher than what I calculated.

Wait, but if the photon is causing a vibrational transition, then the energy is h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, the momentum would be E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.83e-28 is not among the options. The closest would be option B and C, but those are larger.

Wait, so perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so perhaps n=0 and J=0.

If the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon, what is the next state with the lowest possible energy?

Wait, the next state could be either the next vibrational state (n=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (n=0, J=1). Which of these transitions requires less energy?

Because the energy required for a vibrational transition is hw, which is 2.65e-19 J, and the rotational transition is 2B = 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So which transition is possible?

But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions are only allowed when delta J = ±2, but when you have a non-rigid rotor (vibrational-rotational coupling), perhaps other transitions are allowed.

Wait, but perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the selection rules are different. Or maybe the question is only considering vibrational transitions, or only considering rotational.

Wait, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, so perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both. So the molecule's energy is the sum of its rotational and vibrational energies.

But the problem is about moving from the fundamental state to the next state with the lowest energy. So perhaps the next state is the first excited rotational state (J=1) with the same vibrational state (n=0), but that would require the energy of the rotational transition.

Alternatively, maybe the next state is the first vibrational excited state (n=1) but with J=0.

So which has a lower energy? Let's compute both ΔE.

ΔE_rot = 2B ≈9.2e-23 J.

ΔE_vib = hw = 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition requires much less energy, so that must be the next state.

But earlier calculation gives p_photon ≈3.07e-31 kg m/s, but the options are around 1e-27, which is a discrepancy of about 1e4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me re-calculate B.

Alternative approach: Compute the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula for B.

Wait, another way to compute B is using the formula B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), where c is the speed of light, but that would give B in cm^-1 (wavenumbers). But that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy. Let me double-check. The energy levels for rotation are E_J = (ħ² J(J+1))/(2I). So for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = (ħ² (1)(2))/(2I) ) = ( ħ² * 2 )/(2I ) = ħ²/(I).

So, ΔE_rot = ħ^2 / I.

Wait, but I thought earlier that B is h²/(8 pi² I), which is (ħ^2)/(2 I) because ħ = h/(2 pi).

Wait, let me compute:

ħ = h/(2 pi), so ħ^2 = h²/(4 pi²).

So, ΔE_rot = (h²/(4 pi²)) / I.

= h²/(4 pi² I).

Wait, earlier calculation of B was h²/(8 pi² I), which would have been for E_J= B J (J+1) where B is in energy units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me define E_J correctly.

The energy levels for a rigid rotor are given by E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), yes.

So E_1 - E_0 = (ħ² * 2 ) / (2 I ) = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

So substituting ħ = h/(2 pi):

ΔE_rot = (h/(2 pi))² / I = h²/(4 pi² I).

So in this case, I have I=1.2064e-46 kg m².

So h² is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

So: 4.39e-67 / (4 pi² * 1.2064e-46) ) 

4 pi² is about 39.478.

So denominator: 39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.62e-46 → 4.762e-45.

So ΔE_rot = 4.39e-67 /4.762e-45 ≈ (4.39/4.762) * 1e-22.

4.39/4.762 ≈ 0.922.

So 0.922e-22 J → 9.22e-23 J.

Same as before.

So, the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 9.22e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options:

Options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, C) 1.1e-27, D) 1.4e-28.

Hmm, none of these match 3e-31. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is about the vibrational transition. Let's compute the momentum for that.

E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.835e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. So 8.835e-28 is not an option. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, and the photon's energy must account for both. But I don't think that's the case. Usually, a photon causes a transition of a single quantum, either rotational or vibrational, not both.

Wait, maybe the model is such that the molecule's energy is a combination of rotation and vibration, but the next state is a higher rotational state with the same vibrational state.

Hmm. But then, the calculation I did earlier for the rotational transition would be the correct approach, but the answer is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor approximation, not the non-rigid. No, the question says the non-rigid rotor model.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model includes vibrational motion, so the bond length is variable. But in the calculation of the moment of inertia, maybe I should use an average bond length, but I used R=2 angstroms. Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given as R=2 angstroms, but for the vibration, perhaps the reduced mass should be calculated differently, but I don't think so.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the photon's energy corresponds to the transition from the ground vibrational state (n=0) and ground rotational state (J=0) to the next state, which is either n=0, J=1 or n=1, J=0.

So the molecule must have the next higher energy state. The next higher state could be the higher rotational or the higher vibrational, whichever has lower energy.

Wait, but we saw that the energy of the rotational transition is much lower than the vibrational. So the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition.

So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s (since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s).

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transitions but only vibrational. Because in the rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions require certain selection rules, but in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the selection rules are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is the next vibrational state, n=1, regardless of rotation, but that would require higher energy.

But why is the photon's momentum not matching any of the options? Let me think again.

Wait, wait a second. Could the problem be asking about the change in linear momentum of the molecule? No, the question is about the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the photon's momentum differently. Oh wait, no, for a photon, E = pc, so p = E / c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass but in a different way. Or perhaps I should calculate the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers and then convert to energy.

Wait, another approach: compute the rotational constant in wavenumbers (cm^-1) and then find the energy.

B (in cm^-1) = h/(8 pi² c I).

Hmm, let's compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c is 3e8 m/s. I is 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So,

B = h/(8 pi² c I ) 

= (6.626e-34) / (8 *9.8696 *3e8 *1.2064e-46 )

Compute denominator:

8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8 = 2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.2064e-46 = 2.3687e10 *1.2064e-46 = 2.86e-36.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 2.86e-36 → 23.17 cm^-1.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B = 46.34 cm^-1.

But how to convert that into joules? Because 1 cm^-1 is approximately 1.986e-23 J.

So 46.34 cm^-1 *1.986e-23 J/cm^-1 ≈ 9.22e-22 J.

Wait, that's larger than my previous calculation. Oh wait, no, that's 9.22e-22 J, which is 0.922e-21 J.

Wait, earlier I got 9.22e-23 J, so a factor of 100 difference.

Hmm. Let me see where that discrepancy comes from.

Wait, when I compute B in terms of energy earlier, I used E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I). But when B is 23.17 cm^-1, it's in terms of wavenumbers, which are cm^-1.

Wait, 1 cm^-1 corresponds to E = hc cm^-1. So for 1 cm^-1, E = 6.626e-34 J s *3e8 m/s * 1e-2 m/cm → 6.626e-34 *3e8 *0.01 = 2.65e-28 J.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 cm^-1 is E = hc * (cm^-1) → h is in J s, c is m/s → so hc is J m.

So E = hc * cm^-1 = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) * (1 cm^-1)

Wait, 1 cm^-1 = 0.01 m^-1. So E = 6.626e-34 *3e8 * 0.01 = 6.626e-34 *3e6 = 1.9878e-27 J.

So for B=23.17 cm^-1, E_rot = 2 *23.17 * 1.9878e-27 J.

Wait, 23.17 *1.9878e-27 ≈ 46.1e-27 J. Multiply by 2 gives 92.2e-27 → 9.22e-26 J.

Wait, that's 9.22e-26 J, which is much larger than the previous 9.22e-23 J.

This suggests that I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of B expressed in cm^-1.

Because when B is 23.17 cm^-1, each cm^-1 corresponds to 1.986e-23 J.

So E_rot transition is 2 *23.17 cm^-1 → 46.34 cm^-1.

So E = 46.34 * 1.986e-23 J/cm^-1 → 46.34 *1.986e-23 ≈ 9.22e-22 J.

That's 9.22e-22 J, which is larger than the earlier calculation.

So now, the photon's energy is 9.22e-22 J.

Momentum p = E/c =9.22e-22 /3e8 ≈3.07e-29 kg m/s.

But the options are 1e-28 to 2e-27, which is about 1e3 times larger.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's compute the rotational constant B in terms of energy.

The formula for the rotational energy levels is E_J = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1) → E_J = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 pi² I).

So, I have I = μ R².

μ = (20 *2) / (20 +2) amu = 20/11 amu → 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg → μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg → approx 3.016e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = h²/(8 pi² I).

h =6.626e-34 J s.

h²= (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² I → 8*(9.8696) *1.2064e-46 → 78.9568 *1.2064e-46 → 95.25e-46 → 9.525e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 → 4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 =4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 → 4.39 /9.525 is about 0.4608 → 0.4608e-22 → 4.608e-23 J.

So ΔE = 2B =9.216e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.216e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c =9.216e-23 /3e8 =3.072e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way off. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, and my initial calculation was correct, but I miscalculated the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy.

Wait, w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s ≈8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is not present.

So perhaps I've made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Maybe that refers to the ground state of both rotation and vibration, so n=0 and J=0. But the question is about the next state, which could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. The one with lower energy is the rotational transition.

But why the photon's momentum is not matching any option. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the transition to the next state as a vibrational transition, and that the rotational transition is not allowed. But that would require the photon's momentum to be 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the vibrational transition, but the given options are off? Or perhaps I messed up the exponents in calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation of the vibrational energy.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w =4e14 s^-1.

So E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, so 8.8e-28 isn't an option. The closest is option A:1.9e-28.

But that's about a factor of 4.6 difference.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of w. Let me recheck.

Given w =4e14 rad/s. Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the frequency in terms of cm^-1, but no, the calculation is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require 6B.

But earlier, 2B was 9.2e-23 J, 6B would be 2.76e-22 J. Then p_photon would be 9.2e-23 /3e8 → no, wait, 2.76e-22 J → p=9.2e-23 kg m/s.

No, that's still way below the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the momentum of both the photon and the molecule, but that's not the case. The question is about the photon's momentum.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the molecule's mass is the reduced mass. Wait, no, because the photon's momentum doesn't depend on the molecule's mass.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the angular frequency in terms of 2pi, but no, the given w is already in rad/s.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy in terms of the rotational constant R, which is B = h/(8 pi c I), but no, that's for wavenumbers.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the transition that involves both rotation and vibration, so the photon provides enough energy to change both. But that would be a combination, but I don't think that's the usual approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as the first vibrational state (n=1) but that doesn't make sense because the ground state is n=0.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the Raman transition, which allows changes in J by ±2 and involves vibrational and rotational changes, but that's more complex and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of both the rotational and vibrational transitions. But that would be a much higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, when I compute the vibrational transition, p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is about 8.8e-28.

The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is about a factor of 4.6 smaller. Could I have made a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps the bond length is 2 angstroms, but the moment of inertia uses the radius, not the bond length. Oh wait, no, the moment of inertia is μ R², where R is the bond length.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in atomic mass units (amu) without converting to kg. Let me see what happens if I do that.

Wait, no, the formula for I requires mass in kg because the units of I are kg m². So using μ in amu would give wrong units.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the bond length in a different unit.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy using the formula E = (1/2) I ω², where ω is the angular velocity.

But for a diatomic molecule, ω is the rotational angular velocity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is given by E = (ħ²)/(2I), which is the ground state energy (J=0). So the first excited rotational state (J=1) would be E = 2*(ħ²)/(2I) )= (ħ²)/(I) → same as earlier.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one is closest to what I calculate.

Wait, when I calculated the vibrational transition, I got p_photon =8.8e-28 kg m/s.

The options are A)1.9e-28, which is about 1/4 of that.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the given data.

Wait, the given angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. What if it's actually 4e13 rad/s? Then E would be 6.626e-34 *4e13 =2.65e-20 J.

p_photon =2.65e-20 /3e8 =8.83e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in momentum of the molecule, but that doesn't make sense because the molecule's momentum change would be due to the photon's momentum. But the question specifically asks for the photon's momentum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in a different way. Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the moment of inertia is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

But the problem gives Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

Which is 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm not finding any error in the calculations, but the answer isn't among the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to select the closest option, but none of them match.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in the initial approach. Because the question says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which implies that it's a vibration-rotation model, where the bond length can change. So perhaps the energy levels include both vibrational and rotational contributions.

In that model, the energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot.

The ground state is n=0, J=0.

The next state could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1.

Which transition requires less energy?

As before, ΔE_rot is 9.2e-23 J, ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition is lower in energy, so the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition where both J and n change, but I don't think that's the case. Maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first allowed state, which might be a vibrational and rotational change, but that would require more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition from the ground state to the next vibrational state, which requires the photon's energy to be hw. So the momentum is 8.83e-28 kg m/s, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state (n=1, J=0), which requires the vibrational transition. So the photon's energy is hw, and the momentum is E/c.

Which gives p_photon ≈8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, A is 1.9e-28, D is1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.83e-28 is approximately 4.9 times larger than option A, and about 6.3 times larger than option D.

But none of the options match. I'm stuck. Maybe I should re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Perhaps that refers to the state with the lowest energy, which is n=0, J=0. The next state is the first excited state, which could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1.

As before, the lower energy transition is J=1, so the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the correct approach is to go with the vibrational transition, even though it's higher in energy. But that would be the only option that gives an answer in the options' range.

Wait, but the options don't include 8.8e-28. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy of the photon causing a transition to the next state, which is the first state with higher energy, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational.

So comparing the two ΔE's, the rotational ΔE is smaller, so that's the next state.

Thus, the correct photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg m/s, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the given options have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using w in terms of 2π, but no, the given w is already in rad/s.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to be equal to the sum of the rotational and vibrational ground state energies. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require 6B. Let's see.

6B =6 *4.608e-23 =2.765e-22 J.

p_photon=2.765e-22/3e8=9.217e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the momentum of the molecule, not the photon. But the question explicitly asks for the photon's momentum.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is using the formula p = h/wavelength, but wavelength is c/f, but I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, given that the photon's energy is E = h f = h c /lambda, but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the given options and see if any match my calculations.

My initial calculation for the rotational transition gives p_photon =3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s.

Looking at the options, none match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, which requires energy hw, and thus p= h w / c.

So, p = (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (2.65e-19)/3e8≈8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is 1.9e-28, but it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the given w is 4e13 rad/s. Let me recalculate with that.

If w=4e13 rad/s:

E =6.626e-34 *4e13 =2.65e-20 J.

p_photon=2.65e-20/3e8=8.83e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm really not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The closest to my vibrational calculation is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28).

Wait, 8.83e-28 is about 4.6 times option A, which is 1.9e-28. So that's not close.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for Planck's constant. Let me check the exact value. Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J s.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is computed differently. Let me recompute ΔE_rot.

ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) → since E_J= (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I) → ΔE= E_1 - E_0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/I.

So ħ = h/(2 pi).

So ħ² = h²/(4 pi²).

Thus, ΔE_rot = h²/(4 pi² I).

Calculating with I=1.2064e-46 kg m².

h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

4 pi² I =4 *9.8696 *1.2064e-46 → 4*9.8696≈39.478, *1.2064e-46 → 47.6e-46 →4.76e-45.

So ΔE_rot=4.39e-67 /4.76e-45 = 9.22e-23 J.

Same as before.

So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct approach is to select the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, which gives p_photon≈8.8e-28, and see if any options match.

But the only option close is A)1.9e-28 and D)1.4e-28. Since 8.8e-28 is not present, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the vibrational energy calculation.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 s^-1.

E = h w →6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized differently, and the transition is not purely rotational or vibrational, but a combination. But I don't know how to calculate that.

In summary, I think the correct photon's momentum is 8.8e-28 kg m/s, but since that's not an option, I'm probably missing something. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Information and Calculations:
1. **Molecular Parameters**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]

4. **Rotational Constant**:
   The rotational constant \( B \) is given by:
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}
   \]
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
   \[
   B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.608 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The energy difference for a transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.608 \times 10^{-23} = 9.216 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

5. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{9.216 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.072 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]
   This value is far smaller than any of the provided options.

6. **Vibrational Transition**:
   The energy of a photon required for a vibrational transition from \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.6504 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{2.6504 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.835 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]
   This value is approximately \( 4.6 \times 10^1 \) times larger than the closest option, \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, the calculated photon momentum for the rotational transition (\( 3.072 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)) does not match any of the provided options. For the vibrational transition, the calculated momentum (\( 8.835 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)) is also not an exact match but is closest to option **A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)). Given the discrepancy, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: A**
