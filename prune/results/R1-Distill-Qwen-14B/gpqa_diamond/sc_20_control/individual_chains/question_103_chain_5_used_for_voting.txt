Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I'll try to understand the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So breaking it down, the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromo group, and position 5 has a nitro group. Additionally, there's an ethanone group attached to the ring. Wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone, meaning it's a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a CH2 group. So the structure would be a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ethanone group at position 1. Wait, benzene is a ring of six; the numbering might be such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is in the para position relative to nitro, and meta to bromo? Hmm, not sure about the exact positions yet.

Wait, wait. Let me draw this. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5 of the phenyl ring. If I imagine the phenyl group attached to the ketone (which is at position 1), then positions 2,3,4,5,6 are the substituents around. So, if the ketone is at position 1, then position 3 is two carbons away (meta) and position 5 would be four away (para), but that doesn't make sense because on a benzene ring, all positions are either adjacent (ortho), two away (meta), or three away (para).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituents in a different way. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That means the ethanone is attached to the phenyl ring, and the phenyl has bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the point of attachment.

So the benzene ring is substituted at three positions: where it's connected to the ethanone (let's say that's position 1), bromo at position 3, and nitro at position 5. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring; positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other. So the substituents are at positions 1,3,5? Wait no, the ethanone is at position 1 (the point of attachment), and then substituents in positions 3 and 5. So the substituents are on the same ring, but in a meta arrangement relative to each other, but I need to figure out the order of adding these groups.

I remember that when you substitute benzene, the order in which you add substituents can affect the positions where the next substituent adds. Nitration, bromination, acylation, etc., each have different directing effects.

Let me think about the directing effects. The nitro group is a strong meta director. Bromine, when attached to benzene, is also a meta director. The acetyl group (from ethanone) is an acyl group, which is a meta director as well. Wait, no, wait. Acetyl is an activating group? No, wait, the acetyl (COCH3) is actually a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So it's a meta director.

Wait, no, wait. The acetyl group is an acyl group attached to the ring. Acyl groups are meta directors because they are deactivating (they withdraw electrons via the carbonyl group).

So, my target has three substituents: Br at position 3, NO2 at position 5, and the ketone at position 1. Wait, but that's three substituents on the benzene ring. How do I get them all in the correct positions?

Wait, the starting material is benzene. So I need to add three substituents: the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups. But the order in which I add them will determine the positions.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and on the phenyl ring, substituents are at 3 and 5. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone group (as the main substituent), Br at position 3, and nitro at position 5.

So the ketone is the first substituent. Then, the next substituents (Br and nitro) need to be added in the correct positions.

Wait, but how? Let's think about the reaction steps.

The first step is to introduce the ketone group. How? One way is through Friedel-Crafts acylation. That would add an acyl group to benzene, right? So benzene reacts with CH3COCl (acetyl chloride) in the presence of AlCl3 as a catalyst. So that would give acetophenone (phenyl ketone).

Once we have acetophenone, the next step is to add bromine and nitro groups. But the order matters because the substituents will direct the next reaction.

Wait, but wait. Acetophenone is substituted at position 1 (since it's the first substituent). Now, when we add another substituent, say bromine, it will be directed by the existing substituent.

The acetophenone group is a meta director. So bromination (using Br2 with FeBr3 as a catalyst) would add bromine in the meta position relative to the ketone. So that would be position 3.

After that, when adding the nitro group, where would it go? The ring now has substituents at positions 1 (ketone) and 3 (Br). The Br is a meta director, and the ketone is also a meta director. But in a benzene ring with two substituents, the next substituent will go into the position that is meta to both, if possible.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. Position 1 has the ketone, position 3 has Br. So the ring looks like:

Positions: 1 (COCH3), 2,3 (Br), 4,5,6.

Now, adding nitro group. The existing substituents are meta directors. So for each existing substituent, the next substituent would be placed meta to them. But let's see. The ketone (position 1) directs meta, which is position 4. The Br (position 3) directs meta, which is position 6.

But where can the nitro group go to satisfy both? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first before the Br. So maybe the order is different.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added after the ketone. Let's think again. Let's say the first substituent is the ketone (position 1). Then, we add nitro group next. Since the ketone is a meta director, the nitro would enter position 4 or position 3 perhaps? Wait, no, the ketone is at 1, so meta is 4. Wait, benzene numbering: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a circle.

So position 1, the ketone; position 3 is ortho to 2, meta to 4. Wait, perhaps the nitro group would enter at position 3 if we add it next.

Wait, no. Let me visualize. Benzene ring with substituent at position 1. The positions ortho to 1 are 2 and 6. Meta are 3 and 5. Para is 4. So if the substituent is at 1, the next substituent would go into 3 or 5 if it's meta.

So if I add nitro next, it would go to position 3 or 5. Then, when I add Br, where would it go? Let's consider each possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the ketone, then the Br. Let me think.

Wait, the target has nitro at 5, Br at 3, and ketone at 1. So in the final structure, the substituents are at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So relative to each other, the Br is meta to nitro (positions 3 and 5 are adjacent), no. Wait, positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other (three positions apart on the ring). Position 1 is para to position 4, and meta to positions 2 and 6.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this by thinking about the steps in the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each is a list of reactions. Let's take option A:

A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation) → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Since the ring has acetophenone (meta director), Br would add at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br). Which are both meta directors. So where would nitration occur?

The existing substituents would direct the next group to positions that are meta to both. Let's see, the COCH3 is at 1, which would direct to 3 and 5 (but 3 is already occupied). The Br is at 3, which would direct to 6 and 1 (but 1 is occupied). Wait, that's not possible. So perhaps the nitration would be in position 5? Because it's meta to position 1, and ortho to position 3.

Wait, but the existing substituents are at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br). Let me draw this:

Positions:

1: COCH3

2: H

3: Br

4: H

5: H

6: H

Now, the next group (nitro) is to be added. The COCH3 at 1 directs meta, which is 4. But 4 is adjacent to 3 (Br is there), so perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the Br at 3 is a meta director, so directs to position 6 and 1 (but 1 is taken). Alternatively, maybe the nitration occurs at position 5, which is meta to the COCH3 (1 → 5 is two positions away, but wait, in a ring, from 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. Wait, position 3 is already taken. So the nitration would go to position 5. That way, it's meta to the COCH3 and para to the Br. Hmm, but the Br is at 3, so para would be position 7, which doesn't exist; it's a six-membered ring. Alternatively, position 5 is meta to Br (3) because it's two positions away. Wait, position 3's meta would be positions 6 and 1. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think about the general approach to synthesis. We need to introduce the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position based on the directing effects of existing groups.

The target has three substituents: COCH3, Br, and NO2. The ketone is the main substituent because it's part of the ethanone group. The Br and nitro are in the meta positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the nitro group, then the ketone, then the bromine. Or another order.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is added first, then the nitro, then the bromine.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitro group is added after the ketone and bromine. Let me think: if the ketone is added first, then bromine in the meta position (position 3), then nitration would occur where? Since the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br), which are both meta directors. The nitro group would go to a position that's meta to both.

Wait, the position that is meta to COCH3 at 1 is position 4 and position 5? Hmm, no. Wait, position 1's meta is 3 and 5. But position 3 is already taken by Br. So the next available meta position would be 5. So nitration would add at position 5.

So the steps would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation: benzene → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Bromination: add Br at position 3.

3. Nitration: add NO2 at position 5.

But wait, after step 2, the ring has COCH3 (1) and Br (3). Now, when nitrating, which substituent directs more strongly? Both are meta directors, but nitration is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Wait, no, nitration is an electrophilic substitution, and substituents can strongly influence where the next group goes.

Wait, in acetophenone, the COCH3 group is a meta director. Br is a meta director as well. So when adding nitro group, perhaps it goes into position 5, which is meta to COCH3 and para to Br. Wait, but Br is at 3, so position 5 would be meta to Br? Let me see:

Position 3 → positions 6 (ortho), 1 (meta), and 5 (para). Hmm, no, because in a benzene ring, position 3's meta is 6 and 1. So position 5 is two away from 3, which is ortho. So maybe the nitro would go to position 5 because it's meta to the ketone (1 → 5 is two away, which is meta).

So after adding Br and NO2, the structure would have substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which matches the target. So the steps would be:

1. Acylation → acetophenone.

2. Bromination → Br at 3.

3. Nitration → nitro at 5.

But wait, looking at the options, option A does acylation first, then bromination, then nitration. So that would result in the correct substituents. But wait, option A's third step is nitration, then after that, what? Let me look.

Option A: After nitration (step iii), then steps iv) Fe/HCl, which is probably a reduction. Wait, what's that for?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each option step by step.

Looking at option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation, acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination, adds Br at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration, adds nitro group at position 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro group to amine? But our target has a nitro group, so wouldn't want that.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? But the ring already has nitro.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but that's usually for amines.

vii) H3PO2 → maybe for a reduction, but not sure.

Wait, but our target has nitro and bromo groups, and the ketone. So after steps i-iii, the target would already be formed. Why would there be more steps? Unless the order isn't right.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added before the bromine. Let me think about that.

If I first acylate (step i), then nitrate (step ii), then brominate (step iii). What would happen?

After acylation, acetophenone (1-COCH3). Then nitration would add nitro at meta, position 3 or 5. Let's say we add it at position 3 (directed by the ketone). Then bromination would be directed by both COCH3 and NO2.

Wait, but where? The COCH3 is at 1, NO2 at 3. Both are meta directors.

So the available meta positions would be:

From COCH3: position 3 (taken by NO2) and 5.

From NO2: position 1 (taken by COCH3), position 5 (meta to 3), and position 6 (ortho to 3, which is meta to 1? Not sure. So the bromine might add at position 5.

So the substituents would be at 1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2), and 5 (Br). But the target requires Br at 3 and NO2 at 5. That doesn't match. So perhaps this isn't the right order.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the Br. Let me think again.

So, acylation first (step i), then bromination (step ii) → Br at 3. Then nitration (step iii) → NO2 at 5. So the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5. That's correct.

But then in option A, after nitration, there are more steps. So why would the reactions not stop at step iii? Because the target is already formed. So perhaps option A is not correct because the steps go beyond.

Looking at option A:

i) Acetophenone

ii) Br added at 3.

iii) Nitro added at 5.

Then, iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction, but target has nitro, so this would turn nitro into NH2. That would be bad.

So option A's steps iv onwards would change the structure, which we don't want. So option A is not correct.

Let me check option B.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Bromine is a meta director, so nitro would go to position 5 (assuming Br is at 1). Wait, bromobenzene has Br at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5, which are meta to Br.

Wait, but if Br is at position 1, nitration would go to 3 or 5. Let's say it goes to 3.

Then step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. The ring has Br (a deactivating group) and NO2 (also deactivating). So Friedel-Crafts won't work because the ring is deactivated. So can't add the ketone at that point.

So option B's step iii would not work. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene. But benzene is hard to nitrate without a catalyst. Wait, HNO3 and H2SO4 are typical nitrating agents. So first, nitration → nitrobenzene.

Then step ii: Fe/HCl → probably reduction. Nitro group reduced to amine. So now, we have aniline.

Step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. Aniline is strongly activating but it's a meta director. So the acetyl would add at position 3 or 5 relative to the amine.

Wait, but after reduction of nitro to amine, the ring is very activated. Friedel-Crafts can proceed, but the amine is a strong activating group, so acetylation would occur in the ortho or para positions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Option C's steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene (position 1: NO2).

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2. So now, benzene with NH2 at position 1.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. Since NH2 is a strong activating group (ortho/para director), the acetyl would go to ortho or para to NH2.

Assuming it goes to para (position 4), then after acylation, the substituents are at 1 (NH2) and 4 (COCH3). Then step iv: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. The directing effects now depend on the substituents.

The ring has NH2 (position 1, strong activating, ortho/para) and COCH3 (position 4, deactivating, meta). So the Br would be directed by the most activating group, which is NH2. So Br would add at ortho (position 2 or 6) or para (position 5) to NH2.

If Br adds at position 5 (para to NH2), then substituents are at 1 (NH2), 4 (COCH3), and 5 (Br). Then, step v: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. The ring has NH2 (strong activating, ortho/para), COCH3 (deactivating, meta), Br (deactivating, meta). So nitration would likely occur where? The most activating group is NH2, directing to ortho and para positions. But which positions are available?

Positions 1 (NH2), 2 (H), 3 (H), 4 (COCH3), 5 (Br), 6 (H).

NH2 at 1: ortho is 2 and 6; para is 4 (occupied by COCH3), so would go to 2 or 6. But after that, step vi: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, which requires an amine. But if we've already nitrated, maybe it's a different scenario.

This seems complicated, and the target requires Br and nitro groups in specific positions. I'm not sure if option C leads to the correct structure.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Wait, but after step ii, we have NH2. So step iii would form a diazonium salt, which upon heating, would undergo a reaction. But I'm not sure what happens next.

Wait, the steps in D:

i) Nitro group added.

ii) Reduced to NH2.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → usually a reducing agent, but used in some reactions, like the Stephen reduction.

Wait, perhaps after diazotization, the diazonium salt is treated with H3PO2, which can lead to substitution reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps after the nitro group is reduced to amine, and then diazotized, it's replaced by something else. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, but the target requires a nitro group. So if we reduce it to amine, and then in another step, perhaps it's converted back? But the steps don't show that. So option D doesn't seem right.

Let me get back to the correct order of reactions. The target has substituents at positions 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So I need to add these groups in such a way that each new group is directed correctly.

One approach is to first add the nitro group, then the ketone, then the bromine.

Wait, wait. Let's think:

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene (position 1).

2. Reduction of nitro to amine → aniline (NH2 at 1).

3. Friedel-Crafts acylation → add acetyl group. Aniline is a strong activating group (ortho/para director). So the acetyl would add at position 3 or 5 (ortho to NH2 at 1). Wait, no: position 1 has NH2, so ortho is 2 and 6, para is 4.

Wait, if the acetyl adds at position 4, then the ring has substituents at 1 (NH2) and 4 (COCH3). Then, bromination would be directed by the NH2 (activating) and the acetyl (deactivating). So Br would likely add ortho to NH2, at position 2 or 6.

But the target requires Br at 3 and NO2 at 5. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Acetophenone (COCH3 at 1).

2. Nitration → NO2 at 5.

3. Bromination → Br at 3.

But how would that work?

Wait, after acylation (COCH3 at 1), nitration would add NO2 at meta, which is 3 or 5. If nitration adds at 5, then bromination would add at 3.

Let me see: option A's steps are i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. But that would make Br at 3, then nitro at 5. Which is correct. Wait, but option A's steps go beyond that. Let me check again.

Option A's steps:

i) Acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → NO2 at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → Fe and HCl is for reduction, like reducing a nitro group to amine. But our target has nitro, so this would be a problem.

So, in option A, after step iii, the target is achieved. But the remaining steps (iv to vii) would alter the structure, which is not desired. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

So perhaps another option is correct. Let me think about each step of each option.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then the ketone, then bromine. But how would that work?

Let me see. If I first nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.

Then, perhaps reduce it to amine (step ii), but then acetylation would be directed by the amine (ortho/para). So acetophenone would be at position 3 or 5.

Wait, but then bromination would be directed by both the amine and the acetyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option D's steps could work.

Option D steps:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, forms diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps a reaction that replaces the diazonium group with something else, like a hydroxyl group. But I'm not entirely sure how H3PO2 would react here.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, it can undergo a coupling reaction, but that's more for when you have an activating group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. What's the target molecule again? It's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents are: ketone at position 1, Br at 3, NO2 at 5.

So perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce the ketone first.

2. Then nitro group.

3. Then bromine.

But in what order would that happen.

Wait, after introducing the ketone (step i: acetylation), the ring has COCH3 at 1.

Then, nitration: since COCH3 is a meta director, nitro would go to 3 or 5.

Assuming it goes to 5 (so position 5 has NO2).

Then bromination: the directing groups are COCH3 (meta) and NO2 (meta). So where would Br go?

The available meta positions relative to both would be position 3, which is meta to COCH3 (position 1 → 3) and meta to NO2 (position 5 → 3 is adjacent, which is ortho, not meta. Wait, position 5's meta is 2 and 8, which doesn't exist, so perhaps 2 and 8 are not viable. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the positions.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the meta directors.

After COCH3 (1) and NO2 (5), the next substituent (Br) will be placed in a position that's meta to both. Let's see:

The ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 5 (NO2).

Looking for a position that is meta to both:

- From COCH3 at 1: meta positions are 3 and 5.

- From NO2 at 5: meta positions are 2 and 8 (non-existent), or 2 and 8. So perhaps 2.

But position 3 is meta to COCH3 and position 2 is meta to NO2.

But if Br is added at position 3, it's meta to COCH3 (1), and para to NO2 (5). Is that possible? Because para to 5 would be position 2 (since 5's para is 2; 5 plus 3 is 8, which wraps around to 2). So position 2 is para to 5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider that after nitro is added at 5, the next substituent (Br) would be added at 3, which is meta to the ketone, but doesn't conflict with the nitro. So in that case, the substituents would be correctly placed.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetylation → COCH3 at 1.

2. Nitration → NO2 at 5.

3. Bromination → Br at 3.

If I can find an option that follows this order (acylation, nitration, bromination), that should be correct.

Looking at the options, none of them have acylation followed by nitration then bromination. Let me check each option's steps.

Option A: acylation, bromination, nitration. So Br is added before nitro, which would place Br at 3. Then nitro is added at 5. But after that, the steps continue, which would alter the structure, which isn't desired.

Option B: bromination first, then nitration, then acylation. But after bromination, the ring is deactivated, so acylation wouldn't work.

Option C: nitration first, then reduction, acylation, bromination, etc. Not sure.

Option D: nitration, reduction, diazotization, etc. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly match this order. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, and the subsequent steps are something else, but perhaps they don't affect the substituents.

Wait, option A's steps after iii) are:

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reducing nitro to amine. But that would ruin the nitro group, which we don't want. So option A can't be correct.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possibility of using directing groups and the order of adding substituents to avoid interference.

Another approach: The target has the ketone in position 1, Br in 3, and NO2 in 5. So perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because when adding substituents, the last one added is directed by all the previous groups.

So, the order would be:

1. Add ketone (COCH3) at 1.

2. Add Br at 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Add NO2 at 5 (meta to ketone, and para to Br).

But how to get NO2 at 5 after having added COCH3 and Br. Let me see:

After acylation and bromination, the substituents are at 1 and 3. Now, during nitration, the nitro group would be directed by both groups. COCH3 is a meta director, and Br is a meta director. So where can the nitro group go?

Looking for a position that is meta to both COCH3 and Br.

COCH3 at 1: meta positions 3 (occupied) and 5.

Br at 3: meta positions 6 and 1 (occupied).

So the only available position that is meta to COCH3 is 5.

So nitration would add nitro at 5.

So the correct order is acylation → bromination → nitration.

Which is what option A does, but then why does option A have more steps?

Wait, perhaps those additional steps are not part of the synthesis but are present in the options. Wait, no, the question is about the sequence of reactions leading to the target. So perhaps the steps in option A are longer but the target is achieved at step iii.

But the problem is that option A's steps go beyond, which would alter the structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, but the steps after iii are irrelevant or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in option A:

Steps:

i) Acetyl → acetophenone.

ii) Br → Br adds at 3.

iii) Nitro → adds at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → Fe and HCl is for reduction. Maybe reduces something else, but in the structure, we don't have a nitro group that needs reduction. Hmm. Or is it for another purpose?

Wait, perhaps after step iii, the target is achieved, and steps iv onwards are not part of the synthesis but are included in the option. But the question says, which sequence of reactions would lead to the target, so if the option includes steps beyond, but those steps don't affect the target, then it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, another possibility: after acetylation, nitration, then bromination. But that would make the nitro group at 5, then bromine would go where? Let's see.

But wait, after acylation and nitration, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 5. Now bromination would be directed by both. COCH3 is meta, NO2 is meta.

So bromine would go to position 3 (meta to COCH3) or position 2 (meta to NO2 at 5). But position 3 is meta to COCH3 and ortho to NO2. Alternatively, bromine would prefer to go where the directing groups cohere.

After COCH3 (1) and NO2 (5), the only position meta to both would be position 3.

So, in that case, the sequence would be:

i) Acetylation → position 1.

ii) Nitration → position 5.

iii) Bromination → position 3.

Which would give the target.

Looking for an option that follows this order.

Which option has acetylation first, then nitration, then bromination?

Looking at the options:

Option A: acetylation, bromination, nitration.

Option B: bromination, nitration, acetylation.

Option C: nitration, reduction, acetylation, bromination.

Option D: nitration, reduction, diazotization, etc.

Hmm, none of the options have the order acetylation, nitration, bromination. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then acetylate, then brominate.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring has a nitro group, which is deactivating. So Friedel-Crafts acylation (step requires activating ring) might not proceed. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless the nitro group is in a position that allows the acylation to occur. For example, if nitro is at position 3 and acylation occurs at position 1.

Wait, let's try this:

1. Nitration → nitro at position 1.

2. Reduction → amine at 1.

3. Acetylation → acetyl at position 3 (ortho to amine).

4. Bromination → directed by acetyl and amine.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, and the steps after iii are not relevant to the synthesis of the target, but are extra steps. But the question asks for the sequence that leads to the target, so any steps beyond would change the structure, making option A incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the nitro group is added after the bromine. Let me think again.

If I first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate:

After acetylation, the ring has COCH3 at 1.

Nitration adds NO2 at 5.

Bromination adds Br at 3.

Which matches the target.

So the correct order is acetylation → nitration → bromination.

Looking for an option with this order, but none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps in the options. Let me re-examine the options.

Option A's steps:

i) acylation → COCH3.

ii) bromination → Br at 3.

iii) nitration → NO2 at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces something, but target has nitro. So this would be a problem.

Option B: bromination first → Br at 1. Then nitration → NO2 at 3. Then acylation, but Friedel-Crafts won't work because Br is deactivating. So this is impossible.

Option C: nitration first → NO2 at 1. Then reduction → NH2. Then acylation → COCH3 at 4 (para to NH2). Then bromination → Br at 2 or 6 (ortho to NH2). Then another nitration, which would go where? After that, diazotization and H3PO2, but I'm not sure.

Option D: nitration, then reduction, then diazotization, then H3PO2.

Wait, perhaps option D's steps:

i) Nitration → NO2 at 1.

ii) Reduction → NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazotization → N2+Cl- at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps reduction to CH2NH2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, it's treated with H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent), leading to substitution of the diazo group with a hydroxyl group. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, it's heated with H3PO2 to replace the diazo group with a hydrogen, giving toluene derivative. But I'm not certain.

In any case, this doesn't seem to lead to the target.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the target.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the Br.

So:

1. Acetylate → COCH3 at 1.

2. Brominate → Br at 3.

3. Nitrate → NO2 at 5.

Which matches the target.

So the correct steps are i) acylate, ii) brominate, iii) nitrate.

Which is exactly what option A does.

But then, in option A, after step iii, they have more steps. So why are those steps there?

Wait, perhaps the nitration is not step iii. Let me look again:

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → Fe and HCl, perhaps reducing the nitro group to NH2. That would change the structure, which we don't want.

So, option A's steps would actually produce the target after step iii, and then steps iv onwards would alter it, which is not correct.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about the effect of steps iv onwards. Let me think.

iv) Fe/HCl → probably a reduction of a nitro group to amine. So, if after step iii, the target has nitro, using Fe/HCl would reduce it to NH2, which is not desired. So option A would not yield the target.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the target isn't as I thought. Let me recheck the target structure.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents are on the phenyl group attached to the ketone. So the phenyl part is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl.

So, the ketone is attached to the benzene ring, which has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, perhaps the position of the ketone is at position 1, and then Br at 3, nitro at 5. So the ring has three substituents: ketone (1), Br (3), nitro (5).

So, the order of adding substituents would be ketone first, then Br, then nitro.

But how?

Wait, maybe the correct order is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro at 5.

3. Brominate acetophenone → Br at 3.

But in reality, I think when you have multiple substituents, the order in which you add them affects where they go.

So, after acetylation, the ring has COCH3 (position 1). Then, nitrating would add nitro at 3 or 5. Let's say at 5. Then brominating would add at 3. That would give the correct substituents.

So the reactions would be:

i) Acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

iii) Bromination → Br at 3.

Which is the same as option A's first three steps. But option A then proceeds to steps iv and beyond, which would alter the structure.

So, perhaps the correct option is A, but the steps after iii are not part of the synthesis, or perhaps the question assumes that the correct sequence stops at step iii. But the options are all seven steps, so I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to pick the option where the correct substituents are added in the right order, regardless of the extra steps. But that doesn't make sense because the extra steps would affect the product.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the numbering of the substituents. Maybe the ketone is attached to the ring, and the bromo and nitro groups are in the correct positions relative to each other regardless of the order.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added first, then the ketone, then the bromine. Let me think:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

2. Reduce nitro to NH2 → amine at 1.

3. Acetylate → acetyl at 3 or 5 (depending on the director).

Wait, but after reduction, you have aniline. Friedel-Crafts acylation would add the acetyl group at the ortho or para positions relative to the amine. So if you have amine at 1, the acetyl could be at 3 (ortho) or 4 (para).

If it's added at 3, then the ring has NH2 at 1, COCH3 at 3.

Then, brominating would be directed by both NH2 (ortho/para) and COCH3 (meta). So Br would add at position 5 (meta to COCH3) or position 2 or 6 (ortho to NH2).

If Br adds at position 5, the substituents would be 1 (NH2), 3 (COCH3), 5 (Br). Then, perhaps the NH2 is oxidized back to nitro, but the steps don't show that.

This is getting too complicated. I think I've spent enough time thinking through this, and the best conclusion I can reach is that the correct sequence is option A, but the steps after iii would ruin the product. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me think about the possibility that the ketone is introduced in a later step, perhaps through an acylation after activating the ring.

Wait, another approach: the order of reactions must allow for each substituent to be added in the correct position without conflicting with the existing groups.

The correct order is to add the nitro group after the ketone and bromine. Or perhaps the nitro group is added last.

Wait, I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, the correct sequence is acetylation, bromination, nitration (option A's steps i, ii, iii), but the option includes further steps which would alter the structure. Therefore, perhaps none of the options are correct. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that option A's steps continue beyond the target. Let me re-examine the steps in option A:

A) i) Acetophenone.

ii) Br at 3.

iii) Nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → this would reduce nitro to NH2, which we don't want.

So, option A is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is none of the above. But the question provides four options, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing it.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then acetylate, then brominate. But I thought that after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making acetylation difficult.

Wait, but if the nitro group is in a position that allows the acetyl to add in a suitable position, perhaps it's possible.

Let me think:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

2. Acetylate → but the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. So this is not possible.

Thus, the correct option must be option A, assuming that the steps beyond iii are not part of the synthesis, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the target doesn't require the steps beyond iii, and the question is only about the correct sequence leading up to the target. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but the steps iv onwards are extraneous.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed in step iii, and the rest of the steps are for something else, but the question is about the overall sequence, which includes all steps.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the correct order is acetylation, bromination, nitration, which is option A's first three steps. Therefore, the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in an order that ensures each new group is added in the correct position based on the directing effects of the existing groups. The target molecule has a ketone group (COCH3) at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group (NO2) at position 5 on the benzene ring.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone group at position 1, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) adds bromine at position 3, which is meta to the ketone group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) adds the nitro group at position 5, which is meta to the ketone group and para to the bromine.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve Fe/HCl, HNO3/H2SO4, NaNO2/HCl, and H3PO2. These reactions are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and would alter the structure, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) introduces bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) adds the nitro group at position 3, which is meta to bromine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) attempts to introduce the ketone group. However, the ring is deactivated by the bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation impossible. This option is incorrect.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine (-NH2) at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone group. However, the amine group strongly activates the ring, directing the ketone to the ortho or para positions relative to the amine. This would result in the ketone being at position 3 or 4, which does not match the target structure.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps include bromination, nitration, diazotization, and reduction, but they do not lead to the correct substitution pattern. This option is incorrect.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine (-NH2) at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) forms a diazonium salt at position 1.
4. **Step iv**: Reduction with H3PO2 replaces the diazonium group with a hydrogen atom, leaving no nitro group. This sequence does not lead to the target molecule, making this option incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is acetylation, bromination, and nitration. This corresponds to the first three steps of **Option A**. However, the additional steps in Option A (iv–vii) are unnecessary and would alter the structure of the target molecule. Despite this, none of the other options provide a valid sequence for synthesizing the target molecule. Therefore, **Option A** is the best choice, assuming the extra steps are disregarded or considered irrelevant to the synthesis.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I'll try to understand the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So breaking it down, the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromo group, and position 5 has a nitro group. Additionally, there's an ethanone group attached to the ring. Wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone, meaning it's a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a CH2 group. So the structure would be a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ethanone group at position 1. Wait, benzene is a ring of six; the numbering might be such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is in the para position relative to nitro, and meta to bromo? Hmm, not sure about the exact positions yet.

Wait, wait. Let me draw this. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5 of the phenyl ring. If I imagine the phenyl group attached to the ketone (which is at position 1), then positions 2,3,4,5,6 are the substituents around. So, if the ketone is at position 1, then position 3 is two carbons away (meta) and position 5 would be four away (para), but that doesn't make sense because on a benzene ring, all positions are either adjacent (ortho), two away (meta), or three away (para).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituents in a different way. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That means the ethanone is attached to the phenyl ring, and the phenyl has bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the point of attachment.

So the benzene ring is substituted at three positions: where it's connected to the ethanone (let's say that's position 1), bromo at position 3, and nitro at position 5. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring; positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other. So the substituents are at positions 1,3,5? Wait no, the ethanone is at position 1 (the point of attachment), and then substituents in positions 3 and 5. So the substituents are on the same ring, but in a meta arrangement relative to each other, but I need to figure out the order of adding these groups.

I remember that when you substitute benzene, the order in which you add substituents can affect the positions where the next substituent adds. Nitration, bromination, acylation, etc., each have different directing effects.

Let me think about the directing effects. The nitro group is a strong meta director. Bromine, when attached to benzene, is also a meta director. The acetyl group (from ethanone) is an acyl group, which is a meta director as well. Wait, no, wait. Acetyl is an activating group? No, wait, the acetyl (COCH3) is actually a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So it's a meta director.

Wait, no, wait. The acetyl group is an acyl group attached to the ring. Acyl groups are meta directors because they are deactivating (they withdraw electrons via the carbonyl group).

So, my target has three substituents: Br at position 3, NO2 at position 5, and the ketone at position 1. Wait, but that's three substituents on the benzene ring. How do I get them all in the correct positions?

Wait, the starting material is benzene. So I need to add three substituents: the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups. But the order in which I add them will determine the positions.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and on the phenyl ring, substituents are at 3 and 5. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone group (as the main substituent), Br at position 3, and nitro at position 5.

So the ketone is the first substituent. Then, the next substituents (Br and nitro) need to be added in the correct positions.

Wait, but how? Let's think about the reaction steps.

The first step is to introduce the ketone group. How? One way is through Friedel-Crafts acylation. That would add an acyl group to benzene, right? So benzene reacts with CH3COCl (acetyl chloride) in the presence of AlCl3 as a catalyst. So that would give acetophenone (phenyl ketone).

Once we have acetophenone, the next step is to add bromine and nitro groups. But the order matters because the substituents will direct the next reaction.

Wait, but wait. Acetophenone is substituted at position 1 (since it's the first substituent). Now, when we add another substituent, say bromine, it will be directed by the existing substituent.

The acetophenone group is a meta director. So bromination (using Br2 with FeBr3 as a catalyst) would add bromine in the meta position relative to the ketone. So that would be position 3.

After that, when adding the nitro group, where would it go? The ring now has substituents at positions 1 (ketone) and 3 (Br). The Br is a meta director, and the ketone is also a meta director. But in a benzene ring with two substituents, the next substituent will go into the position that is meta to both, if possible.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. Position 1 has the ketone, position 3 has Br. So the ring looks like:

Positions: 1 (COCH3), 2,3 (Br), 4,5,6.

Now, adding nitro group. The existing substituents are meta directors. So for each existing substituent, the next substituent would be placed meta to them. But let's see. The ketone (position 1) directs meta, which is position 4. The Br (position 3) directs meta, which is position 6.

But where can the nitro group go to satisfy both? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first before the Br. So maybe the order is different.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added after the ketone. Let's think again. Let's say the first substituent is the ketone (position 1). Then, we add nitro group next. Since the ketone is a meta director, the nitro would enter position 4 or position 3 perhaps? Wait, no, the ketone is at 1, so meta is 4. Wait, benzene numbering: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a circle.

So position 1, the ketone; position 3 is ortho to 2, meta to 4. Wait, perhaps the nitro group would enter at position 3 if we add it next.

Wait, no. Let me visualize. Benzene ring with substituent at position 1. The positions ortho to 1 are 2 and 6. Meta are 3 and 5. Para is 4. So if the substituent is at 1, the next substituent would go into 3 or 5 if it's meta.

So if I add nitro next, it would go to position 3 or 5. Then, when I add Br, where would it go? Let's consider each possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the ketone, then the Br. Let me think.

Wait, the target has nitro at 5, Br at 3, and ketone at 1. So in the final structure, the substituents are at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So relative to each other, the Br is meta to nitro (positions 3 and 5 are adjacent), no. Wait, positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other (three positions apart on the ring). Position 1 is para to position 4, and meta to positions 2 and 6.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this by thinking about the steps in the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each is a list of reactions. Let's take option A:

A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation) → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Since the ring has acetophenone (meta director), Br would add at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br). Which are both meta directors. So where would nitration occur?

The existing substituents would direct the next group to positions that are meta to both. Let's see, the COCH3 is at 1, which would direct to 3 and 5 (but 3 is already occupied). The Br is at 3, which would direct to 6 and 1 (but 1 is occupied). Wait, that's not possible. So perhaps the nitration would be in position 5? Because it's meta to position 1, and ortho to position 3.

Wait, but the existing substituents are at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br). Let me draw this:

Positions:

1: COCH3

2: H

3: Br

4: H

5: H

6: H

Now, the next group (nitro) is to be added. The COCH3 at 1 directs meta, which is 4. But 4 is adjacent to 3 (Br is there), so perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the Br at 3 is a meta director, so directs to position 6 and 1 (but 1 is taken). Alternatively, maybe the nitration occurs at position 5, which is meta to the COCH3 (1 → 5 is two positions away, but wait, in a ring, from 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. Wait, position 3 is already taken. So the nitration would go to position 5. That way, it's meta to the COCH3 and para to the Br. Hmm, but the Br is at 3, so para would be position 7, which doesn't exist; it's a six-membered ring. Alternatively, position 5 is meta to Br (3) because it's two positions away. Wait, position 3's meta would be positions 6 and 1. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think about the general approach to synthesis. We need to introduce the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position based on the directing effects of existing groups.

The target has three substituents: COCH3, Br, and NO2. The ketone is the main substituent because it's part of the ethanone group. The Br and nitro are in the meta positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the nitro group, then the ketone, then the bromine. Or another order.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is added first, then the nitro, then the bromine.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitro group is added after the ketone and bromine. Let me think: if the ketone is added first, then bromine in the meta position (position 3), then nitration would occur where? Since the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br), which are both meta directors. The nitro group would go to a position that's meta to both.

Wait, the position that is meta to COCH3 at 1 is position 4 and position 5? Hmm, no. Wait, position 1's meta is 3 and 5. But position 3 is already taken by Br. So the next available meta position would be 5. So nitration would add at position 5.

So the steps would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation: benzene → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Bromination: add Br at position 3.

3. Nitration: add NO2 at position 5.

But wait, after step 2, the ring has COCH3 (1) and Br (3). Now, when nitrating, which substituent directs more strongly? Both are meta directors, but nitration is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Wait, no, nitration is an electrophilic substitution, and substituents can strongly influence where the next group goes.

Wait, in acetophenone, the COCH3 group is a meta director. Br is a meta director as well. So when adding nitro group, perhaps it goes into position 5, which is meta to COCH3 and para to Br. Wait, but Br is at 3, so position 5 would be meta to Br? Let me see:

Position 3 → positions 6 (ortho), 1 (meta), and 5 (para). Hmm, no, because in a benzene ring, position 3's meta is 6 and 1. So position 5 is two away from 3, which is ortho. So maybe the nitro would go to position 5 because it's meta to the ketone (1 → 5 is two away, which is meta).

So after adding Br and NO2, the structure would have substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which matches the target. So the steps would be:

1. Acylation → acetophenone.

2. Bromination → Br at 3.

3. Nitration → nitro at 5.

But wait, looking at the options, option A does acylation first, then bromination, then nitration. So that would result in the correct substituents. But wait, option A's third step is nitration, then after that, what? Let me look.

Option A: After nitration (step iii), then steps iv) Fe/HCl, which is probably a reduction. Wait, what's that for?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each option step by step.

Looking at option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation, acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination, adds Br at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration, adds nitro group at position 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro group to amine? But our target has a nitro group, so wouldn't want that.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? But the ring already has nitro.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but that's usually for amines.

vii) H3PO2 → maybe for a reduction, but not sure.

Wait, but our target has nitro and bromo groups, and the ketone. So after steps i-iii, the target would already be formed. Why would there be more steps? Unless the order isn't right.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added before the bromine. Let me think about that.

If I first acylate (step i), then nitrate (step ii), then brominate (step iii). What would happen?

After acylation, acetophenone (1-COCH3). Then nitration would add nitro at meta, position 3 or 5. Let's say we add it at position 3 (directed by the ketone). Then bromination would be directed by both COCH3 and NO2.

Wait, but where? The COCH3 is at 1, NO2 at 3. Both are meta directors.

So the available meta positions would be:

From COCH3: position 3 (taken by NO2) and 5.

From NO2: position 1 (taken by COCH3), position 5 (meta to 3), and position 6 (ortho to 3, which is meta to 1? Not sure. So the bromine might add at position 5.

So the substituents would be at 1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2), and 5 (Br). But the target requires Br at 3 and NO2 at 5. That doesn't match. So perhaps this isn't the right order.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the Br. Let me think again.

So, acylation first (step i), then bromination (step ii) → Br at 3. Then nitration (step iii) → NO2 at 5. So the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5. That's correct.

But then in option A, after nitration, there are more steps. So why would the reactions not stop at step iii? Because the target is already formed. So perhaps option A is not correct because the steps go beyond.

Looking at option A:

i) Acetophenone

ii) Br added at 3.

iii) Nitro added at 5.

Then, iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction, but target has nitro, so this would turn nitro into NH2. That would be bad.

So option A's steps iv onwards would change the structure, which we don't want. So option A is not correct.

Let me check option B.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Bromine is a meta director, so nitro would go to position 5 (assuming Br is at 1). Wait, bromobenzene has Br at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5, which are meta to Br.

Wait, but if Br is at position 1, nitration would go to 3 or 5. Let's say it goes to 3.

Then step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. The ring has Br (a deactivating group) and NO2 (also deactivating). So Friedel-Crafts won't work because the ring is deactivated. So can't add the ketone at that point.

So option B's step iii would not work. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene. But benzene is hard to nitrate without a catalyst. Wait, HNO3 and H2SO4 are typical nitrating agents. So first, nitration → nitrobenzene.

Then step ii: Fe/HCl → probably reduction. Nitro group reduced to amine. So now, we have aniline.

Step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. Aniline is strongly activating but it's a meta director. So the acetyl would add at position 3 or 5 relative to the amine.

Wait, but after reduction of nitro to amine, the ring is very activated. Friedel-Crafts can proceed, but the amine is a strong activating group, so acetylation would occur in the ortho or para positions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Option C's steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene (position 1: NO2).

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2. So now, benzene with NH2 at position 1.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. Since NH2 is a strong activating group (ortho/para director), the acetyl would go to ortho or para to NH2.

Assuming it goes to para (position 4), then after acylation, the substituents are at 1 (NH2) and 4 (COCH3). Then step iv: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. The directing effects now depend on the substituents.

The ring has NH2 (position 1, strong activating, ortho/para) and COCH3 (position 4, deactivating, meta). So the Br would be directed by the most activating group, which is NH2. So Br would add at ortho (position 2 or 6) or para (position 5) to NH2.

If Br adds at position 5 (para to NH2), then substituents are at 1 (NH2), 4 (COCH3), and 5 (Br). Then, step v: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. The ring has NH2 (strong activating, ortho/para), COCH3 (deactivating, meta), Br (deactivating, meta). So nitration would likely occur where? The most activating group is NH2, directing to ortho and para positions. But which positions are available?

Positions 1 (NH2), 2 (H), 3 (H), 4 (COCH3), 5 (Br), 6 (H).

NH2 at 1: ortho is 2 and 6; para is 4 (occupied by COCH3), so would go to 2 or 6. But after that, step vi: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, which requires an amine. But if we've already nitrated, maybe it's a different scenario.

This seems complicated, and the target requires Br and nitro groups in specific positions. I'm not sure if option C leads to the correct structure.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Wait, but after step ii, we have NH2. So step iii would form a diazonium salt, which upon heating, would undergo a reaction. But I'm not sure what happens next.

Wait, the steps in D:

i) Nitro group added.

ii) Reduced to NH2.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → usually a reducing agent, but used in some reactions, like the Stephen reduction.

Wait, perhaps after diazotization, the diazonium salt is treated with H3PO2, which can lead to substitution reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps after the nitro group is reduced to amine, and then diazotized, it's replaced by something else. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, but the target requires a nitro group. So if we reduce it to amine, and then in another step, perhaps it's converted back? But the steps don't show that. So option D doesn't seem right.

Let me get back to the correct order of reactions. The target has substituents at positions 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So I need to add these groups in such a way that each new group is directed correctly.

One approach is to first add the nitro group, then the ketone, then the bromine.

Wait, wait. Let's think:

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene (position 1).

2. Reduction of nitro to amine → aniline (NH2 at 1).

3. Friedel-Crafts acylation → add acetyl group. Aniline is a strong activating group (ortho/para director). So the acetyl would add at position 3 or 5 (ortho to NH2 at 1). Wait, no: position 1 has NH2, so ortho is 2 and 6, para is 4.

Wait, if the acetyl adds at position 4, then the ring has substituents at 1 (NH2) and 4 (COCH3). Then, bromination would be directed by the NH2 (activating) and the acetyl (deactivating). So Br would likely add ortho to NH2, at position 2 or 6.

But the target requires Br at 3 and NO2 at 5. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Acetophenone (COCH3 at 1).

2. Nitration → NO2 at 5.

3. Bromination → Br at 3.

But how would that work?

Wait, after acylation (COCH3 at 1), nitration would add NO2 at meta, which is 3 or 5. If nitration adds at 5, then bromination would add at 3.

Let me see: option A's steps are i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. But that would make Br at 3, then nitro at 5. Which is correct. Wait, but option A's steps go beyond that. Let me check again.

Option A's steps:

i) Acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → NO2 at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → Fe and HCl is for reduction, like reducing a nitro group to amine. But our target has nitro, so this would be a problem.

So, in option A, after step iii, the target is achieved. But the remaining steps (iv to vii) would alter the structure, which is not desired. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

So perhaps another option is correct. Let me think about each step of each option.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then the ketone, then bromine. But how would that work?

Let me see. If I first nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.

Then, perhaps reduce it to amine (step ii), but then acetylation would be directed by the amine (ortho/para). So acetophenone would be at position 3 or 5.

Wait, but then bromination would be directed by both the amine and the acetyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option D's steps could work.

Option D steps:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, forms diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps a reaction that replaces the diazonium group with something else, like a hydroxyl group. But I'm not entirely sure how H3PO2 would react here.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, it can undergo a coupling reaction, but that's more for when you have an activating group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. What's the target molecule again? It's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents are: ketone at position 1, Br at 3, NO2 at 5.

So perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce the ketone first.

2. Then nitro group.

3. Then bromine.

But in what order would that happen.

Wait, after introducing the ketone (step i: acetylation), the ring has COCH3 at 1.

Then, nitration: since COCH3 is a meta director, nitro would go to 3 or 5.

Assuming it goes to 5 (so position 5 has NO2).

Then bromination: the directing groups are COCH3 (meta) and NO2 (meta). So where would Br go?

The available meta positions relative to both would be position 3, which is meta to COCH3 (position 1 → 3) and meta to NO2 (position 5 → 3 is adjacent, which is ortho, not meta. Wait, position 5's meta is 2 and 8, which doesn't exist, so perhaps 2 and 8 are not viable. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the positions.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the meta directors.

After COCH3 (1) and NO2 (5), the next substituent (Br) will be placed in a position that's meta to both. Let's see:

The ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 5 (NO2).

Looking for a position that is meta to both:

- From COCH3 at 1: meta positions are 3 and 5.

- From NO2 at 5: meta positions are 2 and 8 (non-existent), or 2 and 8. So perhaps 2.

But position 3 is meta to COCH3 and position 2 is meta to NO2.

But if Br is added at position 3, it's meta to COCH3 (1), and para to NO2 (5). Is that possible? Because para to 5 would be position 2 (since 5's para is 2; 5 plus 3 is 8, which wraps around to 2). So position 2 is para to 5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider that after nitro is added at 5, the next substituent (Br) would be added at 3, which is meta to the ketone, but doesn't conflict with the nitro. So in that case, the substituents would be correctly placed.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetylation → COCH3 at 1.

2. Nitration → NO2 at 5.

3. Bromination → Br at 3.

If I can find an option that follows this order (acylation, nitration, bromination), that should be correct.

Looking at the options, none of them have acylation followed by nitration then bromination. Let me check each option's steps.

Option A: acylation, bromination, nitration. So Br is added before nitro, which would place Br at 3. Then nitro is added at 5. But after that, the steps continue, which would alter the structure, which isn't desired.

Option B: bromination first, then nitration, then acylation. But after bromination, the ring is deactivated, so acylation wouldn't work.

Option C: nitration first, then reduction, acylation, bromination, etc. Not sure.

Option D: nitration, reduction, diazotization, etc. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly match this order. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, and the subsequent steps are something else, but perhaps they don't affect the substituents.

Wait, option A's steps after iii) are:

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reducing nitro to amine. But that would ruin the nitro group, which we don't want. So option A can't be correct.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possibility of using directing groups and the order of adding substituents to avoid interference.

Another approach: The target has the ketone in position 1, Br in 3, and NO2 in 5. So perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because when adding substituents, the last one added is directed by all the previous groups.

So, the order would be:

1. Add ketone (COCH3) at 1.

2. Add Br at 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Add NO2 at 5 (meta to ketone, and para to Br).

But how to get NO2 at 5 after having added COCH3 and Br. Let me see:

After acylation and bromination, the substituents are at 1 and 3. Now, during nitration, the nitro group would be directed by both groups. COCH3 is a meta director, and Br is a meta director. So where can the nitro group go?

Looking for a position that is meta to both COCH3 and Br.

COCH3 at 1: meta positions 3 (occupied) and 5.

Br at 3: meta positions 6 and 1 (occupied).

So the only available position that is meta to COCH3 is 5.

So nitration would add nitro at 5.

So the correct order is acylation → bromination → nitration.

Which is what option A does, but then why does option A have more steps?

Wait, perhaps those additional steps are not part of the synthesis but are present in the options. Wait, no, the question is about the sequence of reactions leading to the target. So perhaps the steps in option A are longer but the target is achieved at step iii.

But the problem is that option A's steps go beyond, which would alter the structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, but the steps after iii are irrelevant or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in option A:

Steps:

i) Acetyl → acetophenone.

ii) Br → Br adds at 3.

iii) Nitro → adds at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → Fe and HCl is for reduction. Maybe reduces something else, but in the structure, we don't have a nitro group that needs reduction. Hmm. Or is it for another purpose?

Wait, perhaps after step iii, the target is achieved, and steps iv onwards are not part of the synthesis but are included in the option. But the question says, which sequence of reactions would lead to the target, so if the option includes steps beyond, but those steps don't affect the target, then it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, another possibility: after acetylation, nitration, then bromination. But that would make the nitro group at 5, then bromine would go where? Let's see.

But wait, after acylation and nitration, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 5. Now bromination would be directed by both. COCH3 is meta, NO2 is meta.

So bromine would go to position 3 (meta to COCH3) or position 2 (meta to NO2 at 5). But position 3 is meta to COCH3 and ortho to NO2. Alternatively, bromine would prefer to go where the directing groups cohere.

After COCH3 (1) and NO2 (5), the only position meta to both would be position 3.

So, in that case, the sequence would be:

i) Acetylation → position 1.

ii) Nitration → position 5.

iii) Bromination → position 3.

Which would give the target.

Looking for an option that follows this order.

Which option has acetylation first, then nitration, then bromination?

Looking at the options:

Option A: acetylation, bromination, nitration.

Option B: bromination, nitration, acetylation.

Option C: nitration, reduction, acetylation, bromination.

Option D: nitration, reduction, diazotization, etc.

Hmm, none of the options have the order acetylation, nitration, bromination. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then acetylate, then brominate.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring has a nitro group, which is deactivating. So Friedel-Crafts acylation (step requires activating ring) might not proceed. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless the nitro group is in a position that allows the acylation to occur. For example, if nitro is at position 3 and acylation occurs at position 1.

Wait, let's try this:

1. Nitration → nitro at position 1.

2. Reduction → amine at 1.

3. Acetylation → acetyl at position 3 (ortho to amine).

4. Bromination → directed by acetyl and amine.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, and the steps after iii are not relevant to the synthesis of the target, but are extra steps. But the question asks for the sequence that leads to the target, so any steps beyond would change the structure, making option A incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the nitro group is added after the bromine. Let me think again.

If I first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate:

After acetylation, the ring has COCH3 at 1.

Nitration adds NO2 at 5.

Bromination adds Br at 3.

Which matches the target.

So the correct order is acetylation → nitration → bromination.

Looking for an option with this order, but none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps in the options. Let me re-examine the options.

Option A's steps:

i) acylation → COCH3.

ii) bromination → Br at 3.

iii) nitration → NO2 at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces something, but target has nitro. So this would be a problem.

Option B: bromination first → Br at 1. Then nitration → NO2 at 3. Then acylation, but Friedel-Crafts won't work because Br is deactivating. So this is impossible.

Option C: nitration first → NO2 at 1. Then reduction → NH2. Then acylation → COCH3 at 4 (para to NH2). Then bromination → Br at 2 or 6 (ortho to NH2). Then another nitration, which would go where? After that, diazotization and H3PO2, but I'm not sure.

Option D: nitration, then reduction, then diazotization, then H3PO2.

Wait, perhaps option D's steps:

i) Nitration → NO2 at 1.

ii) Reduction → NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazotization → N2+Cl- at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps reduction to CH2NH2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, it's treated with H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent), leading to substitution of the diazo group with a hydroxyl group. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, it's heated with H3PO2 to replace the diazo group with a hydrogen, giving toluene derivative. But I'm not certain.

In any case, this doesn't seem to lead to the target.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the target.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the Br.

So:

1. Acetylate → COCH3 at 1.

2. Brominate → Br at 3.

3. Nitrate → NO2 at 5.

Which matches the target.

So the correct steps are i) acylate, ii) brominate, iii) nitrate.

Which is exactly what option A does.

But then, in option A, after step iii, they have more steps. So why are those steps there?

Wait, perhaps the nitration is not step iii. Let me look again:

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → Fe and HCl, perhaps reducing the nitro group to NH2. That would change the structure, which we don't want.

So, option A's steps would actually produce the target after step iii, and then steps iv onwards would alter it, which is not correct.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about the effect of steps iv onwards. Let me think.

iv) Fe/HCl → probably a reduction of a nitro group to amine. So, if after step iii, the target has nitro, using Fe/HCl would reduce it to NH2, which is not desired. So option A would not yield the target.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the target isn't as I thought. Let me recheck the target structure.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents are on the phenyl group attached to the ketone. So the phenyl part is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl.

So, the ketone is attached to the benzene ring, which has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, perhaps the position of the ketone is at position 1, and then Br at 3, nitro at 5. So the ring has three substituents: ketone (1), Br (3), nitro (5).

So, the order of adding substituents would be ketone first, then Br, then nitro.

But how?

Wait, maybe the correct order is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro at 5.

3. Brominate acetophenone → Br at 3.

But in reality, I think when you have multiple substituents, the order in which you add them affects where they go.

So, after acetylation, the ring has COCH3 (position 1). Then, nitrating would add nitro at 3 or 5. Let's say at 5. Then brominating would add at 3. That would give the correct substituents.

So the reactions would be:

i) Acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

iii) Bromination → Br at 3.

Which is the same as option A's first three steps. But option A then proceeds to steps iv and beyond, which would alter the structure.

So, perhaps the correct option is A, but the steps after iii are not part of the synthesis, or perhaps the question assumes that the correct sequence stops at step iii. But the options are all seven steps, so I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to pick the option where the correct substituents are added in the right order, regardless of the extra steps. But that doesn't make sense because the extra steps would affect the product.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the numbering of the substituents. Maybe the ketone is attached to the ring, and the bromo and nitro groups are in the correct positions relative to each other regardless of the order.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added first, then the ketone, then the bromine. Let me think:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

2. Reduce nitro to NH2 → amine at 1.

3. Acetylate → acetyl at 3 or 5 (depending on the director).

Wait, but after reduction, you have aniline. Friedel-Crafts acylation would add the acetyl group at the ortho or para positions relative to the amine. So if you have amine at 1, the acetyl could be at 3 (ortho) or 4 (para).

If it's added at 3, then the ring has NH2 at 1, COCH3 at 3.

Then, brominating would be directed by both NH2 (ortho/para) and COCH3 (meta). So Br would add at position 5 (meta to COCH3) or position 2 or 6 (ortho to NH2).

If Br adds at position 5, the substituents would be 1 (NH2), 3 (COCH3), 5 (Br). Then, perhaps the NH2 is oxidized back to nitro, but the steps don't show that.

This is getting too complicated. I think I've spent enough time thinking through this, and the best conclusion I can reach is that the correct sequence is option A, but the steps after iii would ruin the product. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me think about the possibility that the ketone is introduced in a later step, perhaps through an acylation after activating the ring.

Wait, another approach: the order of reactions must allow for each substituent to be added in the correct position without conflicting with the existing groups.

The correct order is to add the nitro group after the ketone and bromine. Or perhaps the nitro group is added last.

Wait, I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, the correct sequence is acetylation, bromination, nitration (option A's steps i, ii, iii), but the option includes further steps which would alter the structure. Therefore, perhaps none of the options are correct. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that option A's steps continue beyond the target. Let me re-examine the steps in option A:

A) i) Acetophenone.

ii) Br at 3.

iii) Nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → this would reduce nitro to NH2, which we don't want.

So, option A is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is none of the above. But the question provides four options, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing it.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then acetylate, then brominate. But I thought that after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making acetylation difficult.

Wait, but if the nitro group is in a position that allows the acetyl to add in a suitable position, perhaps it's possible.

Let me think:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

2. Acetylate → but the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. So this is not possible.

Thus, the correct option must be option A, assuming that the steps beyond iii are not part of the synthesis, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the target doesn't require the steps beyond iii, and the question is only about the correct sequence leading up to the target. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but the steps iv onwards are extraneous.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed in step iii, and the rest of the steps are for something else, but the question is about the overall sequence, which includes all steps.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the correct order is acetylation, bromination, nitration, which is option A's first three steps. Therefore, the answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in an order that ensures each new group is added in the correct position based on the directing effects of the existing groups. The target molecule has a ketone group (COCH3) at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group (NO2) at position 5 on the benzene ring.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone group at position 1, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) adds bromine at position 3, which is meta to the ketone group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) adds the nitro group at position 5, which is meta to the ketone group and para to the bromine.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve Fe/HCl, HNO3/H2SO4, NaNO2/HCl, and H3PO2. These reactions are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and would alter the structure, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) introduces bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) adds the nitro group at position 3, which is meta to bromine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) attempts to introduce the ketone group. However, the ring is deactivated by the bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation impossible. This option is incorrect.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine (-NH2) at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) introduces the ketone group. However, the amine group strongly activates the ring, directing the ketone to the ortho or para positions relative to the amine. This would result in the ketone being at position 3 or 4, which does not match the target structure.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps include bromination, nitration, diazotization, and reduction, but they do not lead to the correct substitution pattern. This option is incorrect.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine (-NH2) at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) forms a diazonium salt at position 1.
4. **Step iv**: Reduction with H3PO2 replaces the diazonium group with a hydrogen atom, leaving no nitro group. This sequence does not lead to the target molecule, making this option incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is acetylation, bromination, and nitration. This corresponds to the first three steps of **Option A**. However, the additional steps in Option A (iv–vii) are unnecessary and would alter the structure of the target molecule. Despite this, none of the other options provide a valid sequence for synthesizing the target molecule. Therefore, **Option A** is the best choice, assuming the extra steps are disregarded or considered irrelevant to the synthesis.

**Answer: A**
