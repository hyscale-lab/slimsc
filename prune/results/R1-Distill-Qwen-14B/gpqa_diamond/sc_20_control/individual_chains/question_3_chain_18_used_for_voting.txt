Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving σz and σx. 

The particle is in a superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. Right, so I remember that the expectation value of σz in this state would just be the coefficient squared times their eigenvalues. Because |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1, and |↓⟩ has -1.

Wait, but the operator here is 10σz +5σx. So I need to find the expectation value of each part and sum them. 

Let me break it down. The expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So for 10σz, it's 10⟨σz⟩, and for 5σx, it's 5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation separately and add them.

First, calculating ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of σz eigenstates, it's straightforward. The state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Let me compute that.

|a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3)/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 *1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So 10σz would contribute 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the tricky part is ⟨σx⟩. I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states. The expectation value of σx for a state ψ is a bit more involved. Alternatively, I can write it as (a* b σx expectation in terms of the coefficients.

Wait, another approach: Since σx has matrix representation [[0,1],[1,0]], then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a*, b*) [[0,1],[1,0]] [a; b] = a* b + b* a. So that's 2 Re(a* b).

Wait, let me compute a and b. a is 0.5, which is real. b is sqrt(3)/2, also real. So a* = a, b* =b. So a* b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. Similarly, b* a is the same. So their sum is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because σx is Hermitian, so its expectation value is real, which makes sense. So the calculation is correct. So the expectation value for σx is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the 5σx term contributes 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 *0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Adding the two contributions: the 10σz term is -5, the 5σx term is about 4.33. So total expectation value is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait but wait, let me check the exact values. 10σz gives -5, 5σx gives 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 =4.33. So yes, adding gives -0.67. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is the closest to -0.67. So the answer should be C.

Wait, did I miss any factors? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, is the state normalized? Let's check: |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 0.25 +0.75=1. So yes, it's normalized, so all good.

Another approach: The state is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in the σz basis. The expectation of σx is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/1 = sqrt(3)/2, which is same as before.

Wait, another way: The expectation value of σx can be calculated as (ψ|σx|ψ) = sum_{i,j} ψ_i^* σx_{i,j} ψ_j. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the product (0.5)(1)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(1)(0.5) )= 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = 2*(0.5 sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

So yes, the calculation is correct. So the expectation of 5σx is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈4.330.

Adding to 10σz's -5: total is -5 +4.330= -0.6698. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \), which can be broken into two parts: \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle \) and \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is a linear combination of these eigenstates:
\[
\psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle, \quad \text{where } a = 0.5, \, b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1).
\]
Calculating \( |a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
Thus, the contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator has the matrix representation:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) for the state \( \psi = (a, b) \) in the \( \sigma_z \)-basis is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a^*b + b^*a.
\]
Since \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are real, this simplifies to:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = ab + ba = 2ab.
\]
Substituting \( ab = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we get:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]
The contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
Adding the contributions from \( 10\sigma_z \) and \( 5\sigma_x \), the total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to option **C) -0.7**.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving σz and σx. 

The particle is in a superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. Right, so I remember that the expectation value of σz in this state would just be the coefficient squared times their eigenvalues. Because |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1, and |↓⟩ has -1.

Wait, but the operator here is 10σz +5σx. So I need to find the expectation value of each part and sum them. 

Let me break it down. The expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So for 10σz, it's 10⟨σz⟩, and for 5σx, it's 5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation separately and add them.

First, calculating ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of σz eigenstates, it's straightforward. The state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Let me compute that.

|a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3)/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 *1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So 10σz would contribute 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the tricky part is ⟨σx⟩. I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states. The expectation value of σx for a state ψ is a bit more involved. Alternatively, I can write it as (a* b σx expectation in terms of the coefficients.

Wait, another approach: Since σx has matrix representation [[0,1],[1,0]], then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a*, b*) [[0,1],[1,0]] [a; b] = a* b + b* a. So that's 2 Re(a* b).

Wait, let me compute a and b. a is 0.5, which is real. b is sqrt(3)/2, also real. So a* = a, b* =b. So a* b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. Similarly, b* a is the same. So their sum is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because σx is Hermitian, so its expectation value is real, which makes sense. So the calculation is correct. So the expectation value for σx is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the 5σx term contributes 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 *0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Adding the two contributions: the 10σz term is -5, the 5σx term is about 4.33. So total expectation value is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait but wait, let me check the exact values. 10σz gives -5, 5σx gives 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 =4.33. So yes, adding gives -0.67. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is the closest to -0.67. So the answer should be C.

Wait, did I miss any factors? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, is the state normalized? Let's check: |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 0.25 +0.75=1. So yes, it's normalized, so all good.

Another approach: The state is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in the σz basis. The expectation of σx is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/1 = sqrt(3)/2, which is same as before.

Wait, another way: The expectation value of σx can be calculated as (ψ|σx|ψ) = sum_{i,j} ψ_i^* σx_{i,j} ψ_j. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the product (0.5)(1)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(1)(0.5) )= 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = 2*(0.5 sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

So yes, the calculation is correct. So the expectation of 5σx is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈4.330.

Adding to 10σz's -5: total is -5 +4.330= -0.6698. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \), which can be broken into two parts: \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle \) and \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is a linear combination of these eigenstates:
\[
\psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle, \quad \text{where } a = 0.5, \, b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1).
\]
Calculating \( |a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
Thus, the contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator has the matrix representation:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) for the state \( \psi = (a, b) \) in the \( \sigma_z \)-basis is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a^*b + b^*a.
\]
Since \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are real, this simplifies to:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = ab + ba = 2ab.
\]
Substituting \( ab = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we get:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]
The contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
Adding the contributions from \( 10\sigma_z \) and \( 5\sigma_x \), the total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to option **C) -0.7**.
