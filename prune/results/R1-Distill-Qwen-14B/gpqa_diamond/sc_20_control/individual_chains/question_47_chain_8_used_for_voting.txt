Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The compound in question has the formula C9H11NO2. The IR and 1H NMR data are provided, and I have four options to choose from. 

First, let me jot down the given data. The IR shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are probably O-H stretches, maybe from an amide or an alcohol. But wait, the other options might have different functional groups. Oh, wait, the strong band at 1720 cm-1—what's that? Oh, that's a carbonyl group. So likely a ketone, ester, amide, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But since the formula includes an O2, it's probably an ester or amide because a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H in the IR which I don't see mentioned here. Wait, but the IR has two peaks around 3420, maybe that's an amine or an alcohol. Hmm.

Then looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are as follows: 1.20 ppm triplet integrating for 3H. That seems like a CH2CH3 group, maybe part of an ethyl group. The triplet at 1.2 with 3H suggests that the adjacent group is a CH2. So perhaps an ethyl ester or an ethyl amide?

Then at 4.0 ppm, there's a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlets could be from an OCH2 group or an NH group. Wait, but NH is usually a broad peak, but in this case, the integration is 2H, so maybe OCH2, like in an ethyl ester. Or perhaps it's a -CH2 attached to something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, at 4.5 ppm, a quartet integrating for 2H. Quartet with 2H... that's probably a -OCH2CH2- group, like in an ester. Wait, because for an ethyl group, the splitting would be a triplet for the CH2 next to the O, but a quartet at 4.5 ppm sounds more like the OCH2 in an ester. Wait, no, in an ethyl ester, the structure is O-C-O-CH2CH3. Wait, maybe I should think about the splitting. If it's a -OCH2CH2- group, then the adjacent CH2 would split into a quartet. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -NCH2 group? Not sure yet.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm as a doublet (2H), and 8.0 ppm as another doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So the substituents are in the para positions. So maybe something like para-substituted phenyl ester or amide.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Wait, that's meta, but the NMR shows a para substitution on the benzene ring. Hmm, but then the substituents would be ethoxy and amide groups... but that might not fit the NMR. Let me think about the structure. Benzamide is a CONH2 group attached to the benzene. If there's an ethoxy group at position 3, the aromatic protons would be meta to each other. But in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each two protons, which suggests two substituents in the para positions. Wait, maybe the substituents are in the para positions. So option A is 3-ethoxy, which would be meta, so the aromatic Hs would be in different patterns than the NMR shows. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the aromatic ring has an ethoxy group in the para position. The substituents would be ethoxy and formamide. So the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons, each two H. That fits with the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm signals. Now, the other parts: the formamide group would have an NH, but looking at the NMR, at 4.0 ppm, it's a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, wait formamide's NH would be a broad peak, but integration of 2H? Formamide has only one NH. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is present. Let me consider the other parts. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at around 1.2 ppm for the CH2CH3, which matches. The OCH2CH3 would split into a quartet or triplet? Wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet, but in an ethoxy group attached to benzene, the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3. So the ethoxy's CH2 would be a quartet, but looking at the NMR, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet of 2H. So that would fit OCH2. Wait, but in an ethoxy group, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet (from the adjacent CH3) around 4.1 ppm, and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.2. Oh wait, but in the NMR, the triplet is at 1.20 (3H), which matches the CH3 of an ethyl group. Then the quartet at 4.5 (2H) would be the OCH2. So that would fit for an ethoxy group. So in option B, the ethoxy is on the benzene, and the formamide is attached. So the formamide would have the NH, but in the NMR, do we see an NH peak? The problem says the NMR data doesn't include a peak for NH. Hmm, the NMR data includes a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Wait, formamide has an NH, but that would be a broad peak, possibly around 8-9 ppm? Or is it possible that the NH is exchanged and not showing up? Alternatively, perhaps the NH is missing, but in formamide, the NH would be present. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the NH is an amide, which can sometimes exchange and show up broad or not show up in the NMR, but that's uncertain. Let me think about the other options.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be a benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a propionate group (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COOH, but in this case, it's likely an ester. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: phenyl group (6 C), propionate would be -OOCR, where R is propyl. So the formula would be C6H5NHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be O=C(O-) attached to CH2CH2CH3 and the benzene. Wait, maybe the structure is O=C(OCH2CH2CH3)-NH-C6H4-4. Hmm, but that would be a urethane type structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the propionate ester of 4-aminophenol. So the structure is O=C(O-) attached to a CH2CH2CH3 group and a benzene ring with NH2 in para position. Wait, but the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me check: C6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) + 1 (NH) plus O's—so perhaps. Now, looking at the NMR: the 1.20 triplet (3H) would fit the ethyl group if it's an ethyl ester. But wait, propionate is a three-carbon group. Hmm. So if it's a propionate ester, the ethyl group would be at the end of a longer chain. Wait, maybe the NMR would show a triplet for the ethyl group, which it does at 1.20. Then another triplet for the adjacent CH2? Wait, but in the NMR, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be the OCH2 from the ester. Hmm. Also, the NH group from the amine would be expected to show up as a broad peak, but the NMR data doesn’t mention any peaks around 2-3 ppm for NH2. Wait, the NMR data shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Maybe that's the NH2 group? But NH2 is usually a broad singlet, but integration of 2H suggests maybe an -NH- group. Hmm, but amines can show up as broad singlets. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's move on to the next option.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with an NH2 group at position 4 and a benzoate ester group (O-CO-O-) attached to an ethyl group. Wait, no, the benzoate ester would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the structure would be O=C(O-OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2. Let me check the molecular formula. Benzene (6 C) + COOCH2CH3 (3 C) + NH2 (no additional C). So total 6 + 3 = 9 C. So formula would be C9H11NO3. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a problem because ethyl benzoate would be C9H10O2. Wait, wait, let me recount. Benzoate is C6H5COOEt. So C6 + COOEt (2 O and 2 C for COO and 2 C for ethyl). So total C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 C? No, wait, the benzoate would be C6H5COOEt. C6 (benzene) + COO (2 O) + Et (2 C). So total C is 6 + 2 (from COO) + 2 (from Et) = 10 C? Wait, no, COO is two O, but the carbons are: benzene (6 C) + COO (2 C) + Et (2 C) → total 10 C? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps it's 4-aminophenyl acetate. Let me see. Acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-O-. So 4-aminophenyl acetate would be C6H4NH2COOEt. So molecular formula would be C9H11NO3, because C6 (benzene) + COOEt (3 O) + NH2. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So D option would have O3, which doesn't match. Hmm, that's an issue. So perhaps D is not the correct option. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me calculate again. For ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: benzoate is O-CO-OEt. So the structure is O=C(OEt)-C6H4NH2. So the formula would be C6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) + N and H's. So the molecular formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Therefore, D can't be the answer. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the given formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate each option's formula:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group. So benzene (6 C) + CONH2 (2 O) + OCH2CH3 (1 O, 2 C). So total C: 6 + 2 (from CONH2? Wait, CONH2 is one C, O, N, and two H. So in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the formula is C6H5CONH2-OCH2CH3. Wait, that would be C9H11NO3. Because C6 + C from CONH2 (1) + OCH2CH3 (2 C) → 6+1+2=9 C. O is from CONH2 (1 O) and OCH2CH3 (1 O) → 2 O. Plus the O from the amide? Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2, which has two O (from CO and NH2? No, the amide is CONH2, which is one O. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So molecular formula is C7H7NO. If I add an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), which is C2H5O, then the total becomes C7 + C2 = C9, H: 7 (from benzamide) + (5 from ethoxy?) Wait, no. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would give C9H11NO2. Because benzamide is C7H7NO, adding an ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C7+2=9 C, H: 7 + (5 H from ethoxy) = 12 H, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate each option properly.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which is attached to CONH2. So the molecular formula is C6H5-OCH2CH3-CONH2. Wait, that would be C6 + 2 (from ethoxy) + 1 (from CONH2) → 9 C. H: Benzene ring has 5 H (since substituents are in positions 3 and 1?), ethoxy has 5 H (OCH2CH3 is 2 CH2 groups: 2+3=5?), and CONH2 has 2 H. So total H? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate each option's formula correctly.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the formamide is HCONH-, attached to the benzene which has an ethoxy group. So molecular formula: C6 (benzene) + 2 (from ethoxy) + 2 (from HCONH) → 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 C? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, formamide is HCONH- so it's C=O-NH-. So the molecule would be C6H4-OCH2CH3 connected to HCONH2. So formula: C6 (benzene) + C from OCH2CH3 (2 C) + C from HCONH2 (2 C: C from CO and another C from NH2? Wait, no. HCONH2 has 1 C (the carbonyl C), and the NH2 is attached. So the formula would be C6 + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide C) → C9. So C6 + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide) = 9 C. O: benzene has O from ethoxy (1 O) and O from formamide (1 O) → 2 O. So formula is C9H? Let's count H. Benzene (4 H, since two substituents in para positions: 4 H?), ethoxy (5 H: OCH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H?), formamide (HCONH2 has 2 H from NH2 and 1 H from the formyl H → total 3 H). So total H: 4 +5 +3 = 12? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So this would give 12 H instead of 11. Hmm, so that might not fit. So perhaps option B isn't correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is NH2-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So propionate ester. So the formula is C6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) + 1 (NH2) → C10, but wait, let me count: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H4NH2 connected to O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So C6 + 3 (propionate) → 9 C. O: benzene has O from ester (O), propionate has O from COO, so 2 O. So formula is C9H? Let's see: benzene has 4 H (para substitution), NH2 has 2 H, propionate ester's CH2CH2CH3 has 6 H (CH2 has 2, next CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3 H). The ester oxygen doesn't add H. So total H: 4 (benzene) + 2 (NH2) + 6 (propyl) = 12 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Hmm, something's not right here.

Wait, maybe the structures are different. Let me think again about each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So that would be benzoate ester with NH2 in para. So formula: C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt: 2 O, 2 C) + NH2 (adds nothing to C). Wait, COOEt is COOCH2CH3, so that's 3 C (COO has 2, Et has 2, but wait, COOCH2CH3 is 3 C: the carbonyl C, the two oxygen-connected C, and the ethyl group). So C6 + 3 = 9 C. O: COO has 2 O, and the benzoate ester has another O in the ester linkage. Wait, COOCH2CH3 has two O in COO and one O in the ester (I think I'm getting confused). Let me just count O: Benzoate ester is O=C(O-OCH2CH3). So the benzoate has two O from COO and one O from the ester. Wait, no, the structure is O=C(O-) connected to OCH2CH3. So COOCH2CH3 has two O's in the ester group. So the formula would be C9H10O2 (from benzoate) plus NH2 (adds one N and two H). Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. So benzoate ester is C9H10O2. Adding NH2 would make it C9H12N O2? Hmm, not matching. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR again. Let's go back.

The 1H NMR has a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) → likely a CH2CH3 group. Next, a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) → probably a OCH2 group. Then, a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Hmm.

Looking at the aromatic region, two doublets, each 2H → para substitution. So the substituents are in para positions, probably an ethoxy and another group.

The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1 → carbonyl. Also, the bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 could be amide N-H stretches or possibly O-H from an alcohol, but given the formula, maybe it's an amide.

So, considering the options again.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would have the ethoxy at meta, but the NMR shows para substitution, so maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure has ethoxy and formamide groups in para. The formamide would have a carbonyl (IR 1720), and the NH would show up as a broad peak, but in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H). Wait, formamide's NH would be a broad peak, but the integration is 2H. Hmm, perhaps it's the OCH2 group from ethoxy. Let me think. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at 1.2 (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 (2H). That matches the NMR data. So the ethoxy part fits.

Then the formamide group would have a carbonyl (IR 1720) and the HCONH- group. So the NH would be in the formamide, but in the NMR, the singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could be part of the formamide structure. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. So the NH2 would be a broad peak, probably. But in the NMR, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm, which is a broad singlet. Hmm. Or maybe the peak at 4.0 is from another group.

Option D was ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, but the formula didn't fit, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula calculation. Let me check again. Benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt. So C6 + 2 (COO) + 2 (Et) → 10 C, but given the formula is C9. Hmm, maybe D isn't the right option.

Looking again at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be O=C(O-) attached to a propyl group and a benzene with NH2. So the ester would have OCH2CH2CH3. The NMR has a triplet at 1.2 (3H), which would be the CH3 of the propyl group. The next CH2 would be a quartet at ~1.6 ppm (but not in the NMR data), and the OCH2 would be a triplet at ~4.1 ppm. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would correspond to the OCH2 in the ester. The triplet at 1.2 (3H) would be the CH3. So this could fit. The aromatic region would have two doublets, which fits the para substitution.

But wait, the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which would be a carbonyl. A propionate ester would have a carbonyl around 1720, so that fits.

The amine group (NH2) would typically have an NH stretch in IR. The IR data shows bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches, which would correspond to a secondary amine (amide) or primary amine. In option C, it's a primary amine (NH2), so the IR would show broad N-H stretches, which matches the data.

Looking at the NMR data again, option C would have:

- The propyl group: 1.2 ppm triplet (CH3), then a quartet around 1.6 (CH2), and a triplet around 4.2 (OCH2). Wait, but the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 (2H)—so maybe that's the OCH2. Then the triplet at 1.2 is the CH3. So that fits.

The aromatic region would have two doublets, as the substituents are in para positions (ethoxy and amide, or ethoxy and something else). Wait, in option C, the substituents are NH2 and the ester group (COOCH2CH2CH3). So the ester group is in para to the NH2. So the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the NMR data.

But then what about the NMR peak at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad singlet)? Hmm. In option C, the structure would have an amine (NH2), which might exchange and not show up in the NMR, but the NMR data doesn't mention any peaks that could correspond to NH2. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group's OCH2 is at 4.5, and the NH2 is elsewhere. But then the peak at 4.0 ppm is a singlet, 2H, broad. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps that's the OCH2 from the ester. Let me think. In option C, the ester is propyl, so the OCH2 would be at around 4.2 ppm as a triplet, but in the NMR data, it's a quartet at 4.5. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl ester. Wait, the NMR has a quartet at 4.5 (2H), which could be OCH2 in an ethyl group. So that would suggest an ethyl ester, not propyl. So perhaps option C isn't the right one.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structures wrong. Let's think again. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C(OOCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the carbonyl is from the benzoate, which would show up at ~1720 cm-1 in IR. The ethoxy group would have triplet at 1.2 (CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). That matches the NMR. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which is correct for para substitution. The NH2 group would have a broad peak, but the NMR doesn't show a peak for it. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is deprotonated and not showing in the NMR, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is part of an amide, making the peak less likely to show. Hmm.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the formula for option D, I thought it didn't fit. Let me recalculate. The formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO3. Because benzoate ester is C8H7O2, and adding NH2 (which is -NH2, so adds N and 2 H). So the formula would be C8H7O2 plus NH2, which is C8H9NO2. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, let me think of the molecular formula.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester would be C9H10O2. Then, adding an NH2 group in para position would make it C9H11NO2. Because the ester is C9H10O2, adding NH2 (which is -N(H)2) would replace a H on the benzene. So the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Oh! Because the benzene ring has 5 H in benzoate ester (if it's mono-substituted), but when adding an NH2 group in para to the ester, the total H would be 5-1 + 2 (from NH2) → 6 H on benzene. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula for option D is C9H11NO2. Because benzoate ester is C8H8O2, but adding an NH2 would make it C8H9NO2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the actual formula:

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the structure O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the formula is:

C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3: 1 from COO, 2 from ethyl) → 9 C.

H: Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: COOEt and NH2 in para), COOEt has 5 H (OCH2CH3: 2+3=5), NH2 has 2 H. So total H:4 +5 +2=11 H.

O: 3 O (COO has 2, ester O is another). Wait, the COOEt group has two O from COO and one O from the ester linkage? Or is it three O in total? No, COOCH2CH3 has two O in the carbonyl and ester groups. Wait, no:

The ester group is O=C-O-CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is O, then the ester oxygen is another O. So in total, COOCH2CH3 has 3 O: one from the carbonyl, and two from the ester (O and O in OCH2CH3). Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O-. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the molecular formula. Each COOCH2CH3 contributes 3 O (the carbonyl O, the ester O, and another O in the OCH2CH3). Wait no, the formula for COOCH2CH3 is C3H6O2 (COO is O2, CH2CH3 is C2H5). So in the benzoate ester, the COOCH2CH3 adds 3 O. So if the benzene ring has another O from the ester linkage? I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the formula for option D is indeed C9H11NO3, which doesn't match the given C9H11NO2. So D might not be the correct option.

Back to option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see. Structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. So C from benzene:6, ethoxy:2, formamide: 2 (HCONH is 2 C: one from CO and one from NH). So 6+2+2=10 C. Wait, but the given formula is C9. Hmm, discrepancy. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formamide is HCONHR, where R is the benzene with ethoxy. So the formamide is HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me count:

HCONH-: 1 C (CO), 2 H (from HCONH), 1 N, 1 O.

4-ethoxyphenyl: 6 C (benzene) + 2 C (ethoxy) → 8 C.

Total C: 1 (from formamide) +8 =9 C.

H: formamide has 1 H (from HCONH), ethoxy has 5 H (OCH2CH3: 2+3), and the benzene (4 H).

Wait, benzene has 4 H because two substituents (ethoxy and formamide) are in para positions. So 4 H in benzene.

Total H: 1 (formamide) +5 (ethoxy) +4 (benzene) =10 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's 10 H, which doesn't match. So option B might not fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about the IR again. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. The medium bands at 3420 and 3325 are likely N-H stretches. So maybe the compound is an amide.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at meta. But NMR shows para substitution. So maybe incorrect.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is ester with NH2. But the formula didn't seem to fit earlier.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is ester with NH2. The formula would be C9H12O2N? Wait, let me recount. 4-aminophenyl propionate is O=C(OCH2CH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So molecular formula: C6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) + 1 (NH2) → 10 C? No, wait, propionate is COOCH2CH2CH3, which is 3 C in the COO and ester. Wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is 3 C (COO has 2, CH2CH2CH3 has 3? No, COOCH2CH2CH3 would be 3 C (COO has 2, and the ester is one C attached to three CH2 groups? Not sure. Alternatively, propionate ester is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So in that case, the propionate group is 3 C, so the formula would be C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH2CH3) + 1 (NH2) → 10 C. Which doesn't match the given formula of 9 C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look again at the options. The correct formula is C9H11NO2. So the options must have 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Looking at option D again: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) → 9 C. H: Benzene has 4 H (para substitution), ethoxy group has 5 H (OCH2CH3: 2 +3), NH2 has 2 H. Total H:4+5+2=11. O: COO has 2 O, ester O is 1 O. Wait, no, the structure is O=C(O-OCH2CH3), which has one O in the carbonyl, two O in the ester (O and O). So total O is 3. So formula is C9H11NO3, which doesn't match the given formula. So option D is not correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount for option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt. So C6H5COOEt has 9 C (6 from benzene, 2 from COO, 2 from Et). But the formula given is C9, so that matches. Now, adding NH2 to the benzene in para position, the formula becomes C9H10O2 (from benzoate) + NH2 (adds N and 2 H, losing one H from the benzene), so C9H11NO2. Ah! Because the benzene originally in benzoate has 5 H. Adding NH2 in para would replace one H, so benzene has 4 H. The benzoate ester has 5 H (from OCH2CH3) plus 4 H from benzene. Then adding NH2 adds 2 H. So total H would be 5 +4 + 2 =11. O is from COO (2 O) and the ester O (1 O) → total 3 O. Wait, but the formula given is O2. So this would imply that option D has O3, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think differently. Maybe the compound isn't a benzoate but something else.

Looking back at the NMR: a triplet at 1.2 (3H), quartet at 4.5 (2H), and a broad singlet at 4.0 (2H).

If the quartet is from OCH2, then perhaps it's an ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.2 is the CH3 of ethyl.

The broad singlet at 4.0 (2H) could be an NH group. Wait, but NH is usually a broad peak, but this integration is 2H, which is unusual for an amine. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to something else.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is an ethyl ester, with an amide group attached to the benzene ring. Like ethyl (4-aminophenoxy)acetate. But I don't think that's one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. If the formula is C9H11NO2, then perhaps the O count is correct. Let me recount the O: COOCH2CH3 has two O (from COO), and the ester O is another O. So three O in total, but the formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, option D can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the peak at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) is from an amide NH group. But in that case, the NH would be split into a singlet. Wait, but in an amide, the NH is usually a broad peak around 6-8 ppm. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 4.0 is from a CH2 group next to an oxygen or nitrogen. Like in a -OCH2- group or -NCH2-.

Wait, another approach: The given formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 → (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring (benzene, 4 degrees) and one double bond (like carbonyl), which adds up to 5. So the structure likely has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Now, the NMR shows aromatic protons, so it's likely a mono-substituted benzene, but the aromatic signals are two doublets, which suggests para substitution.

So, the structure probably has a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions: one being a carbonyl-containing group (like ester or amide), and the other an ethoxy group or something else.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me check: C from benzene (6) + ethoxy (2) + formamide (2: HCONH) → 6+2+2=10 C. Hmm, that's one C too many. So perhaps option B isn't correct.

Wait, maybe formamide is HCONH- attached to the benzene, which has an ethoxy group in para. So the formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 (C8H9O2) + HCONH2 (C1H3NO). Wait, that would be C9 H12 O3 N. Which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH2CH3)-NH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. No, that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, but I made a mistake in the O count. Let me think: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the formula C9H11NO2. Because benzoate ester is C8H8O2, and adding an NH2 would add 1 N and 2 H, making it C8H10O2N. Wait, that's not matching.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the NMR again. The triplet at 1.2 (3H) is CH2CH3. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) is OCH2. Then, the broad singlet at 4.0 (2H) could be NH2. But NH2 is usually a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, but integration of 2H is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -OCH2- group.

Wait, another approach: the 1.20 triplet (3H) is CH2CH3. The 4.5 quartet (2H) is OCH2. So together, that's an ethyl group attached to an O. So the structure has an ethoxy group.

The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be an NH group. But in this case, it's a singlet, so maybe it's an -NH- group, but that's usually in a secondary amide. So perhaps the structure is an amide with an ethoxy group.

Looking at option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 attached to benzene at position 3, and CONH2 at position 1. The aromatic protons would be in meta positions, which would give different NMR signals than the observed two doublets (para substitution). So maybe option A isn't correct.

Option B: formamide with ethoxy in para. So the structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. The ethoxy would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak, but the integration at 4.0 (2H) is unclear.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would have ethoxy in the ester group and NH2 in para. But the O count didn't fit earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the O count for option D. Let me recount. The structure is O=C(O-OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the carbonyl O, the ester O, and the O in OCH2CH3. Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is O, and the ester has two O (the O in COO and the O in OCH2CH3). So total O is 3. So the formula is C9H11NO3. Which doesn't match the given formula of C9H11NO2.

Hmm, so none of the options seem to fit perfectly. But I must choose among the given options.

Wait, going back to the NMR data. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H. So the substituents are in para positions.

The ethoxy group is likely present, as indicated by the NMR triplet and quartet.

The IR shows a strong carbonyl, so ester or amide.

If the structure is an ethyl ester of a para-substituted benzoic acid with an amide group, but I don't see that option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid, which would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. But as we saw earlier, the formula doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the O count. Let me calculate the formula for option D again.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is O=C(O-OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the formula is:

C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) =9 C.

H: Benzene ring has 4 H (para substitution). COOCH2CH3 has 5 H. NH2 has 2 H. Total H:4 +5 +2 =11 H.

O: COO has 2 O, ester O is 1 O → 3 O.

N: 1 N.

So formula is C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't fit, so option D can't be correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the IR has N-H stretches, which suggests an amide or amine. The strong carbonyl suggests an amide or ester.

Looking at the options again:

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. If the structure is correct, but I'm miscalculating the O count.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the formula would be:

C:6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) →9 C.

O: COOCH2CH3 has 2 O (COO) and 1 O from the ester O. Wait, no. The structure is O=C-O-CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is O, the ester O is another O → total 2 O. Then the benzene has no other O. So the formula would have O2. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Oh! Wait, that makes sense. Because the ester group is O=C-O-CH2CH3, which has two O's: one from the carbonyl and one from the ester O. So total O is 2, not 3. Because in the structure O=C-O-CH2CH3, the O in the ester is connected to the CH2CH3. So the formula would be O2.

So earlier mistake was thinking that the ester contributes three O, but actually, it contributes two O.

So the formula for option D is C9H11NO2. Which matches the given formula. So option D is the correct choice.

Now, let's check the NMR for option D:

The ethoxy group in the ester would have the triplet at 1.2 (3H, CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (2H, OCH2).

The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H, which fits para substitution.

The 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. That would be the NH2 group. But NH2 is usually a broad peak, but sometimes can appear as a singlet. However, the integration of 2H suggests it's an -NH2 group. But in the NMR data, there's no mention of a peak around 1-5 ppm for NH2. Hmm, maybe the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is elsewhere.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the only peaks are:

1.20 (t,3H)

4.0 (bs, 2H)

4.5 (q, 2H)

7.0 (d,2H)

8.0 (d,2H)

So the 4.0 peak is a broad singlet, which could be the NH2 group. But in reality, NH2 protons usually appear as a broad peak, but they might not show up in the NMR if they're exchanging. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is part of an amide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the peak at 4.0 ppm is from the -OCH2- group. But in the structure, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, which we've accounted for at 4.5 ppm. So what's the 4.0 peak?

Alternatively, perhaps in option D, the -NH2 is not present, but that can't be because the formula has N. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the peak at 4.0 ppm is from the -NH- group in an amide, but that doesn't fit option D, which is an ester.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but given the formula matches, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325, which are N-H stretches. So the compound must have an amide or amine group.

Option D is an ester with an NH2 group. So the IR would show N-H stretches for the amine. So the IR data fits.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The compound in question has the formula C9H11NO2. The IR and 1H NMR data are provided, and I have four options to choose from. 

First, let me jot down the given data. The IR shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are probably O-H stretches, maybe from an amide or an alcohol. But wait, the other options might have different functional groups. Oh, wait, the strong band at 1720 cm-1—what's that? Oh, that's a carbonyl group. So likely a ketone, ester, amide, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But since the formula includes an O2, it's probably an ester or amide because a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H in the IR which I don't see mentioned here. Wait, but the IR has two peaks around 3420, maybe that's an amine or an alcohol. Hmm.

Then looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are as follows: 1.20 ppm triplet integrating for 3H. That seems like a CH2CH3 group, maybe part of an ethyl group. The triplet at 1.2 with 3H suggests that the adjacent group is a CH2. So perhaps an ethyl ester or an ethyl amide?

Then at 4.0 ppm, there's a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlets could be from an OCH2 group or an NH group. Wait, but NH is usually a broad peak, but in this case, the integration is 2H, so maybe OCH2, like in an ethyl ester. Or perhaps it's a -CH2 attached to something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, at 4.5 ppm, a quartet integrating for 2H. Quartet with 2H... that's probably a -OCH2CH2- group, like in an ester. Wait, because for an ethyl group, the splitting would be a triplet for the CH2 next to the O, but a quartet at 4.5 ppm sounds more like the OCH2 in an ester. Wait, no, in an ethyl ester, the structure is O-C-O-CH2CH3. Wait, maybe I should think about the splitting. If it's a -OCH2CH2- group, then the adjacent CH2 would split into a quartet. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -NCH2 group? Not sure yet.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm as a doublet (2H), and 8.0 ppm as another doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So the substituents are in the para positions. So maybe something like para-substituted phenyl ester or amide.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Wait, that's meta, but the NMR shows a para substitution on the benzene ring. Hmm, but then the substituents would be ethoxy and amide groups... but that might not fit the NMR. Let me think about the structure. Benzamide is a CONH2 group attached to the benzene. If there's an ethoxy group at position 3, the aromatic protons would be meta to each other. But in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each two protons, which suggests two substituents in the para positions. Wait, maybe the substituents are in the para positions. So option A is 3-ethoxy, which would be meta, so the aromatic Hs would be in different patterns than the NMR shows. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the aromatic ring has an ethoxy group in the para position. The substituents would be ethoxy and formamide. So the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons, each two H. That fits with the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm signals. Now, the other parts: the formamide group would have an NH, but looking at the NMR, at 4.0 ppm, it's a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, wait formamide's NH would be a broad peak, but integration of 2H? Formamide has only one NH. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is present. Let me consider the other parts. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at around 1.2 ppm for the CH2CH3, which matches. The OCH2CH3 would split into a quartet or triplet? Wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet, but in an ethoxy group attached to benzene, the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3. So the ethoxy's CH2 would be a quartet, but looking at the NMR, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet of 2H. So that would fit OCH2. Wait, but in an ethoxy group, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet (from the adjacent CH3) around 4.1 ppm, and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.2. Oh wait, but in the NMR, the triplet is at 1.20 (3H), which matches the CH3 of an ethyl group. Then the quartet at 4.5 (2H) would be the OCH2. So that would fit for an ethoxy group. So in option B, the ethoxy is on the benzene, and the formamide is attached. So the formamide would have the NH, but in the NMR, do we see an NH peak? The problem says the NMR data doesn't include a peak for NH. Hmm, the NMR data includes a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Wait, formamide has an NH, but that would be a broad peak, possibly around 8-9 ppm? Or is it possible that the NH is exchanged and not showing up? Alternatively, perhaps the NH is missing, but in formamide, the NH would be present. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the NH is an amide, which can sometimes exchange and show up broad or not show up in the NMR, but that's uncertain. Let me think about the other options.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be a benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a propionate group (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COOH, but in this case, it's likely an ester. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: phenyl group (6 C), propionate would be -OOCR, where R is propyl. So the formula would be C6H5NHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be O=C(O-) attached to CH2CH2CH3 and the benzene. Wait, maybe the structure is O=C(OCH2CH2CH3)-NH-C6H4-4. Hmm, but that would be a urethane type structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the propionate ester of 4-aminophenol. So the structure is O=C(O-) attached to a CH2CH2CH3 group and a benzene ring with NH2 in para position. Wait, but the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me check: C6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) + 1 (NH) plus O's—so perhaps. Now, looking at the NMR: the 1.20 triplet (3H) would fit the ethyl group if it's an ethyl ester. But wait, propionate is a three-carbon group. Hmm. So if it's a propionate ester, the ethyl group would be at the end of a longer chain. Wait, maybe the NMR would show a triplet for the ethyl group, which it does at 1.20. Then another triplet for the adjacent CH2? Wait, but in the NMR, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be the OCH2 from the ester. Hmm. Also, the NH group from the amine would be expected to show up as a broad peak, but the NMR data doesn’t mention any peaks around 2-3 ppm for NH2. Wait, the NMR data shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Maybe that's the NH2 group? But NH2 is usually a broad singlet, but integration of 2H suggests maybe an -NH- group. Hmm, but amines can show up as broad singlets. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's move on to the next option.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with an NH2 group at position 4 and a benzoate ester group (O-CO-O-) attached to an ethyl group. Wait, no, the benzoate ester would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the structure would be O=C(O-OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2. Let me check the molecular formula. Benzene (6 C) + COOCH2CH3 (3 C) + NH2 (no additional C). So total 6 + 3 = 9 C. So formula would be C9H11NO3. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a problem because ethyl benzoate would be C9H10O2. Wait, wait, let me recount. Benzoate is C6H5COOEt. So C6 + COOEt (2 O and 2 C for COO and 2 C for ethyl). So total C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 C? No, wait, the benzoate would be C6H5COOEt. C6 (benzene) + COO (2 O) + Et (2 C). So total C is 6 + 2 (from COO) + 2 (from Et) = 10 C? Wait, no, COO is two O, but the carbons are: benzene (6 C) + COO (2 C) + Et (2 C) → total 10 C? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps it's 4-aminophenyl acetate. Let me see. Acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-O-. So 4-aminophenyl acetate would be C6H4NH2COOEt. So molecular formula would be C9H11NO3, because C6 (benzene) + COOEt (3 O) + NH2. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So D option would have O3, which doesn't match. Hmm, that's an issue. So perhaps D is not the correct option. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me calculate again. For ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: benzoate is O-CO-OEt. So the structure is O=C(OEt)-C6H4NH2. So the formula would be C6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) + N and H's. So the molecular formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Therefore, D can't be the answer. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the given formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate each option's formula:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group. So benzene (6 C) + CONH2 (2 O) + OCH2CH3 (1 O, 2 C). So total C: 6 + 2 (from CONH2? Wait, CONH2 is one C, O, N, and two H. So in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the formula is C6H5CONH2-OCH2CH3. Wait, that would be C9H11NO3. Because C6 + C from CONH2 (1) + OCH2CH3 (2 C) → 6+1+2=9 C. O is from CONH2 (1 O) and OCH2CH3 (1 O) → 2 O. Plus the O from the amide? Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2, which has two O (from CO and NH2? No, the amide is CONH2, which is one O. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So molecular formula is C7H7NO. If I add an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), which is C2H5O, then the total becomes C7 + C2 = C9, H: 7 (from benzamide) + (5 from ethoxy?) Wait, no. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would give C9H11NO2. Because benzamide is C7H7NO, adding an ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C7+2=9 C, H: 7 + (5 H from ethoxy) = 12 H, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate each option properly.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which is attached to CONH2. So the molecular formula is C6H5-OCH2CH3-CONH2. Wait, that would be C6 + 2 (from ethoxy) + 1 (from CONH2) → 9 C. H: Benzene ring has 5 H (since substituents are in positions 3 and 1?), ethoxy has 5 H (OCH2CH3 is 2 CH2 groups: 2+3=5?), and CONH2 has 2 H. So total H? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate each option's formula correctly.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the formamide is HCONH-, attached to the benzene which has an ethoxy group. So molecular formula: C6 (benzene) + 2 (from ethoxy) + 2 (from HCONH) → 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 C? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, formamide is HCONH- so it's C=O-NH-. So the molecule would be C6H4-OCH2CH3 connected to HCONH2. So formula: C6 (benzene) + C from OCH2CH3 (2 C) + C from HCONH2 (2 C: C from CO and another C from NH2? Wait, no. HCONH2 has 1 C (the carbonyl C), and the NH2 is attached. So the formula would be C6 + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide C) → C9. So C6 + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide) = 9 C. O: benzene has O from ethoxy (1 O) and O from formamide (1 O) → 2 O. So formula is C9H? Let's count H. Benzene (4 H, since two substituents in para positions: 4 H?), ethoxy (5 H: OCH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H?), formamide (HCONH2 has 2 H from NH2 and 1 H from the formyl H → total 3 H). So total H: 4 +5 +3 = 12? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So this would give 12 H instead of 11. Hmm, so that might not fit. So perhaps option B isn't correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is NH2-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So propionate ester. So the formula is C6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) + 1 (NH2) → C10, but wait, let me count: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H4NH2 connected to O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So C6 + 3 (propionate) → 9 C. O: benzene has O from ester (O), propionate has O from COO, so 2 O. So formula is C9H? Let's see: benzene has 4 H (para substitution), NH2 has 2 H, propionate ester's CH2CH2CH3 has 6 H (CH2 has 2, next CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3 H). The ester oxygen doesn't add H. So total H: 4 (benzene) + 2 (NH2) + 6 (propyl) = 12 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Hmm, something's not right here.

Wait, maybe the structures are different. Let me think again about each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So that would be benzoate ester with NH2 in para. So formula: C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt: 2 O, 2 C) + NH2 (adds nothing to C). Wait, COOEt is COOCH2CH3, so that's 3 C (COO has 2, Et has 2, but wait, COOCH2CH3 is 3 C: the carbonyl C, the two oxygen-connected C, and the ethyl group). So C6 + 3 = 9 C. O: COO has 2 O, and the benzoate ester has another O in the ester linkage. Wait, COOCH2CH3 has two O in COO and one O in the ester (I think I'm getting confused). Let me just count O: Benzoate ester is O=C(O-OCH2CH3). So the benzoate has two O from COO and one O from the ester. Wait, no, the structure is O=C(O-) connected to OCH2CH3. So COOCH2CH3 has two O's in the ester group. So the formula would be C9H10O2 (from benzoate) plus NH2 (adds one N and two H). Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. So benzoate ester is C9H10O2. Adding NH2 would make it C9H12N O2? Hmm, not matching. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR again. Let's go back.

The 1H NMR has a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) → likely a CH2CH3 group. Next, a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) → probably a OCH2 group. Then, a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Hmm.

Looking at the aromatic region, two doublets, each 2H → para substitution. So the substituents are in para positions, probably an ethoxy and another group.

The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1 → carbonyl. Also, the bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 could be amide N-H stretches or possibly O-H from an alcohol, but given the formula, maybe it's an amide.

So, considering the options again.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would have the ethoxy at meta, but the NMR shows para substitution, so maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure has ethoxy and formamide groups in para. The formamide would have a carbonyl (IR 1720), and the NH would show up as a broad peak, but in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H). Wait, formamide's NH would be a broad peak, but the integration is 2H. Hmm, perhaps it's the OCH2 group from ethoxy. Let me think. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at 1.2 (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 (2H). That matches the NMR data. So the ethoxy part fits.

Then the formamide group would have a carbonyl (IR 1720) and the HCONH- group. So the NH would be in the formamide, but in the NMR, the singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could be part of the formamide structure. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. So the NH2 would be a broad peak, probably. But in the NMR, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm, which is a broad singlet. Hmm. Or maybe the peak at 4.0 is from another group.

Option D was ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, but the formula didn't fit, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula calculation. Let me check again. Benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt. So C6 + 2 (COO) + 2 (Et) → 10 C, but given the formula is C9. Hmm, maybe D isn't the right option.

Looking again at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be O=C(O-) attached to a propyl group and a benzene with NH2. So the ester would have OCH2CH2CH3. The NMR has a triplet at 1.2 (3H), which would be the CH3 of the propyl group. The next CH2 would be a quartet at ~1.6 ppm (but not in the NMR data), and the OCH2 would be a triplet at ~4.1 ppm. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would correspond to the OCH2 in the ester. The triplet at 1.2 (3H) would be the CH3. So this could fit. The aromatic region would have two doublets, which fits the para substitution.

But wait, the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which would be a carbonyl. A propionate ester would have a carbonyl around 1720, so that fits.

The amine group (NH2) would typically have an NH stretch in IR. The IR data shows bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches, which would correspond to a secondary amine (amide) or primary amine. In option C, it's a primary amine (NH2), so the IR would show broad N-H stretches, which matches the data.

Looking at the NMR data again, option C would have:

- The propyl group: 1.2 ppm triplet (CH3), then a quartet around 1.6 (CH2), and a triplet around 4.2 (OCH2). Wait, but the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 (2H)—so maybe that's the OCH2. Then the triplet at 1.2 is the CH3. So that fits.

The aromatic region would have two doublets, as the substituents are in para positions (ethoxy and amide, or ethoxy and something else). Wait, in option C, the substituents are NH2 and the ester group (COOCH2CH2CH3). So the ester group is in para to the NH2. So the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the NMR data.

But then what about the NMR peak at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad singlet)? Hmm. In option C, the structure would have an amine (NH2), which might exchange and not show up in the NMR, but the NMR data doesn't mention any peaks that could correspond to NH2. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group's OCH2 is at 4.5, and the NH2 is elsewhere. But then the peak at 4.0 ppm is a singlet, 2H, broad. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps that's the OCH2 from the ester. Let me think. In option C, the ester is propyl, so the OCH2 would be at around 4.2 ppm as a triplet, but in the NMR data, it's a quartet at 4.5. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl ester. Wait, the NMR has a quartet at 4.5 (2H), which could be OCH2 in an ethyl group. So that would suggest an ethyl ester, not propyl. So perhaps option C isn't the right one.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structures wrong. Let's think again. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C(OOCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the carbonyl is from the benzoate, which would show up at ~1720 cm-1 in IR. The ethoxy group would have triplet at 1.2 (CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). That matches the NMR. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which is correct for para substitution. The NH2 group would have a broad peak, but the NMR doesn't show a peak for it. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is deprotonated and not showing in the NMR, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is part of an amide, making the peak less likely to show. Hmm.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the formula for option D, I thought it didn't fit. Let me recalculate. The formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO3. Because benzoate ester is C8H7O2, and adding NH2 (which is -NH2, so adds N and 2 H). So the formula would be C8H7O2 plus NH2, which is C8H9NO2. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, let me think of the molecular formula.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester would be C9H10O2. Then, adding an NH2 group in para position would make it C9H11NO2. Because the ester is C9H10O2, adding NH2 (which is -N(H)2) would replace a H on the benzene. So the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Oh! Because the benzene ring has 5 H in benzoate ester (if it's mono-substituted), but when adding an NH2 group in para to the ester, the total H would be 5-1 + 2 (from NH2) → 6 H on benzene. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula for option D is C9H11NO2. Because benzoate ester is C8H8O2, but adding an NH2 would make it C8H9NO2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the actual formula:

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the structure O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the formula is:

C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3: 1 from COO, 2 from ethyl) → 9 C.

H: Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: COOEt and NH2 in para), COOEt has 5 H (OCH2CH3: 2+3=5), NH2 has 2 H. So total H:4 +5 +2=11 H.

O: 3 O (COO has 2, ester O is another). Wait, the COOEt group has two O from COO and one O from the ester linkage? Or is it three O in total? No, COOCH2CH3 has two O in the carbonyl and ester groups. Wait, no:

The ester group is O=C-O-CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is O, then the ester oxygen is another O. So in total, COOCH2CH3 has 3 O: one from the carbonyl, and two from the ester (O and O in OCH2CH3). Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O-. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the molecular formula. Each COOCH2CH3 contributes 3 O (the carbonyl O, the ester O, and another O in the OCH2CH3). Wait no, the formula for COOCH2CH3 is C3H6O2 (COO is O2, CH2CH3 is C2H5). So in the benzoate ester, the COOCH2CH3 adds 3 O. So if the benzene ring has another O from the ester linkage? I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the formula for option D is indeed C9H11NO3, which doesn't match the given C9H11NO2. So D might not be the correct option.

Back to option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see. Structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. So C from benzene:6, ethoxy:2, formamide: 2 (HCONH is 2 C: one from CO and one from NH). So 6+2+2=10 C. Wait, but the given formula is C9. Hmm, discrepancy. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formamide is HCONHR, where R is the benzene with ethoxy. So the formamide is HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me count:

HCONH-: 1 C (CO), 2 H (from HCONH), 1 N, 1 O.

4-ethoxyphenyl: 6 C (benzene) + 2 C (ethoxy) → 8 C.

Total C: 1 (from formamide) +8 =9 C.

H: formamide has 1 H (from HCONH), ethoxy has 5 H (OCH2CH3: 2+3), and the benzene (4 H).

Wait, benzene has 4 H because two substituents (ethoxy and formamide) are in para positions. So 4 H in benzene.

Total H: 1 (formamide) +5 (ethoxy) +4 (benzene) =10 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's 10 H, which doesn't match. So option B might not fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about the IR again. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. The medium bands at 3420 and 3325 are likely N-H stretches. So maybe the compound is an amide.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at meta. But NMR shows para substitution. So maybe incorrect.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is ester with NH2. But the formula didn't seem to fit earlier.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is ester with NH2. The formula would be C9H12O2N? Wait, let me recount. 4-aminophenyl propionate is O=C(OCH2CH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So molecular formula: C6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) + 1 (NH2) → 10 C? No, wait, propionate is COOCH2CH2CH3, which is 3 C in the COO and ester. Wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is 3 C (COO has 2, CH2CH2CH3 has 3? No, COOCH2CH2CH3 would be 3 C (COO has 2, and the ester is one C attached to three CH2 groups? Not sure. Alternatively, propionate ester is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So in that case, the propionate group is 3 C, so the formula would be C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH2CH3) + 1 (NH2) → 10 C. Which doesn't match the given formula of 9 C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look again at the options. The correct formula is C9H11NO2. So the options must have 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Looking at option D again: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) → 9 C. H: Benzene has 4 H (para substitution), ethoxy group has 5 H (OCH2CH3: 2 +3), NH2 has 2 H. Total H:4+5+2=11. O: COO has 2 O, ester O is 1 O. Wait, no, the structure is O=C(O-OCH2CH3), which has one O in the carbonyl, two O in the ester (O and O). So total O is 3. So formula is C9H11NO3, which doesn't match the given formula. So option D is not correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount for option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt. So C6H5COOEt has 9 C (6 from benzene, 2 from COO, 2 from Et). But the formula given is C9, so that matches. Now, adding NH2 to the benzene in para position, the formula becomes C9H10O2 (from benzoate) + NH2 (adds N and 2 H, losing one H from the benzene), so C9H11NO2. Ah! Because the benzene originally in benzoate has 5 H. Adding NH2 in para would replace one H, so benzene has 4 H. The benzoate ester has 5 H (from OCH2CH3) plus 4 H from benzene. Then adding NH2 adds 2 H. So total H would be 5 +4 + 2 =11. O is from COO (2 O) and the ester O (1 O) → total 3 O. Wait, but the formula given is O2. So this would imply that option D has O3, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think differently. Maybe the compound isn't a benzoate but something else.

Looking back at the NMR: a triplet at 1.2 (3H), quartet at 4.5 (2H), and a broad singlet at 4.0 (2H).

If the quartet is from OCH2, then perhaps it's an ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.2 is the CH3 of ethyl.

The broad singlet at 4.0 (2H) could be an NH group. Wait, but NH is usually a broad peak, but this integration is 2H, which is unusual for an amine. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to something else.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is an ethyl ester, with an amide group attached to the benzene ring. Like ethyl (4-aminophenoxy)acetate. But I don't think that's one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. If the formula is C9H11NO2, then perhaps the O count is correct. Let me recount the O: COOCH2CH3 has two O (from COO), and the ester O is another O. So three O in total, but the formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, option D can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the peak at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) is from an amide NH group. But in that case, the NH would be split into a singlet. Wait, but in an amide, the NH is usually a broad peak around 6-8 ppm. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 4.0 is from a CH2 group next to an oxygen or nitrogen. Like in a -OCH2- group or -NCH2-.

Wait, another approach: The given formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 → (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring (benzene, 4 degrees) and one double bond (like carbonyl), which adds up to 5. So the structure likely has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Now, the NMR shows aromatic protons, so it's likely a mono-substituted benzene, but the aromatic signals are two doublets, which suggests para substitution.

So, the structure probably has a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions: one being a carbonyl-containing group (like ester or amide), and the other an ethoxy group or something else.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me check: C from benzene (6) + ethoxy (2) + formamide (2: HCONH) → 6+2+2=10 C. Hmm, that's one C too many. So perhaps option B isn't correct.

Wait, maybe formamide is HCONH- attached to the benzene, which has an ethoxy group in para. So the formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 (C8H9O2) + HCONH2 (C1H3NO). Wait, that would be C9 H12 O3 N. Which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH2CH3)-NH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. No, that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, but I made a mistake in the O count. Let me think: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the formula C9H11NO2. Because benzoate ester is C8H8O2, and adding an NH2 would add 1 N and 2 H, making it C8H10O2N. Wait, that's not matching.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the NMR again. The triplet at 1.2 (3H) is CH2CH3. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) is OCH2. Then, the broad singlet at 4.0 (2H) could be NH2. But NH2 is usually a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, but integration of 2H is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -OCH2- group.

Wait, another approach: the 1.20 triplet (3H) is CH2CH3. The 4.5 quartet (2H) is OCH2. So together, that's an ethyl group attached to an O. So the structure has an ethoxy group.

The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be an NH group. But in this case, it's a singlet, so maybe it's an -NH- group, but that's usually in a secondary amide. So perhaps the structure is an amide with an ethoxy group.

Looking at option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 attached to benzene at position 3, and CONH2 at position 1. The aromatic protons would be in meta positions, which would give different NMR signals than the observed two doublets (para substitution). So maybe option A isn't correct.

Option B: formamide with ethoxy in para. So the structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. The ethoxy would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak, but the integration at 4.0 (2H) is unclear.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would have ethoxy in the ester group and NH2 in para. But the O count didn't fit earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the O count for option D. Let me recount. The structure is O=C(O-OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the carbonyl O, the ester O, and the O in OCH2CH3. Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is O, and the ester has two O (the O in COO and the O in OCH2CH3). So total O is 3. So the formula is C9H11NO3. Which doesn't match the given formula of C9H11NO2.

Hmm, so none of the options seem to fit perfectly. But I must choose among the given options.

Wait, going back to the NMR data. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H. So the substituents are in para positions.

The ethoxy group is likely present, as indicated by the NMR triplet and quartet.

The IR shows a strong carbonyl, so ester or amide.

If the structure is an ethyl ester of a para-substituted benzoic acid with an amide group, but I don't see that option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid, which would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. But as we saw earlier, the formula doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the O count. Let me calculate the formula for option D again.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is O=C(O-OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the formula is:

C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) =9 C.

H: Benzene ring has 4 H (para substitution). COOCH2CH3 has 5 H. NH2 has 2 H. Total H:4 +5 +2 =11 H.

O: COO has 2 O, ester O is 1 O → 3 O.

N: 1 N.

So formula is C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't fit, so option D can't be correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the IR has N-H stretches, which suggests an amide or amine. The strong carbonyl suggests an amide or ester.

Looking at the options again:

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. If the structure is correct, but I'm miscalculating the O count.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4NH2. So the formula would be:

C:6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) →9 C.

O: COOCH2CH3 has 2 O (COO) and 1 O from the ester O. Wait, no. The structure is O=C-O-CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is O, the ester O is another O → total 2 O. Then the benzene has no other O. So the formula would have O2. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Oh! Wait, that makes sense. Because the ester group is O=C-O-CH2CH3, which has two O's: one from the carbonyl and one from the ester O. So total O is 2, not 3. Because in the structure O=C-O-CH2CH3, the O in the ester is connected to the CH2CH3. So the formula would be O2.

So earlier mistake was thinking that the ester contributes three O, but actually, it contributes two O.

So the formula for option D is C9H11NO2. Which matches the given formula. So option D is the correct choice.

Now, let's check the NMR for option D:

The ethoxy group in the ester would have the triplet at 1.2 (3H, CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (2H, OCH2).

The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H, which fits para substitution.

The 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. That would be the NH2 group. But NH2 is usually a broad peak, but sometimes can appear as a singlet. However, the integration of 2H suggests it's an -NH2 group. But in the NMR data, there's no mention of a peak around 1-5 ppm for NH2. Hmm, maybe the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is elsewhere.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the only peaks are:

1.20 (t,3H)

4.0 (bs, 2H)

4.5 (q, 2H)

7.0 (d,2H)

8.0 (d,2H)

So the 4.0 peak is a broad singlet, which could be the NH2 group. But in reality, NH2 protons usually appear as a broad peak, but they might not show up in the NMR if they're exchanging. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is part of an amide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the peak at 4.0 ppm is from the -OCH2- group. But in the structure, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, which we've accounted for at 4.5 ppm. So what's the 4.0 peak?

Alternatively, perhaps in option D, the -NH2 is not present, but that can't be because the formula has N. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the peak at 4.0 ppm is from the -NH- group in an amide, but that doesn't fit option D, which is an ester.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but given the formula matches, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325, which are N-H stretches. So the compound must have an amide or amine group.

Option D is an ester with an NH2 group. So the IR would show N-H stretches for the amine. So the IR data fits.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

ANSWER: D
