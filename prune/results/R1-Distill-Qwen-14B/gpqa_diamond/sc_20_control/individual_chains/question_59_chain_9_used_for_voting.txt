Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states: we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. I remember that when mixing acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base to see what's going on.

Let me start by finding the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Molarity = 0.1 M
Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl is a strong acid. Its volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L, and concentration is 0.2 M. So moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

Volume of Ba(OH)2 is 300 mL = 0.3 L, concentration 0.3 M. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Which means moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it will donate some H+ as well, but maybe not completely. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from the acids.

So the total H+ ions come from both HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, let's think about that. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, providing 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. But when you mix it with a strong base, maybe some of the acetic acid will react. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's proceed step by step.

First, let's consider the neutralization between the H+ from HCl and HAc (acetic acid) with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, actually, when you mix all the solutions, all the H+ (from HCl and HAc) will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. But HAc is a weak acid; it doesn't completely donate H+. So I need to handle this carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture and see what's left after neutralization.

Wait, but HAc is a weak acid, and in solution, it will produce some H+ ions. However, when OH- is present, it will react with H+ first before reacting with the weak acid. So maybe I can first calculate the total H+ from HCl and HAc, then subtract the OH- to see if there's excess H+ or OH-.

Wait, but it's probably better to think in terms of the reaction between the H+ sources (HCl and CH3COOH) and the OH- (from Ba(OH)2). Let's break it down.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

H+ from CH3COOH: Well, since it's a weak acid, it's not straightforward. But in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the OH- will react first with the H+ from HCl since it's a strong acid (so it fully dissociates), and then any remaining OH- will react with the H+ from the acetic acid.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Calculating equivalents is a good way. Equivalents are moles multiplied by the number of H+ or OH- ions per molecule.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole H+. So 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, each mole gives 1 mole H+. So 0.05 moles H+ (but not all will dissociate, but perhaps we can consider it as a source of 0.05 equivalents since it's a weak acid).

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, each mole gives 2 moles OH-. So 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, total H+ equivalents: 0.08 (from HCl) + 0.05 (from CH3COOH) = 0.13 equivalents.

Total OH- equivalents: 0.18.

So the OH- will neutralize the H+.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, how much H+ and OH- are left after neutralization?

Total H+ is 0.13, OH- is 0.18.

So 0.13 H+ will react with 0.13 OH-, leaving 0.05 OH- unreacted.

So the excess OH- is 0.05 moles. Since OH- is in excess, the solution will be basic.

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the H+ from CH3COOH is a weak acid, maybe not all of it contributes to H+ in the presence of OH-.

Let me think again. The HCl is a strong acid, so all 0.08 moles of H+ are available. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first neutralize these. Then, any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, that makes more sense. So first, OH- reacts with H+ from HCl.

Moles OH-: 0.18

Moles H+ from HCl: 0.08

So OH- neutralizes 0.08 H+, leaving OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

H+ from CH3COOH: 0.05 moles.

But wait, how much of that is actually available? Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, in solution, it only donates some H+. However, when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the acetic acid. Because OH- is a strong base, it will take H+ from the acetic acid until either the OH- is consumed or the acetic acid is fully deprotonated.

So, in this case, the OH- is 0.10 moles after neutralizing HCl, and the H+ available from CH3COOH is 0.05 moles.

So, OH- will take 0.05 moles of H+ from CH3COOH, neutralizing it, and leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, but that can't be right because the initial calculation said that after neutralizing HCl, the OH- is 0.10, and then it takes 0.05 H+ from CH3COOH, so the remaining OH- would be 0.05. But wait, the CH3COOH is only 0.05 moles, so all of it would be neutralized. So the remaining OH- is 0.10 -0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but the CH3COOH is in 500 mL, and the Ba(OH)2 is in 300 mL, but when mixed, the volumes are additive. The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

Wait, but let me recalculate the steps.

1. Calculate each solution's contribution to H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles HCl → 0.08 H+.

CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles CH3COOH → possibly 0.05 H+ (but not all dissociated, but since it's a weak acid, perhaps I should consider it as a source of H+ that can react with OH-).

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH (as a weak acid): 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 equivalents.

Total OH-: 0.18.

So the OH- will first react with the strong acid's H+ (HCl), then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid's H+ (CH3COOH).

So, H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

OH-: 0.18 moles.

They neutralize each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

CH3COOH has 0.05 moles H+. Let's see if OH- can neutralize all of it.

0.05 H+ + 0.05 OH- → 0.05 H2O.

So, after this, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so actually, when OH- reacts with it, it will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the OH- will take H+ from CH3COOH, converting it into CH3COO^-.

So, after the HCl is neutralized, the OH- will take the H+ from CH3COOH.

So, the net reaction:

HCl (0.08 H+) + Ba(OH)2 (0.18 OH-) → neutralizes to H2O, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH is 0.05 H+ available, which reacts with 0.05 OH-, leaving 0.05 OH-.

So, the total OH- in the solution is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but the total volume is 1200 mL (1.2 L), as I thought earlier.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.041667 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.041667) ≈ 1.38. Because log(0.041667) is about 1.38 (since 10^-1.38 ≈ 0.0417).

Then pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. Because after the OH- has neutralized all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, there's 0.05 moles of OH- left. So the solution is basic, and the pH is calculated from the excess OH-.

Yes, the pOH would be -log( [OH-] ), and pH is 14 - pOH.

So, [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

pOH = -log(0.041666...) .

Let me calculate that. 0.041666 is 1/24, approximately. So log(1/24) is log(0.041666...).

I know that log(4) is about 0.6, so log(4.1666) is around 0.62, but wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of exact calculation.

Alternatively, I can use the formula:

pOH = -log(0.05 / 1.2) → same as -log(0.0416667).

Wait, 0.0416667 is 5/120, but perhaps it's better to calculate it as:

log(0.0416667) = log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) ) → log(4.16667) is approximately 0.62, and log(1e-2) is -2, so 0.62 -2 = -1.38.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4.16667e-2 is 0.0416667. So the log is log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) → log(4.16667) is about 0.62, so 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH = - (-1.38) → 1.38.

Then pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the pH is 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Calculated moles of each component correctly.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but in the presence of strong base, OH- will take its H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 moles OH-.

2. Neutralizing H+ from HCl with OH-:

H+ (0.08) and OH- (0.18). Neutralization: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → H2O. Remaining OH- = 0.10.

3. Neutralizing H+ from CH3COOH with remaining OH-:

CH3COOH has 0.05 H+. OH- (0.10) will take 0.05 H+ from CH3COOH, leaving OH- = 0.05.

4. Total OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.041667 M.

5. pOH = 1.38 → pH = 12.62.

That seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. When you mix strong acid and weak acid with a strong base, the strong base will first neutralize the strong acid, then the weak acid, but in reality, the weak acid in solution would be a buffer solution, but in this case, because we have excess OH- after neutralizing all the H+, the solution is basic.

So the calculation seems correct, and the pH is 12.62, which is option A.

To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we analyze the reaction between the acids and bases as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, it contributes 0.05 moles of H⁺.

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Neutralization of H⁺ from HCl with OH⁻:**  
   OH⁻ reacts with the strong acid H⁺ first.  
   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.08, and moles of OH⁻ = 0.18.  
   After neutralization:  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization of H⁺ from CH₃COOH with remaining OH⁻:**  
   Moles of H⁺ from CH₃COOH = 0.05.  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of OH⁻
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
\text{Total volume} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of OH}^-}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} = 0.041667 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pOH and pH
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.041667) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states: we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. I remember that when mixing acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base to see what's going on.

Let me start by finding the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Molarity = 0.1 M
Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl is a strong acid. Its volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L, and concentration is 0.2 M. So moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

Volume of Ba(OH)2 is 300 mL = 0.3 L, concentration 0.3 M. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Which means moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it will donate some H+ as well, but maybe not completely. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from the acids.

So the total H+ ions come from both HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, let's think about that. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, providing 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. But when you mix it with a strong base, maybe some of the acetic acid will react. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's proceed step by step.

First, let's consider the neutralization between the H+ from HCl and HAc (acetic acid) with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, actually, when you mix all the solutions, all the H+ (from HCl and HAc) will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. But HAc is a weak acid; it doesn't completely donate H+. So I need to handle this carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture and see what's left after neutralization.

Wait, but HAc is a weak acid, and in solution, it will produce some H+ ions. However, when OH- is present, it will react with H+ first before reacting with the weak acid. So maybe I can first calculate the total H+ from HCl and HAc, then subtract the OH- to see if there's excess H+ or OH-.

Wait, but it's probably better to think in terms of the reaction between the H+ sources (HCl and CH3COOH) and the OH- (from Ba(OH)2). Let's break it down.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

H+ from CH3COOH: Well, since it's a weak acid, it's not straightforward. But in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the OH- will react first with the H+ from HCl since it's a strong acid (so it fully dissociates), and then any remaining OH- will react with the H+ from the acetic acid.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Calculating equivalents is a good way. Equivalents are moles multiplied by the number of H+ or OH- ions per molecule.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole H+. So 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, each mole gives 1 mole H+. So 0.05 moles H+ (but not all will dissociate, but perhaps we can consider it as a source of 0.05 equivalents since it's a weak acid).

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, each mole gives 2 moles OH-. So 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, total H+ equivalents: 0.08 (from HCl) + 0.05 (from CH3COOH) = 0.13 equivalents.

Total OH- equivalents: 0.18.

So the OH- will neutralize the H+.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, how much H+ and OH- are left after neutralization?

Total H+ is 0.13, OH- is 0.18.

So 0.13 H+ will react with 0.13 OH-, leaving 0.05 OH- unreacted.

So the excess OH- is 0.05 moles. Since OH- is in excess, the solution will be basic.

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the H+ from CH3COOH is a weak acid, maybe not all of it contributes to H+ in the presence of OH-.

Let me think again. The HCl is a strong acid, so all 0.08 moles of H+ are available. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first neutralize these. Then, any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, that makes more sense. So first, OH- reacts with H+ from HCl.

Moles OH-: 0.18

Moles H+ from HCl: 0.08

So OH- neutralizes 0.08 H+, leaving OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

H+ from CH3COOH: 0.05 moles.

But wait, how much of that is actually available? Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, in solution, it only donates some H+. However, when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the acetic acid. Because OH- is a strong base, it will take H+ from the acetic acid until either the OH- is consumed or the acetic acid is fully deprotonated.

So, in this case, the OH- is 0.10 moles after neutralizing HCl, and the H+ available from CH3COOH is 0.05 moles.

So, OH- will take 0.05 moles of H+ from CH3COOH, neutralizing it, and leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, but that can't be right because the initial calculation said that after neutralizing HCl, the OH- is 0.10, and then it takes 0.05 H+ from CH3COOH, so the remaining OH- would be 0.05. But wait, the CH3COOH is only 0.05 moles, so all of it would be neutralized. So the remaining OH- is 0.10 -0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but the CH3COOH is in 500 mL, and the Ba(OH)2 is in 300 mL, but when mixed, the volumes are additive. The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

Wait, but let me recalculate the steps.

1. Calculate each solution's contribution to H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles HCl → 0.08 H+.

CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles CH3COOH → possibly 0.05 H+ (but not all dissociated, but since it's a weak acid, perhaps I should consider it as a source of H+ that can react with OH-).

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH (as a weak acid): 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 equivalents.

Total OH-: 0.18.

So the OH- will first react with the strong acid's H+ (HCl), then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid's H+ (CH3COOH).

So, H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

OH-: 0.18 moles.

They neutralize each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

CH3COOH has 0.05 moles H+. Let's see if OH- can neutralize all of it.

0.05 H+ + 0.05 OH- → 0.05 H2O.

So, after this, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so actually, when OH- reacts with it, it will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the OH- will take H+ from CH3COOH, converting it into CH3COO^-.

So, after the HCl is neutralized, the OH- will take the H+ from CH3COOH.

So, the net reaction:

HCl (0.08 H+) + Ba(OH)2 (0.18 OH-) → neutralizes to H2O, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH is 0.05 H+ available, which reacts with 0.05 OH-, leaving 0.05 OH-.

So, the total OH- in the solution is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but the total volume is 1200 mL (1.2 L), as I thought earlier.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.041667 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.041667) ≈ 1.38. Because log(0.041667) is about 1.38 (since 10^-1.38 ≈ 0.0417).

Then pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. Because after the OH- has neutralized all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, there's 0.05 moles of OH- left. So the solution is basic, and the pH is calculated from the excess OH-.

Yes, the pOH would be -log( [OH-] ), and pH is 14 - pOH.

So, [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

pOH = -log(0.041666...) .

Let me calculate that. 0.041666 is 1/24, approximately. So log(1/24) is log(0.041666...).

I know that log(4) is about 0.6, so log(4.1666) is around 0.62, but wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of exact calculation.

Alternatively, I can use the formula:

pOH = -log(0.05 / 1.2) → same as -log(0.0416667).

Wait, 0.0416667 is 5/120, but perhaps it's better to calculate it as:

log(0.0416667) = log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) ) → log(4.16667) is approximately 0.62, and log(1e-2) is -2, so 0.62 -2 = -1.38.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4.16667e-2 is 0.0416667. So the log is log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) → log(4.16667) is about 0.62, so 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH = - (-1.38) → 1.38.

Then pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the pH is 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Calculated moles of each component correctly.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but in the presence of strong base, OH- will take its H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 moles OH-.

2. Neutralizing H+ from HCl with OH-:

H+ (0.08) and OH- (0.18). Neutralization: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → H2O. Remaining OH- = 0.10.

3. Neutralizing H+ from CH3COOH with remaining OH-:

CH3COOH has 0.05 H+. OH- (0.10) will take 0.05 H+ from CH3COOH, leaving OH- = 0.05.

4. Total OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.041667 M.

5. pOH = 1.38 → pH = 12.62.

That seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. When you mix strong acid and weak acid with a strong base, the strong base will first neutralize the strong acid, then the weak acid, but in reality, the weak acid in solution would be a buffer solution, but in this case, because we have excess OH- after neutralizing all the H+, the solution is basic.

So the calculation seems correct, and the pH is 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we analyze the reaction between the acids and bases as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, it contributes 0.05 moles of H⁺.

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Neutralization of H⁺ from HCl with OH⁻:**  
   OH⁻ reacts with the strong acid H⁺ first.  
   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.08, and moles of OH⁻ = 0.18.  
   After neutralization:  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization of H⁺ from CH₃COOH with remaining OH⁻:**  
   Moles of H⁺ from CH₃COOH = 0.05.  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of OH⁻
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
\text{Total volume} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of OH}^-}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} = 0.041667 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pOH and pH
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.041667) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.
