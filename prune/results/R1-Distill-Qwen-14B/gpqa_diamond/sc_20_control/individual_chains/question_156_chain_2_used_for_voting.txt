Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that a chemist performs two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC. I need to determine how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, which is a reagent used for epoxidation of alkenes. Wait, but wait, when alkenes react with mCPBA, they typically form epoxides. But the reaction conditions here are aqueous acid after the epoxidation. Oh right, that's an important step. So after the epoxide is formed, maybe there's an acid-catalyzed ring opening?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond to form an epoxide. Then, when you treat the epoxide with aqueous acid, what happens? Oh, right, acid catalyzed epoxide ring opening. In acid, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then the ring opens with water, leading to diols, but that's maybe not the case here. Wait, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, when you have an epoxide and you treat it with acid, like aqueous H3O+, it can undergo ring-opening via a carbocation mechanism. So the epoxide oxygen is protonated, then the ring breaks, and the more substituted carbocation forms. Then water attacks.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the epoxide is formed, and then when you add aqueous acid, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring opening to form a diol? Or perhaps a trans-diol? Or is it something else.

Wait no, wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think: mCPBA is a peracid, which reacts with alkenes to form an epoxide. Then, treating the epoxide with acid (like H3O+) leads to ring-opening. In such conditions, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens. The attack can happen from either side, but in the presence of a good nucleophile like water, the ring opens via a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but wait: when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it typically forms a diol. Let's think about the structure. For oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be at the 4 and 5 positions of octane, but wait, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me sketch it: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, octane is eight carbons. So oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: from left to right, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me number from left to right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's not correct because the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's not a double bond. Oh right, wait, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with double bond between C4 and C5. So structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So the molecule is (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene to form an epoxide, the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the epoxide's structure. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the resulting epoxides are different because the groups on either side of the double bond determine the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, let me think again. mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond. For (E) and (Z) isomers, the addition of the oxygen from mCPBA will form a trans or cis epoxide, respectively?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: when a peracid like mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the original double bond. So if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide will have the two substituents (the oxygen) on opposite sides. Wait, no, wait: no, the epoxide adds across the double bond, so the configuration of the double bond becomes the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. For example, if the alkene is trans (E), then the epoxide will have the two substituents (the two adjacent groups) on opposite sides. So the epoxide will be trans. Similarly, if the alkene is cis (Z), the epoxide will have the substituents on the same side, making it cis.

Wait, but wait, mCPBA tends to form the epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So the configuration of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.

So for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide, which is a trans-epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens. How does that work?

In acid, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens with a nucleophilic attack. The attack can happen from either the same face or opposite face, depending on the substituents.

Wait, but in epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because the carbocation is more stable there. Wait, no, in acid-catalyzed ring-opening, the epoxide becomes protonated, and the ring opens so that the more substituted (and hence more stable) carbocation is formed. So the attack happens preferentially at the more substituted carbon, but the mechanism can lead to different products.

Wait, but in the case of an epoxide derived from a symmetric alkene, like oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric double bond (since the substituents on each side are the same), the epoxide would be symmetric as well. Let me think: oct-4-ene is (E) and (Z), but for each, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3, because oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait: for oct-4-ene, each end of the double bond is attached to a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. So the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2CH3 and another CH2CH2CH2CH3. So the epoxide would be a symmetric epoxide in that case. Oh wait, but only if the starting alkene is symmetric.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5. So each of those carbons (C4 and C5) is connected to two CH2 groups and a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite, but the substituents are the same on each carbon. So the epoxide formed would be a trans epoxide, but since each carbon has the same substituents on either side, it's actually a meso compound.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene. (E)-oct-4-ene has the two substituents across the double bond on opposite sides, which would be higher priority groups. Since each carbon in the double bond (C4 and C5) is attached to a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group and two CH2 groups, the higher priority groups on each carbon would be the same. So the (E) and (Z) designations are because the substituents on each side of the double bond are arranged in a particular way.

Wait, but in any case, the reaction with mCPBA will form an epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, what happens?

In acid, the epoxide ring opens. Since the epoxide is symmetric (because the substituents on each carbon are the same), the ring opening under acid conditions would lead to a single product. Because the attack occurs equally on both carbons, but since they're the same, the product would be a single diol.

Wait, but wait, no—wait, no, the ring opening could proceed in a way that leads to different stereochemistry. Or maybe not, because the epoxide is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific example. For a symmetric epoxide like that, the ring-opening in acid would result in a single product, because the two possible attack positions are equivalent.

Wait, but actually, no. Let me take a specific example. Consider ethylene oxide (epoxide), which is symmetric. When it's opened by acid, it forms ethylene glycol, which is a vicinal diol. But wait, ethylene oxide is a three-membered ring, and upon ring-opening in acid, the two oxygens are on adjacent carbons, leading to a diol. But that's a different structure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting off track. Let's consider the epoxide derived from oct-4-ene. After mCPBA treatment, the epoxide is formed, and then in aqueous acid, the ring opens. So what happens?

In general, when an epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens via protonation, followed by nucleophilic attack. In the case of a symmetric epoxide, where both substituents on each carbon are the same, the attack can occur from either side, but because the molecule is symmetric, the resulting product would be a single diastereomer or maybe even the same product regardless of the attack site.

Wait, but wait: when the epoxide is symmetric, like in the case of a cyclohexene oxide (but in a linear molecule), the ring opening would lead to a diol. For example, if the epoxide is formed from a symmetric diene, the diol formed would be a single compound because the two possible attack positions are equivalent.

So in Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans-epoxide, which is symmetric because both substituents on each carbon are the same. So when treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol, but since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a single compound. Wait, but wait—the diol could have different stereochemistry. Or would it?

Wait, no, in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening, the nucleophile (like water) can attack either carbon, but due to the symmetry, both attacks would lead to the same product. So the diol would be a single compound.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: when the epoxide is symmetric, but the attack occurs with inversion, leading to the same diastereomer each time. So the product would be a single diol, maybe a trans-diol.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the diol. For oct-4-ene, the epoxide is between C4 and C5. Upon ring-opening, each of those carbons (C4 and C5) would get an OH group. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed would have the two OH groups on adjacent carbons, but in a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait, in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening would produce a single diol. Because the attack can occur equally from either side, but due to the symmetry, both possibilities give the same product.

So for Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene becomes an epoxide, which is symmetric, and then upon acid treatment, gives a single diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA. The epoxide formed would be the same as the (E) isomer? Or different?

Wait, no, the (Z) and (E) alkenes would form different epoxides. Because the configuration of the double bond dictates the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no. Let me think: for the (E) isomer, the substituents across the double bond are opposite, so the epoxide will have the two substituents (the oxygen) on opposite sides, making it a trans epoxide.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. The mCPBA adds the epoxide group across the double bond. The original double bond's configuration (E or Z) determines the configuration of the epoxide.

So, if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide will be trans. Similarly, if the starting alkene is Z, the epoxide will be cis.

Wait, that's correct. Because the mCPBA adds the oxygen atoms in a way that the configuration of the epoxide reflects the original double bond.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed will be trans, and for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide will be cis.

Now, when each of these epoxides is treated with aqueous acid, what happens?

Let's consider Reaction 1 first: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide. Then, in acid, the ring opens.

In the case of a trans epoxide (from E-alkene), the ring-opening in acid will proceed. Since the epoxide is trans, the two substituents on each carbon are opposite. So when the ring opens, the nucleophile can attack either carbon. But wait, in a trans epoxide, the substituents are on opposite sides—so maybe the ring opening leads to different diastereomers.

Wait, but wait, the starting epoxide is trans, so the two substituents on each carbon are opposite. When the epoxide is opened, the attack can occur from either face, but because the substituents are trans, the outcome might lead to different products.

Wait, but in this specific case, the epoxide is from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric alkene. So each carbon in the epoxide has the same substituents: a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group and two CH2 groups. So the trans epoxide is actually a meso compound.

Wait, because each carbon has the same substituents, but arranged in a trans manner. So the molecule would be a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, when the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring-opening would proceed in a way that produces a single diol, but perhaps with a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, but let me think again. If the epoxide is meso (achiral), then the diol formed upon ring-opening would also be a single compound. Because the attack can happen from either side, but due to the symmetry, the products would be the same.

Wait, but the diol formed from a meso epoxide would have two OH groups. Depending on the attack, the OH groups could be on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. In acid, the epoxide is protonated, making the oxygen a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens as the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon, because that leads to a more stable carbocation.

Wait, but in this case, each carbon of the epoxide is equally substituted. So both are secondary, I think. So the attack can occur on either carbon, but since the epoxide is symmetric, both attacks would lead to the same product.

Wait, but the attack could occur with either retention or inversion of configuration, leading to possible diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps in the case of an epoxide that's a meso compound, the ring-opening in acid would lead to a single diol product because of the symmetry, but maybe with a specific stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-opening can occur in two different ways, leading to two different diastereomers, but due to the symmetry, they might be identical.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of a specific example. Take (E)-oct-4-ene, which is symmetric. The epoxide formed is a meso compound. When treated with acid, the ring opens. Let me imagine the structure: the epoxide has two CH2CH2CH2CH3 groups on opposite sides.

When the ring opens, each oxygen attacks a carbon. Due to the symmetry, the attack can come from either side, but the product would have the two OH groups in a particular configuration.

Wait, maybe the diol formed would be a meso compound as well, making it a single product. But wait, if the diol has two OH groups on adjacent carbons, and the molecule is symmetric, then the diol would be a meso compound, hence a single product.

So, in Reaction 1, the product would be a single diol, a meso compound.

Similarly, in Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA. The epoxide formed would be a cis epoxide, which, in this case, would not be a meso compound. Wait, because the substituents on each carbon are the same, but the epoxide is cis.

Wait, is the cis epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene a meso compound? Let me see: (Z)-oct-4-ene has the two higher priority groups on the same side. When the epoxide is formed, the oxygen would be on the same side as the substituents.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents on each carbon are the same (CH2CH2CH2CH3 and two CH2 groups on each end). So the cis epoxide would have both oxygen atoms on the same side of the ring. But because the molecule is symmetric, the cis epoxide would actually be a meso compound as well.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. If the epoxide is cis, and the substituents on each carbon are the same, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So both the cis and trans epoxides would be meso compounds because of the symmetry of the starting alkene.

Wait, but wait, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a cis epoxide. But considering the substituents, each carbon in the epoxide would have two CH2 groups and one CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, which is the same on both sides. So the cis epoxide would have the same substituents on each carbon arranged in a cis fashion, but because the molecule is symmetric, this would also be a meso compound.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if you have a cis epoxide, it might not be meso. Let me think: consider 2,3-epoxybutane. If the substituents on each end are the same, then it's a meso compound.

Wait, for example, (R,R) and (S,S) configurations would be enantiomers, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, like in meso compounds, then the molecule is achiral.

Wait, so in the case of (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would have the same substituents on each carbon in a cis configuration. But due to the symmetry of the molecule, this would make it a meso compound. So when treated with acid, the ring-opening would proceed to form a diol that's also a meso compound, hence a single product.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because (E) and (Z) would lead to different diastereomeric diols. Or would they?

Wait, no, because both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, starting from (E) and (Z) alkenes, would form epoxides that are both meso compounds, because of the symmetry. So when each is treated with acid, the ring-opening would produce a single meso diol each time.

Wait, but that can't be right because (E) and (Z) would form different epoxides, which would then form different diols upon ring-opening.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because I'm considering the diastereomers. Alternatively, perhaps in both cases, the diols are the same, leading to the same product. But that can't be, because the starting epoxides are different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the diols. Let me imagine the structure.

For Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide. Upon acid treatment, ring opens to form a diol where the OH groups are on opposite sides. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol is a meso compound with two OH groups on adjacent carbons, trans to each other.

For Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide. Upon acid treatment, the ring opens to form a diol where the OH groups are on the same side. But again, due to the symmetry, this would also be a meso compound, but with the OH groups in a cis configuration.

Wait, but are these two diols the same compound? No, because the configuration of the OH groups is different. Wait, if the diol from Reaction 1 has trans OH groups, and the diol from Reaction 2 has cis OH groups, then they are diastereomers.

Wait, but wait, considering the entire structure, if each diol is a meso compound, then each would be a single compound, but different from each other.

Wait, but wait, if the diol from Reaction 1 is a meso compound with trans OH groups, and the diol from Reaction 2 is a meso compound with cis OH groups, then combining them would give two different compounds.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think of it differently. Perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 are enantiomers, but that can't be because each diol is a meso compound, hence achiral.

Wait, no. A meso compound is achiral, so each diol would be a single compound, but they would be different from each other if the configurations are different.

So, combining the products of both reactions, we would have two different diol compounds.

Wait, but let me think about the actual structures.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans, and upon ring-opening, the diol would have the two OH groups on opposite sides, making it a meso compound. So the diol would be (2R,3S) and (2S,3R), but because of symmetry, it's a single compound that's achiral.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis, leading to a diol where the OH groups are on the same side. But again, due to the symmetry of the molecule, this would be a meso compound, meaning it's achiral as well. So the diol would be (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), but because the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, it's a single compound.

Wait, no, because the configurations would lead to a different diastereomer.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: when you have an epoxide derived from (E) and (Z) alkenes, both are symmetric, so their epoxide ring openings would produce diols that are each a single compound, but different from each other. Thus, in the combined product mixture, you have two different diol compounds.

But wait, each diol is a single compound, so combining them gives two different compounds. Then, when run on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, which doesn't separate enantiomers or diastereomers, each diol would be a single peak. But wait, no—wait, the HPLC column can separate diastereomers if they have different physical properties.

Wait, no, standard reverse-phase HPLC columns are achiral and can separate compounds based on their solubility, polarity, etc., but they won't separate enantiomers or diastereomers unless the column is chiral.

Wait, no. Wait, standard (achiral) HPLC can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties, like different retention times. Enantiomers, on the other hand, have the same physical properties and would elute at the same time on an achiral column, but not on a chiral column.

So in our case, if the two diols are diastereomers, the standard HPLC would show two peaks. And the chiral HPLC, which can distinguish enantiomers, would show more peaks.

Wait, but each diol is a meso compound, which is achiral. So if the two diols are different diastereomers, but each is a meso compound, then when run on a standard HPLC, each would be a single peak. But if the two diols are themselves enantiomers, then the standard HPLC would show one peak for each pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but earlier I thought that each diol is a meso compound, so each is achiral. So if the diols from Reaction 1 and 2 are different diastereomers, each being a meso compound, then on the standard HPLC, they would each give a single peak, so two peaks in total.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to clarify.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → diol is a meso compound (single compound, one peak on standard HPLC).

In Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → diol is a meso compound (another single compound, different from the first, so another peak on standard HPLC).

So when both products are combined, the standard HPLC would show two peaks: one for each diol.

Now, what about the chiral HPLC? Chiral columns can separate enantiomers. But in this case, each diol is a meso compound, which is achiral. So the chiral HPLC wouldn't separate them any further, meaning they would still elute as single peaks. So the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks.

Wait, that's not right. Because each diol is a meso compound, which is achiral, so they wouldn't interact differently with a chiral column. So the chiral column would show each as a single peak. So total of two peaks on both HPLC columns.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't include two peaks on both columns. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC
C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC

So according to this reasoning, both HPLC would show two peaks (option C). But I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps when each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it produces more than one product. Because the epoxide is trans (meso) or cis (meso), maybe the ring-opening leads to more than one product.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about the epoxide ring-opening again.

In the case of a trans epoxide (from E-alkene), during ring-opening in acidic conditions, the attack can occur from either face, leading to two possible products. But due to the symmetry, perhaps these products are the same.

Wait, for example, in a symmetric trans epoxide, when the ring opens, the attack can be from either side, leading to a single product because the two possible products are identical.

Similarly, in a symmetric cis epoxide, the attack would lead to a single product.

So each reaction produces a single diol product. Thus, combining the two products would give two different diols.

Now, on the standard HPLC, which is achiral, each diol is a single compound, so two peaks.

On the chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but each diol is a meso compound (achiral), so they would each elute as a single peak. So chiral HPLC would also show two peaks.

Thus, the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Each diol is a meso compound, which is achiral. So in the standard HPLC, each would be a single peak, so two peaks in total. On the chiral HPLC, each meso compound would also elute as a single peak because they're not enantiomers; they're different compounds entirely. So the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks.

So option C is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the products are analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a trans-epoxide. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, the trans-epoxide is a meso compound, and the ring-opening produces a single diol product. This diol is also a meso compound, meaning it is achiral.

2. **Reaction 2**: (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a cis-epoxide. Similarly, upon treatment with aqueous acid, the cis-epoxide undergoes ring-opening. Again, the starting alkene is symmetric, so the cis-epoxide is a meso compound, and the ring-opening produces a single diol product. This diol is also a meso compound and achiral.

3. **Combining Products**: The products from both reactions are combined. The two diols are diastereomers (one from the trans-epoxide and one from the cis-epoxide), and each is a meso compound.

4. **Analysis on HPLC Columns**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: This column separates compounds based on their physical properties (e.g., polarity, solubility) but cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Since the two diols are diastereomers, they have different physical properties and will elute as two distinct peaks.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: This column can distinguish between enantiomers. However, since both diols are meso compounds (achiral), they will each elute as single peaks, resulting in two peaks in total.

5. **Conclusion**: Both the standard and chiral HPLC columns will show two peaks, corresponding to the two diastereomeric diols.

ANSWER: C
