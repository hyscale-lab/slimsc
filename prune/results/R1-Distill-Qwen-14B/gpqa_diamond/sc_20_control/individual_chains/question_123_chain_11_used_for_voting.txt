Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I remember that in such cases, reference frames and relative motion come into play. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem states that the ejecta part and the galaxy are inertial frames. So, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center at 60,000 km/s from the galaxy's frame. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at the same speed. Wait, no, actually, if frame A is moving at speed v relative to frame B, then in frame A, frame B appears to move at speed -v (since velocities are relative). So, if the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy from the galaxy's perspective, then in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That makes sense.

The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, so time is passing in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the corresponding distance in the Galaxy's frame.

I think this is a problem involving time dilation, since the two frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, 60,000 km/s is a big number. Let me calculate how much that is in terms of the speed of light. Oh, because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light. Hmm, that's 20% the speed of light. So, gamma factor comes into play here.

Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, v is 0.2c, so v squared is 0.04c squared. 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. Square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is about 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0203. Not a huge gamma, but not negligible either.

Wait, but how does time dilation affect this? If 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because the galaxy is moving relative to the ejecta, but from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it. No, wait, each frame sees the other moving. But the time experienced in each frame depends on the relative velocity.

Wait, time dilation formula: t' = gamma (t - (v x)/c² ), but in this case, maybe it's better to think of it as from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's time is moving slower. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I need to think carefully.

In the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So, the time experienced in the galaxy's frame would be t = t' * gamma, where t' is the proper time in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, actually, proper time is the time measured in the frame where the events happen at the same location. So, when the ejecta is moving, the time between two events (like the start and end of the 50 seconds) isn't the same in both frames.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's model this as two frames, S (Galaxy) and S' (ejecta). The ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity v = 60,000 km/s relative to S. So, from S's perspective, S' is moving with v towards S. But from S', S is moving towards them with velocity v.

In the problem, 50 seconds pass in S' (the ejecta's frame). We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S (galaxy's frame) during this time. Wait, but wait, the ejecta is moving in S, so the distance would be simply v multiplied by the time in S.

But wait, the time in S isn't 50 seconds. Because in S, the time between the events (start and end of the 50 seconds in S') would be longer due to time dilation.

Wait, no. The events in question are: in S', the time is 50 seconds. What is the corresponding time in S? Let's see. The time dilation formula is t = gamma * t' if the events happen at the same point in S'. Since the ejecta is moving, but in its own frame, the two events (the start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same location. So, for S', the events are at the same position, so the time dilation formula is t = gamma * t'.

So, t = gamma * 50 s.

Once we have t, the distance in S's frame is simply v multiplied by t.

So, let's compute gamma first.

v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020296.

So, t = gamma * 50 ≈ 1.020296 *50 ≈51.0148 seconds.

Then, distance in S is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.0148 s ≈ 60,000 *51.0148 ≈ 3,060,888 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, so that's close. But perhaps I need to compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.96).

0.96 = 96/100 = 24^2 / 25^2? Wait, no, 24^2 is 576, 25^2 is 625. 0.96 is 96/100, which is 24/25, so sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(24/25)=sqrt(24)/5. Hmm, sqrt(24)=approx 4.89898. So sqrt(24)/5 = ~0.979796. So gamma = 1 / 0.979796 ≈ 1.020305.

So gamma is approximately 1.020305.

t = 50 * 1.020305 ≈ 51.01525 s.

v =60,000 km/s.

Distance: 60,000 * 51.01525 = ?

60,000 *50=3,000,000.

60,000 *1.01525=60,000 *1.01525= 60,000 + 60,000*0.01525.

0.01525 = 1.525% of 60,000 = 60,000 *0.01525= 915.

So 60,000 *1.01525 = 60,000 + 915=60,915.

So total distance is 3,000,000 + 60,915 = 3,060,915 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, and option C is 2,880,000. Hmm, 3,060,915 is much closer to D than any other options.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the time in the Galaxy frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame. Because the events (the start and end of the 50 seconds) in the ejecta frame are at the same point (as the ejecta doesn't move in its own frame), so the time experienced in the galaxy's frame (S) would be longer due to time dilation.

Wait, but what if the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that the ejecta's clock measures 50 seconds. So yes, the time in the Galaxy frame is longer.

Wait, another approach: in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s (v). The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is t. The time in the ejecta's frame is t'= t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) } because t' is the proper time when the events occur at the same location in S'.

Wait, no, the proper time is the smallest time between two events. So, in the frame where the events are at the same location, that's the proper time. So, if the events are the start and end of the 50 seconds in S', then in S' the proper time is 50 s. So the time in S is t = t' / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) }.

Wait, because in S, the events are not at the same location, so the time is longer. So in S, t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * t'.

So, yeah, the same as before. So t ≈51.015 seconds.

Then, distance is v*t=60,000 *51.015≈3,060,900 km. So 3,060,900 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. So that's the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) (or \( 0.2c \)) towards the center of the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame during a time of \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) in the ejecta's reference frame.

### Step 1: Time Dilation
Since the two frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (\( v = 0.2c \)), time dilation must be considered. The relationship between the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) and the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is given by:

\[
t = \gamma t'
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203
\]

Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:

\[
t = \gamma t' = 1.0203 \times 50 \approx 51.015 \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Distance in the Galaxy's Frame
In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at a constant velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:

\[
\text{Distance} = v \cdot t
\]

Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.015 \, \text{s} \):

\[
\text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.015 \approx 3,060,900 \, \text{km}.
\]

### Step 3: Matching the Closest Option
The calculated distance (\( 3,060,900 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option D (\( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)).
