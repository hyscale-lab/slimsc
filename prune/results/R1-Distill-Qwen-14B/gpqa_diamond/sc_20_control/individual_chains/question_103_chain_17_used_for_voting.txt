Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which option gives the correct sequence for a high-yield synthesis.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The molecule is a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). On the phenyl ring, there are substituents at positions 3 and 5. The 3 position is bromo, and the 5 is nitro. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to where the ketone is attached. Oh wait, no. Wait, the ketone is at position 1, so the substituents are on the ring attached to the ketone. So benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The substituents are on the same benzene ring as the ketone. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ketone is on a CH2 group attached to the benzene. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH2)2CO, but wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is (CH3)2CO. Hmm, wait, wait. Let me clarify the structure. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. Because ethan-1-one is (CH3)COCH3? No, wait. No, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but in this case, the ketone is at position 1. So the structure is a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (C=O) via a CH2 group? No, wait, the substituent is on the benzene. Let me draw it mentally: benzene ring with the ketone attached directly at position 1, but wait, that's not possible because ketones are R-CO-R'. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, the structure is (Ph)C(O)CH3. Wait, no. Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. But if it's 1-phenyl, that would mean the phenyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3. But wait, that would be acetophenone, but with substituents on the phenyl ring. So the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl, and on that ring, there are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the point of attachment (the carbonyl group). So the substituents are meta and para to each other?

Wait, the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl. So the point of attachment is position 1, and the substituents are at 3 and 5. So when you have a benzene ring attached to the carbonyl, the substituents are at the meta (3) and another position (5?), but wait, the numbering would be such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 and 5, which are both meta to each other. Wait, no, 3 and 5 are meta to each other? No, if the point of attachment is position 1, then positions 3 and 5 are both meta to position 1, which are two para positions? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: Benzene is a ring with six positions. If the ketone is attached at position 1, then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6, the next are 3 and 5, and the opposite is 4. So substituents at 3 and 5 would be across from each other, but that's not possible as benzene is symmetric. Wait, perhaps the substituents are on the benzene ring in the meta and para positions relative to each other.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So if the ketone is attached at position 1, then the substituents are at 3 and 5. So that would be two substituents on the benzene ring attached to the ketone. So in the benzene ring, the substituents (Br and NO2) are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct positions are 3 and 5 on the benzene ring, which is connected to the ketone. So the benzene ring has Br at position 3 and nitro at position 5.

Now, the synthesis starts from benzene. The goal is to get this substituted ketone.

So the steps likely involve introducing substituents on the benzene ring and then forming the ketone.

But wait, when forming a ketone from benzene, that's typically through a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group to the benzene ring. So benzene reacts with an acyl chloride (like CH3COCl) in the presence of AlCl3 as a catalyst. That would give acetophenone (Ph-C(O)-CH3).

But wait, acetophenone has the ketone directly attached to the benzene. So that's the first step perhaps. But wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are on the benzene attached to the ketone. So the benzene is attached to the ketone, which is attached to a methyl group.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to a (CH2)CO group? No, wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is (Ph)C(O)CH3. So the phenyl is attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to a methyl group.

So, to get that structure, I think we need to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on the benzene ring to introduce the acyl group, but wait, benzene doesn't directly undergo Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done on a ring that already has substituents. Wait, but the substituents are nitro and bromo, which are strong meta directors.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the benzene is first nitrated, then brominated, and then acylated. But I'm not sure about the order because the substituents are in specific positions.

Wait, the target has bromo and nitro on the benzene ring. Nitro is a strong meta-directing group, and bromine is a para and ortho-directing, but it's a leaving group as well.

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, their directing effects can influence where new groups attach. So the order of adding substituents matters.

Wait, if I first nitrate benzene, then brominate, then acylate, but I'm not sure. Let's think:

If benzene is first nitrated (step i), then the nitro group is a meta director. Then, if I brominate, the Br would enter at the meta position relative to nitro. But wait, nitro is a meta director, so after nitration, bromination would add Br at the meta position. So if I have nitro at position 1, Br at position 3. Then, when I acylate, the acetyl group is added at the meta position relative to the nitro, but wait, the ring already has substituents.

Wait, but perhaps the acylation is done after introducing the bromine. Alternatively, the acylation is the last step, but the problem is that Friedel-Crafts doesn't work on rings with strong deactivating groups like nitro.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation requires the ring to be activated. Nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So if the ring already has a nitro group, it's hard to add another substituent via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, so maybe we need to introduce the acyl group first, then the nitro and bromine.

But wait, when you have a ketone group attached to benzene (like acetophenone), the ring is activated for electrophilic substitution because the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group but can still undergo substitution, especially under certain conditions.

Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts won't work on deactivated rings, but once the ring has substituents, any further substitution depends on the substituents' directing effects.

So, perhaps the correct order is to acylate benzene first, then introduce nitro and bromine.

Wait, but the target has bromo and nitro on the ring attached to the ketone. So the benzene ring must have substituents in specific positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The ketone is directly attached to the benzene at position 1. The Br is at position 3, and nitro is at position 5. So relative to the ketone, which is position 1, Br is position 3 (meta), nitro is position 5 (also meta, but perhaps that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's para? No, because 3 and 5 are both meta positions relative to position 1, but that would place them across from each other on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is at position 3 and Br at position 5. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to perform the Friedel-Crafts acylation first to get the ketone, then introduce nitro and bromine.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an acyl chloride. So, benzene reacts with CH3COCl and AlCl3 to give acetophenone.

Once we have acetophenone, we can perform electrophilic substitution. The ketone is a meta director, so any incoming groups would enter at the meta position relative to the ketone.

So, perhaps after acylation, nitration would add nitro at the meta position. Then, bromination would add Br at another position. But wait, nitro is a strong meta director, and bromine is a weaker deactivating group.

Wait, let me think about the steps:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

Acetophenone has the ketone group as a meta director.

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group would add at the meta position relative to the ketone. So, in acetophenone, the ketone is at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 3.

3. Then, brominate. The ring now has a ketone at 1 and nitro at 3. The nitro is a strong meta director. So where would Br add?

Wait, but wait, after nitration, the ring has the ketone (meta) and nitro (another meta). So now, the positions available for Br would be?

Wait, in acetophenone (Ph-CO-CH3), the substituent is at position 1. When we nitrate, the nitro group enters at position 3. Now, the substituents are at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2). The next substitution (Br) should be where?

The nitro group is a strong meta director, and the ketone is a meta director as well. So their combined directing effects would influence where the Br adds. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of a nitro group, the ring is so deactivating that Friedel-Crafts won't work for adding anything else. Wait, but the bromination can proceed via electrophilic substitution, but perhaps only under harsh conditions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bromine is added before the nitro group. Let's see.

Wait, if I have acetophenone, and I brominate it. The ketone is a meta director, so Br would add at the meta position (position 3). Then, nitration would occur. But nitration is a strong electrophile, and the ring has Br at 3 and COCH3 at 1. So where would nitration occur?

The ketone is a meta director, the Br is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So which effect is more dominant? The nitration is a nitronium ion, which is a strong electrophile, but the directing depends on the substituents.

Wait, the Br is at position 3 (meta to the ketone at 1). Nitration would prefer positions ortho or para to Br. But the ketone is at 1, and Br at 3.

So, the possible positions for nitration would be:

Looking at the ring, position 1 has COCH3, position 3 has Br. The positions available are 2 (ortho to Br), 4 (para to Br), 5, 6.

But the ketone (COCH3) is a meta director, so the nitration might be directed by COCH3.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think of all the reaction steps in each option and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3; ii) Br2/FeBr3; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me see what each step does.

Step i: Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

Step ii: Br2 with FeBr3 → electrophilic substitution, bromination. So acetophenone with Br added. Where?

In acetophenone, the ketone is a meta director, so Br should add at position 3.

Now, structure is 3-bromoacetophenone.

Step iii: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrating. Where does it add?

In 3-bromoacetophenone, we have substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br). The Br is a para/ortho director but deactivating. The ketone is a meta director. Which effect dominates? Nitration is a strong electrophile, but the substituents can influence the position.

Wait, acetophenone is already a meta director. But with Br present, which is a meta director (since it's deactivating and ortho/para director? Wait, no, wait. Br is a ortho/para director but deactivating. So in a ring with Br and COCH3, the nitration would be directed by the substituent that's most influential.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the acetophenone is the major director, so nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 5. Because the ketone is at 1, position 3 is already occupied by Br, so the next meta position would be position 5.

So after step iii, we have 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. That's exactly the target molecule. So why are there more steps in option A?

Wait, after step iii, the product is the target. But option A goes on with steps iv to vii, which include Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), NaNO2/HCl (maybe diazotization), H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent, maybe for removing nitro groups?).

Wait, that can't be right. Because the target has nitro groups, so if step iii gives nitro, why would step v nitrate again? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct sequence where the nitro and Br are introduced in the correct positions, and then the acylation happens without disturbing those substituents.

Wait, another approach: the target has nitro and Br on the benzene ring, attached to a ketone. So perhaps the substituents are introduced before the acylation.

Wait, but how? Because after acylation, the ring is substituted, but the substituents (Br, NO2) would have to be introduced in a way that directs the acylation to the correct position.

Wait, perhaps the acylation is done after adding the nitro and Br substituents. But wait, the ring must be activated for Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. Nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work on a nitrobenzene.

So it's not possible to acylate after nitration. Therefore, the acylation must come first.

So the initial steps involve acylation, then adding substituents.

Wait, so perhaps the sequence is: Friedel-Crafts acylation, then nitration, then bromination, but I need to get the substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, but after acylation, the ring is activated with an acyl group. So nitration would be next.

So, step 1: benzene → acylation → acetophenone.

Step 2: nitrate acetophenone. Where? The ketone is a meta director, so nitro would go at position 3.

Step 3: brominate. Now, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 3. So where would Br add? It would be directed by the substituents.

The substituents are COCH3 (meta) and NO2 (meta to COCH3, which is position 3). So the ring now has groups at 1 and 3.

Looking for where Br would add, considering both directors:

The ketone (COCH3) at 1 is a meta director, so positions 3 and 5 are meta. But position 3 is already occupied by NO2. So next available meta position is position 5.

Alternatively, the nitro group at 3 is a meta director as well, so it would direct to positions 6 and  (since nitro is meta, it's positions 6 and perhaps something else). Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the Br would add in a position that's ortho or para to the nitro group.

Nitro is a strong meta director, but it's also deactivating. So in this case, the presence of nitro at 3 may direct the Br to positions 5 (meta to nitro) or 4 (para to nitro).

Wait, position 5 is meta to the nitro group at 3, and position 4 is para to nitro.

Wait, but in the ring, with substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2), the positions available are 2,4,5,6.

The COCH3 at 1 is a meta director, so would direct incoming groups to position 5 (since 3 is taken by NO2).

The NO2 at 3 is a meta director, so directs to positions 6 and  (maybe 1, but already taken). Alternatively, is it para? Wait, nitro groups are meta directors, so incoming groups go to meta positions.

So from nitro at 3, incoming groups would go to 6 and perhaps 2. But position 2 is adjacent to COCH3, which is a meta director.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's easier to look at the options and see which one ends up with the correct substituents.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate benzene. So benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate bromobenzene. Wait, nitration of bromobenzene would add nitro at the meta position relative to Br (since Br is an ortho/para director but deactivating, but nitration is a strong electrophile).

So nitro would be at position 3. So we have 3-nitro-1-bromobenzene? Or 5-nitro-1-bromobenzene? Wait, benzene is symmetric, so perhaps that doesn't matter.

But then step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. Wait, but bromobenzene is deactivated towards electrophilic substitution due to the Br. So Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work; the ring is deactivated. So this option is probably incorrect because acylation won't occur.

So option B is out because after step i and ii, the ring is too deactivated for Friedel-Crafts.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. So nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → this is a reducing condition. Fe/HCl is used for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So nitrobenzene → aniline.

Wait, but then step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But aniline is a strong activating group, so acylation would occur. So aniline to acetophenone derivative.

But wait, nitro group is reduced to amino, then acylation. Then step iv: Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

But the problem is that after acylation, the ring has an acyl group (activating) and an amino group (very activating). But wait, in this case, after reduction, the ring would have an amino group, which is a strong activating group, ortho/para director.

But then, the acylation occurs. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts can't proceed if the ring has an amino group because AlCl3 would react with the NH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done before the reduction.

Wait, no, option C's steps are:

i) nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amino → aniline.

iii) acylation → acetylate aniline. But aniline is a strong activating group, so acylation would occur. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an acyl chloride and AlCl3, but aniline's NH2 group would react with AlCl3, making it unsuitable for Friedel-Crafts. So perhaps this step is not feasible. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amino → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → this is diazotization, which requires aniline in cold HCl, leading to diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → this is a reducing agent. Maybe it's used to reduce the diazonium salt. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used for controlled reduction, perhaps of nitro groups to amines.

Wait, but after diazotization, what's next? If we have a diazonium salt, H3PO2 might not do anything. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reagent.

Wait, perhaps after diazotization, some substitution occurs. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe after step iv, the diazonium group is hydrolyzed, but not sure.

Continuing, step v: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

Step vi: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

Step vii: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

This seems complicated. Let me think about each step.

Step i: Nitro group added to benzene.

Step ii: Reduced to amino → aniline.

Step iii: Diazotization → forms diazonium chloride.

Step iv: H3PO2 is a reducing agent, maybe to form a methyl group? Or perhaps it's used for something else, like removing a nitro group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps step iv is for removing the diazonium group. Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps in step iv, the diazonium group is treated with H3PO2, which is a mild reducing agent. Wait, not sure.

This seems convoluted, and I'm not sure if this is the correct path to the target molecule.

So, going back, the correct sequence must involve acylation first, then adding nitro and bromine in the correct positions.

Looking back at option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetophenone. So Br adds at meta to ketone → position 3.

Now, structure is 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Where does NO2 add?

In 3-bromoacetophenone, the substituents are at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br). The ketone is meta director, Br is para/ortho director but deactivating.

Nitration is a strong electrophile, but the directing would be influenced by the substituents.

The ketone is a stronger director than Br, perhaps. So nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the ketone. Since position 3 is already occupied by Br, the next meta position is 5.

So after step iii, we get 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the target.

But then why does option A have more steps after that?

Wait, looking at the question, the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So after step iii, we have that. So why are there more steps? That suggests that perhaps the correct sequence would end at step iii, but the options include all seven steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the target. Let me double-check the target structure.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

Ethan-1-one is CH3-CO-CH2-? No, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to a (CH3)CO group. So the ketone is at the end of a two-carbon chain. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-CH3. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH2)2CO. Wait, no, wait. I think I was correct earlier: ethan-1-one is acetone, (CH3)2CO. So the structure is phenyl-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, but the substituents are on the phenyl ring. So, in any case, after step iii in option A, we'd have the correct structure, but the option's steps go on. So perhaps option A is incorrect because it introduces more steps that might alter the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the product is not the target, and further steps are needed. But that doesn't make sense because nitration at position 5 would give the correct substituents.

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii of option A adds the nitro group at position 5, making the target. So why is there step iv, which is Fe/HCl?

Fe/HCl is a reducing agent. For example, it can reduce nitro groups to amines. But that would destroy the nitro substituent, which is part of the target. So that can't be right.

So perhaps option A is not the correct sequence because it includes steps that would reduce the nitro group, which is needed in the product.

Hmm, that complicates things. So perhaps option A isn't the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of steps. Let me think again. It's possible that in option A, the nitration occurs before bromination. Let me re-examine the steps:

Option A's steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → maybe position 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. That would change the nitro group, which is not desired.

So the product after step iii is correct, but step iv would ruin it. So option A is incorrect.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think about the correct order of substituents.

The target molecule has Br and nitro in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So the substituents are both meta to the ketone. So perhaps the correct approach is to introduce both substituents via meta directors.

Wait, let me consider a different approach. Maybe the benzene is first nitrated, then brominated in a way that both substituents are introduced, and then the ring is acylated. But wait, acylation requires an activated ring, which nitro and bromine would deactivate. So that's not possible.

Wait, unless the acylation is done before the substitution. So the acylation must come first. Then, nitrate and brominate.

So, sequence: acylation → nitration → bromination.

But in that case, after acylation, the ring is activated, so nitration and bromination can occur. Let's see.

So after acylation, the ring has the ketone. Nitration would add nitro in the meta position (position 3). Then bromination would add Br in the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 5.

Wait, but in acetophenone, the ketone is at position 1. So nitration would add at 3 (meta), and bromination would add at 5 (meta to ketone). But wait, after nitration, the ring has ketone (1) and nitro (3). When bromination occurs, where would Br add?

Because the nitro is a meta director, it would direct Br to position 6 (meta to nitro at 3). But position 5 is meta to ketone and adjacent to nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps bromine adds at position 5, which is meta to ketone and not directly influenced by nitro. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct order is acylation, then nitration, then bromination. Let's see:

1. Acetophenone (1-ketophenyl).

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

3. Brominate → Br adds at 5.

So after step 3, the product is 3-nitro-5-bromoacetophenone, which is the target.

So the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl, AlCl3) → acetophenone.

ii) Nitrate → HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at 3.

iii) Brominate → Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 5.

So the sequence would be i, iii, ii. Wait, no. Because after nitration, the ring has nitro and ketone, and then bromination would happen. But in option A, the steps are i, ii, iii. So after acylation, bromination, nitration.

Wait, in that case, after acylation and bromination, the ring would have Br at 3. Then nitration would occur at position 5, which is meta to ketone (position 1), because position 3 is already occupied by Br.

So in option A, after step iii, the product is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the target. But then why does option A include steps iv to vii, which would alter the product?

So perhaps the correct option is not A, but another option.

Wait, looking back at the options, maybe I missed another option. Let me check option B again. Option B starts with bromination, then nitration, then acylation.

But after bromination, the ring is bromobenzene. Then nitration would occur at meta to Br (position 3). So nitro group at 3. Then acylation would be difficult because the ring is deactivated by Br. So that's not possible.

So option B is out.

Option C: nitrate benzene first. Then reduce to amino. Then acylation. Then brominate. But after reducing nitro to amino, the ring is highly activated, which might make acylation difficult because AlCl3 would react with NH2. So probably not feasible.

Option D: nitrate, reduce, diazotize, reduce, brominate, acylate, nitrate.

This seems complicated. Let's see:

Step i: nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → aniline.

Step iii: NaNO2/HCl → diazonium chloride.

Step iv: H3PO2 → maybe reduce the diazo group? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, H3PO2 is a reducing agent that can reduce certain functional groups. For example, it can reduce nitro groups to amines under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about its effect on diazonium salts.

Assuming step iv is the reduction of the diazonium group, perhaps to a benzene ring again? Or maybe it's a different transformation.

Alternatively, maybe this is a Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that's for introducing formyl groups, which isn't our case.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should think about which option correctly adds the substituents in the correct order without deactivating the ring during acylation.

So the correct sequence must be:

1. Acetophenone via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Bromination at meta → 3-bromoacetophenone.

3. Nitration at meta → 5-nitro adds.

So the reaction steps would be acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking for an option with this order.

Looking at the options:

Option A steps are i: acylation, ii: bromination, iii: nitration. So that's the correct order. But then the steps iv to vii would be extra, which would alter the product. So perhaps the product after step iii is correct, but the option includes further steps which are unnecessary.

Wait, but the question says "which sequence of reactions... would lead to the high-yield synthesis". So perhaps the correct sequence ends at step iii, but the options include all steps, including those that don't contribute or are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps option A includes steps beyond the necessary, but the correct product is formed after step iii, and the rest are distractors.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii are not relevant, but that would mean the option is incorrect because it includes extra steps that would change the product.

Hmm, but the question gives each option as a sequence of seven steps. So each option includes all seven steps. So I must make sure that the entire sequence in the option leads to the target.

So, in option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → 3-bromo-5-aminophenyl acetone.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again → but this would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize amine.

vii) H3PO2 → reduce diazo group, perhaps to phenol? Or maybe it's a different reaction.

So in this case, the product after step iii is correct, but steps iv to vii would convert the nitro group to an amine and then perhaps alter it further. So the final product would not have the nitro group, making option A incorrect.

So, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the correct option's steps don't include steps that would alter the nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is none of the above. But that can't be the case. I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Let me think again. Maybe the nitration occurs before bromination.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced first, then bromination, then acylation. But wait, acylation requires an activated ring. So if the ring has nitro and bromine, it's deactivated and acylation won't happen.

So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the acylation is done before adding any substituents.

So the correct order is:

1. Acetophenone.

2. Nitrate at meta → 3-nitro.

3. Brominate at meta to acetophenone → 5-bromo.

So steps i (acylate), ii (nitrate), iii (brominate).

Looking for an option that has this sequence.

Looking at the options:

Option A's steps are i, ii, iii: acylation, bromination, nitration. Wait, nitration is step iii. So after step iii, we have nitro at position 5.

Wait, in option A, after acylation, bromination occurs (step ii), which adds Br at 3. Then nitration (step iii) adds nitro at 5. So the product is correct.

But then, steps iv to vii would do:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. Which would change the product.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. But the ring now has two nitro groups, which is not desired.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → reduces something.

So clearly, the product after step iii is correct, but the subsequent steps would alter it. So option A is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an option where the acylation is the last step, but that's not possible because the ring has to be activated for acylation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituents are added in a different order. Let me consider the possibility that the order of nitration and bromination is different.

Suppose we first nitrate, then brominate, and then acylate. But wait, acylation requires an activated ring. If the ring has nitro groups, it's deactivated, so acylation won't happen. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added after the acylation, but in a position that's influenced by the nitro group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitro group is introduced before bromination, but after acylation. Let me think.

But no, the ring must be activated for acylation. If the ring has nitro groups, it's deactivated, so acylation can't occur.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, nitration, bromination. So the steps are i, iii, ii. Looking for an option that does this.

Looking at option C: steps are i) nitrate, ii) reduce, iii) acylate. So that's not the case.

Option B: i) brominate, ii) nitrate, iii) acylate. Acylation is third, but the ring is deactivated by Br, so not possible.

Option D: steps are i) nitrate, ii) reduce, iii) diazo, iv) reduce, v) brominate, vi) acylate, vii) nitrate. That seems too convoluted and likely would not lead to the desired product.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm missing something about the additional steps. Maybe the additional steps in option A are not relevant to the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product after step iii is correct, and the subsequent steps are for purification or workup, but that doesn't make sense in the context of the question.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration. So option A has these steps. But the subsequent steps would alter the product, which suggests that option A is not correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Another approach: let's imagine the correct steps are acylation, then nitration, then bromination. But I don't see any option that does that.

Wait, looking at option B: steps are bromination, nitration, acylation. No, because acylation won't work after bromination.

Option C: nitration, reduction, acylation, bromination. Acylation comes after nitration (which is deactivating), so no.

Option D: nitration, reduction, diazotization, reduction, bromination, acylation, nitration. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitration and bromination as meta directors.

Wait, in the target, the nitro is at position 5, which is meta to the ketone at 1, and Br is at position 3, also meta to the ketone.

So the correct order would be:

1. Acetophenone.

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

3. Brominate → Br at 5.

But how? Because after nitration, the ring has nitro at 3 and ketone at 1. Bromination would then go to position 5, which is para to nitro (since nitro is at 3, para would be 6, but that's not correct). Hmm.

Wait, no. The nitro group is a meta director. So from nitro at 3, the next meta positions are 6 and 1 (but 1 is already taken by ketone). So bromine would add at position 6.

But that's not the desired position. The desired position is 5.

Hmm. So perhaps this approach won't work.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to brominate first, then nitrate.

So:

1. Acetophenone.

2. Brominate → Br at 3.

3. Nitrate → nitro at 5.

Which is the target.

So steps are i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. Which is option A's steps i, ii, iii.

But then steps iv to vii would be done, which would ruin the product.

Wait, unless the steps after iii in option A are just distractors and the product is formed at step iii. But the question's options include all seven steps, so the entire sequence must lead to the target.

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering the steps after iii in option A. Let me re-examine them.

Option A's steps:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → reduce.

Wait, after step iii, the product is the target. Then, step iv reduces nitro to amine, which would change the product.

So, the entire sequence in option A would lead to a different product. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's possible product.

Another approach: Let's think about the substituents.

The target has two substituents on the benzene ring: Br and NO2, both meta to the ketone.

So, the correct sequence must introduce both substituents in the correct positions before acylation. But wait, that's impossible because acylation requires an activated ring.

Wait, unless the substituents are introduced after acylation, via meta direction.

So, acylation first (step i), then nitration (step iii), then bromination (step ii). Wait, but that's not the case in any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option again.

Option A's steps lead to the correct product after step iii, but then the steps iv to vii would change it. So option A is incorrect.

Option B's steps would not allow acylation after bromination.

Option C's steps involve reducing nitro to amine before acylation, which may not be feasible.

Option D's steps are too complicated and likely would not yield the desired product.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, but the steps after iii are not part of the synthesis. But the question says the sequence includes all seven steps. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again about option A's steps:

i) Acetophenone.

ii) Br at 3.

iii) Nitro at 5 → target.

iv) Reduce nitro to amine → 3-bromo-5-aminophenyl acetone.

v) Nitrate again → adds another nitro group. Not desired.

vi) Diazotization → forms diazonium.

vii) H3PO2 → may reduce to phenol. Not desired.

So the final product is not the target. So option A is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option A, but the steps after iii are irrelevant or perhaps a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation → acetophenone derivative, but this may not work because AlCl3 would react with NH2.

So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, unless the acylation is done under conditions that don't involve AlCl3 reacting with the amine. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after reducing nitro to amine, the acylation occurs using a different method, but I don't think that's feasible.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not fully confident because the steps after iii would change the product.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the steps after iii in option A are for protecting groups or other purposes, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is not reduced because the conditions aren't strong enough. For example, Fe/HCl is a milder reducing agent and might not reduce nitro groups. Wait, no, Fe and HCl are typically used to reduce nitro groups to amines.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration. The only option that has these steps is option A, but the subsequent steps would change the product. So perhaps the correct option is A, but only steps i, ii, iii are relevant. Since all options include seven steps, which is confusing, perhaps the correct answer is A.

The problem involves synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The target molecule has a ketone group attached to a benzene ring, with bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination adds Br at the meta position relative to the ketone, resulting in 3-bromoacetophenone.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at the meta position relative to the ketone, yielding 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which matches the target structure.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve reducing the nitro group to an amine, nitrating again, diazotizing, and reducing the diazonium salt. These steps would alter the product, making it inconsistent with the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: While steps i–iii produce the correct product, the inclusion of steps iv–vii invalidates this option.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination of benzene forms bromobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group at the meta position relative to bromine, forming 3-nitro-1-bromobenzene.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted, but bromine is a deactivating group, making the ring unreactive toward acylation. This step is not feasible.

**Conclusion**: Option B is incorrect because acylation cannot occur after bromination.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration of benzene forms nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine, forming aniline.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted, but the amine group reacts with AlCl₃, making this step infeasible.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination adds Br, but the sequence does not lead to the correct substituent positions.

**Conclusion**: Option C is incorrect because the amine group interferes with acylation.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration of benzene forms nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine, forming aniline.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: H₃PO₂ is used, possibly to reduce the diazonium salt, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.
5. **Steps v–vii**: Bromination, acylation, and additional nitration are performed, but the sequence is convoluted and does not yield the desired product.

**Conclusion**: Option D is incorrect due to the complexity and inefficiency of the sequence.

### Final Answer:
The correct sequence of reactions to synthesize the target molecule is acylation, bromination, and nitration. While **Option A** includes these steps (i–iii), the subsequent steps (iv–vii) would alter the product, making the sequence incomplete. However, among the given options, **Option A** is the closest to the correct synthesis pathway.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which option gives the correct sequence for a high-yield synthesis.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The molecule is a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). On the phenyl ring, there are substituents at positions 3 and 5. The 3 position is bromo, and the 5 is nitro. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to where the ketone is attached. Oh wait, no. Wait, the ketone is at position 1, so the substituents are on the ring attached to the ketone. So benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The substituents are on the same benzene ring as the ketone. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ketone is on a CH2 group attached to the benzene. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH2)2CO, but wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is (CH3)2CO. Hmm, wait, wait. Let me clarify the structure. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. Because ethan-1-one is (CH3)COCH3? No, wait. No, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but in this case, the ketone is at position 1. So the structure is a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (C=O) via a CH2 group? No, wait, the substituent is on the benzene. Let me draw it mentally: benzene ring with the ketone attached directly at position 1, but wait, that's not possible because ketones are R-CO-R'. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, the structure is (Ph)C(O)CH3. Wait, no. Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. But if it's 1-phenyl, that would mean the phenyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3. But wait, that would be acetophenone, but with substituents on the phenyl ring. So the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl, and on that ring, there are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the point of attachment (the carbonyl group). So the substituents are meta and para to each other?

Wait, the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl. So the point of attachment is position 1, and the substituents are at 3 and 5. So when you have a benzene ring attached to the carbonyl, the substituents are at the meta (3) and another position (5?), but wait, the numbering would be such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 and 5, which are both meta to each other. Wait, no, 3 and 5 are meta to each other? No, if the point of attachment is position 1, then positions 3 and 5 are both meta to position 1, which are two para positions? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: Benzene is a ring with six positions. If the ketone is attached at position 1, then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6, the next are 3 and 5, and the opposite is 4. So substituents at 3 and 5 would be across from each other, but that's not possible as benzene is symmetric. Wait, perhaps the substituents are on the benzene ring in the meta and para positions relative to each other.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So if the ketone is attached at position 1, then the substituents are at 3 and 5. So that would be two substituents on the benzene ring attached to the ketone. So in the benzene ring, the substituents (Br and NO2) are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct positions are 3 and 5 on the benzene ring, which is connected to the ketone. So the benzene ring has Br at position 3 and nitro at position 5.

Now, the synthesis starts from benzene. The goal is to get this substituted ketone.

So the steps likely involve introducing substituents on the benzene ring and then forming the ketone.

But wait, when forming a ketone from benzene, that's typically through a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group to the benzene ring. So benzene reacts with an acyl chloride (like CH3COCl) in the presence of AlCl3 as a catalyst. That would give acetophenone (Ph-C(O)-CH3).

But wait, acetophenone has the ketone directly attached to the benzene. So that's the first step perhaps. But wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are on the benzene attached to the ketone. So the benzene is attached to the ketone, which is attached to a methyl group.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to a (CH2)CO group? No, wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is (Ph)C(O)CH3. So the phenyl is attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to a methyl group.

So, to get that structure, I think we need to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on the benzene ring to introduce the acyl group, but wait, benzene doesn't directly undergo Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done on a ring that already has substituents. Wait, but the substituents are nitro and bromo, which are strong meta directors.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the benzene is first nitrated, then brominated, and then acylated. But I'm not sure about the order because the substituents are in specific positions.

Wait, the target has bromo and nitro on the benzene ring. Nitro is a strong meta-directing group, and bromine is a para and ortho-directing, but it's a leaving group as well.

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, their directing effects can influence where new groups attach. So the order of adding substituents matters.

Wait, if I first nitrate benzene, then brominate, then acylate, but I'm not sure. Let's think:

If benzene is first nitrated (step i), then the nitro group is a meta director. Then, if I brominate, the Br would enter at the meta position relative to nitro. But wait, nitro is a meta director, so after nitration, bromination would add Br at the meta position. So if I have nitro at position 1, Br at position 3. Then, when I acylate, the acetyl group is added at the meta position relative to the nitro, but wait, the ring already has substituents.

Wait, but perhaps the acylation is done after introducing the bromine. Alternatively, the acylation is the last step, but the problem is that Friedel-Crafts doesn't work on rings with strong deactivating groups like nitro.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation requires the ring to be activated. Nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So if the ring already has a nitro group, it's hard to add another substituent via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, so maybe we need to introduce the acyl group first, then the nitro and bromine.

But wait, when you have a ketone group attached to benzene (like acetophenone), the ring is activated for electrophilic substitution because the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group but can still undergo substitution, especially under certain conditions.

Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts won't work on deactivated rings, but once the ring has substituents, any further substitution depends on the substituents' directing effects.

So, perhaps the correct order is to acylate benzene first, then introduce nitro and bromine.

Wait, but the target has bromo and nitro on the ring attached to the ketone. So the benzene ring must have substituents in specific positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The ketone is directly attached to the benzene at position 1. The Br is at position 3, and nitro is at position 5. So relative to the ketone, which is position 1, Br is position 3 (meta), nitro is position 5 (also meta, but perhaps that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's para? No, because 3 and 5 are both meta positions relative to position 1, but that would place them across from each other on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is at position 3 and Br at position 5. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to perform the Friedel-Crafts acylation first to get the ketone, then introduce nitro and bromine.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an acyl chloride. So, benzene reacts with CH3COCl and AlCl3 to give acetophenone.

Once we have acetophenone, we can perform electrophilic substitution. The ketone is a meta director, so any incoming groups would enter at the meta position relative to the ketone.

So, perhaps after acylation, nitration would add nitro at the meta position. Then, bromination would add Br at another position. But wait, nitro is a strong meta director, and bromine is a weaker deactivating group.

Wait, let me think about the steps:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

Acetophenone has the ketone group as a meta director.

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group would add at the meta position relative to the ketone. So, in acetophenone, the ketone is at position 1. Nitration would add nitro at position 3.

3. Then, brominate. The ring now has a ketone at 1 and nitro at 3. The nitro is a strong meta director. So where would Br add?

Wait, but wait, after nitration, the ring has the ketone (meta) and nitro (another meta). So now, the positions available for Br would be?

Wait, in acetophenone (Ph-CO-CH3), the substituent is at position 1. When we nitrate, the nitro group enters at position 3. Now, the substituents are at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2). The next substitution (Br) should be where?

The nitro group is a strong meta director, and the ketone is a meta director as well. So their combined directing effects would influence where the Br adds. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of a nitro group, the ring is so deactivating that Friedel-Crafts won't work for adding anything else. Wait, but the bromination can proceed via electrophilic substitution, but perhaps only under harsh conditions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bromine is added before the nitro group. Let's see.

Wait, if I have acetophenone, and I brominate it. The ketone is a meta director, so Br would add at the meta position (position 3). Then, nitration would occur. But nitration is a strong electrophile, and the ring has Br at 3 and COCH3 at 1. So where would nitration occur?

The ketone is a meta director, the Br is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So which effect is more dominant? The nitration is a nitronium ion, which is a strong electrophile, but the directing depends on the substituents.

Wait, the Br is at position 3 (meta to the ketone at 1). Nitration would prefer positions ortho or para to Br. But the ketone is at 1, and Br at 3.

So, the possible positions for nitration would be:

Looking at the ring, position 1 has COCH3, position 3 has Br. The positions available are 2 (ortho to Br), 4 (para to Br), 5, 6.

But the ketone (COCH3) is a meta director, so the nitration might be directed by COCH3.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think of all the reaction steps in each option and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3; ii) Br2/FeBr3; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me see what each step does.

Step i: Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

Step ii: Br2 with FeBr3 → electrophilic substitution, bromination. So acetophenone with Br added. Where?

In acetophenone, the ketone is a meta director, so Br should add at position 3.

Now, structure is 3-bromoacetophenone.

Step iii: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrating. Where does it add?

In 3-bromoacetophenone, we have substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br). The Br is a para/ortho director but deactivating. The ketone is a meta director. Which effect dominates? Nitration is a strong electrophile, but the substituents can influence the position.

Wait, acetophenone is already a meta director. But with Br present, which is a meta director (since it's deactivating and ortho/para director? Wait, no, wait. Br is a ortho/para director but deactivating. So in a ring with Br and COCH3, the nitration would be directed by the substituent that's most influential.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the acetophenone is the major director, so nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 5. Because the ketone is at 1, position 3 is already occupied by Br, so the next meta position would be position 5.

So after step iii, we have 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. That's exactly the target molecule. So why are there more steps in option A?

Wait, after step iii, the product is the target. But option A goes on with steps iv to vii, which include Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), NaNO2/HCl (maybe diazotization), H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent, maybe for removing nitro groups?).

Wait, that can't be right. Because the target has nitro groups, so if step iii gives nitro, why would step v nitrate again? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct sequence where the nitro and Br are introduced in the correct positions, and then the acylation happens without disturbing those substituents.

Wait, another approach: the target has nitro and Br on the benzene ring, attached to a ketone. So perhaps the substituents are introduced before the acylation.

Wait, but how? Because after acylation, the ring is substituted, but the substituents (Br, NO2) would have to be introduced in a way that directs the acylation to the correct position.

Wait, perhaps the acylation is done after adding the nitro and Br substituents. But wait, the ring must be activated for Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. Nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work on a nitrobenzene.

So it's not possible to acylate after nitration. Therefore, the acylation must come first.

So the initial steps involve acylation, then adding substituents.

Wait, so perhaps the sequence is: Friedel-Crafts acylation, then nitration, then bromination, but I need to get the substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, but after acylation, the ring is activated with an acyl group. So nitration would be next.

So, step 1: benzene → acylation → acetophenone.

Step 2: nitrate acetophenone. Where? The ketone is a meta director, so nitro would go at position 3.

Step 3: brominate. Now, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 3. So where would Br add? It would be directed by the substituents.

The substituents are COCH3 (meta) and NO2 (meta to COCH3, which is position 3). So the ring now has groups at 1 and 3.

Looking for where Br would add, considering both directors:

The ketone (COCH3) at 1 is a meta director, so positions 3 and 5 are meta. But position 3 is already occupied by NO2. So next available meta position is position 5.

Alternatively, the nitro group at 3 is a meta director as well, so it would direct to positions 6 and  (since nitro is meta, it's positions 6 and perhaps something else). Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the Br would add in a position that's ortho or para to the nitro group.

Nitro is a strong meta director, but it's also deactivating. So in this case, the presence of nitro at 3 may direct the Br to positions 5 (meta to nitro) or 4 (para to nitro).

Wait, position 5 is meta to the nitro group at 3, and position 4 is para to nitro.

Wait, but in the ring, with substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2), the positions available are 2,4,5,6.

The COCH3 at 1 is a meta director, so would direct incoming groups to position 5 (since 3 is taken by NO2).

The NO2 at 3 is a meta director, so directs to positions 6 and  (maybe 1, but already taken). Alternatively, is it para? Wait, nitro groups are meta directors, so incoming groups go to meta positions.

So from nitro at 3, incoming groups would go to 6 and perhaps 2. But position 2 is adjacent to COCH3, which is a meta director.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's easier to look at the options and see which one ends up with the correct substituents.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate benzene. So benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate bromobenzene. Wait, nitration of bromobenzene would add nitro at the meta position relative to Br (since Br is an ortho/para director but deactivating, but nitration is a strong electrophile).

So nitro would be at position 3. So we have 3-nitro-1-bromobenzene? Or 5-nitro-1-bromobenzene? Wait, benzene is symmetric, so perhaps that doesn't matter.

But then step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. Wait, but bromobenzene is deactivated towards electrophilic substitution due to the Br. So Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work; the ring is deactivated. So this option is probably incorrect because acylation won't occur.

So option B is out because after step i and ii, the ring is too deactivated for Friedel-Crafts.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. So nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → this is a reducing condition. Fe/HCl is used for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So nitrobenzene → aniline.

Wait, but then step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But aniline is a strong activating group, so acylation would occur. So aniline to acetophenone derivative.

But wait, nitro group is reduced to amino, then acylation. Then step iv: Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

But the problem is that after acylation, the ring has an acyl group (activating) and an amino group (very activating). But wait, in this case, after reduction, the ring would have an amino group, which is a strong activating group, ortho/para director.

But then, the acylation occurs. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts can't proceed if the ring has an amino group because AlCl3 would react with the NH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done before the reduction.

Wait, no, option C's steps are:

i) nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amino → aniline.

iii) acylation → acetylate aniline. But aniline is a strong activating group, so acylation would occur. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an acyl chloride and AlCl3, but aniline's NH2 group would react with AlCl3, making it unsuitable for Friedel-Crafts. So perhaps this step is not feasible. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amino → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → this is diazotization, which requires aniline in cold HCl, leading to diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → this is a reducing agent. Maybe it's used to reduce the diazonium salt. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used for controlled reduction, perhaps of nitro groups to amines.

Wait, but after diazotization, what's next? If we have a diazonium salt, H3PO2 might not do anything. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reagent.

Wait, perhaps after diazotization, some substitution occurs. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe after step iv, the diazonium group is hydrolyzed, but not sure.

Continuing, step v: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

Step vi: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

Step vii: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

This seems complicated. Let me think about each step.

Step i: Nitro group added to benzene.

Step ii: Reduced to amino → aniline.

Step iii: Diazotization → forms diazonium chloride.

Step iv: H3PO2 is a reducing agent, maybe to form a methyl group? Or perhaps it's used for something else, like removing a nitro group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps step iv is for removing the diazonium group. Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps in step iv, the diazonium group is treated with H3PO2, which is a mild reducing agent. Wait, not sure.

This seems convoluted, and I'm not sure if this is the correct path to the target molecule.

So, going back, the correct sequence must involve acylation first, then adding nitro and bromine in the correct positions.

Looking back at option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetophenone. So Br adds at meta to ketone → position 3.

Now, structure is 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Where does NO2 add?

In 3-bromoacetophenone, the substituents are at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br). The ketone is meta director, Br is para/ortho director but deactivating.

Nitration is a strong electrophile, but the directing would be influenced by the substituents.

The ketone is a stronger director than Br, perhaps. So nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the ketone. Since position 3 is already occupied by Br, the next meta position is 5.

So after step iii, we get 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the target.

But then why does option A have more steps after that?

Wait, looking at the question, the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So after step iii, we have that. So why are there more steps? That suggests that perhaps the correct sequence would end at step iii, but the options include all seven steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the target. Let me double-check the target structure.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

Ethan-1-one is CH3-CO-CH2-? No, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to a (CH3)CO group. So the ketone is at the end of a two-carbon chain. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-CH3. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH2)2CO. Wait, no, wait. I think I was correct earlier: ethan-1-one is acetone, (CH3)2CO. So the structure is phenyl-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, but the substituents are on the phenyl ring. So, in any case, after step iii in option A, we'd have the correct structure, but the option's steps go on. So perhaps option A is incorrect because it introduces more steps that might alter the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the product is not the target, and further steps are needed. But that doesn't make sense because nitration at position 5 would give the correct substituents.

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii of option A adds the nitro group at position 5, making the target. So why is there step iv, which is Fe/HCl?

Fe/HCl is a reducing agent. For example, it can reduce nitro groups to amines. But that would destroy the nitro substituent, which is part of the target. So that can't be right.

So perhaps option A is not the correct sequence because it includes steps that would reduce the nitro group, which is needed in the product.

Hmm, that complicates things. So perhaps option A isn't the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of steps. Let me think again. It's possible that in option A, the nitration occurs before bromination. Let me re-examine the steps:

Option A's steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → maybe position 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. That would change the nitro group, which is not desired.

So the product after step iii is correct, but step iv would ruin it. So option A is incorrect.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think about the correct order of substituents.

The target molecule has Br and nitro in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So the substituents are both meta to the ketone. So perhaps the correct approach is to introduce both substituents via meta directors.

Wait, let me consider a different approach. Maybe the benzene is first nitrated, then brominated in a way that both substituents are introduced, and then the ring is acylated. But wait, acylation requires an activated ring, which nitro and bromine would deactivate. So that's not possible.

Wait, unless the acylation is done before the substitution. So the acylation must come first. Then, nitrate and brominate.

So, sequence: acylation → nitration → bromination.

But in that case, after acylation, the ring is activated, so nitration and bromination can occur. Let's see.

So after acylation, the ring has the ketone. Nitration would add nitro in the meta position (position 3). Then bromination would add Br in the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 5.

Wait, but in acetophenone, the ketone is at position 1. So nitration would add at 3 (meta), and bromination would add at 5 (meta to ketone). But wait, after nitration, the ring has ketone (1) and nitro (3). When bromination occurs, where would Br add?

Because the nitro is a meta director, it would direct Br to position 6 (meta to nitro at 3). But position 5 is meta to ketone and adjacent to nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps bromine adds at position 5, which is meta to ketone and not directly influenced by nitro. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct order is acylation, then nitration, then bromination. Let's see:

1. Acetophenone (1-ketophenyl).

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

3. Brominate → Br adds at 5.

So after step 3, the product is 3-nitro-5-bromoacetophenone, which is the target.

So the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl, AlCl3) → acetophenone.

ii) Nitrate → HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at 3.

iii) Brominate → Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 5.

So the sequence would be i, iii, ii. Wait, no. Because after nitration, the ring has nitro and ketone, and then bromination would happen. But in option A, the steps are i, ii, iii. So after acylation, bromination, nitration.

Wait, in that case, after acylation and bromination, the ring would have Br at 3. Then nitration would occur at position 5, which is meta to ketone (position 1), because position 3 is already occupied by Br.

So in option A, after step iii, the product is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the target. But then why does option A include steps iv to vii, which would alter the product?

So perhaps the correct option is not A, but another option.

Wait, looking back at the options, maybe I missed another option. Let me check option B again. Option B starts with bromination, then nitration, then acylation.

But after bromination, the ring is bromobenzene. Then nitration would occur at meta to Br (position 3). So nitro group at 3. Then acylation would be difficult because the ring is deactivated by Br. So that's not possible.

So option B is out.

Option C: nitrate benzene first. Then reduce to amino. Then acylation. Then brominate. But after reducing nitro to amino, the ring is highly activated, which might make acylation difficult because AlCl3 would react with NH2. So probably not feasible.

Option D: nitrate, reduce, diazotize, reduce, brominate, acylate, nitrate.

This seems complicated. Let's see:

Step i: nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → aniline.

Step iii: NaNO2/HCl → diazonium chloride.

Step iv: H3PO2 → maybe reduce the diazo group? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, H3PO2 is a reducing agent that can reduce certain functional groups. For example, it can reduce nitro groups to amines under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about its effect on diazonium salts.

Assuming step iv is the reduction of the diazonium group, perhaps to a benzene ring again? Or maybe it's a different transformation.

Alternatively, maybe this is a Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that's for introducing formyl groups, which isn't our case.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should think about which option correctly adds the substituents in the correct order without deactivating the ring during acylation.

So the correct sequence must be:

1. Acetophenone via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Bromination at meta → 3-bromoacetophenone.

3. Nitration at meta → 5-nitro adds.

So the reaction steps would be acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking for an option with this order.

Looking at the options:

Option A steps are i: acylation, ii: bromination, iii: nitration. So that's the correct order. But then the steps iv to vii would be extra, which would alter the product. So perhaps the product after step iii is correct, but the option includes further steps which are unnecessary.

Wait, but the question says "which sequence of reactions... would lead to the high-yield synthesis". So perhaps the correct sequence ends at step iii, but the options include all steps, including those that don't contribute or are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps option A includes steps beyond the necessary, but the correct product is formed after step iii, and the rest are distractors.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii are not relevant, but that would mean the option is incorrect because it includes extra steps that would change the product.

Hmm, but the question gives each option as a sequence of seven steps. So each option includes all seven steps. So I must make sure that the entire sequence in the option leads to the target.

So, in option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → 3-bromo-5-aminophenyl acetone.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again → but this would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize amine.

vii) H3PO2 → reduce diazo group, perhaps to phenol? Or maybe it's a different reaction.

So in this case, the product after step iii is correct, but steps iv to vii would convert the nitro group to an amine and then perhaps alter it further. So the final product would not have the nitro group, making option A incorrect.

So, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the correct option's steps don't include steps that would alter the nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is none of the above. But that can't be the case. I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Let me think again. Maybe the nitration occurs before bromination.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced first, then bromination, then acylation. But wait, acylation requires an activated ring. So if the ring has nitro and bromine, it's deactivated and acylation won't happen.

So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the acylation is done before adding any substituents.

So the correct order is:

1. Acetophenone.

2. Nitrate at meta → 3-nitro.

3. Brominate at meta to acetophenone → 5-bromo.

So steps i (acylate), ii (nitrate), iii (brominate).

Looking for an option that has this sequence.

Looking at the options:

Option A's steps are i, ii, iii: acylation, bromination, nitration. Wait, nitration is step iii. So after step iii, we have nitro at position 5.

Wait, in option A, after acylation, bromination occurs (step ii), which adds Br at 3. Then nitration (step iii) adds nitro at 5. So the product is correct.

But then, steps iv to vii would do:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. Which would change the product.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. But the ring now has two nitro groups, which is not desired.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → reduces something.

So clearly, the product after step iii is correct, but the subsequent steps would alter it. So option A is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an option where the acylation is the last step, but that's not possible because the ring has to be activated for acylation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituents are added in a different order. Let me consider the possibility that the order of nitration and bromination is different.

Suppose we first nitrate, then brominate, and then acylate. But wait, acylation requires an activated ring. If the ring has nitro groups, it's deactivated, so acylation won't happen. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added after the acylation, but in a position that's influenced by the nitro group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitro group is introduced before bromination, but after acylation. Let me think.

But no, the ring must be activated for acylation. If the ring has nitro groups, it's deactivated, so acylation can't occur.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, nitration, bromination. So the steps are i, iii, ii. Looking for an option that does this.

Looking at option C: steps are i) nitrate, ii) reduce, iii) acylate. So that's not the case.

Option B: i) brominate, ii) nitrate, iii) acylate. Acylation is third, but the ring is deactivated by Br, so not possible.

Option D: steps are i) nitrate, ii) reduce, iii) diazo, iv) reduce, v) brominate, vi) acylate, vii) nitrate. That seems too convoluted and likely would not lead to the desired product.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm missing something about the additional steps. Maybe the additional steps in option A are not relevant to the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product after step iii is correct, and the subsequent steps are for purification or workup, but that doesn't make sense in the context of the question.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration. So option A has these steps. But the subsequent steps would alter the product, which suggests that option A is not correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Another approach: let's imagine the correct steps are acylation, then nitration, then bromination. But I don't see any option that does that.

Wait, looking at option B: steps are bromination, nitration, acylation. No, because acylation won't work after bromination.

Option C: nitration, reduction, acylation, bromination. Acylation comes after nitration (which is deactivating), so no.

Option D: nitration, reduction, diazotization, reduction, bromination, acylation, nitration. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitration and bromination as meta directors.

Wait, in the target, the nitro is at position 5, which is meta to the ketone at 1, and Br is at position 3, also meta to the ketone.

So the correct order would be:

1. Acetophenone.

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

3. Brominate → Br at 5.

But how? Because after nitration, the ring has nitro at 3 and ketone at 1. Bromination would then go to position 5, which is para to nitro (since nitro is at 3, para would be 6, but that's not correct). Hmm.

Wait, no. The nitro group is a meta director. So from nitro at 3, the next meta positions are 6 and 1 (but 1 is already taken by ketone). So bromine would add at position 6.

But that's not the desired position. The desired position is 5.

Hmm. So perhaps this approach won't work.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to brominate first, then nitrate.

So:

1. Acetophenone.

2. Brominate → Br at 3.

3. Nitrate → nitro at 5.

Which is the target.

So steps are i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. Which is option A's steps i, ii, iii.

But then steps iv to vii would be done, which would ruin the product.

Wait, unless the steps after iii in option A are just distractors and the product is formed at step iii. But the question's options include all seven steps, so the entire sequence must lead to the target.

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering the steps after iii in option A. Let me re-examine them.

Option A's steps:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → reduce.

Wait, after step iii, the product is the target. Then, step iv reduces nitro to amine, which would change the product.

So, the entire sequence in option A would lead to a different product. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's possible product.

Another approach: Let's think about the substituents.

The target has two substituents on the benzene ring: Br and NO2, both meta to the ketone.

So, the correct sequence must introduce both substituents in the correct positions before acylation. But wait, that's impossible because acylation requires an activated ring.

Wait, unless the substituents are introduced after acylation, via meta direction.

So, acylation first (step i), then nitration (step iii), then bromination (step ii). Wait, but that's not the case in any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option again.

Option A's steps lead to the correct product after step iii, but then the steps iv to vii would change it. So option A is incorrect.

Option B's steps would not allow acylation after bromination.

Option C's steps involve reducing nitro to amine before acylation, which may not be feasible.

Option D's steps are too complicated and likely would not yield the desired product.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, but the steps after iii are not part of the synthesis. But the question says the sequence includes all seven steps. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again about option A's steps:

i) Acetophenone.

ii) Br at 3.

iii) Nitro at 5 → target.

iv) Reduce nitro to amine → 3-bromo-5-aminophenyl acetone.

v) Nitrate again → adds another nitro group. Not desired.

vi) Diazotization → forms diazonium.

vii) H3PO2 → may reduce to phenol. Not desired.

So the final product is not the target. So option A is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option A, but the steps after iii are irrelevant or perhaps a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation → acetophenone derivative, but this may not work because AlCl3 would react with NH2.

So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, unless the acylation is done under conditions that don't involve AlCl3 reacting with the amine. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after reducing nitro to amine, the acylation occurs using a different method, but I don't think that's feasible.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not fully confident because the steps after iii would change the product.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the steps after iii in option A are for protecting groups or other purposes, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is not reduced because the conditions aren't strong enough. For example, Fe/HCl is a milder reducing agent and might not reduce nitro groups. Wait, no, Fe and HCl are typically used to reduce nitro groups to amines.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration. The only option that has these steps is option A, but the subsequent steps would change the product. So perhaps the correct option is A, but only steps i, ii, iii are relevant. Since all options include seven steps, which is confusing, perhaps the correct answer is A.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The target molecule has a ketone group attached to a benzene ring, with bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination adds Br at the meta position relative to the ketone, resulting in 3-bromoacetophenone.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at the meta position relative to the ketone, yielding 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which matches the target structure.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve reducing the nitro group to an amine, nitrating again, diazotizing, and reducing the diazonium salt. These steps would alter the product, making it inconsistent with the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: While steps i–iii produce the correct product, the inclusion of steps iv–vii invalidates this option.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination of benzene forms bromobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group at the meta position relative to bromine, forming 3-nitro-1-bromobenzene.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted, but bromine is a deactivating group, making the ring unreactive toward acylation. This step is not feasible.

**Conclusion**: Option B is incorrect because acylation cannot occur after bromination.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration of benzene forms nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine, forming aniline.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted, but the amine group reacts with AlCl₃, making this step infeasible.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination adds Br, but the sequence does not lead to the correct substituent positions.

**Conclusion**: Option C is incorrect because the amine group interferes with acylation.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration of benzene forms nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine, forming aniline.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: H₃PO₂ is used, possibly to reduce the diazonium salt, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.
5. **Steps v–vii**: Bromination, acylation, and additional nitration are performed, but the sequence is convoluted and does not yield the desired product.

**Conclusion**: Option D is incorrect due to the complexity and inefficiency of the sequence.

### Final Answer:
The correct sequence of reactions to synthesize the target molecule is acylation, bromination, and nitration. While **Option A** includes these steps (i–iii), the subsequent steps (iv–vii) would alter the product, making the sequence incomplete. However, among the given options, **Option A** is the closest to the correct synthesis pathway.

**Answer: A**
