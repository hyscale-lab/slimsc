Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a try.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. Oh right, dipole transitions specifically follow certain selection rules for the quantum numbers.

So, the initial state is n=3, l=0 (which means it's an s orbital), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. The decay goes through two steps, each being a dipole transition.

I think the selection rules for dipole transitions are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the change in n (Δn) can be any integer, but in practice, it's often ±1 or more, depending on the transition. Oh wait, wait, no, for dipole transitions, the selection rule for n is Δn = ±1, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, I'm confusing with other transitions. For hydrogen, the dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1, and there's no restriction on Δn as long as l changes by ±1. But wait, in reality, the transition must involve a change in l by ±1, and n can change accordingly as long as that happens.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are:

Δl = ±1
Δm = 0, ±1
But what about Δn? Well, for hydrogen, the energy levels are determined by n, so any transition that changes l by ±1 and doesn't violate other rules is allowed. But wait, for the transition from n=3 to n=1, that's a Δn of -2. But since it's a two-step process, each step would have Δn of -1, right? Because each dipole transition can only change n by ±1, I think. Because, in a single dipole transition, Δn can't be more than ±1. So, for the |3,0,0⟩ to get to |1,0,0⟩ in two steps, each step must change n by -1. So the first transition would take n=3 to n=2, and then n=2 to n=1.

So the first step would be from n=3, l=0 to n=2. Since l changes by ±1, the l must go from 0 to 1. So the first state after the transition would have l=1. So the first state is |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Now, each transition has certain allowed m changes. The initial state has m=0. The first transition can change m by ±1 or 0. So possible m values after first transition are -1, 0, +1.

Then, the second transition takes that state down to n=1, l=0. So again, l must change by -1 (from 1 to 0). And m in the second step must go from whatever it was to 0. Because the final state has m=0.

So let me think about possible paths.

First transition: 3,0,0 → 2,1,m1.

Second transition: 2,1,m1 → 1,0,0.

So what m1's are allowed? For the first transition, m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Then, in the second transition, the m can change by ±1 or 0. So from m1, we need to reach m=0.

Case 1: If m1 is -1, then in the second step, m can change by +1, so from -1 → 0.

Case 2: If m1 is 0, then in the second step, m can stay 0.

Case 3: If m1 is +1, then m can change by -1, leading to 0.

So all m1 possibilities for the first transition are possible in the second transition.

Now, the question is about the probabilities of each transition. The options give different transition paths and probabilities.

But wait, the question is about the probability of the entire two-step transition. So I need to compute the product of the probabilities for each step, but wait, probabilities in quantum mechanics for such processes might not just be a simple product, unless the steps are independent. But perhaps the selection rules are more about allowed transitions, and the probability depends on the allowed m changes and the possible transitions.

Wait, but the question is giving the options with specific transition paths and probabilities. So perhaps we need to calculate the transition probability for each path and see which one matches.

But wait, the options only show the two steps and the probability, so I need to find which option correctly represents the allowed transitions and the correct probability.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, with 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>, with 1/4.

Option D: → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with 2/3.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>, so m=0. The first transition can go to m= -1, 0, +1.

Looking at the options, all the options have the first step change to l=1, which is correct.

Now, which of these transitions are allowed? Let's think about the possible m transitions.

First, for the first transition: from m=0 to m1.

The dipole selection rule allows m to change by 0, ±1. So from 0, possible m1 are -1, 0, +1.

So all the options are possible for the first step.

Now, for the second transition: from m1 to 0. Again, each step must allow Δm =0, ±1.

So for example:

If the first step goes to m1=1, then the second transition can go to m=0 (Δm = -1).

Similarly, if m1 is 0, the second step can stay at 0.

If m1 is -1, the second step can go to 0 (Δm=+1).

So all options are possible in terms of m transitions.

Now, but the probabilities. The problem is about the probability of the two-step transition.

Wait, but the question is about the decay via two dipole transitions. So each step is a dipole transition. The overall probability would be the product of the transition probabilities for each step.

But wait, in reality, the selection rules don't directly give probabilities, they just say whether a transition is allowed. The probabilities are determined by the square of the matrix elements, which depends on the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator. But perhaps for each transition, the probability is proportional to some factor, and the total would be the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible paths contributes to the probability. Let me think: for each step, the possible m changes are 0, ±1. So the first transition has 3 possible m1 values. The second transition, from each m1, has 3 possible m transitions (but in this case, only certain lead to m=0 in the final state).

Wait, but in dipole transitions, the transition probabilities are given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something similar. Hmm. Alternatively, I remember that the transition probability is proportional to |<f| r |i>|^2, where r is the dipole operator. For hydrogen, the matrix elements for dipole transitions depend on the spherical harmonics involved.

Wait, but another approach: the hydrogen atom wavefunctions are characterized by their quantum numbers. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}, where Y are the spherical harmonics. So when you calculate the matrix element <n' l' m' | r |n l m>, it involves the integral of Y_{l' m'}* Y_1^m Y_{l}^{m'}, multiplied by some radial integrals.

But the selection rules for l and m are already encapsulated in this: l' must be l ± 1, and m' = m ±1, 0.

But the matrix element's magnitude depends on the specific m values. For example, transitions where m changes by +1, 0, or -1 have different contributions.

But perhaps for this problem, we can simplify. The probability for a transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or something like that.

Alternatively, I've heard that the transition probability is proportional to |d_{l m}^{l' m'}|^2, where d are the radial integrals. But perhaps for this problem, the exact probabilities are not necessary, but the relative probabilities between different paths.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0> and the final is |1,0,0>. The two-step transition goes through an intermediate state with l=1.

Each step has a certain probability. So the total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Wait, but the options give a single probability for the entire process. So each option's probability is the total for the two-step process.

I think the way to approach this is to figure out the possible intermediate states and then compute the probabilities for each path.

The possible intermediate states after the first transition are |2,1, m> where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So there are three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,+1>.

Then, from each of these, the second transition must go to |1,0,0>.

Each of these has a certain probability for the two-step process.

So, the overall probability is the sum over all possible intermediates of the product of the probabilities of each step.

But wait, maybe each step's probability is the same, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each step's transition to a particular m has a certain weight, and the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of each path.

Let me think about the allowed transitions. From |3,0,0> to |2,1, m1>, then from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

The probability for each step depends on the matrix element squared.

But perhaps for each step, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1> has a certain probability, and the transition from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0> has another.

But without knowing the exact matrix elements, maybe we can reason based on the possible transitions and their allowedness.

Alternatively, I remember that for hydrogenic atoms, the transition probability is proportional to (2l' +1), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible transitions and the number of possible m changes.

Wait, the transition from n=3, l=0, m=0 to n=2, l=1, m=0: what is the dipole matrix element for that?

I think the matrix element is non-zero because l changes by +1, but m remains the same. So that's allowed.

Similarly, transitions to m=+1 and m=-1 are allowed since Δm can be ±1.

So each of the three possible intermediates is allowed.

Now, the probability for each path would be the product of the probabilities of each individual transition.

But how do I find the relative probabilities between the three possible intermediates?

Wait, perhaps each step's probability depends on (2l +1), or something related to the angular momentum.

Alternatively, the radial part of the matrix element (which depends on n and l) would determine the probability, but perhaps for this problem, the angular parts are the main factors.

The square of the matrix element for each transition is proportional to the product of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which in turn depend on the m values.

Wait, I think that the transition probability for each step is proportional to (2l +1), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transition.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding angular momentum l and 1 (from the dipole operator) to get l' = l ±1.

Wait, for the first transition from l=0 to l'=1, m must change by ±1 or 0. So for the first step, each possible m1 is allowed, but the amplitude depends on the coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining m and m' (from the dipole operator) to get m1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element <n', l', m' | r |n, l, m> is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

Alternatively, I remember that the transition probability is highest when the angular part is most probable, which happens when m changes in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps in the first transition, the possible m changes are 0, ±1. The probability for each transition (m change) is determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

For a dipole transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m transitions are:

From m=0 to m=1 (Δm=+1),
m=0 to m=0 (Δm=0),
m=0 to m=-1 (Δm=-1).

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these transitions are:

For |1, m=1>:

The coefficient is sqrt( (1 - m)(1 + m +1) ) / sqrt(2(2l'+1))? Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Alternatively, the CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l'=1 (the dipole operator, l=1) to get l''=1.

Wait, the initial state is |l=0, m=0>, and the dipole operator has l=1, m=Δm. The final state is |l'=1, m1>.

The CG coefficient is:

< l=0, m=0 | l=1, m' = Δm | l'=1, m1= m> ?

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the matrix element involving Y_{0,0} and Y_{1, m'}, and the result is Y_{1, m}.

The integral of Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,m'} Y_{0,0} would be zero unless certain conditions are met. Wait, but more accurately, the integral is non-zero only when m = m' + 0, because Y_{0,0} is a constant, so when you multiply Y_{1,m'} and Y_{0,0}, you get Y_{1, m'}, right?

Wait, but the product Y_{1,m'} Y_{0,0} is just Y_{1, m'}, because Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)).

So when you multiply Y_{1,m'} Y_{0,0}, it's Y_{1,m'}.

Then, the integral of Y_{l', m}^* times that product (i.e., Y_{1,m'}^*) would be zero unless m = m'.

Because the integral of Y_{l', m}^* Y_{1, m'} is zero unless l'=1, m = m'.

Wait, but in this case, the initial state has l=0, so the transition is from l=0 to l'=1. The dipole operator has l=1, m=Δm.

The matrix element <1, m1 | r | 0, 0> is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* (Y_{1, m_d} Y_{0,0}) ), which is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* Y_{1, m_d}.

Which is zero unless m1 = m_d, because the integral of Y_{a}^* Y_{b} is zero unless a = b.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the dipole operator carries m=Δm, so the matrix element would be non-zero only when m1 = Δm.

So for the initial state |3,0,0⟩, which has m=0, the dipole transition can only go to states where m1 = m_dipole.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1,m}, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So when you have the matrix element <n', l', m' | r |n, l, m>, it's non-zero only if:

l' = l ± 1,

and m' = m + m_d, where m_d is -1, 0, +1.

So for our initial state, |3,0,0>, when it transitions via dipole, the final state must have l' = 1, and m' = 0 + m_d.

So the first transition could go to |2,1, m_d= -1, 0, +1>.

So the possible m1 values are -1, 0, +1.

But the probability for each of these m1 depends on the square of the matrix element for that transition.

The matrix element for each m1 would be proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* Y_{1,m_d} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, but Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π), so it's a constant. So the integral becomes the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* Y_{1,m_d}.

Which is the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* Y_{1,m_d} = δ_{m1, m_d} times something, because the integral of Y^*_a Y_b is zero unless a = b.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when m1 = m_d.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply that the transition can only have m1 equal to m_d, which is -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but that would mean that all three transitions are possible, but each with a different m1.

Hmm. So for each m_d, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m_d> is possible.

Now, the probability for each transition path is the product of the probabilities of each step.

But how do I find the individual probabilities?

Each of the three possible m1 values (-1, 0, +1) has its own transition probability. The sum of all three probabilities would be the total probability for the first step.

Wait, but the question is about the two-step transition, so each path's probability is the product of the first and second step.

Let me denote P1(m1) as the probability of transitioning from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1>, and P2(m1) as the probability of transitioning from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

The total probability for the two-step process via m1 is P1(m1) * P2(m1).

So the total probability is Sum over m1 of [ P1(m1) * P2(m1) ].

But I need to find which of the options has the correct sum.

But perhaps the probabilities P1(m1) and P2(m1) are the same for each m1, making the total probability proportional to the number of paths. But that's probably not the case because different m transitions have different probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps each transition has the same probability, so each path contributes the same amount, leading to a total probability of 3 * (1/3)^2) = 1/3, but that doesn't fit any option exactly.

Wait, the options have probabilities 1/3, 1/4, 2/3. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the selection rules and the possible states. The initial state is |3,0,0>, and the first transition can go to any of the three possible m1 states: -1, 0, +1. Then each of those can transition to |1,0,0> if the second transition's m change is allowed.

Wait, but for the second transition, from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>, the m change must be such that m_final = 0 = m1 + Δm, where Δm is 0, ±1.

So for each m1, the possible Δm is:

If m1 = -1, Δm can be +1 → 0.

If m1 = 0, Δm can be 0 → 0.

If m1 = +1, Δm can be -1 → 0.

So all three m1 states can transition to the final state.

Now, the probability for each path would be the product of the probabilities of each step.

Assuming that the probability for each transition is the same for all m1, which I don't think is the case, but let's see.

If each of the three paths (m1 = -1, 0, +1) has the same probability, then each path's total probability would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, leading to a total of 3 * (1/9) = 1/3. So the total probability would be 1/3. That's option A's probability.

But wait, I don't think the transition probabilities for each m1 are the same. Because the transition probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which vary with m.

Ah, right! The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for different m values are different. For example, the coefficient for m=0 is larger than for m=±1.

I think the matrix element for m=0 is sqrt( (2l +1)(2l' +1) ) * [something], but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, for the transition from l=0 to l=1, the CG coefficients for m=0, ±1 are different.

Wait, I think the CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1 are as follows:

For m=1: the coefficient is 1/sqrt(2) when combining l=0 (m=0) with l=1 (m=+1), because <1,1|0,0;1,1> = sqrt( (0+1)(1+1) ) / sqrt(2(2+1)) )? Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient is sqrt( (2l +1) ) when m is the same.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients for the case of adding two angular momenta j1=1 (dipole) and j2=0 (s orbital) to get j=1. The possible m values are m = m1 + m2. Since j2=0, m2=0. So m = m1.

But the CG coefficients for this case are:

< j', m | j1, m1; j2, m2 > = <1, m |1, m; 0, 0>.

Which is 1 for each m from -1 to +1, because when you add zero, m remains the same.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the CG coefficients involve normalization factors. Let me think again. The general CG coefficient is given by:

< j', m | j1, m1; j2, m2 > = δ_{m, m1 + m2} * sqrt( (2j' +1) (j1 + j2 +1 - j' ) (j1 + j2 +1 + j') ) / ( (j1 + j2 +1) ) )

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe for j2=0, the CG coefficient is simply sqrt( (2j' +1) ) when m1 = m.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible m transitions and their probabilities.

In the first step, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1> can have m1= -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m1 is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that m1.

I found a source that says the CG coefficients for j1=1, j2=0, j'=1 are:

<1, m |1, m;0,0> = sqrt( (1 + 1) / (2*(1) +1) ) )? Not sure.

Alternatively, since j2=0, the state is just |j1, m>. So the CG coefficient in this case is sqrt( (2j' +1) ) when m = m1.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think differently.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding j1=1 and j2=0 is given by:

<j', m | j1, m1; j2, m2> = δ_{m, m1 + m2} * sqrt( (2j' +1) (j1 + j2 +1 - j') (j1 + j2 +1 + j') ) ) / ( j1 + j2 +1 )

But since j2=0, m2=0. So m = m1.

And j' can be j1 ± j2 = 1 ± 0 = 1.

So the CG coefficient becomes sqrt( (2*1 +1) (1 +0 +1 -1) (1 +0 +1 +1) ) / (1 +0 +1) )

Wait, simplifying:

(2j' +1) = 3,

( j1 + j2 +1 - j' ) = (1 +0 +1 -1 )=1,

( j1 + j2 +1 + j' )= (1 +0 +1 +1 )=3,

Denominator: (1+0+1 )=2.

So the square root factor becomes sqrt(3 * 1 * 3 )= sqrt(9)=3.

So the CG coefficient is 3 / 2.

Wait, but this can't be correct because CG coefficients are supposed to be less than or equal to 1.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

<j', m | j1, m1; j2, m2> = sqrt( (j1 + j2 +1) (j1 + j2 +1 - 2j') ) ) / ( j1 + j2 +1 ) ) * something else.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the wrong formula. Let me look for a different approach.

Another approach: since j2=0, the state |j1, m1> is just |j', m> where m = m1 and j' = j1 =1. So the CG coefficient in this case is 1. Because when you add angular momentum 0, the state remains the same.

Wait, that must be the case. So the CG coefficient <1, m |1, m; 0,0> is 1.

So the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1> has a matrix element proportional to 1 for each m1.

But that would mean that each transition has the same probability, which is 1/3 for each m1, since there are three possible m1.

So the first step has three equally probable paths, each with probability 1/3.

Now, moving to the second step: from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

Again, the dipole transition has to change l by -1, so from 1 to 0, and m from m1 to 0.

The matrix element is again proportional to the CG coefficient for this transition.

So for each m1, the transition to m=0 is allowed if |Δm|=0,1.

So for m1=0 → m=0: allowed.

m1=1 → m= -1: allowed.

m1=-1 → m=+1: allowed.

Wait, no, for the second step, the dipole operator can have m_dipole = -1, 0, +1. So the transition from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0> must have m1 + m_dipole = 0.

So m_dipole = -m1.

So m_dipole can be 0, ±1, so:

- If m1=0, m_dipole can be 0 → allowed.

- If m1=1, m_dipole must be -1 → allowed.

- If m1=-1, m_dipole must be +1 → allowed.

So each of these transitions is allowed.

Now, the probability for each path would be the product of the first and second step probabilities.

Assuming that each step's transition probability is 1/3, the total for each path would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

Since there are three paths, the total probability is 3 * (1/9) )= 1/3.

But wait, that would imply that the total probability is 1/3, as in option A.

But option A's path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/3.

But wait, if all three paths contribute 1/9 each, the total is 3*(1/9)=1/3. So the correct answer would have a total probability of 1/3.

But let me think again: is each step's probability the same?

In the first step, each m1 transition has the same probability because the CG coefficients are the same. So each has probability 1/3.

In the second step, each transition's probability depends on the CG coefficient from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

Again, the CG coefficient for the second step is:

<j', m' | j1, m1; j2, m2>.

Here, j' =0 (since l=0), j1=1, j2=1 (the dipole operator's l=1).

Wait, no, the dipole operator has l=1, so j2=1.

Wait, the second transition is from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

So the matrix element involves the dipole operator with l=1, and the transition from l=1 to l=0.

So the CG coefficients for this transition would be:

<0,0 | 1, m1; 1, m_dipole>

Which is non-zero only if m1 + m_dipole = 0.

So m_dipole = -m1.

So the CG coefficients for this would be:

sqrt( (2l' +1) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps when adding two angular momenta with l1=1 and l2=1 to get l'=0.

The CG coefficient <0, 0 |1, m1;1, m_dipole> is non-zero only if m1 + m_dipole =0.

In such cases, the CG coefficient is:

sqrt( [ (1 +1 +1 -0 ) (1 +1 +1 +0) ] / (2(1+1+1)) )) ?

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look up the CG coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get l=0.

I recall that the CG coefficients for combining two l=1 states into l=0 are zero except when m1 = -m2.

Wait, when l1=1, l2=1, and l'=0.

The CG coefficients are:

<0,0 |1,1;1,-1> = 1/sqrt(2),

<0,0 |1,0;1,0> = 1/sqrt(6),

<0,0 |1,-1;1,1> = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, that's from the formula.

So for our case:

When m1=1 and m_dipole=-1, the CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2).

When m1=0 and m_dipole=0, CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(6).

When m1=-1 and m_dipole=+1, CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2).

So the squares are (1/2), (1/6), and (1/2), respectively.

So the probabilities for the second step are:

For m1=1 → 1/2,

m1=0 → 1/6,

m1=-1 → 1/2.

Wait, no, because the probability is the square of the CG coefficient.

So, the transition probabilities from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0> are:

P(m1=1 → 0) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2,

P(m1=0 → 0) = (1/sqrt(6))^2 = 1/6,

P(m1=-1 → 0) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So now, the total probability for each path is:

P1(m1) * P2(m1).

Since P1(m1) is 1/3 for each m1, because there are three equally likely first steps.

So:

For m1=1: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

For m1=0: (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18.

For m1=-1: (1/3) * (1/2) =1/6.

Adding them up: 1/6 +1/18 +1/6 = (3/18 + 1/18 +3/18)=7/18 ≈ 0.388.

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step's probabilities are not all equal.

Wait, perhaps the first transition's probabilities are not all 1/3. Because the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which has l=0, m=0. The dipole operator can have m= -1, 0, +1, leading to transitions to |2,1,m1⟩ where m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m1 is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that transition.

In the first step, the transition from |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0) to |2,1,m1> is governed by the CG coefficient <1, m1 |0,0;1, m_dipole>.

Wait, no, the dipole operator has l=1, and the matrix element is proportional to <2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0>.

Which is non-zero only if m1 = m_dipole, where m_dipole is the m of the dipole operator (so -1, 0, +1).

So the CG coefficient for the first step is <1, m1 | 1, m_dipole; 0, 0>.

Which is 1 when m1 = m_dipole, because the 0 state doesn't contribute to m.

Wait, as discussed earlier, the CG coefficient for adding l=1 (dipole) and l=0 (initial state) to get l'=1 is 1 for each m1 = m_dipole.

So the matrix element squared is proportional to (1)^2 =1.

But since there are three possible m_dipole values (-1,0,+1), each contributing equally, the probability for each m1 is 1/3.

So for the first step, each m1 has a 1/3 chance.

Wait, but that would mean that the probabilities for the first step are 1/3 each for m1= -1, 0, +1.

Then, the second step's probabilities, as calculated earlier, are 1/2, 1/6, 1/2.

So the total probability is sum ( (1/3) * P2(m1) ), which is:

(1/3)(1/2) + (1/3)(1/6) + (1/3)(1/2) = (1/6 + 1/18 + 1/6) = (3/18 + 1/18 +3/18) =7/18 ≈0.388.

But none of the options have 7/18. The options are 1/3, 1/4, 2/3.

This suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect, or perhaps the problem is assuming that the two-step process is only allowed through one specific path.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says the path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/3.

If that's the case, perhaps the transition goes through m1=0.

But why would that be the case?

Because perhaps the transition through m1=0 has a higher probability than others.

Wait, earlier I thought that each m1 has equal probability 1/3 for the first step, but maybe that's not true. Because the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator's matrix element for m=0 is larger than for m=±1.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for m=0 is larger. So the transition to m1=0 has a higher probability.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The transition probability isn't necessarily the same for each m1. Because the matrix element for m=0 is larger than for m=±1.

In dipole transitions, the transition probability is higher for Δm=0 than for Δm=±1.

Wait, I think that for the transition from l=0 to l=1, the probability for m=0 is higher. Because the matrix element involves Y_{0,0} times Y_{1, m}.

The integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{0,0} Y_{1,m'}^* is non-zero only if m' = m +0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element is largest when m=0.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which in this case for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, the CG coefficients are:

<1, m |0,0;1, m> = sqrt( (2l +1) ) / sqrt(2(2l+1)) )?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 are:

<1, m |0,0;1, m> = sqrt( (2l'+1) ) / sqrt( 2l'+1 + 2l'+1 ), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I think the CG coefficients for this case are 1/sqrt(2) for m=±1 and 1/sqrt(6) for m=0.

Wait, another approach: the sum of the squares of the CG coefficients must be 1.

If the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) for m=±1 and 1/sqrt(6) for m=0, then:

(1/2) + (1/2) + (1/6) = (3/6 + 3/6 +1/6 )=7/6, which is more than 1. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are sqrt( (2l'+1) ) / something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should refer to the selection rules and the typical allowed transitions.

In hydrogen, the transition probabilities for different Δm values are not the same. The transition with Δm=0 is more probable than those with Δm=±1.

So, in the first step, the transition to m1=0 has a higher probability than m1=±1.

So, the first step's probabilities are not equal.

If that's the case, the probabilities may not be 1/3 each.

So, perhaps the first step's probabilities are:

P(m1=0) = something higher, and P(m1=±1) = lower.

So, let's model the first step's probabilities as P(m1=0) = a, and P(m1=±1) = b each. With a + 2b =1.

Assuming that a is higher than b.

In reality, the transition probabilities for m=0 are higher, so a > b.

Now, for the second step, the probabilities for each m1 are as before: P2(0)=1/6, P2(1)=1/2, P2(-1)=1/2.

So the total probability would be:

a*(1/6) + b*(1/2) + b*(1/2) = a*(1/6) + b*(1).

But we also have a + 2b =1.

But without knowing the exact values of a and b, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the only allowed transition is Δm=0, meaning m1=0.

But that can't be because the dipole selection rules allow Δm=0,±1.

Wait, maybe the transition can only occur when Δm=0, which would mean the first step goes to |2,1,0>, and the second step also goes to |1,0,0>, leading to a single path with probability 1/3, as in option A.

But why would that be the case? Because the problem states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions, implying that both steps are dipole transitions.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the correct answer is option A, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, looking at the options, the probabilities are 1/3, 1/4, and 2/3.

If the only allowed path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, then the probability would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, but that's not an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step has a probability of 1/3 for m1=0, and the second step has a probability of 1/3 again, leading to a total of (1/3)^2 = 1/9, which isn't in the options.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the overall probability as the sum of the probabilities of each allowed path. So if the first step to m1=0 has a higher probability, and the second step from m1=0 has a probability of 1/6, then the total probability via that path is (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18.

But that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the transition can only occur via m1=0, making the total probability (1/3)^2 = 1/9, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps it's best to consult what the standard approach to this problem is.

Wait, the standard approach for two-photon transitions (or two-step dipole transitions) in hydrogen: from n=3 to n=1 via an intermediate state.

The allowed intermediate states have l=1, and the m must change in a way that allows two Δm steps to reach 0.

But another point: the transition from n=3 → n=2 and then n=2 → n=1. Each transition must have l changing by ±1.

So the first transition is 3s (l=0) → 2p (l=1). The second is 2p → 1s (l=0).

The possible m transitions are as discussed.

But perhaps the probability is determined by the number of possible dipole transitions that can occur. For example, the transition from 3s to 2p can go to m= -1, 0, +1. Each has a certain probability, and the total is the sum of the probabilities for each path.

Wait, perhaps the simplest solution is to recall that in hydrogen, the probability of a transition is higher when the angular momentum change is such that m doesn't change. So the transition via m=0 in both steps would be the dominant path.

If that's the case, the path in option A would have the highest probability.

But looking at the options, option A's probability is 1/3, which could make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each step has a 1/2 probability, leading to a product of 1/4, but that's option B and C.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I don't remember the exact probabilities.

Another approach: the possible number of ways to change m from 0 to 0 in two steps.

Each step can change m by 0, ±1.

So two steps can change m by 0, ±1, ±2.

But since the final m is 0, the initial m is 0, so the sum of the two Δm's must be 0.

Possible combinations:

(0,0), (1,-1), (-1,1).

So three possible paths.

Each with their own probabilities.

Assuming each step has a transition probability of 1/3 for each possible Δm.

Then, the probability for each path would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

Since there are three paths, the total probability is 3*(1/9) )= 1/3, which matches option A's probability.

So the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1, and Δn can be any integer as long as l changes appropriately. The decay proceeds through an intermediate state with l=1, and the possible m values for the intermediate state are -1, 0, +1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m₁⟩):**
   - The initial state has m=0, and the dipole operator allows transitions to m₁ = -1, 0, +1.
   - The probabilities for these transitions are not necessarily equal. The transition to m₁=0 is generally more probable due to the symmetry of the spherical harmonics and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

2. **Second Transition (|2,1,m₁⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):**
   - The intermediate state |2,1,m₁⟩ must transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩, which has m=0.
   - The allowed m₁ values for the intermediate state are -1, 0, +1, and the transition probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:
     - For m₁=1, the probability is proportional to \( \frac{1}{2} \).
     - For m₁=0, the probability is proportional to \( \frac{1}{6} \).
     - For m₁=-1, the probability is proportional to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Total Probability:**
   - The total probability is the sum of the probabilities for all possible paths:
     \[
     P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{first step}}(m₁) \cdot P_{\text{second step}}(m₁).
     \]
   - Assuming equal probabilities for the first step (\( P_{\text{first step}}(m₁) = \frac{1}{3} \) for each m₁), the total probability becomes:
     \[
     P_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{7}{18}.
     \]
   - However, this result does not match any of the given options. The problem likely assumes that the dominant path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, which has a total probability of \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Conclusion:
The most plausible answer is that the decay proceeds through the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a total probability of \( \frac{1}{3} \), as this path is consistent with the selection rules and the dominant transition probabilities.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a try.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. Oh right, dipole transitions specifically follow certain selection rules for the quantum numbers.

So, the initial state is n=3, l=0 (which means it's an s orbital), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. The decay goes through two steps, each being a dipole transition.

I think the selection rules for dipole transitions are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the change in n (Δn) can be any integer, but in practice, it's often ±1 or more, depending on the transition. Oh wait, wait, no, for dipole transitions, the selection rule for n is Δn = ±1, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, I'm confusing with other transitions. For hydrogen, the dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1, and there's no restriction on Δn as long as l changes by ±1. But wait, in reality, the transition must involve a change in l by ±1, and n can change accordingly as long as that happens.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are:

Δl = ±1
Δm = 0, ±1
But what about Δn? Well, for hydrogen, the energy levels are determined by n, so any transition that changes l by ±1 and doesn't violate other rules is allowed. But wait, for the transition from n=3 to n=1, that's a Δn of -2. But since it's a two-step process, each step would have Δn of -1, right? Because each dipole transition can only change n by ±1, I think. Because, in a single dipole transition, Δn can't be more than ±1. So, for the |3,0,0⟩ to get to |1,0,0⟩ in two steps, each step must change n by -1. So the first transition would take n=3 to n=2, and then n=2 to n=1.

So the first step would be from n=3, l=0 to n=2. Since l changes by ±1, the l must go from 0 to 1. So the first state after the transition would have l=1. So the first state is |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Now, each transition has certain allowed m changes. The initial state has m=0. The first transition can change m by ±1 or 0. So possible m values after first transition are -1, 0, +1.

Then, the second transition takes that state down to n=1, l=0. So again, l must change by -1 (from 1 to 0). And m in the second step must go from whatever it was to 0. Because the final state has m=0.

So let me think about possible paths.

First transition: 3,0,0 → 2,1,m1.

Second transition: 2,1,m1 → 1,0,0.

So what m1's are allowed? For the first transition, m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Then, in the second transition, the m can change by ±1 or 0. So from m1, we need to reach m=0.

Case 1: If m1 is -1, then in the second step, m can change by +1, so from -1 → 0.

Case 2: If m1 is 0, then in the second step, m can stay 0.

Case 3: If m1 is +1, then m can change by -1, leading to 0.

So all m1 possibilities for the first transition are possible in the second transition.

Now, the question is about the probabilities of each transition. The options give different transition paths and probabilities.

But wait, the question is about the probability of the entire two-step transition. So I need to compute the product of the probabilities for each step, but wait, probabilities in quantum mechanics for such processes might not just be a simple product, unless the steps are independent. But perhaps the selection rules are more about allowed transitions, and the probability depends on the allowed m changes and the possible transitions.

Wait, but the question is giving the options with specific transition paths and probabilities. So perhaps we need to calculate the transition probability for each path and see which one matches.

But wait, the options only show the two steps and the probability, so I need to find which option correctly represents the allowed transitions and the correct probability.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, with 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>, with 1/4.

Option D: → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with 2/3.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>, so m=0. The first transition can go to m= -1, 0, +1.

Looking at the options, all the options have the first step change to l=1, which is correct.

Now, which of these transitions are allowed? Let's think about the possible m transitions.

First, for the first transition: from m=0 to m1.

The dipole selection rule allows m to change by 0, ±1. So from 0, possible m1 are -1, 0, +1.

So all the options are possible for the first step.

Now, for the second transition: from m1 to 0. Again, each step must allow Δm =0, ±1.

So for example:

If the first step goes to m1=1, then the second transition can go to m=0 (Δm = -1).

Similarly, if m1 is 0, the second step can stay at 0.

If m1 is -1, the second step can go to 0 (Δm=+1).

So all options are possible in terms of m transitions.

Now, but the probabilities. The problem is about the probability of the two-step transition.

Wait, but the question is about the decay via two dipole transitions. So each step is a dipole transition. The overall probability would be the product of the transition probabilities for each step.

But wait, in reality, the selection rules don't directly give probabilities, they just say whether a transition is allowed. The probabilities are determined by the square of the matrix elements, which depends on the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator. But perhaps for each transition, the probability is proportional to some factor, and the total would be the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible paths contributes to the probability. Let me think: for each step, the possible m changes are 0, ±1. So the first transition has 3 possible m1 values. The second transition, from each m1, has 3 possible m transitions (but in this case, only certain lead to m=0 in the final state).

Wait, but in dipole transitions, the transition probabilities are given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something similar. Hmm. Alternatively, I remember that the transition probability is proportional to |<f| r |i>|^2, where r is the dipole operator. For hydrogen, the matrix elements for dipole transitions depend on the spherical harmonics involved.

Wait, but another approach: the hydrogen atom wavefunctions are characterized by their quantum numbers. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}, where Y are the spherical harmonics. So when you calculate the matrix element <n' l' m' | r |n l m>, it involves the integral of Y_{l' m'}* Y_1^m Y_{l}^{m'}, multiplied by some radial integrals.

But the selection rules for l and m are already encapsulated in this: l' must be l ± 1, and m' = m ±1, 0.

But the matrix element's magnitude depends on the specific m values. For example, transitions where m changes by +1, 0, or -1 have different contributions.

But perhaps for this problem, we can simplify. The probability for a transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or something like that.

Alternatively, I've heard that the transition probability is proportional to |d_{l m}^{l' m'}|^2, where d are the radial integrals. But perhaps for this problem, the exact probabilities are not necessary, but the relative probabilities between different paths.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0> and the final is |1,0,0>. The two-step transition goes through an intermediate state with l=1.

Each step has a certain probability. So the total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Wait, but the options give a single probability for the entire process. So each option's probability is the total for the two-step process.

I think the way to approach this is to figure out the possible intermediate states and then compute the probabilities for each path.

The possible intermediate states after the first transition are |2,1, m> where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So there are three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,+1>.

Then, from each of these, the second transition must go to |1,0,0>.

Each of these has a certain probability for the two-step process.

So, the overall probability is the sum over all possible intermediates of the product of the probabilities of each step.

But wait, maybe each step's probability is the same, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each step's transition to a particular m has a certain weight, and the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of each path.

Let me think about the allowed transitions. From |3,0,0> to |2,1, m1>, then from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

The probability for each step depends on the matrix element squared.

But perhaps for each step, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1> has a certain probability, and the transition from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0> has another.

But without knowing the exact matrix elements, maybe we can reason based on the possible transitions and their allowedness.

Alternatively, I remember that for hydrogenic atoms, the transition probability is proportional to (2l' +1), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible transitions and the number of possible m changes.

Wait, the transition from n=3, l=0, m=0 to n=2, l=1, m=0: what is the dipole matrix element for that?

I think the matrix element is non-zero because l changes by +1, but m remains the same. So that's allowed.

Similarly, transitions to m=+1 and m=-1 are allowed since Δm can be ±1.

So each of the three possible intermediates is allowed.

Now, the probability for each path would be the product of the probabilities of each individual transition.

But how do I find the relative probabilities between the three possible intermediates?

Wait, perhaps each step's probability depends on (2l +1), or something related to the angular momentum.

Alternatively, the radial part of the matrix element (which depends on n and l) would determine the probability, but perhaps for this problem, the angular parts are the main factors.

The square of the matrix element for each transition is proportional to the product of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which in turn depend on the m values.

Wait, I think that the transition probability for each step is proportional to (2l +1), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transition.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding angular momentum l and 1 (from the dipole operator) to get l' = l ±1.

Wait, for the first transition from l=0 to l'=1, m must change by ±1 or 0. So for the first step, each possible m1 is allowed, but the amplitude depends on the coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining m and m' (from the dipole operator) to get m1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element <n', l', m' | r |n, l, m> is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

Alternatively, I remember that the transition probability is highest when the angular part is most probable, which happens when m changes in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps in the first transition, the possible m changes are 0, ±1. The probability for each transition (m change) is determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

For a dipole transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m transitions are:

From m=0 to m=1 (Δm=+1),
m=0 to m=0 (Δm=0),
m=0 to m=-1 (Δm=-1).

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these transitions are:

For |1, m=1>:

The coefficient is sqrt( (1 - m)(1 + m +1) ) / sqrt(2(2l'+1))? Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Alternatively, the CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l'=1 (the dipole operator, l=1) to get l''=1.

Wait, the initial state is |l=0, m=0>, and the dipole operator has l=1, m=Δm. The final state is |l'=1, m1>.

The CG coefficient is:

< l=0, m=0 | l=1, m' = Δm | l'=1, m1= m> ?

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the matrix element involving Y_{0,0} and Y_{1, m'}, and the result is Y_{1, m}.

The integral of Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,m'} Y_{0,0} would be zero unless certain conditions are met. Wait, but more accurately, the integral is non-zero only when m = m' + 0, because Y_{0,0} is a constant, so when you multiply Y_{1,m'} and Y_{0,0}, you get Y_{1, m'}, right?

Wait, but the product Y_{1,m'} Y_{0,0} is just Y_{1, m'}, because Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)).

So when you multiply Y_{1,m'} Y_{0,0}, it's Y_{1,m'}.

Then, the integral of Y_{l', m}^* times that product (i.e., Y_{1,m'}^*) would be zero unless m = m'.

Because the integral of Y_{l', m}^* Y_{1, m'} is zero unless l'=1, m = m'.

Wait, but in this case, the initial state has l=0, so the transition is from l=0 to l'=1. The dipole operator has l=1, m=Δm.

The matrix element <1, m1 | r | 0, 0> is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* (Y_{1, m_d} Y_{0,0}) ), which is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* Y_{1, m_d}.

Which is zero unless m1 = m_d, because the integral of Y_{a}^* Y_{b} is zero unless a = b.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the dipole operator carries m=Δm, so the matrix element would be non-zero only when m1 = Δm.

So for the initial state |3,0,0⟩, which has m=0, the dipole transition can only go to states where m1 = m_dipole.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1,m}, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So when you have the matrix element <n', l', m' | r |n, l, m>, it's non-zero only if:

l' = l ± 1,

and m' = m + m_d, where m_d is -1, 0, +1.

So for our initial state, |3,0,0>, when it transitions via dipole, the final state must have l' = 1, and m' = 0 + m_d.

So the first transition could go to |2,1, m_d= -1, 0, +1>.

So the possible m1 values are -1, 0, +1.

But the probability for each of these m1 depends on the square of the matrix element for that transition.

The matrix element for each m1 would be proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* Y_{1,m_d} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, but Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π), so it's a constant. So the integral becomes the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* Y_{1,m_d}.

Which is the integral of Y_{1,m1}^* Y_{1,m_d} = δ_{m1, m_d} times something, because the integral of Y^*_a Y_b is zero unless a = b.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when m1 = m_d.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply that the transition can only have m1 equal to m_d, which is -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but that would mean that all three transitions are possible, but each with a different m1.

Hmm. So for each m_d, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m_d> is possible.

Now, the probability for each transition path is the product of the probabilities of each step.

But how do I find the individual probabilities?

Each of the three possible m1 values (-1, 0, +1) has its own transition probability. The sum of all three probabilities would be the total probability for the first step.

Wait, but the question is about the two-step transition, so each path's probability is the product of the first and second step.

Let me denote P1(m1) as the probability of transitioning from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1>, and P2(m1) as the probability of transitioning from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

The total probability for the two-step process via m1 is P1(m1) * P2(m1).

So the total probability is Sum over m1 of [ P1(m1) * P2(m1) ].

But I need to find which of the options has the correct sum.

But perhaps the probabilities P1(m1) and P2(m1) are the same for each m1, making the total probability proportional to the number of paths. But that's probably not the case because different m transitions have different probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps each transition has the same probability, so each path contributes the same amount, leading to a total probability of 3 * (1/3)^2) = 1/3, but that doesn't fit any option exactly.

Wait, the options have probabilities 1/3, 1/4, 2/3. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the selection rules and the possible states. The initial state is |3,0,0>, and the first transition can go to any of the three possible m1 states: -1, 0, +1. Then each of those can transition to |1,0,0> if the second transition's m change is allowed.

Wait, but for the second transition, from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>, the m change must be such that m_final = 0 = m1 + Δm, where Δm is 0, ±1.

So for each m1, the possible Δm is:

If m1 = -1, Δm can be +1 → 0.

If m1 = 0, Δm can be 0 → 0.

If m1 = +1, Δm can be -1 → 0.

So all three m1 states can transition to the final state.

Now, the probability for each path would be the product of the probabilities of each step.

Assuming that the probability for each transition is the same for all m1, which I don't think is the case, but let's see.

If each of the three paths (m1 = -1, 0, +1) has the same probability, then each path's total probability would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, leading to a total of 3 * (1/9) = 1/3. So the total probability would be 1/3. That's option A's probability.

But wait, I don't think the transition probabilities for each m1 are the same. Because the transition probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which vary with m.

Ah, right! The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for different m values are different. For example, the coefficient for m=0 is larger than for m=±1.

I think the matrix element for m=0 is sqrt( (2l +1)(2l' +1) ) * [something], but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, for the transition from l=0 to l=1, the CG coefficients for m=0, ±1 are different.

Wait, I think the CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1 are as follows:

For m=1: the coefficient is 1/sqrt(2) when combining l=0 (m=0) with l=1 (m=+1), because <1,1|0,0;1,1> = sqrt( (0+1)(1+1) ) / sqrt(2(2+1)) )? Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient is sqrt( (2l +1) ) when m is the same.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients for the case of adding two angular momenta j1=1 (dipole) and j2=0 (s orbital) to get j=1. The possible m values are m = m1 + m2. Since j2=0, m2=0. So m = m1.

But the CG coefficients for this case are:

< j', m | j1, m1; j2, m2 > = <1, m |1, m; 0, 0>.

Which is 1 for each m from -1 to +1, because when you add zero, m remains the same.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the CG coefficients involve normalization factors. Let me think again. The general CG coefficient is given by:

< j', m | j1, m1; j2, m2 > = δ_{m, m1 + m2} * sqrt( (2j' +1) (j1 + j2 +1 - j' ) (j1 + j2 +1 + j') ) / ( (j1 + j2 +1) ) )

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe for j2=0, the CG coefficient is simply sqrt( (2j' +1) ) when m1 = m.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible m transitions and their probabilities.

In the first step, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1> can have m1= -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m1 is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that m1.

I found a source that says the CG coefficients for j1=1, j2=0, j'=1 are:

<1, m |1, m;0,0> = sqrt( (1 + 1) / (2*(1) +1) ) )? Not sure.

Alternatively, since j2=0, the state is just |j1, m>. So the CG coefficient in this case is sqrt( (2j' +1) ) when m = m1.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think differently.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding j1=1 and j2=0 is given by:

<j', m | j1, m1; j2, m2> = δ_{m, m1 + m2} * sqrt( (2j' +1) (j1 + j2 +1 - j') (j1 + j2 +1 + j') ) ) / ( j1 + j2 +1 )

But since j2=0, m2=0. So m = m1.

And j' can be j1 ± j2 = 1 ± 0 = 1.

So the CG coefficient becomes sqrt( (2*1 +1) (1 +0 +1 -1) (1 +0 +1 +1) ) / (1 +0 +1) )

Wait, simplifying:

(2j' +1) = 3,

( j1 + j2 +1 - j' ) = (1 +0 +1 -1 )=1,

( j1 + j2 +1 + j' )= (1 +0 +1 +1 )=3,

Denominator: (1+0+1 )=2.

So the square root factor becomes sqrt(3 * 1 * 3 )= sqrt(9)=3.

So the CG coefficient is 3 / 2.

Wait, but this can't be correct because CG coefficients are supposed to be less than or equal to 1.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

<j', m | j1, m1; j2, m2> = sqrt( (j1 + j2 +1) (j1 + j2 +1 - 2j') ) ) / ( j1 + j2 +1 ) ) * something else.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the wrong formula. Let me look for a different approach.

Another approach: since j2=0, the state |j1, m1> is just |j', m> where m = m1 and j' = j1 =1. So the CG coefficient in this case is 1. Because when you add angular momentum 0, the state remains the same.

Wait, that must be the case. So the CG coefficient <1, m |1, m; 0,0> is 1.

So the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1> has a matrix element proportional to 1 for each m1.

But that would mean that each transition has the same probability, which is 1/3 for each m1, since there are three possible m1.

So the first step has three equally probable paths, each with probability 1/3.

Now, moving to the second step: from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

Again, the dipole transition has to change l by -1, so from 1 to 0, and m from m1 to 0.

The matrix element is again proportional to the CG coefficient for this transition.

So for each m1, the transition to m=0 is allowed if |Δm|=0,1.

So for m1=0 → m=0: allowed.

m1=1 → m= -1: allowed.

m1=-1 → m=+1: allowed.

Wait, no, for the second step, the dipole operator can have m_dipole = -1, 0, +1. So the transition from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0> must have m1 + m_dipole = 0.

So m_dipole = -m1.

So m_dipole can be 0, ±1, so:

- If m1=0, m_dipole can be 0 → allowed.

- If m1=1, m_dipole must be -1 → allowed.

- If m1=-1, m_dipole must be +1 → allowed.

So each of these transitions is allowed.

Now, the probability for each path would be the product of the first and second step probabilities.

Assuming that each step's transition probability is 1/3, the total for each path would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

Since there are three paths, the total probability is 3 * (1/9) )= 1/3.

But wait, that would imply that the total probability is 1/3, as in option A.

But option A's path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/3.

But wait, if all three paths contribute 1/9 each, the total is 3*(1/9)=1/3. So the correct answer would have a total probability of 1/3.

But let me think again: is each step's probability the same?

In the first step, each m1 transition has the same probability because the CG coefficients are the same. So each has probability 1/3.

In the second step, each transition's probability depends on the CG coefficient from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

Again, the CG coefficient for the second step is:

<j', m' | j1, m1; j2, m2>.

Here, j' =0 (since l=0), j1=1, j2=1 (the dipole operator's l=1).

Wait, no, the dipole operator has l=1, so j2=1.

Wait, the second transition is from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

So the matrix element involves the dipole operator with l=1, and the transition from l=1 to l=0.

So the CG coefficients for this transition would be:

<0,0 | 1, m1; 1, m_dipole>

Which is non-zero only if m1 + m_dipole = 0.

So m_dipole = -m1.

So the CG coefficients for this would be:

sqrt( (2l' +1) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps when adding two angular momenta with l1=1 and l2=1 to get l'=0.

The CG coefficient <0, 0 |1, m1;1, m_dipole> is non-zero only if m1 + m_dipole =0.

In such cases, the CG coefficient is:

sqrt( [ (1 +1 +1 -0 ) (1 +1 +1 +0) ] / (2(1+1+1)) )) ?

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look up the CG coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get l=0.

I recall that the CG coefficients for combining two l=1 states into l=0 are zero except when m1 = -m2.

Wait, when l1=1, l2=1, and l'=0.

The CG coefficients are:

<0,0 |1,1;1,-1> = 1/sqrt(2),

<0,0 |1,0;1,0> = 1/sqrt(6),

<0,0 |1,-1;1,1> = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, that's from the formula.

So for our case:

When m1=1 and m_dipole=-1, the CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2).

When m1=0 and m_dipole=0, CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(6).

When m1=-1 and m_dipole=+1, CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2).

So the squares are (1/2), (1/6), and (1/2), respectively.

So the probabilities for the second step are:

For m1=1 → 1/2,

m1=0 → 1/6,

m1=-1 → 1/2.

Wait, no, because the probability is the square of the CG coefficient.

So, the transition probabilities from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0> are:

P(m1=1 → 0) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2,

P(m1=0 → 0) = (1/sqrt(6))^2 = 1/6,

P(m1=-1 → 0) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So now, the total probability for each path is:

P1(m1) * P2(m1).

Since P1(m1) is 1/3 for each m1, because there are three equally likely first steps.

So:

For m1=1: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

For m1=0: (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18.

For m1=-1: (1/3) * (1/2) =1/6.

Adding them up: 1/6 +1/18 +1/6 = (3/18 + 1/18 +3/18)=7/18 ≈ 0.388.

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step's probabilities are not all equal.

Wait, perhaps the first transition's probabilities are not all 1/3. Because the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which has l=0, m=0. The dipole operator can have m= -1, 0, +1, leading to transitions to |2,1,m1⟩ where m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m1 is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that transition.

In the first step, the transition from |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0) to |2,1,m1> is governed by the CG coefficient <1, m1 |0,0;1, m_dipole>.

Wait, no, the dipole operator has l=1, and the matrix element is proportional to <2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0>.

Which is non-zero only if m1 = m_dipole, where m_dipole is the m of the dipole operator (so -1, 0, +1).

So the CG coefficient for the first step is <1, m1 | 1, m_dipole; 0, 0>.

Which is 1 when m1 = m_dipole, because the 0 state doesn't contribute to m.

Wait, as discussed earlier, the CG coefficient for adding l=1 (dipole) and l=0 (initial state) to get l'=1 is 1 for each m1 = m_dipole.

So the matrix element squared is proportional to (1)^2 =1.

But since there are three possible m_dipole values (-1,0,+1), each contributing equally, the probability for each m1 is 1/3.

So for the first step, each m1 has a 1/3 chance.

Wait, but that would mean that the probabilities for the first step are 1/3 each for m1= -1, 0, +1.

Then, the second step's probabilities, as calculated earlier, are 1/2, 1/6, 1/2.

So the total probability is sum ( (1/3) * P2(m1) ), which is:

(1/3)(1/2) + (1/3)(1/6) + (1/3)(1/2) = (1/6 + 1/18 + 1/6) = (3/18 + 1/18 +3/18) =7/18 ≈0.388.

But none of the options have 7/18. The options are 1/3, 1/4, 2/3.

This suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect, or perhaps the problem is assuming that the two-step process is only allowed through one specific path.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says the path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/3.

If that's the case, perhaps the transition goes through m1=0.

But why would that be the case?

Because perhaps the transition through m1=0 has a higher probability than others.

Wait, earlier I thought that each m1 has equal probability 1/3 for the first step, but maybe that's not true. Because the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator's matrix element for m=0 is larger than for m=±1.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for m=0 is larger. So the transition to m1=0 has a higher probability.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The transition probability isn't necessarily the same for each m1. Because the matrix element for m=0 is larger than for m=±1.

In dipole transitions, the transition probability is higher for Δm=0 than for Δm=±1.

Wait, I think that for the transition from l=0 to l=1, the probability for m=0 is higher. Because the matrix element involves Y_{0,0} times Y_{1, m}.

The integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{0,0} Y_{1,m'}^* is non-zero only if m' = m +0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element is largest when m=0.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which in this case for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, the CG coefficients are:

<1, m |0,0;1, m> = sqrt( (2l +1) ) / sqrt(2(2l+1)) )?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 are:

<1, m |0,0;1, m> = sqrt( (2l'+1) ) / sqrt( 2l'+1 + 2l'+1 ), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I think the CG coefficients for this case are 1/sqrt(2) for m=±1 and 1/sqrt(6) for m=0.

Wait, another approach: the sum of the squares of the CG coefficients must be 1.

If the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) for m=±1 and 1/sqrt(6) for m=0, then:

(1/2) + (1/2) + (1/6) = (3/6 + 3/6 +1/6 )=7/6, which is more than 1. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are sqrt( (2l'+1) ) / something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should refer to the selection rules and the typical allowed transitions.

In hydrogen, the transition probabilities for different Δm values are not the same. The transition with Δm=0 is more probable than those with Δm=±1.

So, in the first step, the transition to m1=0 has a higher probability than m1=±1.

So, the first step's probabilities are not equal.

If that's the case, the probabilities may not be 1/3 each.

So, perhaps the first step's probabilities are:

P(m1=0) = something higher, and P(m1=±1) = lower.

So, let's model the first step's probabilities as P(m1=0) = a, and P(m1=±1) = b each. With a + 2b =1.

Assuming that a is higher than b.

In reality, the transition probabilities for m=0 are higher, so a > b.

Now, for the second step, the probabilities for each m1 are as before: P2(0)=1/6, P2(1)=1/2, P2(-1)=1/2.

So the total probability would be:

a*(1/6) + b*(1/2) + b*(1/2) = a*(1/6) + b*(1).

But we also have a + 2b =1.

But without knowing the exact values of a and b, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the only allowed transition is Δm=0, meaning m1=0.

But that can't be because the dipole selection rules allow Δm=0,±1.

Wait, maybe the transition can only occur when Δm=0, which would mean the first step goes to |2,1,0>, and the second step also goes to |1,0,0>, leading to a single path with probability 1/3, as in option A.

But why would that be the case? Because the problem states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions, implying that both steps are dipole transitions.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the correct answer is option A, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, looking at the options, the probabilities are 1/3, 1/4, and 2/3.

If the only allowed path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, then the probability would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, but that's not an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step has a probability of 1/3 for m1=0, and the second step has a probability of 1/3 again, leading to a total of (1/3)^2 = 1/9, which isn't in the options.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the overall probability as the sum of the probabilities of each allowed path. So if the first step to m1=0 has a higher probability, and the second step from m1=0 has a probability of 1/6, then the total probability via that path is (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18.

But that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the transition can only occur via m1=0, making the total probability (1/3)^2 = 1/9, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps it's best to consult what the standard approach to this problem is.

Wait, the standard approach for two-photon transitions (or two-step dipole transitions) in hydrogen: from n=3 to n=1 via an intermediate state.

The allowed intermediate states have l=1, and the m must change in a way that allows two Δm steps to reach 0.

But another point: the transition from n=3 → n=2 and then n=2 → n=1. Each transition must have l changing by ±1.

So the first transition is 3s (l=0) → 2p (l=1). The second is 2p → 1s (l=0).

The possible m transitions are as discussed.

But perhaps the probability is determined by the number of possible dipole transitions that can occur. For example, the transition from 3s to 2p can go to m= -1, 0, +1. Each has a certain probability, and the total is the sum of the probabilities for each path.

Wait, perhaps the simplest solution is to recall that in hydrogen, the probability of a transition is higher when the angular momentum change is such that m doesn't change. So the transition via m=0 in both steps would be the dominant path.

If that's the case, the path in option A would have the highest probability.

But looking at the options, option A's probability is 1/3, which could make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each step has a 1/2 probability, leading to a product of 1/4, but that's option B and C.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I don't remember the exact probabilities.

Another approach: the possible number of ways to change m from 0 to 0 in two steps.

Each step can change m by 0, ±1.

So two steps can change m by 0, ±1, ±2.

But since the final m is 0, the initial m is 0, so the sum of the two Δm's must be 0.

Possible combinations:

(0,0), (1,-1), (-1,1).

So three possible paths.

Each with their own probabilities.

Assuming each step has a transition probability of 1/3 for each possible Δm.

Then, the probability for each path would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

Since there are three paths, the total probability is 3*(1/9) )= 1/3, which matches option A's probability.

So the correct answer would be option A.


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1, and Δn can be any integer as long as l changes appropriately. The decay proceeds through an intermediate state with l=1, and the possible m values for the intermediate state are -1, 0, +1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m₁⟩):**
   - The initial state has m=0, and the dipole operator allows transitions to m₁ = -1, 0, +1.
   - The probabilities for these transitions are not necessarily equal. The transition to m₁=0 is generally more probable due to the symmetry of the spherical harmonics and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

2. **Second Transition (|2,1,m₁⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):**
   - The intermediate state |2,1,m₁⟩ must transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩, which has m=0.
   - The allowed m₁ values for the intermediate state are -1, 0, +1, and the transition probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:
     - For m₁=1, the probability is proportional to \( \frac{1}{2} \).
     - For m₁=0, the probability is proportional to \( \frac{1}{6} \).
     - For m₁=-1, the probability is proportional to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Total Probability:**
   - The total probability is the sum of the probabilities for all possible paths:
     \[
     P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{first step}}(m₁) \cdot P_{\text{second step}}(m₁).
     \]
   - Assuming equal probabilities for the first step (\( P_{\text{first step}}(m₁) = \frac{1}{3} \) for each m₁), the total probability becomes:
     \[
     P_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{7}{18}.
     \]
   - However, this result does not match any of the given options. The problem likely assumes that the dominant path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, which has a total probability of \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Conclusion:
The most plausible answer is that the decay proceeds through the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a total probability of \( \frac{1}{3} \), as this path is consistent with the selection rules and the dominant transition probabilities.

**Answer: A**
