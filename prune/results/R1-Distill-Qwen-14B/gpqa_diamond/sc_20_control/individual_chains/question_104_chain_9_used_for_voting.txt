Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step.

So the question is about two planets around two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The RV method detected these planets, and the spectral line shifts are given. Planet 1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet 2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. They ask how many times longer the orbital period of Planet 2 is compared to Planet 1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star's motion is what's being measured here. So K is the maximum speed the star moves toward or away from us.

The formula related to radial velocity is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the velocity. But I think for this problem, the exact formula involving the star's and planet's masses might be more relevant.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_p + M_s)^2 * (1 - e²) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_s)^(1/3)) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

Another approach: The RV method equation is K = (V * sin i) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But since both planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so that term is 1. Also, since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_s + M_p ≈ M_s, which is the same for both stars. So I can approximate M_s as the same and much larger than M_p, so M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So the formula simplifies. Let me write down the simplified version.

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since sin i is the same for both (assuming both are edge-on, but I think the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume sin i is the same for both or maybe it's the same inclination, but since they are just given as the same, maybe we can ignore it as a constant factor. Or perhaps even that the inclination angles are the same.

But wait, the problem doesn't mention the inclination, but since the RV method can't detect the inclination directly, but in this problem, the shift is given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So maybe the K values are given, and since K is the same as the shift (if we consider the same spectral line), then K1 is 5 and K2 is7.

Wait, the problem says the periodic wavelength shift is 5 and 7 milliangstroms for the two planets. So that should correspond to K for each.

So K is proportional to the velocity semi-amplitude. So K1 = 5, K2=7.

But wait, the way the RV method works is that the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. The actual shift in wavelength is determined by the Doppler effect and is given by delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. But in terms of the RV method, K is the velocity, so the wavelength shift is proportional to K.

So if the stars are the same (same spectral lines, same wavelength lambda), then the shift in wavelength (delta_lambda) is proportional to K. So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2/K1 =7/5.

Wait, but because the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula: K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since e=0, and M_p is same for both (Neptune-like), and M_s is same for both, and assuming sin i is same for both (maybe same inclination?), then K should be proportional to M_p / ( (M_s)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But wait, no, let me write the formula properly.

The more precise formula I recall is:

K = [ (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ] / [ (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]

But since e=0, and M_p << M_s,

K ≈ (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3) )

But if M_p is same for both planets, sin i same, M_s same, then K is proportional to P^(-1/3).

So K ∝ P^(-1/3)

So if K1 is for planet 1, K2 for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K = (1/P^(1/3)) * const.

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, let me think again. Let's say K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). So if K1 is smaller than K2, that would imply that P1 is larger than P2, because if K is smaller, 1/P^(1/3) is smaller, so P^(1/3) is larger, so P is larger.

Hmm, but in our case, K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K2 > K1. So according to the formula, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a larger K would mean a smaller P.

So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So because K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (49/25) = P1/P2

So P2/P1 = 25/49 ≈ 0.5102.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So P2 is 0.51 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by about a factor of 0.51.

But wait, the options given are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

Hmm. So 0.51 isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. Let me re-do the steps.

We have K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So K1 = 5, K2=7.

K2 = (7/5) * K1.

So (K2/K1) = 7/5.

Since K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), then K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: 343/125 = (P1/P2).

So P1/P2 = 343/125 ≈2.744.

So P2 = P1 * (125/343) ≈ P1 * 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter. So how many times longer is P2 than P1?

Wait, no, the question is, How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, so the period is 0.36 times longer.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: How many times longer is P2 than P1. If P2 is shorter, the answer would be less than 1, but the options include 0.36 (option A) and others.

But wait, perhaps I have the ratio inverted.

Let me write it again.

We have:

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So K2 / K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3).

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (343)/(125) = P1/P2.

So P1 = (343/125) P2.

So P2 = (125/343) P1 ≈ (0.364) P1.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So if P1 is, say, 10 days, P2 is about 3.64 days.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So it's shorter, meaning planet #2's period is shorter, so it's about 0.36 times as long.

Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's 0.36 times longer, but that's a shorter duration. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long. So the period is 0.36 times longer, meaning it's shorter.

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

So the answer would be A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I handle the proportionality correctly?

K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So K2 = (7/5) K1 → K2/K1 = 7/5.

So (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = 7/5 → (P1/P2)^(1/3) = 7/5 → cube both sides → P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 → P2 = (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So if P1 is longer, then P2 is shorter. So the question is, how much longer is P2 compared to P1? It's 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

But wait, the options also have option D as ~0.85. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the cube of 7/5.

(7/5)^3 = 343/125 = 2.744. So 1/(2.744) is approximately 0.364.

So yes, 0.364 is about 0.36, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered K inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K is smaller for a longer period.

In this case, K2 is bigger than K1, so P2 is smaller than P1.

So the ratio of periods is P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal.

Let me think again: K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So let me compute P2/P1.

P2/P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period.

So the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1? So it's 0.36 times longer, which is less than one. So the correct answer is A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). Using the radial velocity method, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
\frac{343}{125} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is **shorter** than that of planet #1 by a factor of ~0.36.

Given the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

K ≈ (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3) )

But if M_p is same for both planets, sin i same, M_s same, then K is proportional to P^(-1/3).

So K ∝ P^(-1/3)

So if K1 is for planet 1, K2 for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K = (1/P^(1/3)) * const.

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, let me think again. Let's say K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). So if K1 is smaller than K2, that would imply that P1 is larger than P2, because if K is smaller, 1/P^(1/3) is smaller, so P^(1/3) is larger, so P is larger.

Hmm, but in our case, K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K2 > K1. So according to the formula, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a larger K would mean a smaller P.

So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So because K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (49/25) = P1/P2

So P2/P1 = 25/49 ≈ 0.5102.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So P2 is 0.51 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by about a factor of 0.51.

K2 = (7/5) * K1.

So (K2/K1) = 7/5.

Since K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), then K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: 343/125 = (P1/P2).

So P1/P2 = 343/125 ≈2.744.

So P2 = P1 * (125/343) ≈ P1 * 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter. So how many times longer is P2 than P1?

Wait, no, the question is, How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, so the period is 0.36 times longer.

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (343)/(125) = P1/P2.

So P1 = (343/125) P2.

So P2 = (125/343) P1 ≈ (0.364) P1.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So if P1 is, say, 10 days, P2 is about 3.64 days.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So it's shorter, meaning planet #2's period is shorter, so it's about 0.36 times as long.

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

So the answer would be A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I handle the proportionality correctly?

K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So K2 = (7/5) K1 → K2/K1 = 7/5.

So (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = 7/5 → (P1/P2)^(1/3) = 7/5 → cube both sides → P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 → P2 = (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So if P1 is longer, then P2 is shorter. So the question is, how much longer is P2 compared to P1? It's 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

But wait, the options also have option D as ~0.85. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the cube of 7/5.

(7/5)^3 = 343/125 = 2.744. So 1/(2.744) is approximately 0.364.

So yes, 0.364 is about 0.36, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered K inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K is smaller for a longer period.

In this case, K2 is bigger than K1, so P2 is smaller than P1.

So the ratio of periods is P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal.

Let me think again: K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So let me compute P2/P1.

P2/P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period.

So the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1? So it's 0.36 times longer, which is less than one. So the correct answer is A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). Using the radial velocity method, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
\frac{343}{125} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is **shorter** than that of planet #1 by a factor of ~0.36.

Given the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
