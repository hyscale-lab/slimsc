Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, making product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm. I think I'll need to figure out each step of the reaction to understand what product 3 is and then analyze its NMR.

First, let's think about the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination, forming alkenes via an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in adamantane, elimination would lead to the formation of an alkene. But wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has the bromines on adjacent positions in a way that when they eliminate, they form a double bond.

Wait, actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. But elimination would require the two leaving groups to be anti-periplanar, which in the adamantane structure might be possible. So the product after elimination would be an adamantene with a double bond. So product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar, but perhaps more accurately, since it's from 1,3-dibromide, perhaps 1,3-cycloaddition isn't happening, but rather dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond.

Wait, but I've heard that when two adjacent bromides are present on adamantane, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Wait no, in the structure of adamantane, each carbon is connected in a diamond-like lattice. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on two non-adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe the initial structure is such that elimination forms a bridge across the adamantane. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene or something else.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows:

- 4.79 ppm, 2H: probably an -OCH2- group, maybe from an epoxide or an ether.
- 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H: these are likely the adamantane ring protons. Adamantane's protons are typically around 2 ppm, so 10H suggests that the structure has four equivalent CH2 groups in the adamantane part (each CH2 contributing 2H; 4x2=8H), but wait, 10H doesn't fit that. Alternatively, perhaps it's two sets of equivalent protons, like two different types of CH2 groups. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe the product is a diol because KOH is a base and could also act as a nucleophile. Wait, but KOH in elimination would form an alkene, but in a substitution, it might form a diol. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a vicinal diol after two substitution reactions. But wait, KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely than substitution.

Wait, the IR spectrum of product 1 has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So if product 1 has a carbonyl, that suggests that the reaction isn't elimination but perhaps an oxidation.

Wait, but wait, when dibromides react with a base, another possibility is that they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then, where would the carbonyl come from? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters, not bromides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement, but that requires specific conditions and structures.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide. Wait, no, that's usually with peracids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form a carbonyl. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how would that happen from a dibromide? Oh wait, perhaps the bromides are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination (two dehydrohalogenation steps), a double bond is formed, and then further oxidation occurs? But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: product 1 is a light yellow solid. That could indicate a ketone, which is often yellowish. So if the product has a ketone group, then perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some oxidation? Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms an alkene, and then that alkene is epoxidized, but that would require a peracid, which isn't present here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the NMR data again. The peak at 4.79 ppm with 2H. That's in the range for an OCH2 group, as in an ether or epoxide. But wait, another possibility is that it's a carbonyl oxygen adjacent to CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in a ketone group. Wait, perhaps a carbonyl group is next to a CH2 group. So maybe it's a structure like (CH2)CO-O- something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the product 1. The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So the product is a ketone. So product 1 is a diketone? Or perhaps a mono-ketone.

Wait, considering the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If the reaction with KOH leads to a double elimination, perhaps forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Wait, because if two adjacent Br atoms are removed, forming a double bond, but the carbonyl would come from where?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol. But a diol would have OH protons, which might show up elsewhere in the NMR. So, looking at the NMR data again, 4.79 ppm is 2H; perhaps that's the -OCH2- group, but in a diol, we would have OH groups which might be broad, but in this case, the problem says to ignore exchanging protons, so maybe the OH's are not showing up as singlets. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is from an epoxide, but then the coupling would be a triplet if it's adjacent to another CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone formed via some elimination and oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't typically an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl via a different mechanism. Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution followed by elimination. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with two equivalents of KOH. Each Br could be replaced by an OH group, forming a diol. Then, on heating, the diol could undergo elimination to form an alkene and water. But that would require two elimination steps, which might be possible. So if you have two adjacent hydroxyl groups, heating could lead to elimination, forming a double bond. But where would the carbonyl come from? That's the confusing part.

Wait, maybe I'm getting off track. Let me consider that product 1 has a carbonyl group. So after KOH treatment, 1,3-dibromoadamantane becomes a ketone. How? Maybe via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or some other rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement, but those typically involve isocyanates or similar structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base and causing the elimination of HBr twice, which would form a double bond. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps after elimination of two HBr molecules, the molecule forms a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial compound 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH in a way that forms a geminal diol, which then undergoes a dehydration to form a carbonyl group. Oh! Wait, that makes sense. If two bromines are on the same carbon (geminal), treatment with a base could lead to the formation of a diol, which then dehydrates to form a ketone. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the two Brs are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not the same. So that wouldn't work.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with each carbon bonded to three others. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, maybe each Br leaves, and the hydroxide attacks adjacent carbons, but I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a double bond. Then, product 1 would be a diene. But then, the IR would show a peak for a double bond (around 1650 cm-1), but the given IR is at 1720 cm-1, which is more indicative of a carbonyl.

Wait another idea: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then an epoxidation occurs. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the formation of a cyclic ether via elimination. But the IR peak is at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl, not an ether.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

I'm stuck. Maybe I should move on and see if the next steps can help.

Second reaction: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing a Claisen rearrangement if it's a ketene or something similar. Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl, so if it's a ketone, what happens when you treat it with Al(OiPr)3?

Wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring. But adamantane is a polycyclic structure, but I don't think it's aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but the substrate would need to be an aromatic ring. Hmm, maybe product 1 has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, which would undergo further acylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, which can undergo acylation. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: when product 1 (a ketone) is treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes a keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(OiPr)3 is acting as a catalyst for ring-opening. But in that case, the NMR for product 1 would show the epoxide protons, which are typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, which fits with the 4.79 peak. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester. Wait, but how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? I'm a bit stuck here.

Perhaps I should think about the third step to see if that gives any clues. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments with carbonyl groups.

But ozonolysis is usually done at low temperatures (like -78°C), so that fits. After ozonolysis, the product is cleaved, and then dimethylsulfide is added, which is a reductive work-up, preventing the formation of ozonides into diketones, instead yielding aldehydes or ketones.

So if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would be a di-ketone or dialdehyde, depending on the structure. But the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which is probably in a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2 or something similar.

Wait, let me think. Ozonolysis of a symmetric diene would give two identical carbonyl compounds. But the coupling pattern in NMR would depend on the structure. For example, if the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, the protons on CH2 would be next to two other CH2 groups, perhaps leading to a triplet or more complex splitting.

Wait, in product 3, after ozonolysis, if the molecule has a structure like (CH2)2CO, then the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would be split based on neighboring protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering product 3 is formed from product 2, which came from product 1, which came from the initial dibromide. Maybe the initial reaction forms a diol, which then forms a diene upon heating with Al(OiPr)3, which then undergoes ozonolysis.

Wait, but let's try to piece it all together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming elimination of two HBr molecules, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene (a diene). But then the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm-1 for C=C. But the IR is at 1720, so that's a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is a diketone. How? Let's say that each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that would require oxidation, which KOH isn't known for.

Wait, perhaps each Br is oxidized to a carbonyl. But how? KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene, and then some kind of oxidation step occurs, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the initial dibromide is a cyclopropane derivative. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diamondoid structure, so that's probably not the case.

Another thought: perhaps product 1 is a diol, and then upon heating with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. Oh wait, that would make sense. So product 1 is a diol (vicinal diol, perhaps), and Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid that can help in elimination reactions, like dehydration to form an alkene.

So, product 1 is a diol: 1,3-diols on adamantane.

Then, when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, it loses water to form an alkene, product 2. Then, product 2 (the alkene) is ozonolyzed to form product 3, which would have carbonyl groups.

So, let's try to model this.

Product 1: 1,3-adamantanediol.

Heated with Al(OiPr)3 (Lewis acid catalyst) → product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene (the diol loses two water molecules to form a double bond).

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But the structure of adamantadiene would determine how it breaks.

Wait, but where would the double bonds be in product 2? If product 2 is 1,3-diene, the ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but 1,3-diene is conjugated, so ozonolysis would break it into two fragments.

Wait, but let me think. Ozonolysis of a diene (like 1,3-pentadiene) would give two carbonyl compounds. For example, 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes (formaldehyde and another aldehyde), but the exact products depend on the structure.

But in the case of adamantadiene, the structure is more complex. Let's think about the ozonolysis of a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis cleaves each double bond into carbonyl groups. For a conjugated diene (like 1,3-butadiene), ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. But for a cyclic diene, the outcome could be different.

Wait, perhaps in product 2, the structure after elimination is a bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. But in this case, perhaps product 3 ends up with two ketone groups.

Wait, but the NMR of product 3 is what's needed. The question specifically asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which I assume is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

So, let's imagine that product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2CO. The protons on the CH2 next to CO would be deshielded and would couple with neighboring protons.

Wait, but let's think about the splitting. If each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2, the coupling would occur between the adjacent protons. For instance, if there's a structure like CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups. Wait, but in such a scenario, the protons on the first CH2 would be next to another CH2, leading to splitting.

Wait, but for example, consider a structure like CH2-CH2-CO-R. The protons on the first CH2 (attached to the CO) would have neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2. Each of these CH2 groups would have two neighboring groups, leading to multiplet splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent only to another CH2, leading to a triplet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, but let's consider a specific example: if we have a structure like (CH2)2CO, then each CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Wait, no, in (CH2)2CO, the first CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, and the second CH2 is adjacent to the CO. So the first CH2 (next to the CO) would have neighboring CH2 protons on the adjacent CH2, which would split into a triplet. The second CH2 (further away from the CO) would have neighboring CH2 protons on both sides, leading to a quartet? Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, but let's think about the splitting in more detail. The most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl group. Let's say we have a structure where the carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to another CH2 group (like CO-CH2-CH2-...). The protons on the CO-adjacent CH2 would be next to the other CH2. Each of those protons would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet (n+1, where n=2 neighbors).

Wait, but that would be a triplet. Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, then each set of CH2 protons would split into a triplet. Hmm.

Wait, but in reality, the splitting can get more complex. For example, if each proton on the first CH2 is coupling with two protons on the next CH2, and each of those is also coupling with another set of protons, the splitting could become a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps in the product 3, the structure is such that the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group that is next to another CH2 group. So each proton on the first CH2 would see two protons on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bridge, and the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 that's adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to a doublet of triplets or another pattern.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model this.

Assume product 3 has a structure where the deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-something. But that's getting a bit far.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone, and the adjacent CH2 groups are coupled in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs on the next CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the next CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2, then each H on the first would couple with both their own adjacent and the next, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that is next to two different CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm with 2H, which is likely the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Then, the IR at 1720 cm-1 confirms the presence of a ketone.

So, product 1 is a diol (1,3-adamantanediol). Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 causes the diol to eliminate water and form a diene (product 2). Ozonolysis of the diene breaks the double bonds, forming product 3 with carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would likely have two ketone groups if the diene was in a position that would break into two carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is in a bridge position, leading to a single ketone group.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone. Then, each ketone would have adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, if the structure is something like O=C-(CH2)n-CO, the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketones would each have neighboring CH2 groups.

So, for example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 would be next to another CH2 group. The H's on the CH2 adjacent to the ketone would see two H's on the next CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the next CH2 is also next to another group, perhaps the splitting becomes more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to one CH2 and another group, leading to a different splitting pattern.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should think about the coupling pattern possibilities.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, which of these would correspond to a CH2 group next to another CH2, and perhaps adjacent to another group.

If the structure is CH2-CO, with the adjacent CH2 having another CH2, perhaps the H's on the first CH2 would be a quartet (n=3, like a CH2-CH2-CH2 group), but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet.

Wait, maybe it's a simple CH2 group next to another CH2, leading to a triplet. That would be option A.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to two different CH2 groups, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, for example, if the structure is:

CO-CH2-CH2-CH3

Then, the CH2 next to the CO would have neighboring CH2 group (two H's), so each H on the first CH2 would be a triplet. The next CH2 would have two H's, each seeing two H's from the first CH2 and two from the third (if any), but in this case, the third is a CH3. So their splitting would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is in a CH2 that is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain.

Another approach: when a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So if the splitting is only from that, the peak would be a triplet (option A).

But wait, if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another group, then the coupling could be more complex. For example, if the adjacent CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H in the first CH2 would couple with two H's from the second CH2, which are themselves split into a triplet. So the first CH2's H would be a triplet of triplets.

But that would be option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 next to the carbonyl is also adjacent to another CH2 group that's part of a bridge or another structure, leading to more coupling.

Hmm. I think I'm getting too deep without knowing the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the H's adjacent to the ketones are each in a CH2 group. So, the structure could be something like (CH2)2CO, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring structure where the CH2 groups are adjacent in a way that each H on the CH2 next to the ketone is coupled with two H's from another CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from coupling with two different sets of H's, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the adjacent CH2 group is part of a larger system, leading to more splitting.

Wait, I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: triplet → simple n=2, so two neighboring H's.

Option B: triplet of triplets → each H is coupling with two different groups, each of which has two H's.

Option C: doublet of triplets → perhaps coupling with two groups, one with two H's and another with one.

Option D: pentet → four neighboring H's, but that's unlikely in this scenario.

So, which is more likely.

In a simple CH2-CH2 group, each CH2's H's would be triplet.

But if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 which is adjacent to a different CH2, the first CH2's H's would see two H's from the adjacent CH2 and the two H's from the CH2 beyond, making a quartet? Wait, no, because each H would see the two H's in the adjacent CH2, but perhaps the H's in the next CH2 are split into a triplet, so the first CH2's H's would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between two different sets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling between first and second CH2 would lead to triplets for each, and if they are also coupled with another group (like a third CH2), the splitting could become more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH2 that is itself adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H's on the second CH2, and those on the second would couple with two on the first and two on the third, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH2 group which is also adjacent to another H environment, leading to a more complex coupling pattern.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think of a real example. Ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehyde groups. But that's a straight chain. In adamantane, the structure would be more complex, leading to a bridged or ring structure after ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis of product 2 (a bicyclic diene) would result in a structure with two ketone groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group.

So, each ketone would have a CH2 group next to it. If each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, then the H's on the CH2 next to the ketone would be a triplet.

So, the answer would be a triplet (option A).

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 groups are part of a bridge, the coupling could involve more than just adjacent CH2. For example, in a bridge, the CH2 could be adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between the two CH2 groups on either side of the ketone, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. The most straightforward scenario is that each CH2 group next to the ketone has two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

So, the answer would be option A) triplet.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the final answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, likely undergoing elimination of two HBr molecules to form a diol (1,3-adamantanediol).  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the diol may undergo further dehydration to form a ketone.  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to an -OCH₂- group, and signals for adamantane protons in the range of 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H).  

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 (likely a diol or ketone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates the elimination of water from the diol, forming a diene (product 2).  

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   - Product 2, being a diene, undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by treatment with dimethylsulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the diene, forming carbonyl-containing products (product 3).  

4. **Analysis of Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - If the structure of product 3 includes a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, the protons on this CH₂ group will couple with the protons on an adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - Each proton on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl will couple with two protons on the neighboring CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern.  

5. **Coupling Pattern**:  
   - The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl) is a **triplet**, as it is influenced by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.  

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.  

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, making product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm. I think I'll need to figure out each step of the reaction to understand what product 3 is and then analyze its NMR.

First, let's think about the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination, forming alkenes via an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in adamantane, elimination would lead to the formation of an alkene. But wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has the bromines on adjacent positions in a way that when they eliminate, they form a double bond.

Wait, actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. But elimination would require the two leaving groups to be anti-periplanar, which in the adamantane structure might be possible. So the product after elimination would be an adamantene with a double bond. So product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar, but perhaps more accurately, since it's from 1,3-dibromide, perhaps 1,3-cycloaddition isn't happening, but rather dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond.

Wait, but I've heard that when two adjacent bromides are present on adamantane, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Wait no, in the structure of adamantane, each carbon is connected in a diamond-like lattice. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on two non-adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe the initial structure is such that elimination forms a bridge across the adamantane. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene or something else.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows:

- 4.79 ppm, 2H: probably an -OCH2- group, maybe from an epoxide or an ether.
- 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H: these are likely the adamantane ring protons. Adamantane's protons are typically around 2 ppm, so 10H suggests that the structure has four equivalent CH2 groups in the adamantane part (each CH2 contributing 2H; 4x2=8H), but wait, 10H doesn't fit that. Alternatively, perhaps it's two sets of equivalent protons, like two different types of CH2 groups. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe the product is a diol because KOH is a base and could also act as a nucleophile. Wait, but KOH in elimination would form an alkene, but in a substitution, it might form a diol. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a vicinal diol after two substitution reactions. But wait, KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely than substitution.

Wait, the IR spectrum of product 1 has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So if product 1 has a carbonyl, that suggests that the reaction isn't elimination but perhaps an oxidation.

Wait, but wait, when dibromides react with a base, another possibility is that they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then, where would the carbonyl come from? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters, not bromides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement, but that requires specific conditions and structures.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide. Wait, no, that's usually with peracids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form a carbonyl. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how would that happen from a dibromide? Oh wait, perhaps the bromides are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination (two dehydrohalogenation steps), a double bond is formed, and then further oxidation occurs? But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: product 1 is a light yellow solid. That could indicate a ketone, which is often yellowish. So if the product has a ketone group, then perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some oxidation? Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms an alkene, and then that alkene is epoxidized, but that would require a peracid, which isn't present here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the NMR data again. The peak at 4.79 ppm with 2H. That's in the range for an OCH2 group, as in an ether or epoxide. But wait, another possibility is that it's a carbonyl oxygen adjacent to CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in a ketone group. Wait, perhaps a carbonyl group is next to a CH2 group. So maybe it's a structure like (CH2)CO-O- something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the product 1. The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So the product is a ketone. So product 1 is a diketone? Or perhaps a mono-ketone.

Wait, considering the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If the reaction with KOH leads to a double elimination, perhaps forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Wait, because if two adjacent Br atoms are removed, forming a double bond, but the carbonyl would come from where?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol. But a diol would have OH protons, which might show up elsewhere in the NMR. So, looking at the NMR data again, 4.79 ppm is 2H; perhaps that's the -OCH2- group, but in a diol, we would have OH groups which might be broad, but in this case, the problem says to ignore exchanging protons, so maybe the OH's are not showing up as singlets. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is from an epoxide, but then the coupling would be a triplet if it's adjacent to another CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone formed via some elimination and oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't typically an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl via a different mechanism. Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution followed by elimination. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with two equivalents of KOH. Each Br could be replaced by an OH group, forming a diol. Then, on heating, the diol could undergo elimination to form an alkene and water. But that would require two elimination steps, which might be possible. So if you have two adjacent hydroxyl groups, heating could lead to elimination, forming a double bond. But where would the carbonyl come from? That's the confusing part.

Wait, maybe I'm getting off track. Let me consider that product 1 has a carbonyl group. So after KOH treatment, 1,3-dibromoadamantane becomes a ketone. How? Maybe via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or some other rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement, but those typically involve isocyanates or similar structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base and causing the elimination of HBr twice, which would form a double bond. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps after elimination of two HBr molecules, the molecule forms a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial compound 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH in a way that forms a geminal diol, which then undergoes a dehydration to form a carbonyl group. Oh! Wait, that makes sense. If two bromines are on the same carbon (geminal), treatment with a base could lead to the formation of a diol, which then dehydrates to form a ketone. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the two Brs are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not the same. So that wouldn't work.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with each carbon bonded to three others. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, maybe each Br leaves, and the hydroxide attacks adjacent carbons, but I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a double bond. Then, product 1 would be a diene. But then, the IR would show a peak for a double bond (around 1650 cm-1), but the given IR is at 1720 cm-1, which is more indicative of a carbonyl.

Wait another idea: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then an epoxidation occurs. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the formation of a cyclic ether via elimination. But the IR peak is at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl, not an ether.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

I'm stuck. Maybe I should move on and see if the next steps can help.

Second reaction: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing a Claisen rearrangement if it's a ketene or something similar. Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl, so if it's a ketone, what happens when you treat it with Al(OiPr)3?

Wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring. But adamantane is a polycyclic structure, but I don't think it's aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but the substrate would need to be an aromatic ring. Hmm, maybe product 1 has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, which would undergo further acylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, which can undergo acylation. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: when product 1 (a ketone) is treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes a keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(OiPr)3 is acting as a catalyst for ring-opening. But in that case, the NMR for product 1 would show the epoxide protons, which are typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, which fits with the 4.79 peak. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester. Wait, but how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? I'm a bit stuck here.

Perhaps I should think about the third step to see if that gives any clues. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments with carbonyl groups.

But ozonolysis is usually done at low temperatures (like -78°C), so that fits. After ozonolysis, the product is cleaved, and then dimethylsulfide is added, which is a reductive work-up, preventing the formation of ozonides into diketones, instead yielding aldehydes or ketones.

So if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would be a di-ketone or dialdehyde, depending on the structure. But the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which is probably in a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2 or something similar.

Wait, let me think. Ozonolysis of a symmetric diene would give two identical carbonyl compounds. But the coupling pattern in NMR would depend on the structure. For example, if the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, the protons on CH2 would be next to two other CH2 groups, perhaps leading to a triplet or more complex splitting.

Wait, in product 3, after ozonolysis, if the molecule has a structure like (CH2)2CO, then the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would be split based on neighboring protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering product 3 is formed from product 2, which came from product 1, which came from the initial dibromide. Maybe the initial reaction forms a diol, which then forms a diene upon heating with Al(OiPr)3, which then undergoes ozonolysis.

Wait, but let's try to piece it all together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming elimination of two HBr molecules, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene (a diene). But then the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm-1 for C=C. But the IR is at 1720, so that's a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is a diketone. How? Let's say that each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that would require oxidation, which KOH isn't known for.

Wait, perhaps each Br is oxidized to a carbonyl. But how? KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene, and then some kind of oxidation step occurs, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the initial dibromide is a cyclopropane derivative. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diamondoid structure, so that's probably not the case.

Another thought: perhaps product 1 is a diol, and then upon heating with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. Oh wait, that would make sense. So product 1 is a diol (vicinal diol, perhaps), and Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid that can help in elimination reactions, like dehydration to form an alkene.

So, product 1 is a diol: 1,3-diols on adamantane.

Then, when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, it loses water to form an alkene, product 2. Then, product 2 (the alkene) is ozonolyzed to form product 3, which would have carbonyl groups.

So, let's try to model this.

Product 1: 1,3-adamantanediol.

Heated with Al(OiPr)3 (Lewis acid catalyst) → product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene (the diol loses two water molecules to form a double bond).

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But the structure of adamantadiene would determine how it breaks.

Wait, but where would the double bonds be in product 2? If product 2 is 1,3-diene, the ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but 1,3-diene is conjugated, so ozonolysis would break it into two fragments.

Wait, but let me think. Ozonolysis of a diene (like 1,3-pentadiene) would give two carbonyl compounds. For example, 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes (formaldehyde and another aldehyde), but the exact products depend on the structure.

But in the case of adamantadiene, the structure is more complex. Let's think about the ozonolysis of a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis cleaves each double bond into carbonyl groups. For a conjugated diene (like 1,3-butadiene), ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. But for a cyclic diene, the outcome could be different.

Wait, perhaps in product 2, the structure after elimination is a bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. But in this case, perhaps product 3 ends up with two ketone groups.

Wait, but the NMR of product 3 is what's needed. The question specifically asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which I assume is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

So, let's imagine that product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2CO. The protons on the CH2 next to CO would be deshielded and would couple with neighboring protons.

Wait, but let's think about the splitting. If each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2, the coupling would occur between the adjacent protons. For instance, if there's a structure like CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups. Wait, but in such a scenario, the protons on the first CH2 would be next to another CH2, leading to splitting.

Wait, but for example, consider a structure like CH2-CH2-CO-R. The protons on the first CH2 (attached to the CO) would have neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2. Each of these CH2 groups would have two neighboring groups, leading to multiplet splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent only to another CH2, leading to a triplet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, but let's consider a specific example: if we have a structure like (CH2)2CO, then each CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Wait, no, in (CH2)2CO, the first CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, and the second CH2 is adjacent to the CO. So the first CH2 (next to the CO) would have neighboring CH2 protons on the adjacent CH2, which would split into a triplet. The second CH2 (further away from the CO) would have neighboring CH2 protons on both sides, leading to a quartet? Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, but let's think about the splitting in more detail. The most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl group. Let's say we have a structure where the carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to another CH2 group (like CO-CH2-CH2-...). The protons on the CO-adjacent CH2 would be next to the other CH2. Each of those protons would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet (n+1, where n=2 neighbors).

Wait, but that would be a triplet. Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, then each set of CH2 protons would split into a triplet. Hmm.

Wait, but in reality, the splitting can get more complex. For example, if each proton on the first CH2 is coupling with two protons on the next CH2, and each of those is also coupling with another set of protons, the splitting could become a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps in the product 3, the structure is such that the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group that is next to another CH2 group. So each proton on the first CH2 would see two protons on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bridge, and the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 that's adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to a doublet of triplets or another pattern.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model this.

Assume product 3 has a structure where the deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-something. But that's getting a bit far.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone, and the adjacent CH2 groups are coupled in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs on the next CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the next CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2, then each H on the first would couple with both their own adjacent and the next, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that is next to two different CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm with 2H, which is likely the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Then, the IR at 1720 cm-1 confirms the presence of a ketone.

So, product 1 is a diol (1,3-adamantanediol). Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 causes the diol to eliminate water and form a diene (product 2). Ozonolysis of the diene breaks the double bonds, forming product 3 with carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would likely have two ketone groups if the diene was in a position that would break into two carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is in a bridge position, leading to a single ketone group.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone. Then, each ketone would have adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, if the structure is something like O=C-(CH2)n-CO, the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketones would each have neighboring CH2 groups.

So, for example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 would be next to another CH2 group. The H's on the CH2 adjacent to the ketone would see two H's on the next CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the next CH2 is also next to another group, perhaps the splitting becomes more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to one CH2 and another group, leading to a different splitting pattern.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should think about the coupling pattern possibilities.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, which of these would correspond to a CH2 group next to another CH2, and perhaps adjacent to another group.

If the structure is CH2-CO, with the adjacent CH2 having another CH2, perhaps the H's on the first CH2 would be a quartet (n=3, like a CH2-CH2-CH2 group), but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet.

Wait, maybe it's a simple CH2 group next to another CH2, leading to a triplet. That would be option A.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to two different CH2 groups, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, for example, if the structure is:

CO-CH2-CH2-CH3

Then, the CH2 next to the CO would have neighboring CH2 group (two H's), so each H on the first CH2 would be a triplet. The next CH2 would have two H's, each seeing two H's from the first CH2 and two from the third (if any), but in this case, the third is a CH3. So their splitting would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is in a CH2 that is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain.

Another approach: when a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So if the splitting is only from that, the peak would be a triplet (option A).

But wait, if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another group, then the coupling could be more complex. For example, if the adjacent CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H in the first CH2 would couple with two H's from the second CH2, which are themselves split into a triplet. So the first CH2's H would be a triplet of triplets.

But that would be option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 next to the carbonyl is also adjacent to another CH2 group that's part of a bridge or another structure, leading to more coupling.

Hmm. I think I'm getting too deep without knowing the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the H's adjacent to the ketones are each in a CH2 group. So, the structure could be something like (CH2)2CO, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring structure where the CH2 groups are adjacent in a way that each H on the CH2 next to the ketone is coupled with two H's from another CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from coupling with two different sets of H's, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the adjacent CH2 group is part of a larger system, leading to more splitting.

Wait, I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: triplet → simple n=2, so two neighboring H's.

Option B: triplet of triplets → each H is coupling with two different groups, each of which has two H's.

Option C: doublet of triplets → perhaps coupling with two groups, one with two H's and another with one.

Option D: pentet → four neighboring H's, but that's unlikely in this scenario.

So, which is more likely.

In a simple CH2-CH2 group, each CH2's H's would be triplet.

But if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 which is adjacent to a different CH2, the first CH2's H's would see two H's from the adjacent CH2 and the two H's from the CH2 beyond, making a quartet? Wait, no, because each H would see the two H's in the adjacent CH2, but perhaps the H's in the next CH2 are split into a triplet, so the first CH2's H's would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between two different sets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling between first and second CH2 would lead to triplets for each, and if they are also coupled with another group (like a third CH2), the splitting could become more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH2 that is itself adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H's on the second CH2, and those on the second would couple with two on the first and two on the third, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH2 group which is also adjacent to another H environment, leading to a more complex coupling pattern.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think of a real example. Ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehyde groups. But that's a straight chain. In adamantane, the structure would be more complex, leading to a bridged or ring structure after ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis of product 2 (a bicyclic diene) would result in a structure with two ketone groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group.

So, each ketone would have a CH2 group next to it. If each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, then the H's on the CH2 next to the ketone would be a triplet.

So, the answer would be a triplet (option A).

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 groups are part of a bridge, the coupling could involve more than just adjacent CH2. For example, in a bridge, the CH2 could be adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between the two CH2 groups on either side of the ketone, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. The most straightforward scenario is that each CH2 group next to the ketone has two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

So, the answer would be option A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the final answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, likely undergoing elimination of two HBr molecules to form a diol (1,3-adamantanediol).  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the diol may undergo further dehydration to form a ketone.  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to an -OCH₂- group, and signals for adamantane protons in the range of 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H).  

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 (likely a diol or ketone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates the elimination of water from the diol, forming a diene (product 2).  

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   - Product 2, being a diene, undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by treatment with dimethylsulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the diene, forming carbonyl-containing products (product 3).  

4. **Analysis of Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - If the structure of product 3 includes a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, the protons on this CH₂ group will couple with the protons on an adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - Each proton on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl will couple with two protons on the neighboring CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern.  

5. **Coupling Pattern**:  
   - The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl) is a **triplet**, as it is influenced by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.  

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.  

**Answer: A**
