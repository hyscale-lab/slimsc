Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, considering it hasn't decayed for some time already. 

Alright, the setup is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, wait, that probably means that the probability of decay (P) after 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. But wait, in radioactive decay, the decay follows an exponential law, right? So the probability of decay is related to the decay constant.

Let me recall the decay formula. The probability that an atom has decayed by time t is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as the survival probability S = e^(-λt), which is the chance the atom hasn't decayed by time t.

So, the problem states that after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, which is 0.32. So that means P(100) = 0.32. Since P = 1 - S, that would mean S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. 

Wait, but S is e^(-λ *100) = 0.68. So I can solve for λ here. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ *100. So λ = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that.

Calculating ln(0.68) is about ln(2/3) is around -0.405, but exact number: Let me think, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ is 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, maybe I should do this more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68): 

I know that ln(1)=0, ln(e^-0.405)= about 0.68. Wait, e^-0.405 is approximately 0.667, so maybe 0.68 is a little higher. Let me use a calculator approach.

Using a calculator, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. Right, so λ is approximately 0.0038566 per minute.

Now the scenario is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and now we want to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 50 + 150 is 200 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes. But perhaps we should think in terms of the remaining time after 50 minutes.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. So, the decay is a memoryless process. That's a key point. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, starting from now, regardless of how much time has passed before.

Wait, so since we are told that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, we can model this as starting the process anew. Because radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next t minutes depends only on the current time, not on when you started observing.

So, the question is: what's the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So, the time we're considering is 150 minutes from now.

So, the approach is to calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet. Which, because of the memoryless property, is the same as the probability in any 150-minute period.

So, using the decay formula again. The probability P(150) is 1 - e^(-λ *150). But wait, since we've already had 50 minutes pass without decay, the effective time left is 150 minutes. But wait, no, the time is additive. Because the decay process is continuous. So whether you consider the total time as 200 minutes (50 +150), or just 150 minutes from now, the probability would be the same as if you started fresh and waited 150 minutes.

Because of the memoryless property, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if you were to start a new timer. So λ is the same.

So, let me compute the probability.

First, compute λ. From the earlier data, P(100) = 0.32.

So, S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 = e^(-λ*100). So λ = ln(1/0.68)/100 = ln(1.470588)/100.

Wait, because 1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. So ln(1.470588) is approximately 0.3856. So λ ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Now, for the next 150 minutes, the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute λ*150 = 0.003856 * 150 ≈ 0.5784.

So e^(-0.5784) ≈ 0.5612. Wait, because e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6. Let's compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.5784: Let me compute e^-0.5784.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach, but perhaps it's better to do this step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a better approximation. The exact value of λ is ln(1/0.68)/100 = (ln(25/17)) / 100. Because 1/0.68 is 25/17, approximately. Let me compute ln(25/17):

25/17 is approximately 1.470588.

ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.3856, which is correct.

So, λ = 0.3856 / 100 = 0.003856 per minute.

So, for 150 minutes, λ*t = 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.

Now, e^-0.5784 ≈ ?

We can use the Taylor series or remember that e^-0.5784 is approximately 0.561.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it using known values.

We know that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065.

e^-0.6 is approx 0.5488.

e^-0.5784 is about 0.5612, which is between 0.6 and 0.5488. Let me see.

Wait, maybe better to use linear approximation. Let me think: between 0.5 and 0.6.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in x, and the e^(-x) goes from 0.6065 to 0.5488, a decrease of about 0.0577 over 0.1 in x. So, for each 0.01 increase in x beyond 0.5, e^-x decreases by approximately 0.00577.

So, 0.5784 is 0.5 + 0.0784. So, let's find e^-0.5784.

At x=0.5, e^-0.5=0.6065.

For each 0.01 increase in x, e^-x decreases by about 0.577 * 0.01 = 0.00577 per 0.01. So for 0.0784, that's 7.84 steps of 0.01.

So decrease is 7.84 *0.00577 ≈ 0.0452.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0452 = 0.5613.

So, e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.5613, so the survival probability is about 0.5613.

Thus, the probability of decay is 1 - 0.5613 ≈ 0.4387, or 43.87%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I missed a step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can compute λ more accurately.

From S(100) = 0.68 = e^(-λ*100).

So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Compute ln(0.68):

I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me compute ln(0.68).

We know that ln(1) =0, ln(0.7)= about -0.35667, ln(0.65)= about -0.43078.

0.68 is between 0.65 and 0.7. Let's compute ln(0.68) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Taylor series expansion of ln(x) around x=1.

ln(x) ≈ (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - ... 

But maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, using a calculator:

ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248.

So, λ ≈ 0.0038566248 per minute.

Now, for t=150 minutes, λt = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.

Compute e^-0.57849372.

We can use the fact that e^-0.57849372 = 1/(e^0.57849372).

Compute e^0.57849372.

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.8221188.

0.57849372 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Let me compute e^0.57849372.

Using a linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.

At x=0.5, e^x=1.64872.

At x=0.6, e^x=1.8221188.

The difference is 0.1 in x, and about 0.1734 in e^x.

So, for x=0.57849372, which is 0.07849372 above 0.5.

So, the increase in e^x would be approximately (0.07849372 /0.1) * 0.1734 ≈ 0.7849372 *0.1734 ≈ 0.1363.

So e^0.5784 ≈ 1.64872 + 0.1363 = 1.785.

Wait, but wait, that's a linear approximation. Let me see if a better approximation is possible.

Alternatively, use the Taylor series around x=0.5.

Let me take x=0.5 + h, where h=0.07849372.

Then e^{x} = e^{0.5} * e^{h}.

We know e^{0.5}=1.64872.

Compute e^{h} where h=0.07849372.

We can approximate e^h as 1 + h + h^2/2 + h^3/6.

h=0.07849372.

h^2 = (0.0785)^2 ≈ 0.00616.

h^3 ≈ (0.0785)^3 ≈ 0.000483.

So,

e^h ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + 0.00616/2 + 0.000483/6

= 1 + 0.0785 + 0.00308 + 0.0000805

≈ 1 + 0.0816605 ≈ 1.0816605.

So, e^{0.57849372} = e^{0.5} * e^h ≈ 1.64872 * 1.0816605.

Multiplying these:

1.64872 * 1.08 = Let's compute 1.64872 *1.08.

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872,

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.

Sum: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.

And then 1.64872 * 0.0016605 ≈ 0.00273 (approx 1.64872 *0.00166 ≈ 0.00273).

So total e^{0.57849372} ≈ 1.7806176 + 0.00273 ≈ 1.78335.

So, e^0.57849372 ≈ 1.78335.

Thus, e^-0.57849372 ≈ 1/1.78335 ≈ 0.5612.

So, the survival probability is 0.5612, so the decay probability is 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388, or 43.88%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%.

Wait, but wait, looking back, the initial statement was that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, perhaps I should have used the decay equation correctly.

Wait, another thought: the problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays before 100 minutes. So that would be consistent with the formula P = 1 - e^(-λ t). So, yes, that's correct.

So, with the calculation leading to about 43.88%, so 44% is the correct answer. But let me check the options again.

Options are:

A)44%

B)40%

C)52%

D)48%

So, A is 44%, which is what I'm getting.

Wait, but wait another approach. Let me think again about the time.

Wait, the initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, the remaining time is 150 minutes. But the decay is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as starting fresh and waiting 150 minutes. So, in that case, the calculation is correct: 43.88% approx, so option A.

Another thing to check: perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the atom will decay within the next 150 minutes. But perhaps I should compute the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is the same as decay in 150 minutes from now.

Wait, because the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is independent of the time already spent. So the 50 minutes have passed, but the probability of decay in the next 150 is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval.

So, the approach is correct. The answer should be approximately 44%, so option A.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The survival probability, which is the probability that the atom has not decayed by time \( t \), is:

\[
S(t) = e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, we know that the probability of decay after 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using the relationship \( P(100) = 1 - S(100) \), we find:

\[
S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Substituting \( S(100) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} \), we solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
\ln(0.68) = -\lambda \cdot 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we calculate:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The problem states that 50 minutes have already passed without the atom decaying. Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is independent of the previous 50 minutes. Thus, we calculate the decay probability for \( t = 150 \) minutes:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Using approximations or a calculator:

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5612
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388 \, \text{or} \, 43.88\%.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated probability is approximately \( 43.88\% \), which rounds to \( 44\% \). Among the given options:

- **A) 44%**
- **B) 40%**
- **C) 52%**
- **D) 48%**

The closest match is **A) 44%**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, considering it hasn't decayed for some time already. 

Alright, the setup is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, wait, that probably means that the probability of decay (P) after 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. But wait, in radioactive decay, the decay follows an exponential law, right? So the probability of decay is related to the decay constant.

So, the problem states that after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, which is 0.32. So that means P(100) = 0.32. Since P = 1 - S, that would mean S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. 

Wait, but S is e^(-λ *100) = 0.68. So I can solve for λ here. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ *100. So λ = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that.

Calculating ln(0.68) is about ln(2/3) is around -0.405, but exact number: Let me think, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ is 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, maybe I should do this more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68): 

I know that ln(1)=0, ln(e^-0.405)= about 0.68. Wait, e^-0.405 is approximately 0.667, so maybe 0.68 is a little higher. Let me use a calculator approach.

Using a calculator, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. Right, so λ is approximately 0.0038566 per minute.

Now the scenario is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and now we want to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 50 + 150 is 200 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes. But perhaps we should think in terms of the remaining time after 50 minutes.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. So, the decay is a memoryless process. That's a key point. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, starting from now, regardless of how much time has passed before.

Wait, so since we are told that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, we can model this as starting the process anew. Because radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next t minutes depends only on the current time, not on when you started observing.

So, the question is: what's the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So, the time we're considering is 150 minutes from now.

So, the approach is to calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet. Which, because of the memoryless property, is the same as the probability in any 150-minute period.

So, using the decay formula again. The probability P(150) is 1 - e^(-λ *150). But wait, since we've already had 50 minutes pass without decay, the effective time left is 150 minutes. But wait, no, the time is additive. Because the decay process is continuous. So whether you consider the total time as 200 minutes (50 +150), or just 150 minutes from now, the probability would be the same as if you started fresh and waited 150 minutes.

Because of the memoryless property, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if you were to start a new timer. So λ is the same.

So, let me compute the probability.

First, compute λ. From the earlier data, P(100) = 0.32.

So, S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 = e^(-λ*100). So λ = ln(1/0.68)/100 = ln(1.470588)/100.

Wait, because 1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. So ln(1.470588) is approximately 0.3856. So λ ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Now, for the next 150 minutes, the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute λ*150 = 0.003856 * 150 ≈ 0.5784.

So e^(-0.5784) ≈ 0.5612. Wait, because e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6. Let's compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.5784: Let me compute e^-0.5784.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach, but perhaps it's better to do this step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a better approximation. The exact value of λ is ln(1/0.68)/100 = (ln(25/17)) / 100. Because 1/0.68 is 25/17, approximately. Let me compute ln(25/17):

25/17 is approximately 1.470588.

ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.3856, which is correct.

So, λ = 0.3856 / 100 = 0.003856 per minute.

So, for 150 minutes, λ*t = 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.

Now, e^-0.5784 ≈ ?

We can use the Taylor series or remember that e^-0.5784 is approximately 0.561.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it using known values.

We know that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065.

e^-0.6 is approx 0.5488.

e^-0.5784 is about 0.5612, which is between 0.6 and 0.5488. Let me see.

Wait, maybe better to use linear approximation. Let me think: between 0.5 and 0.6.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in x, and the e^(-x) goes from 0.6065 to 0.5488, a decrease of about 0.0577 over 0.1 in x. So, for each 0.01 increase in x beyond 0.5, e^-x decreases by approximately 0.00577.

So, 0.5784 is 0.5 + 0.0784. So, let's find e^-0.5784.

At x=0.5, e^-0.5=0.6065.

For each 0.01 increase in x, e^-x decreases by about 0.577 * 0.01 = 0.00577 per 0.01. So for 0.0784, that's 7.84 steps of 0.01.

So decrease is 7.84 *0.00577 ≈ 0.0452.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0452 = 0.5613.

So, e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.5613, so the survival probability is about 0.5613.

Thus, the probability of decay is 1 - 0.5613 ≈ 0.4387, or 43.87%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I missed a step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can compute λ more accurately.

From S(100) = 0.68 = e^(-λ*100).

So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Compute ln(0.68):

I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me compute ln(0.68).

We know that ln(1) =0, ln(0.7)= about -0.35667, ln(0.65)= about -0.43078.

0.68 is between 0.65 and 0.7. Let's compute ln(0.68) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Taylor series expansion of ln(x) around x=1.

ln(x) ≈ (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - ... 

But maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, using a calculator:

ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248.

So, λ ≈ 0.0038566248 per minute.

Now, for t=150 minutes, λt = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.

Compute e^-0.57849372.

We can use the fact that e^-0.57849372 = 1/(e^0.57849372).

Compute e^0.57849372.

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.8221188.

0.57849372 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Let me compute e^0.57849372.

Using a linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.

At x=0.5, e^x=1.64872.

At x=0.6, e^x=1.8221188.

The difference is 0.1 in x, and about 0.1734 in e^x.

So, for x=0.57849372, which is 0.07849372 above 0.5.

So, the increase in e^x would be approximately (0.07849372 /0.1) * 0.1734 ≈ 0.7849372 *0.1734 ≈ 0.1363.

So e^0.5784 ≈ 1.64872 + 0.1363 = 1.785.

Wait, but wait, that's a linear approximation. Let me see if a better approximation is possible.

Alternatively, use the Taylor series around x=0.5.

Let me take x=0.5 + h, where h=0.07849372.

Then e^{x} = e^{0.5} * e^{h}.

We know e^{0.5}=1.64872.

Compute e^{h} where h=0.07849372.

We can approximate e^h as 1 + h + h^2/2 + h^3/6.

h=0.07849372.

h^2 = (0.0785)^2 ≈ 0.00616.

h^3 ≈ (0.0785)^3 ≈ 0.000483.

So,

e^h ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + 0.00616/2 + 0.000483/6

= 1 + 0.0785 + 0.00308 + 0.0000805

≈ 1 + 0.0816605 ≈ 1.0816605.

So, e^{0.57849372} = e^{0.5} * e^h ≈ 1.64872 * 1.0816605.

Multiplying these:

1.64872 * 1.08 = Let's compute 1.64872 *1.08.

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872,

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.

Sum: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.

And then 1.64872 * 0.0016605 ≈ 0.00273 (approx 1.64872 *0.00166 ≈ 0.00273).

So total e^{0.57849372} ≈ 1.7806176 + 0.00273 ≈ 1.78335.

So, e^0.57849372 ≈ 1.78335.

Thus, e^-0.57849372 ≈ 1/1.78335 ≈ 0.5612.

So, the survival probability is 0.5612, so the decay probability is 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388, or 43.88%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%.

Wait, but wait, looking back, the initial statement was that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, perhaps I should have used the decay equation correctly.

Wait, another thought: the problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays before 100 minutes. So that would be consistent with the formula P = 1 - e^(-λ t). So, yes, that's correct.

So, with the calculation leading to about 43.88%, so 44% is the correct answer. But let me check the options again.

Options are:

A)44%

B)40%

C)52%

D)48%

So, A is 44%, which is what I'm getting.

Wait, but wait another approach. Let me think again about the time.

Wait, the initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, the remaining time is 150 minutes. But the decay is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as starting fresh and waiting 150 minutes. So, in that case, the calculation is correct: 43.88% approx, so option A.

Another thing to check: perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the atom will decay within the next 150 minutes. But perhaps I should compute the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is the same as decay in 150 minutes from now.

Wait, because the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is independent of the time already spent. So the 50 minutes have passed, but the probability of decay in the next 150 is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval.

So, the approach is correct. The answer should be approximately 44%, so option A.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The survival probability, which is the probability that the atom has not decayed by time \( t \), is:

\[
S(t) = e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, we know that the probability of decay after 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using the relationship \( P(100) = 1 - S(100) \), we find:

\[
S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Substituting \( S(100) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} \), we solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
\ln(0.68) = -\lambda \cdot 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we calculate:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The problem states that 50 minutes have already passed without the atom decaying. Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is independent of the previous 50 minutes. Thus, we calculate the decay probability for \( t = 150 \) minutes:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Using approximations or a calculator:

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5612
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388 \, \text{or} \, 43.88\%.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated probability is approximately \( 43.88\% \), which rounds to \( 44\% \). Among the given options:

- **A) 44%**
- **B) 40%**
- **C) 52%**
- **D) 48%**

The closest match is **A) 44%**.
