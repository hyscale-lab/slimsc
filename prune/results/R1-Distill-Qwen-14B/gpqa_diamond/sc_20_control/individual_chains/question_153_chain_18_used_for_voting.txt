Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reactions, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts (A, B, C) and four options to choose from. I need to figure out what each reaction produces and match them with the options.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This addition is conjugate addition, meaning the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, leading to the formation of an enolate intermediate. The product typically is a larger conjugated system.

Looking at the first reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it's probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid. Its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, no—the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; but with the substituent on the third carbon? Wait, the formula would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, but the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. Oh, so maybe it's CH2=CH-C-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think. The structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? Or is the double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent on C3 is the p-tolyl? So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the substituent on C3 being a p-tolyl group.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it can form an enolate. Wait, no, in the Michael reaction, the enolate acts as the nucleophile. Oh wait, so dimethyl malonate would generate the enolate when treated with a base. So, the base (NaOEt) deprotonates the alpha position of dimethyl malonate, forming an enolate. Then, this enolate attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate).

So the acrylate has a conjugated system: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the carbonyl is on C3 (since it's an acrylate ester, R-CH2-CH2-COOR? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So in (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OEt with a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, but the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So the carbonyl is on C3, so the substituent is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Hmm, no, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to write the structure correctly.

The correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. Wait, no. Because acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. If the substituent is on the third carbon, but wait, the acrylate is a three-carbon chain: CH2-CH2-COOR, but with the double bond between the first and second. So the third carbon is the carbonyl. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be a substituent on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon? That doesn't make sense because carbonyl is a double bond. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is on the second carbon? No, because the numbering is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituent on C3 is the next carbon after the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. That would mean that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has the p-tolyl group, and C3 is the carbonyl. Wait, that makes sense. So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOEt? No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOEt. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the structure again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt. Wait, no, because the acrylate is an ester, so the carbonyl is at the end. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt, but with a p-tolyl group on the second carbon (the CH2 group). So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. That would make sense. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the substituent (p-tolyl) is on the second carbon, and the third is the carbonyl with the ester group.

So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position (the CH2 in CH2=CH-C(O)OEt), the attack would occur on the second carbon of the acrylate. Wait, no, the beta position is the next carbon after the carbonyl. Wait, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt. So the carbonyl is on C3, and the double bond is C1 and C2. So the alpha and beta positions relative to the carbonyl are C2 and C1. Wait, no, in the carbonyl group, the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent. So for C=O, the alpha carbon is the one attached to the carbonyl (C2 in this case). The beta would be the next one (C1). Hmm, but wait, the numbering might be different based on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl on C2. The carbonyl is on C3. So the alpha carbon is C2 (attached to the carbonyl), and the beta is C1.

Wait, so the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. So the double bond is between C1 (CH2) and C2 (C(p-tolyl)), and the carbonyl is on C3 (COOEt).

In that case, the alpha and beta positions are C2 and C1. So the enolate would attack the beta position (C1) of the acrylate.

But wait, in the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the attack would be on the C1, which is the beta position relative to the carbonyl.

So the enolate of dimethyl malonate (which is a diester) would attack the acrylate at the beta (C1) position.

Let me think about the structure of dimethyl malonate. It's CH2(COOEt)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would form at the central CH2, leading to a conjugated base: [CH2- C(-OEt)2]- with a negative charge on the central carbon.

So when this enolate attacks the acrylate at the beta position (C1), it would add across the double bond. The attack would be on the less substituted end, perhaps, due to the E stereochemistry.

Wait, but the reaction is in E conditions. So the acrylate is E, meaning the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite. So in the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt, the substituents on either end of the double bond (C1 and C2) are a H and a p-tolyl group, respectively. So for the E configuration, the H on C1 and the p-tolyl on C2 would be opposite each other.

So when the enolate attacks the C1 (beta) position, it would add across the double bond. The enolate would approach from the less hindered side, leading to the correct stereochemistry.

After the attack, the double bond would open, and the enolate would form a new bond. So the product would have the two parts connected: the enolate (from malonate) and the acrylate.

Wait, actually, the product would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So the structure after attack would have the new substituent from the enolate attached to the C1, and the p-tolyl group on C2.

Wait, let me try to draw this out in my mind. The enolate is the conjugate base of dimethyl malonate, which is CH2(COOEt)2. When the enolate attacks, the nucleophile (the enolate's carbon) attacks the beta carbon (C1) of the acrylate. So the enolate's carbon (which is the central CH2 in the malonate) attacks the C1 of the acrylate.

So after attack, the structure would have the enolate's CH2 connected to the C1 of the acrylate, which is connected to the C2 (p-tolyl) and the COOEt group.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a larger ester. So the malonate's CH2 would add to the C1 of the acrylate, resulting in a new compound where the two parts are connected, and the COOEt groups are still present.

Wait, perhaps the product would be something like the enolate attacking the acrylate, leading to a new structure where the two are connected. So, after the attack, the product would be a tricarboxylate ester.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. The acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. The enolate would attack the acrylate's C1, adding the CH2 from the enolate to that position, leading to a new structure where the CH2 from the enolate is attached to the acrylate's C1. So the product would have a structure like CH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)COOEt, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps after the attack, the two molecules combine. The Malonate's CH2 would be added to the C1 of the acrylate, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)COOEt, but with the enolate's COOEt groups attached as well.

Wait, no, perhaps the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Wait, let's think about that. The product would have three ester groups. How?

If dimethyl malonate (which has two ester groups) adds to the acrylate (which has one ester group), then the product would have three ester groups.

The structure would be something like CH2-COOEt attached to CH2, which is attached to the rest.

Wait, perhaps the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

So, the central carbon (originally from dimethyl malonate's CH2) connects to two COOEt groups and the new substituent from the acrylate.

The acrylate part would contribute the p-tolyl group and the COOEt. So the product would be a tricarboxylate, with two ester groups from the malonate and one from the acrylate.

Wait, but wait, how does the numbering work? Let me think about the structure.

The product would have a central carbon connected to two COOEt groups and a CH2 group. The CH2 is attached to the p-tolyl and another COOEt. Wait, no, perhaps it's a three-carbon chain with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is:

OEt
|
O=C-OEt
|
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOEt

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trimethyl ester with a p-tolyl group attached.

Looking at option A: A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

The structure for that would be:

OEt
|
O=C-OEt
C
/   \
CH2   OEt
|
p-tolyl

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricarboxylate where the p-tolyl is on the middle carbon.

So, the product would have three COOEt groups and a p-tolyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction mechanism again.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the acrylate has the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. The enolate from dimethyl malonate (CH2(COOEt)2-) attacks the C1 (beta) position. So the enolate's CH2 would add to C1, breaking the double bond and forming a new single bond.

The resulting structure after attack would have the enolate's CH2 connected to the acrylate's C1, the C2 (p-tolyl) connected to the C3 (COOEt), and the enolate's two COOEt groups.

Wait, so the product would be:

CH2(COOEt)2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt?

No, that can't be right because that would imply four carbons, but the product is a tricarboxylate.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cross between the two starting materials, leading to a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a new molecule where the two esters from malonate are on adjacent carbons, and the acrylate contributes a substituent.

Wait, another approach: the Michael addition of dimethyl malonate to the acrylate would form a new bond between the enolate's carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, the enolate's CH2 would add to the C1 (beta carbon) of the acrylate, which is CH2 in CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt.

So after the addition, the structure would have the enolate's CH2 connected to the acrylate's C1, which is now a single bond.

So the product would have the enolate's two COOEt groups attached to the adjacent carbon (the one that was the alpha position in the malonate). So the structure would be:

COOEt
|
CH2-C(COOEt)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)COOEt

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the product is:

CH2(COOEt)2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)COOEt

But that's a five-carbon chain, which seems unlikely. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricarboxylate where the central carbon is attached to two COOEt groups, a CH2 group, and the p-tolyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

OEt
|
O=C-OEt
|
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOEt

No, that doesn't seem to fit the options. Looking at the options, option A for product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

So that would imply a propane chain (three carbons), with COOEt groups on carbons 1 and 3, and a p-tolyl group on carbon 2.

So the structure would be:

COOEt   COOEt
 \     /
  C   C
   \ /
    C(p-tolyl)
   
Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the structure would be:

COOEt
|
C
/   \
COOEt  CH2-p-tolyl

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

OEt
|
O=C-OEt
|
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOEt

No, that's four carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of carbons. Dimethyl malonate has three carbons (CH2(COOEt)2), and the acrylate has three carbons (CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt). When they undergo Michael addition, the product would combine them. So, the resulting molecule would have five carbons, but the product in option A is a trimethyl ester of a three-carbon chain, which seems confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the product is a tricarboxylate because the enolate adds to the acrylate, and the two ester groups from the malonate and the acrylate's ester combine.

Wait, dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, and the acrylate has one ester. So the product would have three ester groups. So the product would be trimethyl ester, meaning three ester groups attached to a carbon chain.

So, for option A, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So propane has three carbons, with COOEt groups on C1 and C3, and a p-tolyl on C2.

So the structure would be:

COOEt
|
C
/   \
COOEt p-tolyl

So that's a central carbon connected to two COOEt groups and a p-tolyl group.

Wait, that makes sense because the attack would merge the two molecules into a single structure. The CH2 from the enolate would add to the C1 of the acrylate, bringing the two COOEt groups from the malonate onto the same carbon as the p-tolyl.

Hmm, maybe.

So the major product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Looking at the options, option A and B have this for product A. So that narrows it down to options A and B.

Now, moving to reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a cyclic amine. The structure would have a cyclohexene ring attached to the piperidine ring at position 1. So the cyclohexene is a substituent on the piperidine.

(E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, with the E configuration. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, but the nitrile is on C4. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. The E configuration would have substituents on opposite sides, but in this case, the substituents are H and CN on the double bond.

So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN. The E configuration would have the CN on the opposite side of the double bond, but in this case, since it's CH2=CHCH2CN, the substituents are H and CH2CN on either end. Hmm, not sure.

In any case, the reaction is under acidic conditions (H3O+ and MeOH). So the conditions are for a conjugate addition, perhaps. The Michael reaction usually occurs under basic conditions, but sometimes under acidic conditions as well, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question states that when a nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, it's a Michael reaction. So in this case, the nucleophile would attack the β position of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.

But wait, (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with the double bond at position 2. So it's CH3-CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN, with the double bond between C1 and C2.

So the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. So the α position is C2 (CH), and the β is C1 (CH2).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify the structure.

But-2-enenitrile is:

NC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile has the nitrile group on C1, and the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, no: the nitrile is at the end, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN. So the nitrile is at the end (C4), and the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, no: but-2-enenitrile is CH2-CH2-CN, but with a double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but but-2-enenitrile would have four carbons, with the nitrile on C4, and the double bond between C2 and C3.

So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN.

In any case, the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN.

The nucleophile here is likely the piperidine ring. Piperidine is a six-membered amine ring, and when it's attached to a cyclohexene ring, perhaps it can act as a nucleophile.

Wait, but in the presence of H3O+ and MeOH, maybe the conditions are for a conjugate addition, such as a Michael addition.

In this reaction, the nucleophile (from the piperidine) would attack the β position of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.

So the nucleophile (probably a lone pair from the amine) attacks the β carbon (C1) of the enenitrile.

Wait, but the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN. The α position is C2 (CH), and the β is C1 (CH2). So the attack would be on C1.

So the product would have the piperidine group attached to C1, and the rest of the molecule would adjust accordingly.

So the product would be CH2-CH2CN connected to the piperidine-cyclohexene group.

Wait, but what's the exact structure.

Alternatively, the product would be 3-(2-cyclohexenylpiperidinyl)butanenitrile or something similar.

Looking at the options, option B for product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the starting material has a cyclohexene, which upon attack would form a cyclohexyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That would imply that the cyclohexene has been converted into a cyclohexanone (with a ketone group), but under what conditions?

Wait, the reaction uses MeOH and H3O+. Maybe the conditions are acidic, which could lead to some tautomerism or keto-enol tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a six-membered ring transition state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a nitrile with a cyclohexyl group attached. But the options suggest that the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which would have a ketone on the cyclohexyl ring.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about reaction B, but perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Looking at the options, option B for product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

So for reaction B, the product is this.

Now, moving to reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, the product is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and we need to find what C is.

But-3-en-2-one is an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. Its structure is CH2=C(CHO)CH2CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2CO with a double bond.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one would be CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. No, but the numbering is such that the ketone is on C2, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, but that would make it a four-carbon chain with the double bond between C1 and C2, and the ketone on C3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

But-3-en-2-one has four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4, but wait, but-3-en-2-one would have the double bond between C2 and C3, with the ketone on C2.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2-C(O)-CH2. Hmm, I'm getting myself confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2CO with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, but but-3-en-2-one would be:

Structure: CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-R, but I'm not certain. Let me think of it as CH2=CH-C(O)-R, where R is another group.

In any case, the reaction is with KOH in water, so it's a basic condition. This suggests a Michael addition where the enolate of the carbonyl reacts as the nucleophile.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the product has a cyclohexane ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

The 3-oxobutyl group is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2. So the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a ketone on the third carbon.

So the product is formed by the addition of the enolate of the but-3-en-2-one to the cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but wait, the product is formed by C reacting with but-3-en-2-one under KOH and H2O. So C is the nucleophile, and but-3-en-2-one is the electrophilic component.

So the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Thus, C must be the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3-dione is a diketone, and its enolate can form. Under basic conditions (KOH), cyclohexane-1,3-dione would form an enolate, which would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one) in a Michael addition.

So the enolate from the dione would attack the beta position of the but-3-en-2-one.

Thus, the product would have the dione ring with a substituent added at the alpha position (position 2) from the addition.

The substituent would be derived from the but-3-en-2-one. So the substituent would be CH2-CH2-C(O)-R, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is -(CH2)2-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. So when the enolate attacks the beta position (the CH2 of CH2=CH-), the addition would bring the CH2 group from the dione's enolate to the CH2 of the enone.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed by adding the cyclohexane dione's enolate to the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone.

So the product would have the cyclohexane ring with the substituent attached at position 2, which is derived from the but-3-en-2-one.

Thus, C would be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, because that's the starting material that forms the enolate.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, meaning that the starting material for C must be the enolate precursor. So C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options, option C and D have C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Option A and B have C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which I don't think is correct because the product doesn't have an alcohol group.

Wait, the product is a ketone, so the starting material must have been a ketone as well. So C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So for reaction C, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Now, putting it all together:

Looking at the options:

Option A: A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate; B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile; C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but in reaction C, C is the starting material, which is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So option B's C is 2-hydroxy, which doesn't fit.

Option B: A and B as before, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So that would fit reaction C.

So the options are:

Option B: A is the tricarboxylate, B is the butanenitrile with 2-oxocyclohexyl, and C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B says:

A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Yes, that matches all three reactions.

So the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing three Michael addition reactions and determining the correct reactants and products. Here's the breakdown:

### Reaction A: Dimethyl Malonate + Methyl (E)-3-(p-Tolyl)Acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → (A)
- **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOEt)₂) and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (CH₂=C(p-tolyl)COOEt).
- **Mechanism**: Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) deprotonates dimethyl malonate to form an enolate, which acts as a nucleophile. The enolate attacks the β-carbon (C1) of the α,β-unsaturated acrylate. This results in a conjugate addition, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.
- **Product**: The product is a trimethyl ester with three carboxylate groups and a p-tolyl substituent. The structure is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.

### Reaction B: 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)Piperidine + (E)-But-2-Enenitrile + MeOH, H₃O⁺ → (B)
- **Reactants**: 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (a cyclic amine with a cyclohexene substituent) and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₂=CHCH₂CN).
- **Mechanism**: Under acidic conditions (H₃O⁺ and MeOH), the piperidine group acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon (C1) of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond. The reaction proceeds via a conjugate addition mechanism.
- **Product**: The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, where the cyclohexene ring is converted into a cyclohexanone (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.

### Reaction C: C + But-3-En-2-One + KOH, H₂O → 2-(3-Oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
- **Reactants**: Cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C) and but-3-en-2-one (CH₂=CHC(O)CH₃).
- **Mechanism**: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) deprotonates cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form an enolate, which acts as a nucleophile. The enolate attacks the β-carbon (C1) of the α,β-unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one), forming a new carbon-carbon bond.
- **Product**: The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, where the cyclohexane-1,3-dione is substituted with a 3-oxobutyl group at position 2.

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product of Reaction C.
- **Option B**: Correct because:
  - A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (matches Reaction A).
  - B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (matches Reaction B).
  - C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (matches Reaction C).
- **Option C**: Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product of Reaction C.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product of Reaction C.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
