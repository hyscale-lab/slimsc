Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I think that should be a column vector with those three elements. So it's a 3-dimensional vector, probably in a 3x1 matrix. 

The operators P and Q are given as square matrices. The matrix for P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The matrix for Q is diagonal: first row (1, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -1). Oh wait, that's a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The question is: if we measure Q just after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?

Wait, no, the question says, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q.

Wait, no, the order is: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the sequence is P is measured first, then Q. So the measurement of P affects the state, which then is used to measure Q.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. So the process would be: measure P, get a certain eigenvalue, which leaves the system in the corresponding eigenstate of P. Then, measure Q on that new state.

But the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So first, let's find the possible outcomes of P, and how the state collapses when P is measured. Then, for each possible outcome of P, the state collapses, and then we can compute the probability of getting -1 for Q in that new state.

But wait, perhaps it's better to approach it by considering the probabilities step by step.

First, let's find the possible eigenvalues of P and their corresponding eigenvectors.

Wait, the operator P is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, that's a symmetric matrix, so it should have orthogonal eigenvectors.

But perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Let me think: perhaps P is a sparse matrix, maybe with some structure that can make calculations easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the eigenvalues of P. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

Wait, the matrix P is:

[ 0    1/√2    0 ]
[1/√2  0    1/√2 ]
[ 0    1/√2    0 ]

So, to compute the determinant of (P - λ I), it's:

| -λ    1/√2     0    |
|1/√2  -λ     1/√2 |
| 0     1/√2   -λ    |

Calculating this determinant. Let's expand it.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the determinant using the first row.

So, the determinant is:

(-λ) * det( [ -λ   1/√2 ]
             [1/√2  -λ ] )

Minus (1/√2) * det( [1/√2   1/√2 ]
                      [ 0     -λ ] )

Plus 0 * something (so that term is zero).

So, first term: (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ].

Which is (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] = -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) = (λ/2 )

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2 )

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

= -λ^3 + λ 

So the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (λ² -1) =0 → λ = 0, ±1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Similarly, Q has eigenvalues 1,0,-1 as it's a diagonal matrix with 1,0,-1 on the diagonal.

Now, when you measure P, you can get either 1, 0, or -1. Then, the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector of P.

Similarly, when you measure Q, the state can collapse into one of the eigenvectors of Q.

But the problem is: what is the probability that measuring P gives 0 and then measuring Q gives -1.

Wait, but wait: when you measure P first, the state collapses to an eigenstate of P. So the probability of getting 0 for P is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the original state.

Similarly, after getting 0 for P, the state is the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. Then, measuring Q on that state would have a certain probability of getting -1.

So, the steps are:

1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to each eigenvalue, especially for 0.

2. Compute the projection of the initial state onto each eigenvector to find the probabilities for each eigenvalue of P.

3. For the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in P, compute the probability that measuring Q gives -1.

So, let's proceed.

First, find the eigenvectors of P for each eigenvalue.

Eigenvalue 1: P |v> = 1 |v>

So, solving (P - I) |v> = 0.

The matrix P - I is:

[ -1   1/√2    0 ]
[1/√2 -1    1/√2 ]
[ 0    1/√2   -1 ]

We can set up the equations:

- v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2.

(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → substituting v1:

(1/√2)(1/√2 v2) - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (-1/2) v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0.

And the third equation: (1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0 → v3 = (1/√2) v2.

Substituting v3 into the second equation:

(-1/2) v2 + (1/√2)(1/√2 v2) )= (-1/2) v2 + (1/2) v2 = 0. So that equation is satisfied for any v2.

So, from the third equation, v3 = (1/√2) v2.

From the first equation, v1 = (1/√2) v2.

Let me choose v2 = √2 to make the components integers. Then v1 = 1, v2 = √2, v3 = 1.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 is (1, √2, 1). We can normalize it.

Wait, the norm is sqrt(1² + (√2)^2 + 1² ) = sqrt(1 + 2 +1 )= sqrt(4)=2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, √2/2, 1/2).

Similarly, for eigenvalue 0.

So, for eigenvalue 0: solving (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So,

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3)=0 → v1 + v3=0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as row 1, which is v2=0.

So, the eigenvector for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0, and v3 = -v1.

So, let's let v1 = a, then v3 = -a.

So the eigenvector is (a, 0, -a). We can choose a=1 for simplicity, so (1, 0, -1). Let's normalize it.

The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1.

But perhaps for this problem, we only need the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0, since the question is about getting 0 for P.

So, the initial state is the vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me write it as a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

To find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, we need to find the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

The eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

So, the inner product <v|ψ> is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) )= (-2)/√2 = -√2.

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product.

So |<v|ψ>|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. Wait, wait. Wait, (-√2)^2 is 2, but the probability can't be more than 1. So I must have made a mistake, because that suggests a probability of 2, which is impossible.

Ah, wait, no. Because the eigenvector for P=0 is normalized, so the inner product squared gives the probability. So let's compute again.

Wait, the eigenvector is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T. The initial state is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Compute the inner product:

(1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) )= (-2/√2) = -√2.

The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But this is greater than 1, which is impossible because probabilities can't be more than 100%.

Wait, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake in the eigenvector.

Wait, let me recheck the eigenvector for λ=0. So when solving P |v> = 0, we have:

Row 1: (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → v1 + v3=0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: (1/√2) v2=0 → v2=0.

So, the eigenvector can be written as (v1, 0, -v1) = v1 (1, 0, -1).

So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T, which is correct.

So, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Let's express it as a vector:

|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The projection onto the eigenvector v_p0 (for P=0) is:

< v_p0 | ψ > = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) ) = (-1/√2) + (-1/√2) )= (-2/√2) = -√2.

Ah, but wait, the inner product is a complex number (but here, it's real). The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (√2)^2 = 2. But that's 2, which is greater than 1, which can't be right because probability can't exceed 1.

Wait, this suggests that I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't see where.

Wait, perhaps the initial state isn't normalized. Let me check the norm of the initial state.

The initial state is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the initial state is not normalized. Oh wait, that's important! Because the probabilities are based on normalized states.

So, to compute the probability correctly, I should normalize the initial state first.

So, |ψ> is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T, but the actual state vector must be normalized. So perhaps the actual state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). I might have to assume it's already normalized. Let me check: the sum of squares is 6, as before, so the vector has a length of sqrt(6). So unless it's given that the state is normalized, I can't assume that.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

So, the actual state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So, the inner product with v_p0 is:

(1/√2) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) ) + (-1/√2) * (1/sqrt(6)).

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-2) / (sqrt(12)) ) ]

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so this becomes (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/3).

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Then, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector v_p0, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. This is because when you measure P and get 0, the state becomes the corresponding eigenvector.

Now, when measuring Q on this state, what's the probability of getting -1?

The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

The eigenvectors are:

For Q=1: (1, 0, 0)^T.

For Q=0: any vector in the y-z plane, but since Q is diagonal, the eigenvectors are orthogonal. Wait, no, for Q=0, it's actually the subspace where the first and third components are zero. Wait, no, because the matrix Q is diagonal, so the eigenvector for Q=0 is any vector where the first and third components are zero, and the second component can be anything. So the eigenvectors for Q=0 are of the form (0, a, 0)^T, where a is any scalar.

Wait, but in our case, the state after measuring P=0 is v_p0 = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2 )^T.

We can write this as a combination of the eigenvectors of Q.

The eigenvectors of Q are:

|q_1> = (1, 0, 0)^T (eigenvalue 1).

|q_0> = (0,1,0)^T (eigenvalue 0).

|q_-1> = (0,0,1)^T (eigenvalue -1).

So, the state v_p0 can be written in terms of these:

v_p0 = (1/√2)|q_1> + 0 |q_0> + (-1/√2) |q_-1>.

So, when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, or -1.

The probability of getting -1 is the square of the amplitude of |q_-1> in the state, which is (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/2.

So, the overall probability is the product of the probability of getting P=0 and the probability of getting Q=-1 given P=0.

So, overall probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but wait, the options are given as A) 1/2, B) 1/3, C) 2/3, D) 1/6.

So the answer would be D) 1/6.

Let me quickly recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

- State is (-1,2,1), which isn't normalized. I assumed it's normalized to (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1,2,1 ].

- The eigenvector for P=0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ), and the inner product with the initial state gives ( -1/√(2*6) ) *2 → -2/(sqrt(12))= -1/sqrt(3). The square is 1/3.

- The state after P=0 is the eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ), which when expressed in terms of Q's eigenvectors, has components (1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ). So the amplitude for Q=-1 is (-1/√2 ), which squared is 1/2.

Product is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So the answer is D.

The problem involves a quantum system with a given state vector and two observables represented by operators \( P \) and \( Q \). The goal is to find the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The initial state is given as \( | \psi \rangle = (-1, 2, 1)^T \). The norm of this vector is calculated as:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} (-1, 2, 1)^T.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 1, 0, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( P = 0 \) is:

\[
| v_{P=0} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1, 0, -1)^T.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto \( | v_{P=0} \rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v_{P=0} | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} (1) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = | \langle v_{P=0} | \psi \rangle |^2 = (-\sqrt{2})^2 = 2.
\]

However, this result is incorrect because probabilities cannot exceed 1. The mistake arises because the initial state \( | \psi \rangle \) was not normalized. After normalizing \( | \psi \rangle \), the corrected inner product is:

\[
\langle v_{P=0} | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The corrected probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = | \langle v_{P=0} | \psi \rangle |^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the system collapses to the eigenvector \( | v_{P=0} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1, 0, -1)^T \).

### Step 5: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvectors of \( Q \) are the standard basis vectors:

\[
| q_1 \rangle = (1, 0, 0)^T, \quad | q_0 \rangle = (0, 1, 0)^T, \quad | q_{-1} \rangle = (0, 0, 1)^T.
\]

The state \( | v_{P=0} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1, 0, -1)^T \) can be expressed as:

\[
| v_{P=0} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} | q_1 \rangle + 0 | q_0 \rangle + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} | q_{-1} \rangle.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( | q_{-1} \rangle \) in \( | v_{P=0} \rangle \):

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
