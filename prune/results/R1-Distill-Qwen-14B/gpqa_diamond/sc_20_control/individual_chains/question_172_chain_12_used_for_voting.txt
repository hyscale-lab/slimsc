Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think it through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). Oh wait, but here, E_i is the higher energy state because the atoms are excited. So if star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited, that ratio is 2.

Wait, let's get the setup right. Let me denote star_1 and star_2 as two different stars, each with their own temperature T1 and T2. The energy levels in question are E_upper and E_lower. The excitation is the population in the upper level compared to the lower.

So the ratio for star_1 is (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = 2. For star_2, perhaps that ratio is 1, or maybe it's half? Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, no, the problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as much when compared to star_2. So if I think of the ratio in star_1 as 2 times that of star_2's ratio. Wait, wait. Let me read again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Wait, does that mean the population in the excited state is twice as much? So n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2)? Or is it that the excitation (the ratio) is twice as much? Hmm, I think it's the latter. So the ratio of excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, but if I consider the Boltzmann factor, then the ratio depends on the temperature. So for each star, the ratio of upper to lower population is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between E_upper and E_lower. Oh, but wait, in the problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is positive because upper is higher than lower.

In the Boltzmann equation, if we have two states, the ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T) ). So if we look at star_1 and star_2, their respective ratios are:

For star_1: R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )

For star_2: R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

Wait, I'm assuming that the statistical weights g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same element, same energy levels. So g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars.

So the ratio R1/R2 would be [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, wait, let me re-calculate that. So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But the question states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So R1 = 2 R2. Therefore, R1/R2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, wait, let me do that step again. Because the exponent is [ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ].

So ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Hmm, let's rearrange that. Let me write it as:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me see: 

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, because 1/T2 = T1/(T1 T2) and 1/T1 = T2/(T1 T2), so subtracting gives (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting back in:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, I have that. Now, what's the value of ΔE/k?

Wait, the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's the same as k_B (Boltzmann constant) because k_B is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

Oh wait! Because k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k_B * 1 K. Because 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (1 K) = k_B * 1 K.

So ΔE = k_B * (1 K) * (1.0) ?

Wait, not exactly, because 1.38e-23 J is exactly k_B (since k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K). So if ΔE = k_B * (1), because when you multiply by 1 K, you get 1.38e-23 J.

So ΔE = k_B * 1 K.

So substituting back, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (k_B * 1 K / k_B ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

The k_B cancels out, so ln(2) = (1) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which can be written as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly the equation I derived.

So the correct option is D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. The ratio of the populations in the upper and lower energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right),
\]

where \(g_{\text{upper}}\) and \(g_{\text{lower}}\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of the populations in the upper and lower levels are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so \(R_1 = 2R_2\). Dividing the two equations gives:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(R_1/R_2 = 2\), we find:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to \(k_B\) (since \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)). Substituting \(\Delta E = k_B\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
