Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Hmm, let's read the question again.

So, the researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. Both are detected via RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have same masses. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so if Period_1 is P1 and Period_2 is P2, then P1 = P2 /3. So Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, meaning it's closer to its star since the period is shorter for closer-in planets.

The host stars have the same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but their radii are same. But the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Oh wait, so Star_1 (Planet_1's host) has mass M1 = 2 * M2, where M2 is Star_2's mass, right?

Wait, but how does that affect the transit probability? I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The transit probability formula, I think, is something like (R_p + R_s)² / (a²), but wait no, that's the area ratio. Wait, actually, the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's area that would allow a transit when viewed edge-on. So the formula is more like (R_s + R_p) / a, but wait, that's the geometric probability. Wait, no, I think the geometric probability is (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by some function involving the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula correctly. The transit probability, P, is given by (R_p / a)² * ( (R_s + R_p) / (R_s) )² ) or something like that? Or wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet)^2 / a^2, but actually, wait, the formula I'm thinking of is more precise.

Let me think. The probability that a planet transits is approximately the ratio of the size of the star plus the planet to the distance of the planet's orbit, squared, multiplied by the probability that the inclination is just right. Wait, no, that's not exactly right.

Wait, I think the probability P is roughly (R_*/a)^2, where R_* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. But actually, maybe it's (R_p + R_*)^2 / a^2, but no, the planet's size is much smaller than the star's, so R_p is negligible compared to R_*. So, more accurately, the geometric transit probability is (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by the factor that accounts for the alignment of the orbital plane. But wait, the RV method already tells us that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough for the RV signal, but for transits, it has to be perfectly edge-on or close. So perhaps the probability is (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5}, but since both orbits are circular, the e term is 1. So it's (R_star + R_planet)^2 / a^2. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it can be approximated as (R_star / a)^2.

So, the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2.

But wait, we can't really have R_planet not mattering at all, but in reality, the probability is higher if the planet is bigger compared to the star. But in this case, the problem says both planets are Earth-like, so their radii are about the same. So R_p is the same for both planets. So, R_p is a constant, so in the formula (R_p + R_*)^2 / a^2, since R_p is same, the dominant term is R_*, which is same for both stars since the host stars have same radii. So for both planets, R_*/a is the main factor.

Wait, but actually, the star's radius is same, R_s1 = R_s2. So the transit probability for each planet is proportional to (R_s / a)^2 for each. So the question comes down to comparing a1 and a2.

But wait, a is the orbital radius of the planet. How can we find a1 and a2? Because we know the orbital periods (P1 and P2) and the masses of the host stars (M1 and M2). So using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that P^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) a^3. Since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a³. Rearranging, a³ = G M P²/(4 π²). So a = [ (G M P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3).

But G, π are constants, so a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

So, a1 ∝ (M1 * P1²)^(1/3), and a2 ∝ (M2 * P2²)^(1/3).

Given M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So let's compute a1 and a2 in terms of M2 and P2.

a1 ∝ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) )^(1/3)
= (2 M2 * P2² / 9 )^(1/3)
= [ (2/9) * M2 P2² ]^(1/3)

a2 ∝ (M2) * (P2²)^(1/3)
= [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3)

So the ratio a1/a2 is [ (2/9) M2 P2² / (M2 P2²) ) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3).

So a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2. Let's compute 2/9 ≈ 0.222, and cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Because 0.6^3=0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period (so closer in) and a more massive star (which would have stronger gravity, so planet is closer). So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2. So a1 is shorter than a2.

Now, transit probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Since R_s is same for both, (R_s/a1)^2 and (R_s/a2)^2. So the ratio of the probabilities is (a2/a1)^2.

Because, P1 ~ (R_s/a1)^2, P2 ~ (R_s/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

We know a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

So a2/a1 = 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

So (a2/a1)^2 = (9/2)^(2/3) = ( (9^2) / (2^2) )^(1/3) )^2? Wait, perhaps better to compute it as (9/2)^(2/3) = ( (9/2)^(1/3) )^2.

Compute 9/2=4.5. Cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65, because 1.65^3 ≈ (1.6)^3=4.096, 1.65^3=4.49 approximately. So 4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65. So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1/P2 ≈ (a2/a1)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Wait wait, I'm getting that Planet_1's transit probability is about 2.7 times higher than Planet_2's. So if they choose the one with higher probability, they'd pick Planet_1, because higher P.

Wait, but let me double-check. The transit probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Since a1 is smaller than a2, R_s is same for both. So (R_s/a1) is larger than (R_s/a2). So (R_s/a1)^2 is larger than (R_s/a2)^2. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but let me think about that again. If a planet is closer to the star, the transit probability is higher because the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front is higher. Because the orbital distance a is smaller, so the path is narrower, but the star's size is fixed. So a planet with a smaller a has a higher probability of transiting because the ratio R_s/a is larger.

So in this case, a1 is smaller than a2, so (R_s/a1) is larger. So (R_s/a1)^2 is much larger. So P1 > P2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher. So which planet would the researchers choose? They would choose Planet_1, because it's more likely to transit.

Wait, but let me compute the exact ratio.

a1 = [ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ]^(1/3) = [2 M2 P2² / 9 ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3)

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = approx 0.6, as before.

The transit probability is (R/a)^2 for each.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = [1/(2/9)^(1/3)]^2 = (9/2)^(2/3).

Wait, 9/2 is 4.5. So 4.5^(2/3) = (4.5^(1/3))^2.

Cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65, as before. So squared is about 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they'd pick Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability. Hmm, 2.25 is 9/4, which is (3/2)^2. But our calculation is about 2.7 times, so this is not A.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher probability. No, because P1 is higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. Well 1.65 is the cube root of 4.5, but the ratio is (4.5)^(2/3) which is about 2.7, so this is not correct.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher. Yes, that matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait another thing: is the transit probability just (R_s / a)^2, or is there another factor? Because I think the actual formula for the transit probability includes (R_p + R_s)^2 / a^2, but if R_p is much smaller than R_s, then R_p is negligible. But since both are Earth-like, their R_p is about same (Earth's radius).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (R_p + R_s)^2 / a^2. So the transit probability is proportional to (R_p + R_s)^2 / a^2.

But since R_p is the same for both planets, and R_s is same for both stars, then (R_p + R_s) is same for both. Therefore, it reduces to (same numerator) / a^2. So the transit probability is inversely proportional to a squared. So our previous approach is correct.

So yes, the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher, and the ratio is about 2.7 times higher, so option D is correct.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_s\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a\) is the orbital radius of the planet. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are negligible compared to the stars, and the host stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), the transit probability depends only on the orbital radius \(a\).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Radius to Orbital Period
Using Kepler's third law, the orbital radius \(a\) is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left(M \cdot P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

where \(M\) is the mass of the host star, and \(P\) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

Substituting these values:

\[
a_1 \propto \left(2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

\[
a_2 \propto \left(M_2 \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(M_2P_2^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

Taking the ratio of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a^2\). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{0.6}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A:** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not 2.25.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. Planet_1 is preferred, but the transit probability ratio is not 1.65.
- **Option D:** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the transit probability ratio is approximately 2.7.

### Final Answer
The researchers should observe Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability (~2.7 times) compared to Planet_2.

But wait, a is the orbital radius of the planet. How can we find a1 and a2? Because we know the orbital periods (P1 and P2) and the masses of the host stars (M1 and M2). So using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that P^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) a^3. Since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a³. Rearranging, a³ = G M P²/(4 π²). So a = [ (G M P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3).

But G, π are constants, so a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

So, a1 ∝ (M1 * P1²)^(1/3), and a2 ∝ (M2 * P2²)^(1/3).

Given M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So let's compute a1 and a2 in terms of M2 and P2.

a1 ∝ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) )^(1/3)
= (2 M2 * P2² / 9 )^(1/3)
= [ (2/9) * M2 P2² ]^(1/3)

a2 ∝ (M2) * (P2²)^(1/3)
= [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3)

So the ratio a1/a2 is [ (2/9) M2 P2² / (M2 P2²) ) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3).

So a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2. Let's compute 2/9 ≈ 0.222, and cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Because 0.6^3=0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period (so closer in) and a more massive star (which would have stronger gravity, so planet is closer). So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2. So a1 is shorter than a2.

Now, transit probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Since R_s is same for both, (R_s/a1)^2 and (R_s/a2)^2. So the ratio of the probabilities is (a2/a1)^2.

Because, P1 ~ (R_s/a1)^2, P2 ~ (R_s/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

We know a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

So a2/a1 = 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

So (a2/a1)^2 = (9/2)^(2/3) = ( (9^2) / (2^2) )^(1/3) )^2? Wait, perhaps better to compute it as (9/2)^(2/3) = ( (9/2)^(1/3) )^2.

Compute 9/2=4.5. Cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65, because 1.65^3 ≈ (1.6)^3=4.096, 1.65^3=4.49 approximately. So 4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65. So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1/P2 ≈ (a2/a1)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Wait wait, I'm getting that Planet_1's transit probability is about 2.7 times higher than Planet_2's. So if they choose the one with higher probability, they'd pick Planet_1, because higher P.

Wait, but let me double-check. The transit probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Since a1 is smaller than a2, R_s is same for both. So (R_s/a1) is larger than (R_s/a2). So (R_s/a1)^2 is larger than (R_s/a2)^2. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but let me think about that again. If a planet is closer to the star, the transit probability is higher because the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front is higher. Because the orbital distance a is smaller, so the path is narrower, but the star's size is fixed. So a planet with a smaller a has a higher probability of transiting because the ratio R_s/a is larger.

So in this case, a1 is smaller than a2, so (R_s/a1) is larger. So (R_s/a1)^2 is much larger. So P1 > P2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher. So which planet would the researchers choose? They would choose Planet_1, because it's more likely to transit.

Wait, but let me compute the exact ratio.

a1 = [ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ]^(1/3) = [2 M2 P2² / 9 ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3)

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = approx 0.6, as before.

The transit probability is (R/a)^2 for each.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = [1/(2/9)^(1/3)]^2 = (9/2)^(2/3).

Wait, 9/2 is 4.5. So 4.5^(2/3) = (4.5^(1/3))^2.

Cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65, as before. So squared is about 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they'd pick Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability. Hmm, 2.25 is 9/4, which is (3/2)^2. But our calculation is about 2.7 times, so this is not A.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher probability. No, because P1 is higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. Well 1.65 is the cube root of 4.5, but the ratio is (4.5)^(2/3) which is about 2.7, so this is not correct.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher. Yes, that matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait another thing: is the transit probability just (R_s / a)^2, or is there another factor? Because I think the actual formula for the transit probability includes (R_p + R_s)^2 / a^2, but if R_p is much smaller than R_s, then R_p is negligible. But since both are Earth-like, their R_p is about same (Earth's radius).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (R_p + R_s)^2 / a^2. So the transit probability is proportional to (R_p + R_s)^2 / a^2.

But since R_p is the same for both planets, and R_s is same for both stars, then (R_p + R_s) is same for both. Therefore, it reduces to (same numerator) / a^2. So the transit probability is inversely proportional to a squared. So our previous approach is correct.

So yes, the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher, and the ratio is about 2.7 times higher, so option D is correct.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_s\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a\) is the orbital radius of the planet. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are negligible compared to the stars, and the host stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), the transit probability depends only on the orbital radius \(a\).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Radius to Orbital Period
Using Kepler's third law, the orbital radius \(a\) is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left(M \cdot P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

where \(M\) is the mass of the host star, and \(P\) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

Substituting these values:

\[
a_1 \propto \left(2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

\[
a_2 \propto \left(M_2 \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(M_2P_2^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

Taking the ratio of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a^2\). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{0.6}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A:** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not 2.25.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. Planet_1 is preferred, but the transit probability ratio is not 1.65.
- **Option D:** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the transit probability ratio is approximately 2.7.

### Final Answer
The researchers should observe Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability (~2.7 times) compared to Planet_2.

Answer: D
