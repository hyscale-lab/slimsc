Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given. Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of each product.

Wait, right, in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since Pi is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but directions are opposite.

I remember that in such cases, the kinetic energy can be found using the concept of invariant mass or maybe using energy and momentum conservation equations.

So, let's denote the particles as Pi, mu, and nu. Let me write down what I know:

Pi is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. Its rest energy is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the muon and neutrino are moving. Let me denote their energies as E_mu and E_nu. Since a neutrino is massless, its energy is just its momentum times c. But wait, in units where c=1, energy is just the magnitude of momentum. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the neutrino's mass. Oh, right, in this context, the neutrino is considered massless, so its rest mass is zero.

So, energy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Momentum conservation: The total momentum after decay must be zero since Pi was at rest. So, the magnitude of the muon's momentum equals that of the neutrino's, but opposite in direction.

So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Let me denote the muon's energy as E_mu, which is gamma * m_mu c², and its momentum as p = gamma * m_mu v. But since the neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu c = p c.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu. And since |p_mu|=|p_nu|=p, we can say p_nu = p.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (m_mu c²)^2 + (p c)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, in units where c=1, E_mu = sqrt( m_mu^2 + p^2 ), and E_nu = p.

But I'm a bit confused about the units here. Maybe I should work in units where c=1 to simplify things.

So, E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( m_mu^2 + p^2 )

E_nu = p

So, energy conservation: m_pi = sqrt( m_mu^2 + p^2 ) + p.

Hmm, let's write that equation:

m_pi = sqrt(m_mu² + p²) + p.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for p.

Let me denote m_pi = M and m_mu = m. So,

M = sqrt(m² + p²) + p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

M - p = sqrt(m² + p²).

Now, square both sides:

(M - p)^2 = m² + p².

Expanding the left side:

M² - 2 M p + p² = m² + p².

Simplify by subtracting p² from both sides:

M² - 2 M p = m².

Now, isolate p:

-2 M p = m² - M².

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 M p = M² - m².

So,

p = (M² - m²)/(2 M).

Plugging in the numbers:

M = 139.6 MeV,
m = 105.7 MeV.

So,

p = ( (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) / (2 * 139.6) )

Wait, let me calculate numerator first.

Calculate 139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6.

Wait 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 would be a bit less. Let me compute:

(139.6)^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2 *140 *0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, (105.7)^2: 105^2 = 11025. 105.7 is 105 +0.7.

(105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by (2 *139.6) = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Let me see: 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Approximate:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 -279.2= 8096.8. Hmm, but 279.2 *29.7 is?

Wait, maybe better to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.7:

279.2 * 30 = 8376 → subtract 0.3 *279.2=83.76 → 8376 -83.76= 8292.24.

Wait, 279.2 *29.7 = 8292.24.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is 23.43 more than 8292.24.

So, 29.7 + (23.43/279.2) ≈ 29.7 + 0.0839 ≈ 29.7839.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, because earlier I had p = (M² -m²)/(2M).

Wait actually, wait, the units here: since c=1, p is in MeV/c, but since we set c=1, it's just MeV.

Wait, but perhaps I should be careful with units.

Wait, in natural units where c=1, E and mass have units of MeV, and momentum p has units MeV/c. Oh wait, no, I think in natural units, since c=1, momentum would have units of MeV (since E=pc for massless particles). Hmm, maybe better to not get stuck on units and proceed.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but neutrino's energy is p, so E_nu = p = 29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( m_mu^2 + p^2 )

So m_mu is 105.7 MeV, p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So E_mu = sqrt(105.7² + 29.78²) ≈ sqrt( (105.7)^2 + (29.78)^2 )

Calculate 105.7^2 = 11172.49, 29.78^2 ≈ 887.0.

So sum is 11172.49 + 887 ≈ 12059.49.

Square root of 12059.49 is approximately 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the muon's rest energy is already 105.7. So the kinetic energy would be E_mu - m_mu c².

Wait, but in this case, E_mu is about 109.8 MeV, and m_mu is 105.7. So KE_mu is 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but the neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV. So what's the KE of the neutrino? Well, since it's massless, its energy is all kinetic, because rest mass is zero.

So KE_nu = E_nu = 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV. No, because our p is about 29.78, so neutrino KE is ~29.78, muon KE ~4.1.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that's very close to our approximate calculation.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation.

Let me compute (139.6)^2 precisely.

139.6 *139.6:

Compute as (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

(105.7)^2: 105.7 *105.7.

Compute 105 *105 = 11025. 105 *0.7 =73.5, 0.7 *105=73.5, and 0.7 *0.7=0.49.

So (105 +0.7)^2 =105^2 + 2*(105*0.7) +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49= 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by denominator 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So, 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do this division more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 =8376; minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. So 29 times is 8096.8.

Subtract from numerator: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 279.2 * x = 218.87 → x=218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p =29.783 MeV/c.

So E_nu = 29.783 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (105.7)^2 + (29.783)^2 )

Compute 105.7^2 =11172.49.

29.783^2: let's compute 29.78^2.

29.78 *29.78:

= (30 -0.22)^2 =30² - 2*30*0.22 +0.22² =900 -13.2 +0.0484= 886.8484.

So 11172.49 +886.8484=12059.3384.

Square root of 12059.3384:

What's sqrt(12059)? Let's see, 109^2=11881, 110^2=12100.

109^2=11881. 109.8^2= ?

109.8^2= (110 -0.2)^2=110² -2*110*0.2 +0.2²=12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.

But our value is 12059.34, which is 3.3 higher.

So, between 109.8 and 109.9.

Compute 109.8^2 =12056.04.

12059.34 -12056.04=3.3.

Each 0.1 increase adds approximately 2*109.8*0.1 +0.1²= 21.96 +0.01=21.97 per 0.1.

Wait, that's the derivative approach. Alternatively, let me compute 109.85^2.

109.85^2 = ?

(109.8 +0.05)^2 =109.8² + 2*109.8*0.05 +0.05² =12056.04 +10.98 +0.0025=12067.0225.

Wait, wait, that's more than needed. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, no, 109.85^2 is higher than 109.8^2, which is 12056.04.

Wait, perhaps I should do it step by step.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 109.8 + x, where x is small.

We have: (109.8 + x)^2 =12056.04 + 2*109.8 x + x².

We set this equal to 12059.34.

So,

2*109.8 x ≈ 12059.34 -12056.04 =3.3.

So,

219.6 x ≈3.3 → x ≈3.3 /219.6 ≈ 0.015.

So x≈0.015.

So E_mu ≈109.8 +0.015=109.815 MeV.

So E_mu is approximately 109.815 MeV.

Then, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c² =109.815 -105.7 =4.115 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is 29.783 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our calculation.

So the correct answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given as:

- Rest mass of π⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Rest mass of μ⁺: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  

Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the μ⁺ and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of their momenta be \( p \). The neutrino is massless, so its energy is entirely due to its momentum: \( E_{\nu} = p \). The μ⁺ energy is given by \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + p^2} \).

### Energy Conservation
The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved:
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
Since \( E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} \) (the π⁺ is stationary), we have:
\[
m_{\pi} = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + p^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
m_{\pi} - p = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + p^2}.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(m_{\pi} - p)^2 = m_{\mu}^2 + p^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - 2m_{\pi}p + p^2 = m_{\mu}^2 + p^2.
\]
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - 2m_{\pi}p = m_{\mu}^2.
\]
Solving for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2m_{\pi}}.
\]

### Substituting Values
Substitute \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \times 139.6}.
\]
First, calculate \( (139.6)^2 \) and \( (105.7)^2 \):
\[
(139.6)^2 = 19488.16, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6}.
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
The neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The μ⁺ energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + p^2} = \sqrt{(105.7)^2 + (29.78)^2}.
\]
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{11172.49 + 887.0} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The μ⁺'s kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Results
- Kinetic energy of μ⁺: \( KE_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Kinetic energy of neutrino: \( KE_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \)  

### Matching with Options
The closest match is **Option D**: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \).

Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given. Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of each product.

Wait, right, in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since Pi is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but directions are opposite.

I remember that in such cases, the kinetic energy can be found using the concept of invariant mass or maybe using energy and momentum conservation equations.

So, let's denote the particles as Pi, mu, and nu. Let me write down what I know:

Pi is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. Its rest energy is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the muon and neutrino are moving. Let me denote their energies as E_mu and E_nu. Since a neutrino is massless, its energy is just its momentum times c. But wait, in units where c=1, energy is just the magnitude of momentum. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the neutrino's mass. Oh, right, in this context, the neutrino is considered massless, so its rest mass is zero.

So, energy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Momentum conservation: The total momentum after decay must be zero since Pi was at rest. So, the magnitude of the muon's momentum equals that of the neutrino's, but opposite in direction.

So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Let me denote the muon's energy as E_mu, which is gamma * m_mu c², and its momentum as p = gamma * m_mu v. But since the neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu c = p c.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu. And since |p_mu|=|p_nu|=p, we can say p_nu = p.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (m_mu c²)^2 + (p c)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, in units where c=1, E_mu = sqrt( m_mu^2 + p^2 ), and E_nu = p.

But I'm a bit confused about the units here. Maybe I should work in units where c=1 to simplify things.

So, E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( m_mu^2 + p^2 )

E_nu = p

So, energy conservation: m_pi = sqrt( m_mu^2 + p^2 ) + p.

Hmm, let's write that equation:

m_pi = sqrt(m_mu² + p²) + p.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for p.

Let me denote m_pi = M and m_mu = m. So,

M = sqrt(m² + p²) + p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

M - p = sqrt(m² + p²).

Now, square both sides:

(M - p)^2 = m² + p².

Expanding the left side:

M² - 2 M p + p² = m² + p².

Simplify by subtracting p² from both sides:

M² - 2 M p = m².

Now, isolate p:

-2 M p = m² - M².

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 M p = M² - m².

So,

p = (M² - m²)/(2 M).

Plugging in the numbers:

M = 139.6 MeV,
m = 105.7 MeV.

So,

p = ( (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) / (2 * 139.6) )

Wait, let me calculate numerator first.

Calculate 139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6.

Wait 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 would be a bit less. Let me compute:

(139.6)^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2 *140 *0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, (105.7)^2: 105^2 = 11025. 105.7 is 105 +0.7.

(105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by (2 *139.6) = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Let me see: 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Approximate:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 -279.2= 8096.8. Hmm, but 279.2 *29.7 is?

Wait, maybe better to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.7:

279.2 * 30 = 8376 → subtract 0.3 *279.2=83.76 → 8376 -83.76= 8292.24.

Wait, 279.2 *29.7 = 8292.24.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is 23.43 more than 8292.24.

So, 29.7 + (23.43/279.2) ≈ 29.7 + 0.0839 ≈ 29.7839.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, because earlier I had p = (M² -m²)/(2M).

Wait actually, wait, the units here: since c=1, p is in MeV/c, but since we set c=1, it's just MeV.

Wait, but perhaps I should be careful with units.

Wait, in natural units where c=1, E and mass have units of MeV, and momentum p has units MeV/c. Oh wait, no, I think in natural units, since c=1, momentum would have units of MeV (since E=pc for massless particles). Hmm, maybe better to not get stuck on units and proceed.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but neutrino's energy is p, so E_nu = p = 29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( m_mu^2 + p^2 )

So m_mu is 105.7 MeV, p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So E_mu = sqrt(105.7² + 29.78²) ≈ sqrt( (105.7)^2 + (29.78)^2 )

Calculate 105.7^2 = 11172.49, 29.78^2 ≈ 887.0.

So sum is 11172.49 + 887 ≈ 12059.49.

Square root of 12059.49 is approximately 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the muon's rest energy is already 105.7. So the kinetic energy would be E_mu - m_mu c².

Wait, but in this case, E_mu is about 109.8 MeV, and m_mu is 105.7. So KE_mu is 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but the neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV. So what's the KE of the neutrino? Well, since it's massless, its energy is all kinetic, because rest mass is zero.

So KE_nu = E_nu = 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV. No, because our p is about 29.78, so neutrino KE is ~29.78, muon KE ~4.1.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that's very close to our approximate calculation.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation.

Let me compute (139.6)^2 precisely.

139.6 *139.6:

Compute as (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

(105.7)^2: 105.7 *105.7.

Compute 105 *105 = 11025. 105 *0.7 =73.5, 0.7 *105=73.5, and 0.7 *0.7=0.49.

So (105 +0.7)^2 =105^2 + 2*(105*0.7) +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49= 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by denominator 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So, 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do this division more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 =8376; minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. So 29 times is 8096.8.

Subtract from numerator: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 279.2 * x = 218.87 → x=218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p =29.783 MeV/c.

So E_nu = 29.783 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (105.7)^2 + (29.783)^2 )

Compute 105.7^2 =11172.49.

29.783^2: let's compute 29.78^2.

29.78 *29.78:

= (30 -0.22)^2 =30² - 2*30*0.22 +0.22² =900 -13.2 +0.0484= 886.8484.

So 11172.49 +886.8484=12059.3384.

Square root of 12059.3384:

What's sqrt(12059)? Let's see, 109^2=11881, 110^2=12100.

109^2=11881. 109.8^2= ?

109.8^2= (110 -0.2)^2=110² -2*110*0.2 +0.2²=12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.

But our value is 12059.34, which is 3.3 higher.

So, between 109.8 and 109.9.

Compute 109.8^2 =12056.04.

12059.34 -12056.04=3.3.

Each 0.1 increase adds approximately 2*109.8*0.1 +0.1²= 21.96 +0.01=21.97 per 0.1.

Wait, that's the derivative approach. Alternatively, let me compute 109.85^2.

109.85^2 = ?

(109.8 +0.05)^2 =109.8² + 2*109.8*0.05 +0.05² =12056.04 +10.98 +0.0025=12067.0225.

Wait, wait, that's more than needed. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, no, 109.85^2 is higher than 109.8^2, which is 12056.04.

Wait, perhaps I should do it step by step.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 109.8 + x, where x is small.

We have: (109.8 + x)^2 =12056.04 + 2*109.8 x + x².

We set this equal to 12059.34.

So,

2*109.8 x ≈ 12059.34 -12056.04 =3.3.

So,

219.6 x ≈3.3 → x ≈3.3 /219.6 ≈ 0.015.

So x≈0.015.

So E_mu ≈109.8 +0.015=109.815 MeV.

So E_mu is approximately 109.815 MeV.

Then, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c² =109.815 -105.7 =4.115 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is 29.783 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our calculation.

So the correct answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given as:

- Rest mass of π⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Rest mass of μ⁺: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  

Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the μ⁺ and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of their momenta be \( p \). The neutrino is massless, so its energy is entirely due to its momentum: \( E_{\nu} = p \). The μ⁺ energy is given by \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + p^2} \).

### Energy Conservation
The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved:
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
Since \( E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} \) (the π⁺ is stationary), we have:
\[
m_{\pi} = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + p^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
m_{\pi} - p = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + p^2}.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(m_{\pi} - p)^2 = m_{\mu}^2 + p^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - 2m_{\pi}p + p^2 = m_{\mu}^2 + p^2.
\]
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - 2m_{\pi}p = m_{\mu}^2.
\]
Solving for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2m_{\pi}}.
\]

### Substituting Values
Substitute \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \times 139.6}.
\]
First, calculate \( (139.6)^2 \) and \( (105.7)^2 \):
\[
(139.6)^2 = 19488.16, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6}.
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
The neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The μ⁺ energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + p^2} = \sqrt{(105.7)^2 + (29.78)^2}.
\]
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{11172.49 + 887.0} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The μ⁺'s kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Results
- Kinetic energy of μ⁺: \( KE_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Kinetic energy of neutrino: \( KE_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \)  

### Matching with Options
The closest match is **Option D**: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \).
