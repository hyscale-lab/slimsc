Okay, so I have this question about barley genetics and mutagenesis. Hmm, let me read through it again. The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that's not good for food because it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the target gene in these mutants.

The question is which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the idea is that the gene's product (probably a protein) is making this compound, and we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. The options are Mutant 1 to 4, and the choices are A to D.

Looking at the wild-type and mutant sequences. The wild-type starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Each mutant has some changes in the beginning of the sequence, in the first exon area.

I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so mutations in exons can affect the protein structure. But how? The approach is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's product—maybe a nonsense mutation (stop codon) or a frameshift that changes the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild-type:
Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

I see the first part is different. Let's look at the changes. The wild-type sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... and mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Breaking it down:

Wild-type first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C TGG TACT...

Wait, perhaps the nucleotides changed. Let me count positions.

Wait, the entire sequence is a bit long, but the first few bases are important. Let me compare each position.

First, the wild-type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant1 starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Looking at the change: In the wild-type, after ATG, the next few nucleotides are TTTCTCGCT... In mutant1, it becomes TCTACGCT...

Let me write the wild-type and mutant sequences for the first part.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA
Mutant1:    ATG TCT ACG C  GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA

Wait, perhaps the exact change is that at position where wild has TTTCTCGCT, the mutant has TCTACGCT.

Wait, perhaps a substitution. Let me check for possible amino acid changes.

ATG is the start codon, methionine. Then the next codons:

Wild-type: TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc.

Mutant1: TCT (Ser), ACG (Thr), C (but wait, codons are 3 nucleotides. So let me see.

Wait, the mutant starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT... So after ATG, it's TTCTACGCT...

Wait, maybe I should break the sequences into triplets.

Wild-type first part:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

Mutant1:
ATG TCT ACG C G G TACT... Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me line them up.

Wild-type: positions 1-60 (just a guess, but we'll look at the initial part)
Mutant1: same positions.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA

Wait, maybe the change is at the third codon. Let me count the nucleotides.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the presence of a stop codon or a frameshift.

Wait, let me check each mutant for possible frame shifts or new stop codons.

Looking at the wild-type: It ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

Now, let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The last part is TCGCG…TGA. So the only change is in the middle.

Wait, what about the nucleotide changes in each mutant?

Let me write the wild-type and each mutant's first part:

Wild-type exon 1:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

Mutant 1:
ATG TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC ... 

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for where a stop codon occurs earlier.

Because if a stop codon occurs earlier, the protein would be shorter. If the mutation introduces a stop codon in the first exon, the protein might be truncated, which could disrupt its function.

Let me see each mutant's sequence:

Wild-type: Exon 1 starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So the wild-type has a stop codon at the end, which is normal.

Mutant 1: Ends with ...GTCGC…TGA. So the end is same as wild-type except for a C at the end.

Mutant 2: Ends with ...GTCGC...TGA. Wait, same as Mutant 1?

Wait, let me recheck.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the end part is TCGTCGC…TGA.

Hmm, maybe I should look for where the stop codon occurs. Or, perhaps, any new stop codons are introduced in the middle.

Looking at each mutant, perhaps a mutation that introduces a stop codon early would be best.

So, looking for where a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) is introduced before the original stop.

Let me check each mutant's sequence for any occurrences of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle.

Wild-type has the stop at the end.

Mutant1: Let's see.

Mutant1's sequence: The first part is ATG TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC...

Wait, not seeing a stop codon in the middle. The end is GTC GC...TGA.

Mutant2: Same as Mutant1, perhaps? Let me look. Their sequences are different in the middle.

Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

In the middle, after ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG... So, perhaps in the middle, the coding sequence is changed. Does this introduce a stop codon?

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

In mutant3's sequence, the part after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG. So no TGA in the middle.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Hmm, in this case, the sequence is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the stop codon is TGA, which is at the end in the wildtype, but in Mutant4, perhaps it's earlier?

Wait, let's see:

The wildtype's first part: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4's sequence: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, maybe I'm not seeing their exact sequences. Let me write the wild-type and Mutant4's sequences for the region.

Wildtype: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, that doesn't change, but perhaps the change is earlier. Let me see.

Mutant4's sequence: ...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA...

Wait, perhaps the part where it should be GCT GGT in wildtype becomes GCT ACT in mutant4.

Wait, perhaps the sequence in mutant4 is:

...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA...

So the middle part is ACTTCTGT... So, the codons would be:

ACT TCT GTG... So no stop codon there.

Wait, but in Mutant4, perhaps the middle part has a frameshift. No, because the sequences look like they're in triplets. Let me check for any possible frameshifts.

Wait, if a mutation causes a frameshift, it would change the reading frame from the mutation point onwards. But in the options given, the mutations don't seem to have insertions or deletions, just substitutions. So, likely, it's a point mutation that changes an amino acid or creates a stop codon.

So, going back, which mutant has a stop codon introduced in the middle of the coding sequence?

Looking again:

Mutant1: No internal stop codon.

Mutant2: No.

Mutant3: Let me see. The sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG. So, no TGA, TAA, or TAG in the middle.

Mutant4: Let me see. Middle part is ...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Hmm, in terms of codons: ACG (Thr), CTA (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), etc. No stop codons.

Wait, but let me think differently. Perhaps the mutation changes a codon into a stop codon, thus truncating the protein.

Looking at each mutation:

Mutant1: The change is in the second codon.

Wild-type has TTT (Phe) at position 2, then CTC (Leu) at position 3. In Mutant1, position 2 is TCT (Ser), position 3 is ACG (Thr). So, two amino acids changed. No stop codon.

Mutant2: Let's compare:

Wild-type: first few codons are ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T... Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me look again.

Actually, the Mutant2 sequence is:

ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So after ATG, the next few bases are TTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

Wait, perhaps breaking into codons:

ATG TCT AAG C TGG TAC T...

Wait, no. Let me do this step by step.

Mutant2’s first part is: ATG T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T...

Wait, perhaps the second codon is TTT (Phe), third is CTA (Leu), fourth is AGC (Ser), etc.

So, no stop codon in the middle.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So after ATG, the next few are TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is GGT (Gly), sixth is GTC (Val), then ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val). No stop codons.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So after ATG, the next codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (stop).

Wait a second! In Mutant4, the sequence is ...GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, no, let me see:

Mutant4's sequence: ...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATAT...

Breaking into codons:

ACG (Thr), CTA (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), etc.

Wait, but looking for TGA. Oh, wait, in the later part of the sequence, after GTC GT..., it's TGA. So, the stop codon is still at the end. No, that doesn't help.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for any change that introduces a stop codon before the end.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4's sequence changes the 5th codon or so into a stop.

Looking again, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence is ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

But wait, in the wild-type, that region is ...GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

In Mutant4, it's ...GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA... No, that's same as wild-type. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation has caused a premature stop codon earlier.

Wait, perhaps the exons are longer. Maybe I need to look for a stop codon in the early part of the sequence.

Another approach: look for the presence of a stop codon in the middle. Which mutant introduces a stop before the original one.

Looking at the sequences again:

Wild-type: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1: ...ACT TCT GTG TGC...

So, no stop in the middle. Ends with TGA as usual.

Mutant2: ...ACT TCT GTG TGC... So same as Mutant1.

Mutant3: ...ACT TCT GTG TGC...

Wait, no, looking at Mutant3's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So the middle is GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG. No stop.

Mutant4: Let me see the actual letters:

Mutant4's sequence is: ...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into codons:

ACG (Thr), CTA (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), TGA (stop). So, in Mutant4, the 6th codon is TGA, which is a stop. Oh! Because in the wild-type, TGA is the last codon, but in Mutant4, it's in the middle.

Wait, let me count the codons.

Wild-type first part:
ATG (1) TTT (2) CTC (3) GCT (4) GGT (5) ACT (6) TCT (7) GTG (8) TGA (9).

Mutant4's sequence:

ATG (1) TTT (2) TAC (3) GCT (4) ACT (5) TCT (6) GTG (7) TGA (8) ... ?

Wait, no. Let me get the exact order.

Mutant4's sequence is: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... TGA-3’.

Wait, so the first 8 codons are:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. TAC (Tyr)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. ACT (Thr)
6. TCT (Ser)
7. GTG (Val)
8. TGA (stop)

So, after 8 codons, it's a stop. The wild-type would have continued past that. So, this introduces a premature stop codon.

Thus, Mutant4's protein would be truncated, missing the last part. If the anti-nutritional compound is encoded by the latter part of the gene, this might eliminate its production.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene's function is in the first few exons, so disrupting it early would be better.

So, which mutation creates a premature stop codon?

Mutant4's sequence introduces a TGA (stop) in the middle, which would truncate the protein.

So, in the options, option D is Mutant4.

Wait, the options are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4.

So, the correct answer would be D, because it introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

But wait, looking back, Mutant4's sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So, after GTG (Val) comes TGA. So, the 8th codon is TGA. So, the reading frame is maintained until that point, and then stops.

So, this would produce a shorter protein. If the anti-nutritional compound requires the entire protein to be functional, truncating it could disrupt the compound's synthesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene is translated into an enzyme that produces the compound; disrupting the enzyme's structure would stop the compound's production.

Thus, the best bet is Mutant4, which introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional protein. So, the answer is D.

To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (TGA, TAG, or TAA), leading to a truncated and nonfunctional protein. The wild-type sequence and the mutant sequences are analyzed as follows:

### Wild-Type Sequence:
The wild-type sequence starts with:
```
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA-3’
```
The stop codon (`TGA`) is at the end of the sequence.

### Mutant Analysis:
1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATG TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC-3’`
   - Changes: The second codon (`TTT` → `TCT`, Phe → Ser) and the third codon (`CTC` → `ACG`, Leu → Thr) are altered.
   - No premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATG TCT AAG C TGG TAC T-3’`
   - Changes: The sequence differs from Mutant 1 but does not introduce a premature stop codon. The stop codon remains at the end.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG-3’`
   - Changes: The third codon (`CTC` → `TAC`, Leu → Tyr) and subsequent codons are altered, but no premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA-3’`
   - Changes: The fifth codon (`GGT` → `ACT`, Gly → Thr) and the sixth codon (`ACT` → `TCT`, Thr → Ser) are altered. Notably, the eighth codon is now `TGA`, a stop codon, which appears in the middle of the sequence.
   - This introduces a premature stop codon, truncating the protein and potentially disrupting its function.

### Conclusion:
Mutant 4 introduces a premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the middle of the sequence, leading to a truncated protein. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by rendering the gene nonfunctional.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this question about barley genetics and mutagenesis. Hmm, let me read through it again. The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that's not good for food because it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns.

Looking at the wild-type and mutant sequences. The wild-type starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Each mutant has some changes in the beginning of the sequence, in the first exon area.

I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so mutations in exons can affect the protein structure. But how? The approach is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's product—maybe a nonsense mutation (stop codon) or a frameshift that changes the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild-type:
Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

I see the first part is different. Let's look at the changes. The wild-type sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... and mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Breaking it down:

Wild-type first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C TGG TACT...

Wait, perhaps the nucleotides changed. Let me count positions.

Wait, the entire sequence is a bit long, but the first few bases are important. Let me compare each position.

First, the wild-type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant1 starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Looking at the change: In the wild-type, after ATG, the next few nucleotides are TTTCTCGCT... In mutant1, it becomes TCTACGCT...

Let me write the wild-type and mutant sequences for the first part.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA
Mutant1:    ATG TCT ACG C  GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA

Wait, perhaps the exact change is that at position where wild has TTTCTCGCT, the mutant has TCTACGCT.

Wait, perhaps a substitution. Let me check for possible amino acid changes.

ATG is the start codon, methionine. Then the next codons:

Wild-type: TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc.

Mutant1: TCT (Ser), ACG (Thr), C (but wait, codons are 3 nucleotides. So let me see.

Wait, the mutant starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT... So after ATG, it's TTCTACGCT...

Wait, maybe I should break the sequences into triplets.

Wild-type first part:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

Mutant1:
ATG TCT ACG C G G TACT... Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me line them up.

Wild-type: positions 1-60 (just a guess, but we'll look at the initial part)
Mutant1: same positions.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA

Wait, maybe the change is at the third codon. Let me count the nucleotides.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the presence of a stop codon or a frameshift.

Wait, let me check each mutant for possible frame shifts or new stop codons.

Looking at the wild-type: It ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

Now, let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The last part is TCGCG…TGA. So the only change is in the middle.

Wait, what about the nucleotide changes in each mutant?

Let me write the wild-type and each mutant's first part:

Wild-type exon 1:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

Mutant 1:
ATG TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC ... 

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for where a stop codon occurs earlier.

Because if a stop codon occurs earlier, the protein would be shorter. If the mutation introduces a stop codon in the first exon, the protein might be truncated, which could disrupt its function.

Let me see each mutant's sequence:

Wild-type: Exon 1 starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So the wild-type has a stop codon at the end, which is normal.

Mutant 1: Ends with ...GTCGC…TGA. So the end is same as wild-type except for a C at the end.

Mutant 2: Ends with ...GTCGC...TGA. Wait, same as Mutant 1?

Wait, let me recheck.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the end part is TCGTCGC…TGA.

Hmm, maybe I should look for where the stop codon occurs. Or, perhaps, any new stop codons are introduced in the middle.

Looking at each mutant, perhaps a mutation that introduces a stop codon early would be best.

So, looking for where a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) is introduced before the original stop.

Let me check each mutant's sequence for any occurrences of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle.

Wild-type has the stop at the end.

Mutant1: Let's see.

Mutant1's sequence: The first part is ATG TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC...

Wait, not seeing a stop codon in the middle. The end is GTC GC...TGA.

Mutant2: Same as Mutant1, perhaps? Let me look. Their sequences are different in the middle.

Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

In the middle, after ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG... So, perhaps in the middle, the coding sequence is changed. Does this introduce a stop codon?

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

In mutant3's sequence, the part after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG. So no TGA in the middle.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Hmm, in this case, the sequence is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the stop codon is TGA, which is at the end in the wildtype, but in Mutant4, perhaps it's earlier?

Wait, let's see:

The wildtype's first part: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4's sequence: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, maybe I'm not seeing their exact sequences. Let me write the wild-type and Mutant4's sequences for the region.

Wildtype: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, that doesn't change, but perhaps the change is earlier. Let me see.

Mutant4's sequence: ...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA...

Wait, perhaps the part where it should be GCT GGT in wildtype becomes GCT ACT in mutant4.

Wait, perhaps the sequence in mutant4 is:

...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA...

So the middle part is ACTTCTGT... So, the codons would be:

ACT TCT GTG... So no stop codon there.

Wait, but in Mutant4, perhaps the middle part has a frameshift. No, because the sequences look like they're in triplets. Let me check for any possible frameshifts.

Wait, if a mutation causes a frameshift, it would change the reading frame from the mutation point onwards. But in the options given, the mutations don't seem to have insertions or deletions, just substitutions. So, likely, it's a point mutation that changes an amino acid or creates a stop codon.

So, going back, which mutant has a stop codon introduced in the middle of the coding sequence?

Looking again:

Mutant1: No internal stop codon.

Mutant2: No.

Mutant3: Let me see. The sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG. So, no TGA, TAA, or TAG in the middle.

Mutant4: Let me see. Middle part is ...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Hmm, in terms of codons: ACG (Thr), CTA (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), etc. No stop codons.

Wait, but let me think differently. Perhaps the mutation changes a codon into a stop codon, thus truncating the protein.

Looking at each mutation:

Mutant1: The change is in the second codon.

Wild-type has TTT (Phe) at position 2, then CTC (Leu) at position 3. In Mutant1, position 2 is TCT (Ser), position 3 is ACG (Thr). So, two amino acids changed. No stop codon.

Mutant2: Let's compare:

Wild-type: first few codons are ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T... Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me look again.

Actually, the Mutant2 sequence is:

ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So after ATG, the next few bases are TTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

Wait, perhaps breaking into codons:

ATG TCT AAG C TGG TAC T...

Wait, no. Let me do this step by step.

Mutant2’s first part is: ATG T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T...

Wait, perhaps the second codon is TTT (Phe), third is CTA (Leu), fourth is AGC (Ser), etc.

So, no stop codon in the middle.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So after ATG, the next few are TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is GGT (Gly), sixth is GTC (Val), then ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val). No stop codons.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So after ATG, the next codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (stop).

Wait a second! In Mutant4, the sequence is ...GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, no, let me see:

Mutant4's sequence: ...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATAT...

Breaking into codons:

ACG (Thr), CTA (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), etc.

Wait, but looking for TGA. Oh, wait, in the later part of the sequence, after GTC GT..., it's TGA. So, the stop codon is still at the end. No, that doesn't help.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for any change that introduces a stop codon before the end.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4's sequence changes the 5th codon or so into a stop.

Looking again, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence is ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

But wait, in the wild-type, that region is ...GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

In Mutant4, it's ...GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA... No, that's same as wild-type. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation has caused a premature stop codon earlier.

Wait, perhaps the exons are longer. Maybe I need to look for a stop codon in the early part of the sequence.

Another approach: look for the presence of a stop codon in the middle. Which mutant introduces a stop before the original one.

Looking at the sequences again:

Wild-type: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1: ...ACT TCT GTG TGC...

So, no stop in the middle. Ends with TGA as usual.

Mutant2: ...ACT TCT GTG TGC... So same as Mutant1.

Mutant3: ...ACT TCT GTG TGC...

Wait, no, looking at Mutant3's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So the middle is GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG. No stop.

Mutant4: Let me see the actual letters:

Mutant4's sequence is: ...ACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into codons:

ACG (Thr), CTA (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), TGA (stop). So, in Mutant4, the 6th codon is TGA, which is a stop. Oh! Because in the wild-type, TGA is the last codon, but in Mutant4, it's in the middle.

Wait, let me count the codons.

Wild-type first part:
ATG (1) TTT (2) CTC (3) GCT (4) GGT (5) ACT (6) TCT (7) GTG (8) TGA (9).

Mutant4's sequence:

ATG (1) TTT (2) TAC (3) GCT (4) ACT (5) TCT (6) GTG (7) TGA (8) ... ?

Wait, no. Let me get the exact order.

Mutant4's sequence is: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... TGA-3’.

Wait, so the first 8 codons are:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. TAC (Tyr)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. ACT (Thr)
6. TCT (Ser)
7. GTG (Val)
8. TGA (stop)

So, after 8 codons, it's a stop. The wild-type would have continued past that. So, this introduces a premature stop codon.

Thus, Mutant4's protein would be truncated, missing the last part. If the anti-nutritional compound is encoded by the latter part of the gene, this might eliminate its production.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene's function is in the first few exons, so disrupting it early would be better.

So, which mutation creates a premature stop codon?

Mutant4's sequence introduces a TGA (stop) in the middle, which would truncate the protein.

So, in the options, option D is Mutant4.

Wait, the options are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4.

So, the correct answer would be D, because it introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

But wait, looking back, Mutant4's sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So, after GTG (Val) comes TGA. So, the 8th codon is TGA. So, the reading frame is maintained until that point, and then stops.

So, this would produce a shorter protein. If the anti-nutritional compound requires the entire protein to be functional, truncating it could disrupt the compound's synthesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene is translated into an enzyme that produces the compound; disrupting the enzyme's structure would stop the compound's production.

Thus, the best bet is Mutant4, which introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional protein. So, the answer is D.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (TGA, TAG, or TAA), leading to a truncated and nonfunctional protein. The wild-type sequence and the mutant sequences are analyzed as follows:

### Wild-Type Sequence:
The wild-type sequence starts with:
```
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA-3’
```
The stop codon (`TGA`) is at the end of the sequence.

### Mutant Analysis:
1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATG TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC-3’`
   - Changes: The second codon (`TTT` → `TCT`, Phe → Ser) and the third codon (`CTC` → `ACG`, Leu → Thr) are altered.
   - No premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATG TCT AAG C TGG TAC T-3’`
   - Changes: The sequence differs from Mutant 1 but does not introduce a premature stop codon. The stop codon remains at the end.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG-3’`
   - Changes: The third codon (`CTC` → `TAC`, Leu → Tyr) and subsequent codons are altered, but no premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA-3’`
   - Changes: The fifth codon (`GGT` → `ACT`, Gly → Thr) and the sixth codon (`ACT` → `TCT`, Thr → Ser) are altered. Notably, the eighth codon is now `TGA`, a stop codon, which appears in the middle of the sequence.
   - This introduces a premature stop codon, truncating the protein and potentially disrupting its function.

### Conclusion:
Mutant 4 introduces a premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the middle of the sequence, leading to a truncated protein. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by rendering the gene nonfunctional.
