Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember mesons are subatomic particles, usually composed of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles, right? They don't exist for very long before decaying into other particles.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of X. Hmm, decay distance—oh right, that's how far the particle travels before it decays. Since these particles are moving, the distance depends on their lifetime and their speed.

The given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D with values in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Alright, so to find the mean decay distance, I think I need to calculate the lifetime of the meson first. Once I have the lifetime, I can figure out how fast it's moving and then compute the distance.

Wait, mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. I remember something about the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the exact formula is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ would be ħ divided by Γ. Let me verify that. Oh right, because Γ is the energy width, and the uncertainty in energy times uncertainty in time is ħ. So the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, let me think about units. ħ is in units of GeV·s or something? I might have to convert everything properly.

So first, calculate Γ in GeV. Let me see, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Since 1 GeV is 10^3 MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. I think its value is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yes, that's right—since ħ is about 197 MeV·fm, but in GeV units, it's 0.197 GeV·fm, but wait, maybe I should get the exact value.

Actually, the value of ħ in GeV·s is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is about 6.626e-34 J·s. But converting all that might be tricky, but for this calculation, I think I can use ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Let's calculate that.

Dividing 6.582e-25 by 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, let me compute it properly.

Wait, 0.32 GeV is 0.32, so 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = let's see: 0.32 * 20 is 6.4. So 20.56875 (since 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582). So 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but that seems really short. Oh wait, particles with large width decay quickly, which makes sense. Since Γ is 0.32 GeV, which is big, the lifetime is small.

Next, I need to find the speed of the meson. Because the decay distance is speed multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, speed depends on the energy. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV. So I need to find the velocity v of the meson from its energy.

Since the mass of the meson is m_X = 1.2 GeV/c², because E = mc². So m is 1.2 GeV/c².

Wait, energy E is given as production energy. So I can use the relativistic energy equation: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So let's calculate the momentum p.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So (pc)^2 = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 = (64 - 1.44) GeV² = 62.56 GeV².

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = (7.91 GeV) / c.

Now, the momentum p is also equal to gamma * m * v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So:

p = gamma * m * v.

But I can find gamma from E = gamma * m c². So gamma = E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is 6.6667 (which is 20/3).

Now, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm, but I think I can get v from beta = v/c. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and gamma m v = p/(c) * c? Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, beta = v/c = p c / (E) → because p c = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c^2? Wait, perhaps I should express beta as p c / E.

Wait, beta is (v/c) = (p c) / E. Because E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c^2)^2. So pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

Wait, so beta = (p c) / E = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ≈ 0.98875.

So beta is approximately 0.98875. So v is approximately 0.98875 c.

So the velocity v ≈ 0.98875 * c.

Now, the mean decay distance is the product of the velocity, the lifetime, and the speed times the lifetime. So:

distance = v * τ.

So v is 0.98875 c, and τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure about the units.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So putting it all together:

distance = v * τ = (0.98875 c) * (2.056875e-24 s).

But let's compute the numerical value.

First, calculate c * τ: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply by beta (0.98875): 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ let's compute that.

0.98875 is approximately 0.98875, so 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875.

Multiply 6.170625 by 0.98875: let's approximate.

6.170625 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.170625 * (1 - 0.01125) ≈ 6.170625 - 0.0695109 ≈ 6.101114.

So 6.101114e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answers are in the range of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So 6.1e-16 m is close to option D, which is 4.0655e-16 m, but wait, my calculation is about 6e-16. Hmmm. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the lifetime. Let me double-check that step.

Wait, earlier I calculated τ as ħ / Γ. Let me recheck that.

Γ is 0.32 GeV. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, that seems correct.

Then, the speed was beta c, which was about 0.98875c.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

Wait, let's do a more precise calculation for beta.

The exact value of (pc) = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56). Let me compute sqrt(62.56).

Well, 7.9^2 is 62.41. 7.91^2 is (7.9 +0.01)^2 = 62.41 + 2*7.9*0.01 + 0.0001 = 62.41 + 0.158 + 0.0001=62.5681. So sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

So pc =7.91 GeV.

So beta = (pc)/(E) = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So beta is exactly 0.98875.

So beta is 0.98875.

So v = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So distance is v * τ.

v is 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by τ: 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply 2.96625 * 2.056875 to get the coefficient, and then add exponents.

2.96625 * 2.056875. Let's compute this more accurately.

2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325.

2.96625 * 0.056875 = let's compute:

0.056875 is approximately 0.056875.

2.96625 * 0.05 = 0.1483125

2.96625 * 0.006875 = 0.0203515625

Adding them: 0.1483125 + 0.0203515625 ≈ 0.1686640625.

So total is 5.9325 + 0.1686640625 ≈ 6.1011640625.

So the coefficient is approximately 6.1011640625, and the exponents: 1e8 *1e-24 = 1e-16.

So distance is approximately 6.10116e-16 meters.

But looking at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, none of the options match 6.1e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, I thought that Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But wait, is it Γ = ħ / τ? Or is it Γ = ħ * τ^{-1}?

Yes, because the uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for a particle, Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But perhaps I should use inverse. Let me think.

Wait, in natural units where ħ = c =1, Γ is the width in energy (GeV), and τ is the lifetime in inverse energy. So to convert τ into seconds, we have to multiply by ħ (since τ [s] = τ [GeV^-1] * ħ [GeV s] ).

So τ (s) = ħ (GeV s) * τ (GeV^-1) = ħ / Γ.

Yes, so the calculation I did was correct.

Wait, perhaps I had a mistake in miscalculating the coefficient.

Wait, 6.10116e-16 m is about 6.1e-16 m.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.0223 *1e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

But my calculation is 6.1e-16, which isn't any of the options. Hmm.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check each step again.

First, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

p c = sqrt(8² -1.2²) = sqrt(64-1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV. Correct.

Beta = pc/E =7.91/8=0.98875. Correct.

v= beta c =0.98875 *3e8 m/s=2.96625e8 m/s.

distance= v * τ =2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

2.96625e8 *2.056875e-24= (2.96625 *2.056875 )e(8-24)=6.101e-16 meters.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta.

Wait, another approach to compute beta: beta = (p c)/(E) → beta = (sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 )) / (E c^2) ) → but perhaps I'm mixing units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² )).

Which is another way to compute it. Let's try that.

m c² =1.2 GeV.

E=8 GeV.

So 1 - (1.2)^2 /8^2 = 1 - 1.44/64 = 1 -0.0225=0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.

Which matches the earlier calculation of beta as 0.98875. So that's correct.

Hmm. So why am I getting 6.1e-16, but the options have answers close to 4e-16 or 5e-15.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the resonance is a virtual particle, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length is calculated using the mean lifetime and the velocity, but perhaps I should use the speed in terms of beta multiplied by c, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should include the gamma factor. Because the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Wait, the mean lifetime τ is the proper lifetime, measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime is longer by the gamma factor. Oh wait wait no! Because in relativity, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the proper lifetime is tau_0, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

Wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake here. Because in the rest frame of the meson, the lifetime is tau. But when it's moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the mean decay distance is v multiplied by gamma tau.

Wait! Oh no, that's probably where I messed up. Because the lifetime I calculated is the proper lifetime (tau), but in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

Ah, that's a crucial point. So the correct formula for the mean decay distance is L = v * gamma * tau.

Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the tau I calculated earlier is the proper lifetime. So the lifetime as seen in the lab is gamma * tau.

So I should have used L = v * gamma * tau.

So let's recompute with that in mind.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So tau_lab = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, v is 0.98875 c = 2.96625e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau_lab = 2.96625e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.96625 * 1.37125, and then exponents 1e8 *1e-23=1e-15.

Compute 2.96625 *1.37125.

Let me compute:

2 *1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.96625 *1.37125: let's see.

0.9 *1.37125=1.234125.

0.06625 *1.37125≈0.09103.

So total 1.234125 + 0.09103≈1.32515.

Adding to 2.7425: 2.7425+1.32515≈4.06765.

So 4.06765e-15 meters.

Wait, so approximately 4.068e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, my calculation gives 4.068e-15, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me recheck all the steps because I had to correct myself earlier.

So the proper lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma.

But I think I confused the lab frame lifetime and the proper lifetime. So the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

Yes, because from the lab's perspective, the particle is moving, so its lifetime is longer by gamma.

So I should have multiplied the proper lifetime by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime.

So the correct decay distance is v multiplied by gamma tau.

So using that:

v = beta c.

gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666...

tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma tau =6.666666... * 2.056875e-24 = approx 1.37125e-23 s.

v = 0.98875 *3e8 m/s =2.96625e8 m/s.

distance = v * gamma tau = 2.96625e8 m/s *1.37125e-23 s.

= (2.96625 *1.37125 )e(8-23) m.

Calculate 2.96625 *1.37125.

Let me compute that precisely:

2.96625 *1.37125.

Break it down:

2 *1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.96625 *1.37125.

Compute 0.96625 *1 = 0.96625.

0.96625 *0.3 = 0.289875.

0.96625 *0.07 = 0.0676375.

0.96625 *0.00125 = 0.0012078125.

Adding these:

0.96625 +0.289875=1.256125

+0.0676375=1.3237625

+0.0012078125≈1.3249703125.

So 0.96625 *1.37125 ≈1.32497.

So total 2.7425 +1.32497=4.06747.

So 4.06747e-15 meters.

Which rounds to approximately 4.0675e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of gamma tau.

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666... (exactly 20/3).

tau is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875e-24) /3.

20 *2.056875e-24 =41.1375e-24 = 4.11375e-23.

Divided by 3: 4.11375e-23 /3 = 1.37125e-23 s. So correct.

v is 0.98875 *3e8 =2.96625e8 m/s.

So 2.96625e8 *1.37125e-23 = 4.06747e-15 m.

So the closest option is B)4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but why is the exact value a bit different? Let me think if perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ and other constants.

The value of ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

But sometimes it's taken as 6.582×10^-25 or perhaps 6.5823×10^-25.

If I use more precise value, perhaps the result would be closer to option B.

Let me recalculate tau with more precise ħ.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.5823e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.5823e-25 / 0.32 = 2.05696875e-24 s.

Then, gamma tau = (20/3) *2.05696875e-24 = (20 *2.05696875e-24)/3.

20 *2.05696875e-24 =41.139375e-24 =4.1139375e-23.

Divide by 3: 4.1139375e-23/3=1.3713125e-23 s.

v =0.98875 *3e8 m/s=2.96625e8 m/s.

distance =2.96625e8 m/s *1.3713125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.96625 *1.3713125.

Let me compute that:

2.96625 *1.3713125.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator approach.

2.96625 *1.3713125 = ?

Let me break it down:

2 *1.3713125 = 2.742625.

0.96625 *1.3713125.

Compute 0.9 *1.3713125=1.23418125.

0.06625 *1.3713125= 0.09107666015625.

Adding these: 1.23418125 +0.09107666015625=1.32525791015625.

So total 2.742625 +1.32525791015625=4.06788291015625.

So distance =4.06788291e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0679e-15 m.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So perhaps minor differences come from more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used more precise beta.

Wait, beta can be calculated more precisely.

We have beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

m^2= (1.2)^2 =1.44.

E^2=64.

So 1 -1.44/64= (64-1.44)/64=62.56/64=0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.

Wait, exact value:

0.9775 → find square root.

I know that 0.988^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2*(0.98)(0.008) + (0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 +0.000064=0.976144. Hmm, that's under 0.9775.

Wait, 0.988^2 = (0.988)(0.988).

Let me compute it:

988 *988.

Well, 1000^2=1e6.

(1000-12)^2=1e6 - 2*12*1e3 +12^2=1e6 -24e3 +144=976000 +144=976144.

So 0.988^2=0.976144.

Which is less than 0.9775.

So let's find x such that (0.988 + x)^2 =0.9775.

Approximate x using linear approximation.

(0.988 +x)^2 ≈ 0.976144 + 2 *0.988 *x =0.9775.

2*0.988 *x=0.9775 -0.976144=0.001356.

So x=0.001356/(2*0.988) ≈0.001356/(1.976)= approx 0.000686.

So 0.988 +0.000686=0.988686.

So beta ≈0.988686.

So beta is approximately 0.988686.

So let me recompute v as beta c.

v =0.988686 *3e8=2.966058e8 m/s.

Then, distance =v * gamma tau.

gamma tau is 1.3713125e-23 s.

So 2.966058e8 *1.3713125e-23 = (2.966058 *1.3713125 )e(8-23).

2.966058 *1.3713125.

Let me compute 2.966058 *1.3713125.

Break it down:

2 *1.3713125 =2.742625.

0.966058 *1.3713125.

Compute 0.9 *1.3713125=1.23418125.

0.066058 *1.3713125= approx 0.09063.

So 1.23418125 +0.09063=1.32481125.

Total: 2.742625 +1.32481125=4.06743625.

So approximately 4.0674e-15 m.

Which is still approximately 4.067e-15 m.

So the closest option is B)4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps the options use more precise values for ħ, such as 6.582×10^-25, but perhaps the exact value is 6.582374e-25 GeV s.

Let me compute using ħ=6.582374e-25.

Tau =6.582374e-25 /0.32.

6.582374 /0.32 =20.56991875.

So tau=20.56991875e-25 s=2.056991875e-24 s.

gamma tau = (20/3) *2.056991875e-24 = (20 *2.056991875e-24)/3.

20 *2.056991875=41.1398375 → 41.1398375e-24=4.11398375e-23.

Divide by 3:4.11398375e-23/3=1.371327917e-23 s.

v=0.988686 *3e8=2.966058e8 m/s.

distance=2.966058e8 *1.371327917e-23 = (2.966058 *1.371327917 )e(8-23).

Compute 2.966058 *1.371327917.

Let me compute step by step:

2.966058 *1.371327917.

Break it down:

= (2 + 0.966058) * (1 + 0.371327917)

= 2*1 + 2*0.371327917 + 0.966058*1 + 0.966058 *0.371327917.

Which is 2 + 0.742655834 +0.966058 + 0.358518216.

Adding all terms:

2 + 0.742655834=2.742655834.

+0.966058=3.708713834.

+0.358518216≈4.06723205.

So 2.966058 *1.371327917≈4.067232e-15 m.

Which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m) but slightly higher. Hmm. So perhaps the exact calculation would give 4.067e-15, but perhaps the options have rounded it.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation expects us to not include the gamma factor. Wait, that would bring us back to the earlier 6.1e-16 m, but that's not an option.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to include the gamma factor, so option B would be the correct answer.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information and Formulas
1. **Given Data**:
   - Production energy: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Mass: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)
   - Decay width: \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)

2. **Mean Lifetime**:
   The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]
   Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy and Momentum**:
   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:
   \[
   E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2
   \]
   Solving for \( pc \):
   \[
   pc = \sqrt{E^2 - (m_X c^2)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

4. **Velocity**:
   The velocity \( v \) is determined by the ratio \( \beta = \frac{pc}{E} \):
   \[
   \beta = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875
   \]
   Thus, \( v = \beta c = 0.98875 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} = 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

5. **Mean Decay Distance**:
   The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:
   \[
   L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
   \]
   where \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau \) is the lifetime in the lab frame, and \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m_X c^2} \). Calculating \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
   \]
   Finally:
   \[
   L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.96625 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
   \]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**, with minor differences likely due to rounding or slight variations in constants.

### Final Answer
**Answer: B**
