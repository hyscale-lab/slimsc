Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let's take it step by step. 

Alright, the question is about a star with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and it's got an effective temperature of 6000 K. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. The problem says that because of these spots, the star's brightness changes as it rotates, and this looks similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The task is to find out what the radius of such a planet would be to produce the same brightness variation.

Hmm. So, I think this is about the change in brightness, or the dip in light, when a planet transits the star. Normally, when a planet passes in front, it blocks some of the star's light, so we see a dip proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. But in this case, the star has spots, so the brightness variation is due to parts of the spotted hemisphere rotating into and out of view.

Wait, but the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would give the same amplitude. So we need to compare the amplitude caused by the spots to what a planet would cause.

I remember that the relative change in brightness when a planet transits is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But in this case, the star has spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side (as the star rotates), the observed brightness decreases because the spots contribute less light. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The problem states that the spots have a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface (since it's a hemisphere), and the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, then the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) )? Or maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the total star's surface covered by spots. Hmm, wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%". Oh, so the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². Half of that is the hemisphere, which is 2π R². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere). The area of the hemisphere is 2π R². So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Right. Now, the star's total light is the sum of all the surface emitting. When the spots are on the visible side, their contribution is less, so the total brightness decreases.

The star's total luminosity is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But when there are spots, the effective temperature of the spots is lower. Let me think.

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. Since the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spot temperature is 5000 K.

The brightness variation comes from the fact that when the spotted region is on the day side, the observed flux is lower. The total flux when the spots are visible is the normal flux minus the flux emitted by the spotted area.

Wait, maybe we should calculate the fractional change in brightness when the spots are on the visible side versus when they're not.

So, the star's normal flux without any spots is F = σ T_eff^4.

But when the spots are present on the hemisphere, the flux from that side is a bit less. Let me model this.

The total flux when the star is viewed with the spots is:

F_total = (1 - f) * F_normal + f * F_spot,

where f is the filling factor (0.2), and F_spot is the flux per unit area from the spots.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the spots are cooler, each spot emits F_spot = σ (T_spot)^4. So the contribution from the spots is f * (F_spot / F_normal) times the area they cover.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the flux from the entire star, considering the spots. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_visible = (normal area without spots) * F_normal + (spotted area) * F_spot.

Wait, the star's entire surface is 4π R². When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is the night side, which we don't see. So the visible area is the hemisphere, which is 2π R². Of that, 0.2 * 2π R² is spotted, and the rest is normal.

So, F_visible = [ (2π R² - 0.2 * 2π R²) ] * F_normal + [ 0.2 * 2π R² ] * F_spot.

Simplifying that:

F_visible = (0.8 * 2π R²) * F_normal + (0.2 * 2π R²) * F_spot.

F_visible = 2π R² [ 0.8 F_normal + 0.2 F_spot ].

The star's normal flux without any spots (F0) would be when the hemisphere without spots is viewed. Wait, no. Wait, normally, when the star isn't being modulated by spots, it would have the same average flux. But perhaps in this scenario, the average flux is F_avg = 2π R² F_normal, since the other hemisphere could be the night side (which doesn't contribute), but wait, stars emit from their entire surface. Hmm, maybe I should think of the star as having two hemispheres: one with spots (f=0.2) and one without.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible, and when the unspotted is visible, and find the difference.

Wait, no. The star is rotating, so the spots come into view and go out of view. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux we receive will be lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. The star's entire surface emits. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, part of it is cooler. So the total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas (which are at Teff) and the spotted areas (which are cooler).

But the star is a sphere, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is the night side, which is not emitting. So the total flux we receive is from the hemisphere we can see.

So, the total flux when the star shows the spotted hemisphere is:

F_spotted = (1 - f) * F_normal * (area of hemisphere) + f * F_spot * (area of hemisphere).

Wait, no, because for each point on the hemisphere, if it's a spot, it contributes F_spot, else it contributes F_normal.

So, the area of the hemisphere is 2π R². The area of spots is f * 2π R². So,

F_spotted = ( (2π R²) * F_normal ) * (1 - f) + (f * 2π R²) * F_spot.

Which is F_spotted = 2π R² [ (1 - f) F_normal + f F_spot ].

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F_unspotted = 2π R² F_normal.

So the change in flux is ΔF = F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2π R² [ F_normal ( (1 - f) + f ) - F_normal (1 - f) - f F_spot ) ].

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the fractional change.

The fractional change in brightness is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

So, F_unspotted = 2π R² F_normal.

F_spotted = 2π R² [ (1 - f) F_normal + f F_spot ].

So the difference is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2π R² [ F_normal - ( (1 - f) F_normal + f F_spot ) ].

= 2π R² [ F_normal (1 - (1 - f)) - f F_spot ) ]

= 2π R² [ F_normal * f - f F_spot ]

= 2π R² f ( F_normal - F_spot )

So, the fractional change is [ 2π R² f (F_normal - F_spot) ] / [ 2π R² F_normal ]

= f ( F_normal - F_spot ) / F_normal

= f [ (F_normal - F_spot) / F_normal ]

= f [ 1 - (F_spot / F_normal) ]

So the fractional change is f [ 1 - (F_spot / F_normal) ]

Wait, F_spot is the flux per unit area from the spots, which is σ T_spot^4.

F_normal is σ T_eff^4.

So, F_spot / F_normal = (T_spot / T_eff)^4.

T_spot is 5000 K, T_eff is 6000 K.

So, (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

Calculating that: 0.8333^2 is about 0.6944, squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So, F_spot / F_normal ≈ 0.4823.

So, 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So, fractional change is f * 0.5177.

f is 0.2.

So, 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% fractional decrease.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the observed brightness variation is due to the spots, and we want to compare it to a planet transit.

In the case of a planet transiting, the fractional change is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

But wait, in the planet case, the change is when the planet blocks part of the star. The area blocked is π Rp², so the fractional area is π Rp² / (4π Rstar²) ) = (Rp²)/(4 Rstar²) ) = (Rp/(2 Rstar))^2. Wait, no, wait. The area of the planet's disk is π Rp². The area of the star is π Rstar², but wait, no, the star's area is 4π Rstar² (surface area), but when a planet transits, it blocks a circle of area π Rp². So the fractional area is π Rp² / (π Rstar²) ) = (Rp²)/(Rstar²). So the fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, no. The area of the star's face is π Rstar², as the area we see is a circle when viewed from Earth. So when the planet blocks a part, the blocked area is π Rp². So the fractional change is (π Rp²) / (π Rstar²) ) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but wait: the star's surface area is 4π Rstar², but from a distance, the area we see is a disk of area π Rstar². So when a planet transits, it blocks a part of that disk. So the area blocked is π Rp², so the fractional area is (Rp/Rstar)^2, which is the dip in brightness.

So, that's the formula for the planet case: (Rp/Rstar)^2.

In the star case, the fractional change is approximately 0.1035 (about 10.35% dip), and for the planet, it's (Rp/Rstar)^2.

The question states that the same amplitude would be produced by a planet. So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 equal to the fractional change in the star case, which is 0.1035.

So, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in the star case, the dip is 0.1035 (a 10.35% decrease). So the planet's dip would have to be the same: 0.1035.

So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ sqrt(0.1) is 0.316, but 0.1035 is a bit more, so sqrt is approx 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate F_spot / F_normal.

T_spot = 5000 K, Teff = 6000 K.

(5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4: 5^4 = 625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

f is 0.2, so 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.103549.

So, fractional change is ~10.35%.

For the planet, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So, the answer should be approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: when the star is being observed, as it rotates, the spots come into view, but the star's overall brightness isn't just based on whether the spotted hemisphere is visible or not. Because the star is a sphere, the spots that are on the far side (not visible) are in the night, so perhaps the star's light is a combination of both hemispheres.

Wait, no. Actually, the star emits from its entire surface, regardless of our view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. When it's the other hemisphere, we don't. Wait, no, that's not correct. The star emits uniformly, and the spots are on the surface. So when the hemisphere with spots is facing us, we see those spots; when it's the other hemisphere, we don't. But in reality, the star is a sphere, so when the spotted hemisphere is visible, we see 50% of the star's surface, with 20% of that being spots. But the other 50% (the far side) is not visible, but it's emitting as well. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, if the star is a sphere, when you look at it, you see the entire surface, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is on the near side (toward us), those spots are visible. When the other hemisphere is toward us, the spots are on the far side and not visible. So the brightness variation comes from whether the hemisphere with spots is facing us or not.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so as it spins, the hemisphere with spots will come into view and then go out of view. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the observed flux is lower because that area is emitting less. When the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is normal. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between these two states.

So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. The amplitude is the difference between these two, which is what I calculated earlier as about 10.35%.

So, to get the same amplitude, the planet's transit should cause a dip of 10.35%.

Which would require (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035, so Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.322, which rounds to 0.32, option D.

So, the correct answer is D.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and compare it to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_\text{star} \), and an effective temperature \( T_\text{eff} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_\text{spot} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Fractional Brightness Change Due to Spots**:
   - The fractional change in brightness is determined by the difference in flux between the unspotted and spotted hemispheres.
   - The flux from a surface element is proportional to \( T^4 \), so:
     \[
     \frac{F_\text{spot}}{F_\text{normal}} = \left( \frac{T_\text{spot}}{T_\text{eff}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823.
     \]
   - The fractional brightness change is:
     \[
     \Delta F = f \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{F_\text{spot}}{F_\text{normal}} \right),
     \]
     where \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor. Substituting:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5177 \approx 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
     \]

3. **Planet Transit Brightness Variation**:
   - The fractional brightness change caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the radius ratio:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_\text{planet}}{R_\text{star}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_\text{planet}}{R_\text{star}} \right)^2 = \Delta F = 0.1035.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_\text{planet}}{R_\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_\text{planet}}{R_\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322.
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The closest value to \( 0.322 \) among the options is \( 0.32 \), corresponding to **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star is approximately \( 0.32 \).
