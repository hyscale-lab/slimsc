Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about molecular symmetry, specifically C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is important for understanding their structure and properties. C3h symmetry... I think that refers to a particular type of symmetry element. Let me try to recall what C3h means. 

C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm mixing up the notation. Oh right, the C3h point group. So, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis, and when combined with a horizontal mirror plane, the symmetry operations form the C3h group. Alternatively, sometimes C3h can also involve a horizontal mirror plane in a specific arrangement.

The question is asking which of the given molecules exhibits C3h symmetry. The options are four different compounds: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Let me think about each option's structure and their symmetry.

First, triisopropyl borate. Its structure is (i-Pr)3BO, where i-Pr is isopropyl. The borate has a trigonal planar geometry around boron, with three isopropyl groups attached. Since all three substituents are the same, the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But what about mirror planes? Each isopropyl group is symmetrical, so maybe there's a horizontal mirror plane as well. If that's the case, the molecule might belong to the C3h group. But wait, maybe the mirror plane is vertical? Or maybe it's a different point group like C3v or something else. I'm not sure, but I'll keep this in mind.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a tricyclic structure but I think it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Its structure is a cube-like arrangement with a nitrogen in one of the bridge positions. The molecule is known for having a high degree of symmetry. I believe it has a C3 axis because the bridges are arranged symmetrically. Wait, but quinuclidine's structure is actually a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has multiple symmetry elements. Let me think: if it has a three-fold rotation axis, and perhaps a mirror plane, but I'm not sure if it fits C3h. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different point group like Td, but I'm not certain.

Then there's the benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-hexaone. Hmm, the name sounds complicated. Let me break it down. Benzo indicates a benzene ring fused to another ring. The [1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c''] suggests multiple fusions. Wait, maybe it's a tricyclic system with three furans connected in a certain way. The numbering goes 1,3,4,6,7,9, which suggests the substituents are at specific positions. For symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely to have D3h symmetry, which includes a three-fold axis and horizontal and vertical mirrors. But I'm not sure if the presence of the benzene ring affects this. Benzene rings usually have D6h symmetry, but when fused, the overall symmetry can change.

The last option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-hexaone. So, triphenylene attached to a trifuran system. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system. So the molecule has a central trifuran (three fused furan rings) with triphenyl groups attached. The substituents are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13. I'm trying to imagine the structure. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a three-fold axis, then maybe the molecule has C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is flat enough and the substituents mirror across a plane, then the C3h symmetry would apply.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about each molecule's symmetry.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure is trigonal planar, so the molecule should be symmetrical. Each isopropyl is a mirror image. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, and perhaps a horizontal mirror plane (since the molecule is flat). So, C3h symmetry? Or maybe it's C3v symmetry? Because if there are vertical mirror planes, then it's a different group. I'm a bit confused. I think C3h involves a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. If the mirror plane is horizontal, then maybe the molecule is flat, like in a trigonal planar geometry. But wait, triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule, so maybe yes.

Option D: quinuclidine. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. The molecule has a lot of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Alternatively, perhaps it has a center of inversion. Wait, quinuclidine is known to have a high degree of symmetry, possibly C3v or maybe Td. I'm not exactly sure, but I don't think it's C3h. Maybe it's better to rule it out for now.

Options A and B are both hexaones with trifuran and benzo or triphenyleno substituents.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So this has a benzene ring fused in certain positions of the trifuran. The hexaone suggests six ketone groups. Wait, no, hexaone would be six carbonyl groups? That seems a lot. Alternatively, maybe it's just a hexa- system with multiple ketone substituents. But regardless, the question is about symmetry. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a three-fold axis. If it's fused with benzene rings, the symmetry might be lower. For example, benzene is D6h, but when fused, the overall symmetry could be lower. Maybe this molecule has a three-fold axis but lacks a horizontal mirror plane, so it doesn't fit C3h.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, and attaching it to a trifuran might create a molecule with multiple symmetry elements. If the substituents are arranged in a way that each is 120 degrees apart around a central axis, plus a horizontal mirror plane, then it would be C3h. Alternatively, if there's a vertical mirror, it would be a different group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the point groups. C3h is a point group that includes a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should be flat enough to have a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold axis perpendicular to it.

Triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule with a trigonal planar geometry. The boron is in the center with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a mirror image across the plane. So, the molecule has a C3 axis (since rotation by 120 degrees would map the structure onto itself), and a horizontal mirror plane (since it's symmetric in that plane). So, that would make it C3h symmetry. That would mean option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought option C was triisopropyl borate. So, looking back at the options: A, B, C, D. The question lists four options, each being one of the four molecules. So, the choices are A: triphenyleno..., B: benzo..., C: triisopropyl borate, D: quinuclidine.

If triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry, then option C is correct. But I should double-check the others. Quinuclidine, I think, has a higher symmetry, maybe Td. So, it wouldn't be C3h.

The other options (A and B) are more complex with fused rings. If they have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, they would fit C3h. But I'm not sure about their structures. For example, the benzo substitution in option B might disrupt the mirror plane. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps they do have C3h.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate is probably the correct answer because it's a simple trigonal planar molecule with three identical groups, which would definitely have C3h symmetry. So, the answer must be option C. Wait, no, wait. Looking back, the options are A, B, C, D. The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when a molecule has a C3 axis but no horizontal mirror, it's C3v. But if it has a horizontal mirror, it's C3h.

Triisopropyl borate's structure: the boron is in the center, three isopropyl groups. So, the molecule is flat and has a plane of symmetry through the boron. But wait, the mirror plane would be vertical in this case, not horizontal. Because each isopropyl is a mirror image across a vertical plane. Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is horizontal. But in a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are vertical, and the horizontal plane is the one perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, perhaps the molecule belongs to C3v, not C3h. Because C3v has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes. C3h has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, so perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think about the definitions. The point group C3h is characterized by a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So, the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis. For example, in a trigonal pyramidal molecule, the C3 axis is along the pyramid's height, and the horizontal mirror would be the base. But in triisopropyl borate, which is trigonal planar, the mirror planes would be vertical, not horizontal. So maybe it's C3v, not C3h.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Then perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have C3h symmetry but C3v. Then which molecule does have C3h?

Maybe the correct molecule is option A or B.

Looking again: option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene, which is symmetric. The trifuran is a three-fused furan rings, which would have a three-fold symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the whole molecule has a C3h symmetry. Alternatively, the substituents from triphenylene might be arranged in a way that creates a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule in option A is hexaone, which is a ketone. The positions 1,3,6,8,11,13 suggest that the substituents are placed symmetrically every 60 degrees if the molecule is a hexagon. Wait, but wait, the numbering might be different. Another approach: if the molecule has three substituents spaced 120 degrees apart, and a mirror plane, then C3h.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident anymore. Let me think of the other options again. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. It has a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold rotation axis (I think), and perhaps a mirror plane. But I'm not certain if it's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Wait, but I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry would require that the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. Which of these molecules fit that?

Triisopropyl borate (option C) is trigonal planar with a C3 axis, but the mirror planes are vertical (so C3v). So it doesn't have a horizontal mirror, so not C3h.

quinuclidine (option D) has a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has a three-fold axis, but the mirror planes are in different orientations. I might need to look up the symmetry, but I don't have that option now.

The benzo option (option B) might have a three-fold symmetry but perhaps not a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, maybe it has a D3h symmetry, which includes C3h.

Wait, but D3h includes a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror, and other elements. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it's more than C3h. So, if any of the options have D3h, they would also have C3h. But the question is which has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has triphenylene attached to a trifuran. Triphenylene itself has three benzene rings in a symmetric arrangement, perhaps a three-fold symmetry. If the trifuran is attached in a way that the entire molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would have C3h.

Alternatively, option B is benzo-fused. Maybe the three substituents are arranged symmetrically around a three-fold axis, which would require a horizontal mirror plane.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Which of these molecules is known for having C3h symmetry?

Triisopropyl borate is a common molecule. Its structure is trigonal planar, which is C3v, not C3h. So it doesn't fit. So option C is probably not correct.

Quinuclidine is a very symmetric molecule. It has a three-fold axis, but I'm not sure about the mirror planes. It might have a center of inversion, making it I (inversion), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could have C3v symmetry.

Options A and B: the benzo and triphenylene ones. If the substituents are arranged with 120 degrees between them, and there's a horizontal mirror, then C3h.

Wait, triphenylene is a symmetric structure, and if it's attached to a trifuran in a way that the entire molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would have C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A: triphenyleno... with substituents arranged in a way that creates a C3h symmetry.

Wait, another thought: the molecule in option A is triphenyleno... which has three phenyl groups attached. So, if they are arranged at 120-degree intervals and there's a horizontal mirror plane, that might fit.

Alternatively, maybe all the substituents are on the same side, making a plane of symmetry. But without seeing the structure, it's hard to tell.

Wait, the hexaone part implies six ketone groups? No, wait, 'hexaone' is a six-carbon chain with a ketone. Or perhaps it's a compound with multiple ketone groups. But the structure is more about the rings.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is symmetric across a horizontal plane and has a three-fold axis. So, perhaps the correct molecule is option A: triphenyleno... but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of what C3h symmetry would require. It needs a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So the molecule must be flat, with a plane of symmetry that is horizontal (like the xy-plane if the C3 axis is along z).

Triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule, but its mirror planes are vertical, so C3v, not C3h.

Which of the other options are flat enough to have a horizontal mirror plane?

The furan-based molecules (B and A) are likely flat, given that furans are planar. So, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a three-fold axis, and the molecule is flat with a horizontal mirror, then they would have C3h.

So, the benzo option (B) has a benzene ring fused with the furan. Benzene is flat, but the fusion might disrupt the symmetry. Alternatively, the triphenylene in option A is a three-ring system that's symmetric, and when attached to the trifuran, the entire structure could have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is triphenyleno... So let's imagine the structure: a central trifuran with three phenyl groups attached. If the phenyl groups are at 120 degrees apart, and the molecule is flat, then it would have C3h symmetry. But wait, the substituents are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13. Hmm, that's six substituents. If they are arranged as three pairs, each pair across from each other, then maybe it's D3h symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it's arranged in a way that each is separated by 60 degrees, which would suggest a six-fold symmetry, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking for the molecule that's known to have C3h symmetry. I think triphenylene derivatives can have such symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options have C3h, but I must choose the best fit.

Wait, another approach: I've heard that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and multiple mirror planes, so perhaps it's C3v. But I'm not certain. If that's the case, then option D isn't correct.

Perhaps the correct answer is option A. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another way to think: The molecule in option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The benzo group is fused to the trifuran. The numbering suggests that the substituents are at positions that are symmetrically placed. If the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would have C3h symmetry. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. I think I've made a mistake before about triisopropyl borate. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO. Each isopropyl group is a mirror image across the plane. The molecule is trigonal planar, so the mirror planes would be vertical. So the point group is C3v, not C3h. So option C is not the correct answer.

So, considering that, the correct answer must be one of A, B, or D.

Wait, quinuclidine: it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The molecule is symmetric. I think it has a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has a three-fold axis and also mirror planes. The molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. So, perhaps it has C3v symmetry or maybe Td. I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B or A. Let me think about the structures again.

Option B is a benzo-fused trifuran. Benzo implies a benzene ring fused to one of the furan rings, which would create a bicyclic structure. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps it creates a three-fold axis. For example, if each pair of substituents is on a three-fold axis, then it might have a three-fold rotation. If there's also a horizontal mirror plane, it would be C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that there's a three-fold axis but no horizontal mirror, making it C3v.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, I'm not making progress. Maybe I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, I think triphenylene has D3h symmetry. When attached to a trifuran, which also has a three-fold axis, the entire molecule could have C3h symmetry. So option A would be correct.

Alternatively, the benzo-fused structure in option B may not have the necessary symmetry.

Wait, another thought: the triphenylene group in option A is symmetric. If it's attached to a trifuran in a way that the whole molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would fit.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with option A as the correct answer, but I'm not 100% confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). The molecule must be flat enough to accommodate these symmetry elements.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a central trifuran system fused with a triphenylene group. Triphenylene is a symmetric tricyclic benzene system, and the trifuran provides a three-fold axis. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically at 120° intervals around the three-fold axis and the molecule is flat with a horizontal mirror plane, it would exhibit **C₃h** symmetry. This makes it a strong candidate.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9, which suggests a three-fold axis. However, the benzene ring may disrupt the symmetry, particularly the horizontal mirror plane. This makes it less likely to exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and vertical mirror planes, but no horizontal mirror plane. This places it in the **C₃v** point group, not **C₃h**. Therefore, it does not satisfy the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen atom. It has a high degree of symmetry, including a three-fold axis, but its symmetry elements are more consistent with **C₃v** or possibly **Td** symmetry. It does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, the molecule in **Option A** (triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone) is the most likely to exhibit **C₃h** symmetry due to its three-fold axis and potential horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about molecular symmetry, specifically C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is important for understanding their structure and properties. C3h symmetry... I think that refers to a particular type of symmetry element. Let me try to recall what C3h means. 

C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm mixing up the notation. Oh right, the C3h point group. So, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis, and when combined with a horizontal mirror plane, the symmetry operations form the C3h group. Alternatively, sometimes C3h can also involve a horizontal mirror plane in a specific arrangement.

The question is asking which of the given molecules exhibits C3h symmetry. The options are four different compounds: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Let me think about each option's structure and their symmetry.

First, triisopropyl borate. Its structure is (i-Pr)3BO, where i-Pr is isopropyl. The borate has a trigonal planar geometry around boron, with three isopropyl groups attached. Since all three substituents are the same, the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But what about mirror planes? Each isopropyl group is symmetrical, so maybe there's a horizontal mirror plane as well. If that's the case, the molecule might belong to the C3h group. But wait, maybe the mirror plane is vertical? Or maybe it's a different point group like C3v or something else. I'm not sure, but I'll keep this in mind.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a tricyclic structure but I think it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Its structure is a cube-like arrangement with a nitrogen in one of the bridge positions. The molecule is known for having a high degree of symmetry. I believe it has a C3 axis because the bridges are arranged symmetrically. Wait, but quinuclidine's structure is actually a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has multiple symmetry elements. Let me think: if it has a three-fold rotation axis, and perhaps a mirror plane, but I'm not sure if it fits C3h. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different point group like Td, but I'm not certain.

Then there's the benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-hexaone. Hmm, the name sounds complicated. Let me break it down. Benzo indicates a benzene ring fused to another ring. The [1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c''] suggests multiple fusions. Wait, maybe it's a tricyclic system with three furans connected in a certain way. The numbering goes 1,3,4,6,7,9, which suggests the substituents are at specific positions. For symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely to have D3h symmetry, which includes a three-fold axis and horizontal and vertical mirrors. But I'm not sure if the presence of the benzene ring affects this. Benzene rings usually have D6h symmetry, but when fused, the overall symmetry can change.

The last option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-hexaone. So, triphenylene attached to a trifuran system. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system. So the molecule has a central trifuran (three fused furan rings) with triphenyl groups attached. The substituents are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13. I'm trying to imagine the structure. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a three-fold axis, then maybe the molecule has C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is flat enough and the substituents mirror across a plane, then the C3h symmetry would apply.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about each molecule's symmetry.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure is trigonal planar, so the molecule should be symmetrical. Each isopropyl is a mirror image. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, and perhaps a horizontal mirror plane (since the molecule is flat). So, C3h symmetry? Or maybe it's C3v symmetry? Because if there are vertical mirror planes, then it's a different group. I'm a bit confused. I think C3h involves a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. If the mirror plane is horizontal, then maybe the molecule is flat, like in a trigonal planar geometry. But wait, triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule, so maybe yes.

Option D: quinuclidine. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. The molecule has a lot of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Alternatively, perhaps it has a center of inversion. Wait, quinuclidine is known to have a high degree of symmetry, possibly C3v or maybe Td. I'm not exactly sure, but I don't think it's C3h. Maybe it's better to rule it out for now.

Options A and B are both hexaones with trifuran and benzo or triphenyleno substituents.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So this has a benzene ring fused in certain positions of the trifuran. The hexaone suggests six ketone groups. Wait, no, hexaone would be six carbonyl groups? That seems a lot. Alternatively, maybe it's just a hexa- system with multiple ketone substituents. But regardless, the question is about symmetry. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a three-fold axis. If it's fused with benzene rings, the symmetry might be lower. For example, benzene is D6h, but when fused, the overall symmetry could be lower. Maybe this molecule has a three-fold axis but lacks a horizontal mirror plane, so it doesn't fit C3h.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, and attaching it to a trifuran might create a molecule with multiple symmetry elements. If the substituents are arranged in a way that each is 120 degrees apart around a central axis, plus a horizontal mirror plane, then it would be C3h. Alternatively, if there's a vertical mirror, it would be a different group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the point groups. C3h is a point group that includes a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should be flat enough to have a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold axis perpendicular to it.

Triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule with a trigonal planar geometry. The boron is in the center with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a mirror image across the plane. So, the molecule has a C3 axis (since rotation by 120 degrees would map the structure onto itself), and a horizontal mirror plane (since it's symmetric in that plane). So, that would make it C3h symmetry. That would mean option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought option C was triisopropyl borate. So, looking back at the options: A, B, C, D. The question lists four options, each being one of the four molecules. So, the choices are A: triphenyleno..., B: benzo..., C: triisopropyl borate, D: quinuclidine.

If triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry, then option C is correct. But I should double-check the others. Quinuclidine, I think, has a higher symmetry, maybe Td. So, it wouldn't be C3h.

The other options (A and B) are more complex with fused rings. If they have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, they would fit C3h. But I'm not sure about their structures. For example, the benzo substitution in option B might disrupt the mirror plane. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps they do have C3h.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate is probably the correct answer because it's a simple trigonal planar molecule with three identical groups, which would definitely have C3h symmetry. So, the answer must be option C. Wait, no, wait. Looking back, the options are A, B, C, D. The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when a molecule has a C3 axis but no horizontal mirror, it's C3v. But if it has a horizontal mirror, it's C3h.

Triisopropyl borate's structure: the boron is in the center, three isopropyl groups. So, the molecule is flat and has a plane of symmetry through the boron. But wait, the mirror plane would be vertical in this case, not horizontal. Because each isopropyl is a mirror image across a vertical plane. Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is horizontal. But in a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are vertical, and the horizontal plane is the one perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, perhaps the molecule belongs to C3v, not C3h. Because C3v has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes. C3h has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, so perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think about the definitions. The point group C3h is characterized by a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So, the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis. For example, in a trigonal pyramidal molecule, the C3 axis is along the pyramid's height, and the horizontal mirror would be the base. But in triisopropyl borate, which is trigonal planar, the mirror planes would be vertical, not horizontal. So maybe it's C3v, not C3h.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Then perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have C3h symmetry but C3v. Then which molecule does have C3h?

Maybe the correct molecule is option A or B.

Looking again: option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene, which is symmetric. The trifuran is a three-fused furan rings, which would have a three-fold symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the whole molecule has a C3h symmetry. Alternatively, the substituents from triphenylene might be arranged in a way that creates a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule in option A is hexaone, which is a ketone. The positions 1,3,6,8,11,13 suggest that the substituents are placed symmetrically every 60 degrees if the molecule is a hexagon. Wait, but wait, the numbering might be different. Another approach: if the molecule has three substituents spaced 120 degrees apart, and a mirror plane, then C3h.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident anymore. Let me think of the other options again. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. It has a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold rotation axis (I think), and perhaps a mirror plane. But I'm not certain if it's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Wait, but I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry would require that the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. Which of these molecules fit that?

Triisopropyl borate (option C) is trigonal planar with a C3 axis, but the mirror planes are vertical (so C3v). So it doesn't have a horizontal mirror, so not C3h.

quinuclidine (option D) has a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has a three-fold axis, but the mirror planes are in different orientations. I might need to look up the symmetry, but I don't have that option now.

The benzo option (option B) might have a three-fold symmetry but perhaps not a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, maybe it has a D3h symmetry, which includes C3h.

Wait, but D3h includes a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror, and other elements. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it's more than C3h. So, if any of the options have D3h, they would also have C3h. But the question is which has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has triphenylene attached to a trifuran. Triphenylene itself has three benzene rings in a symmetric arrangement, perhaps a three-fold symmetry. If the trifuran is attached in a way that the entire molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would have C3h.

Alternatively, option B is benzo-fused. Maybe the three substituents are arranged symmetrically around a three-fold axis, which would require a horizontal mirror plane.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Which of these molecules is known for having C3h symmetry?

Triisopropyl borate is a common molecule. Its structure is trigonal planar, which is C3v, not C3h. So it doesn't fit. So option C is probably not correct.

Quinuclidine is a very symmetric molecule. It has a three-fold axis, but I'm not sure about the mirror planes. It might have a center of inversion, making it I (inversion), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could have C3v symmetry.

Options A and B: the benzo and triphenylene ones. If the substituents are arranged with 120 degrees between them, and there's a horizontal mirror, then C3h.

Wait, triphenylene is a symmetric structure, and if it's attached to a trifuran in a way that the entire molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would have C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A: triphenyleno... with substituents arranged in a way that creates a C3h symmetry.

Wait, another thought: the molecule in option A is triphenyleno... which has three phenyl groups attached. So, if they are arranged at 120-degree intervals and there's a horizontal mirror plane, that might fit.

Alternatively, maybe all the substituents are on the same side, making a plane of symmetry. But without seeing the structure, it's hard to tell.

Wait, the hexaone part implies six ketone groups? No, wait, 'hexaone' is a six-carbon chain with a ketone. Or perhaps it's a compound with multiple ketone groups. But the structure is more about the rings.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is symmetric across a horizontal plane and has a three-fold axis. So, perhaps the correct molecule is option A: triphenyleno... but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of what C3h symmetry would require. It needs a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So the molecule must be flat, with a plane of symmetry that is horizontal (like the xy-plane if the C3 axis is along z).

Triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule, but its mirror planes are vertical, so C3v, not C3h.

Which of the other options are flat enough to have a horizontal mirror plane?

The furan-based molecules (B and A) are likely flat, given that furans are planar. So, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a three-fold axis, and the molecule is flat with a horizontal mirror, then they would have C3h.

So, the benzo option (B) has a benzene ring fused with the furan. Benzene is flat, but the fusion might disrupt the symmetry. Alternatively, the triphenylene in option A is a three-ring system that's symmetric, and when attached to the trifuran, the entire structure could have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is triphenyleno... So let's imagine the structure: a central trifuran with three phenyl groups attached. If the phenyl groups are at 120 degrees apart, and the molecule is flat, then it would have C3h symmetry. But wait, the substituents are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13. Hmm, that's six substituents. If they are arranged as three pairs, each pair across from each other, then maybe it's D3h symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it's arranged in a way that each is separated by 60 degrees, which would suggest a six-fold symmetry, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking for the molecule that's known to have C3h symmetry. I think triphenylene derivatives can have such symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options have C3h, but I must choose the best fit.

Wait, another approach: I've heard that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and multiple mirror planes, so perhaps it's C3v. But I'm not certain. If that's the case, then option D isn't correct.

Perhaps the correct answer is option A. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another way to think: The molecule in option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The benzo group is fused to the trifuran. The numbering suggests that the substituents are at positions that are symmetrically placed. If the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would have C3h symmetry. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. I think I've made a mistake before about triisopropyl borate. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO. Each isopropyl group is a mirror image across the plane. The molecule is trigonal planar, so the mirror planes would be vertical. So the point group is C3v, not C3h. So option C is not the correct answer.

So, considering that, the correct answer must be one of A, B, or D.

Wait, quinuclidine: it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The molecule is symmetric. I think it has a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has a three-fold axis and also mirror planes. The molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. So, perhaps it has C3v symmetry or maybe Td. I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B or A. Let me think about the structures again.

Option B is a benzo-fused trifuran. Benzo implies a benzene ring fused to one of the furan rings, which would create a bicyclic structure. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps it creates a three-fold axis. For example, if each pair of substituents is on a three-fold axis, then it might have a three-fold rotation. If there's also a horizontal mirror plane, it would be C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that there's a three-fold axis but no horizontal mirror, making it C3v.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, I'm not making progress. Maybe I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, I think triphenylene has D3h symmetry. When attached to a trifuran, which also has a three-fold axis, the entire molecule could have C3h symmetry. So option A would be correct.

Alternatively, the benzo-fused structure in option B may not have the necessary symmetry.

Wait, another thought: the triphenylene group in option A is symmetric. If it's attached to a trifuran in a way that the whole molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would fit.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with option A as the correct answer, but I'm not 100% confident.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). The molecule must be flat enough to accommodate these symmetry elements.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a central trifuran system fused with a triphenylene group. Triphenylene is a symmetric tricyclic benzene system, and the trifuran provides a three-fold axis. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically at 120° intervals around the three-fold axis and the molecule is flat with a horizontal mirror plane, it would exhibit **C₃h** symmetry. This makes it a strong candidate.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9, which suggests a three-fold axis. However, the benzene ring may disrupt the symmetry, particularly the horizontal mirror plane. This makes it less likely to exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and vertical mirror planes, but no horizontal mirror plane. This places it in the **C₃v** point group, not **C₃h**. Therefore, it does not satisfy the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen atom. It has a high degree of symmetry, including a three-fold axis, but its symmetry elements are more consistent with **C₃v** or possibly **Td** symmetry. It does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, the molecule in **Option A** (triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone) is the most likely to exhibit **C₃h** symmetry due to its three-fold axis and potential horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: A**
