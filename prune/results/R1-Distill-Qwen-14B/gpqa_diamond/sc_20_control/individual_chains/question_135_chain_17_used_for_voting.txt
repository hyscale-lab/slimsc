Okay, so I'm faced with this question about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I remember some basics.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is describing the interaction between the boson field X and some fermion field ψ_f. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decays are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, I should figure out what fermions are being interacted with by X. The term λ f suggests that f is a Yukawa coupling, which usually couples a scalar (boson) to fermions. So ψ_f would be a fermion species—like electrons, quarks, etc.

The interaction term looks like a Yukawa coupling, where the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the decay process we're looking at is X → fermion-antifermion pairs. But which fermions can X decay into?

For a decay to be allowed, the energy must be sufficient. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so the fermion pair must have a combined rest mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Also, the process must conserve quantum numbers, but since X is a boson, it can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as it's kinematically allowed, and the coupling exists.

Wait, but the problem tells me the interaction involves ψ_f. Does that mean X only couples to a specific type of fermion? The way the Lagrangian is written, I think X couples to ψ_f. So the possible decay products would be ψ_f and anti-ψ_f. But wait, maybe in the problem, ψ_f is a specific fermion, like a bottom quark or something else.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Lagrangian doesn't explicitly state which fermion it's coupling to. Maybe it's a generic fermion, but the possible decays depend on which fermions are light enough.

Wait, no, perhaps the fermions in the decay are the ones that X couples to. So if X can decay into a fermion pair, the fermion's mass must be less than half of X's mass. Because in the rest frame of X, each fermion can have at most half the mass. So for each fermion f, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Given that m_X is 6 GeV, each fermion's mass must be ≤3 GeV.

So what fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let me recall the masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Quarks:
   - Up (u): around 2.2 MeV (negligible)
   - Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
   - Strange (s): ~95 MeV
   - Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
   - Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (so wait, that's above 3 GeV)
   - Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- How about the other particles like neutrinos? But they're negligible.

Wait, the tau is about 1.777 GeV. So 2m_tau would be about 3.55 GeV, which is just under 6 GeV (since m_X is 6 GeV). Wait, no: 2m_f is the maximum needed for the pair. So m_f can be up to 3 GeV, because 2*3=6 GeV.

Wait, X has 6 GeV mass. The maximum mass a fermion can have to allow X→ f f̄ is m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Because the rest mass of the pair would be 2m_f, and that can't exceed X's mass.

So let's list all the fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV.

- e: 0.0005 GeV → yes
- ν_e: nearly 0 → yes
- μ: 0.105 → yes
- ν_μ: negligible → yes
- τ: 1.777 → yes
- ν_τ: negligible → yes
- u: 2.2 MeV → yes
- d: ~4.7 MeV → yes
- s: ~95 MeV → yes
- c: ~1.275 GeV → yes
- b: 4.1-4.7 GeV → too heavy, can't decay into b b̄
- t: way too heavy, can't decay
- How about the top quark? No, way too heavy.

Wait, but wait. The tau is 1.777 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.554 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV, so X could decay into tau pairs. Similarly, 2m_c is about 2.55 GeV, which is way under 6. But what about the bottom quark? 2m_b is about 8.2-9.4 GeV, which is way above X's mass, so X can't decay into b b̄.

But wait, I just realized, the X mass is 6 GeV. So for a fermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So for each fermion, 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV?

All except the bottom quark (b) and top quark (t), and maybe some others.

Wait, the charm quark is around 1.275 GeV, so 2m_c is about 2.55 GeV. That's okay.

So possible fermions: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

But wait, what about the neutrinos? X can decay into ν ν̄, but that's possible. But in the options, I don't see any neutrinos, so maybe the question is considering only charged leptons and quarks.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b, s, u, d, tau+, tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait. b quark has mass around 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b = ~9 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So option A includes b, which would be impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c, s, u, d, tau+, tau-, mu+, mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, the c quark is 1.275 GeV, so 2m_c is 2.55 GeV, which is fine. So option B includes c, which is allowed.

But wait, option B also includes tau, mu, e, which are all allowed as their 2m is way under 6 GeV.

What about the strange quark? s is about 95 MeV, so 2m_s is ~ 0.19 GeV, which is way under 6.

So the possible decay products for X would include any fermion-antifermion pair where m_f ≤3 GeV.

But wait, the Lagrangian term given is -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction is with ψ_f, which is a specific fermion. So perhaps X can only decay into ψ_f and ψ̄_f. But the question is about all possible kinematically allowed decays, so perhaps it's considering all possible fermions that X can couple to, given that the Lagrangian is written that way?

Wait, maybe the problem is that X can couple to any fermion as long as the coupling term exists. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is for a specific fermion, but the question is about what X can decay into regardless.

Wait, the way the interaction is written, it looks like X couples to ψ_f, which could be any fermion. So the decay depends on whether the fermion's mass is under 3 GeV.

So the possible decay products are any fermions f where m_f ≤3 GeV. So that includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

But the options don't include all of these. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: X→ c, s, u, d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So that's all the fermions with mass ≤3 GeV, except for the neutrinos, which are not included in the options.

Wait, but the options don't include neutrinos, so perhaps the intended answer is that X can decay into any pair where the fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV. But looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Why is option B correct? Because it includes all the possible fermions except for the heavy ones.

Wait, but wait. Let's check the masses:

- c: 1.275 GeV → allowed
- s: 0.095 GeV → allowed
- u: 2.2 MeV → allowed
- d: 4.7 MeV → allowed
- tau: 1.777 GeV → allowed
- mu: 0.105 GeV → allowed
- e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed

So all of them are allowed. So the possible decay channels are into these fermions.

Looking at the options:

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes.

But wait, option D: includes b, which is not allowed. So D is out.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy, but if X could decay into t t̄, but 2m_t is way above 6 GeV, so that's impossible.

So the correct option is B or D, but D includes b which is not allowed. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but some people might think about the coupling. Does the interaction term imply that X can only decay into a particular type of fermion? Like, if X couples only to charged leptons or only to quarks?

Wait, the interaction term is written as -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So in this term, ψ_f could be any fermion. So the X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it can couple to. So if the coupling is same for all fermions, then all possible light fermions can be decay products.

But in reality, the Yukawa coupling λ is different for different fermions. But the question says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so perhaps all the fermions are allowed if their mass is less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify what ψ_f is. So perhaps ψ_f is a generic fermion, so the X can decay into any fermion as long as m_f ≤3 GeV.

But then the options are about which fermions are possible. So option B is correct because it includes all the allowed fermions.

Wait, but what about the possibility of vector boson decays? Like, could X decay into W W or Z Z? But since X is a boson, but the interaction term is with fermions, perhaps X can't decay into other bosons. The question is about fermion decays.

Another point: in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with a fermion field ψ_f, so the decay products would be ψ_f and ψ̄_f. So if ψ_f is a quark, then X can decay into quark-antiquark pairs. If it's a lepton, then into leptons. But the question is about the allowed decays, regardless of the specific ψ_f.

Wait, but in reality, a generic boson can decay into any fermion pair as long as the coupling exists and the mass allows it. So if X is a boson that couples to multiple types of fermions, it can decay into any of their pairs.

But in this problem, the interaction is given as involving ψ_f. So perhaps ψ_f is a specific fermion, but it's not specified which one. So without knowing which fermion ψ_f is, we can't say for sure which decay channels are allowed. But the question gives a list of possible decay products, so perhaps it's considering all possible light fermions.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

The question asks which are the kinematically allowed decays. Kinematically allowed means that the fermion pair's rest mass is less than or equal to the X's mass.

So regardless of the coupling, the only decays allowed are those where the sum of the fermion masses is less than 6 GeV. So the fermions must have m_f ≤3 GeV.

So in the options, any decay that includes a fermion with m_f >3 GeV is not allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A includes b (4.5 GeV), so that's not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B includes c (1.275 GeV), which is allowed. So B is a candidate.

Option C includes t (173 GeV), which is way too heavy. So C is wrong.

Option D includes b, which is too heavy, so D is wrong.

Thus, the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option B's decay products are:

c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, all of these have m_f <=3 GeV.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to a fermion field \( \psi_f \), and the decays depend on whether the fermion pair's total rest mass is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). Specifically, for a fermion \( f \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq m_X \) must be satisfied, where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The possible fermions and their approximate masses are:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)

From this, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). The decays involving these fermions are kinematically allowed. The problem does not include neutrinos in the options, so they are not considered.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed since their masses satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. Hence, this option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
