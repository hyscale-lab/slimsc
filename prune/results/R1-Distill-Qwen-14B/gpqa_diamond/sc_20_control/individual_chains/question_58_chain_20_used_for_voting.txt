Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about regularization and each of these theories.

Regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the infinities temporarily before they're canceled out by renormalization. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or because their structure avoids these divergences.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory: I remember that string theory deals with strings instead of point particles. It's a theory of quantum gravity, right? Strings are one-dimensional, and they vibrate at different frequencies, which correspond to different particles. Since it's a theory that includes gravity and is supposed to be a candidate for a theory of everything, it might handle high energies better. Also, I think string theory has a concept of supersymmetry which could help in avoiding some divergences. Or wait, do string theories require regularization? I'm not too sure. I think they might because they're still part of the framework of quantum field theories, but maybe their higher-dimensional aspects help. Or perhaps not, because string theory includes gravity, which might lead to different behavior.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies, QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, so quarks behave more like free particles. But QCD calculations can still have divergences. Wait, doesn't QCD require renormalization, which implies it might need regularization? Or maybe in practical calculations, like in lattice QCD, they might handle it without needing the same kind of regularization as other theories.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED has been very successful and that it does require renormalization. The calculations for things like the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron involve dealing with divergent integrals, so regularization is definitely used here. So QED needs regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: Hmm, classical ED is Maxwell's theory, right? It's a non-quantum theory. So it doesn't involve the same kind of infinities that quantum theories do. For example, in classical ED, you don't have issues like the infinite charge density of a point charge because you don't have the same mathematical framework as in quantum theories. Wait, but do you get infinities in classical theories? Like, when you have point charges, you get issues with their fields at the point. But in practice, classical ED is handled without regularization because it's not a quantum field theory. So regularization is a quantum field theory concept. Therefore, classical ED might not require regularization because it doesn't use perturbative expansions or loop diagrams where divergences occur.

So the question is which theory never requires regularization. The options are A to D.

Wait, but all the quantum theories (QED, QCD, Superstring) would need regularization because they involve quantum loops and divergences. Only the classical theory might not. Because the question is about which theory never requires regularization, the answer would be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Do any of the other theories not require regularization? Superstring theory is a quantum theory but perhaps avoids some divergences because of its higher-dimensional nature. But I think string theories usually require regularization because they still have loop diagrams and potential divergences, but maybe their treatment is different. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to whether the theory is a priori free of divergences. For example, some theories are nonrenormalizable, meaning they require an infinite number of counterterms, but that's different from whether regularization is needed. But I think regularization is a step in the renormalization process, so any theory that's renormalizable would require regularization. 

Wait, but wait. Quantum Electrodynamics is renormalizable, so it needs regularization. QCD is as well. Superstring theory is a background-dependent theory and I'm not sure if it's renormalizable in the same way. But regardless, if a theory has divergent loops, it needs regularization.

So the only theory that doesn't involve quantum loops and hence wouldn't need regularization is D) Classical Electrodynamics. Because it's not a quantum field theory, so regularization isn't part of its framework.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on their characteristics and the role of regularization in quantum field theory.

- **A) Superstring Theory**: Superstring theory is a quantum theory that incorporates supersymmetry and is a candidate for a theory of everything. While it is free from some divergences due to its higher-dimensional and string-based nature, it still involves quantum field theory concepts and loop diagrams, which typically require regularization. Thus, it is not entirely free from the need for regularization.

- **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: QCD describes the strong interaction and is asymptotically free at high energies. While it does not require as much regularization as other quantum field theories in practice (e.g., lattice QCD), it still involves divergences and renormalization in perturbative calculations. Therefore, it does require regularization.

- **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: QED is a well-established quantum field theory that deals with electromagnetic interactions. It is known to require regularization due to divergent loop integrals in calculations, such as those for the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.

- **D) Classical Electrodynamics**: Classical electrodynamics is based on Maxwell's equations and does not involve quantum field theory concepts like loop integrals or divergences. Since regularization is a quantum field theory tool used to handle infinities, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization.

From this analysis, the only theory that never requires regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
