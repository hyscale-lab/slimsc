Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of isomers and tautomerism. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound can show optical isomerism.

First, let me understand the terms. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional and stereoisomers. But I think the question is focusing on tautomerism and optical isomerism, which are related to different types of isomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can undergo a structural rearrangement, usually by the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond. An example is between keto and enol forms. So compounds that have this ability will show tautomerism. If a compound can't do that, it doesn't show tautomerism.

Optical isomerism arises when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. This requires the presence of a stereogenic center or some kind of asymmetry in the molecule. So, if a compound has such features, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the compounds given:

For part A, the options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to determine which one doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? I think there are two types: para-benzoquinone and ortho. Either way, both have two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Do they show tautomerism? Well, tautomerism in quinones... Hmm. Quinones are typically in the keto form, so maybe they don't have an enol form because the structure is already conjugated. Alternatively, maybe they can tautomerize, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they can't because the structure is too rigid. Wait, but I remember that quinones can exist in keto forms and maybe some enol forms, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps they don't show tautomerism because they're already in the most stable form.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. So the structure is like three carbonyl groups at 1,3,5 positions. Since all the possible positions for hydrogen are at the same positions, can it undergo tautomerism? Wait, tautomerism usually requires a hydrogen to move from one position to another. In this case, if all the ketones are in a symmetrical arrangement, maybe the molecule can't really undergo tautomerism. Wait, no. Let me think. Each ketone group is at a different carbon, but because it's 1,3,5, each is adjacent to two other ketones. Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetric, so moving a hydrogen might not change anything. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's no acidic hydrogen available for tautomerism. Wait, in a ketone, the alpha hydrogens are acidic, but in 1,3,5-trione, the alpha to each carbonyl is a carbon that's adjacent to other carbonyls. Hmm. So maybe the alpha hydrogens are more acidic than usual, but can they undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

Wait, another thought: For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen that can move from one position to another, usually involving a conjugated system. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups across the ring. I think para-benzoquinone is a stable structure, and maybe it can tautomerize into an enol form. But wait, in the case of 1,4-benzoquinone, the positions are such that any enol form would have two double bonds, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any enol form because the structure is too rigid. Or maybe it can't tautomerize because the positions are already occupied, or perhaps it's more stable as the keto form. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, I should think about which of these two compounds is more likely to undergo tautomerism. Benzoquinone is a diketone, so maybe it can tautomerize. But wait, wait, I think benzoquinone is more likely to have an enol form. Let me think of the structure. For a diketone like 1,4-benzoquinone, the enol form would have conjugated double bonds. So maybe it can tautomerize to an enol, but in reality, if the molecule is more stable in keto form, which it probably is, then it's the dominant form. But the question is about whether it shows tautomerism, not which is more stable. So if it can exist in both forms, it shows tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Another approach: which of these compounds doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, or can't form the enol form?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each ketone is on a carbon that's attached to two other ketones. So each carbonyl group is at a position where the adjacent carbons are also carbonyl groups. So the alpha positions (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls) are connected to two other carbonyls. So, each alpha carbon is CH2? Or is it CH groups? Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Let's number the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Positions 1,3,5 have ketones.

So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-C? No, wait. Wait, cyclohexane has six carbons. So positions 1,3,5 are each carbonyls, so each is a C=O. The positions between them would be CH2 groups, right?

So structure would be:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- ?

Wait, that doesn't quite form a ring. Let me think again. No, the cyclohexane ring is six-membered, with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. Each of these carbons is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So each ketone is at a position that's adjacent to two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Let me imagine the ring: positions 1,3,5 are all double-bonded O. So the ring would have three carbonyl groups. So each of those carbons (1,3,5) is double-bonded O, and the neighboring carbons (2,4,6) would be single-bonded. So, each of these would be CH2 groups.

Now, in such a structure, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are the 2,4,6 positions. So each of these is a CH2 group, meaning they have two hydrogens each. So those are alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but wait: Are the CH2 groups between the ketones? So each ketone is at 1, 3, 5. So between 1 and 3 is position 2 (CH2), between 3 and 5 is position 4 (CH2), and between 5 and 1 is position 6 (CH2). So each of these is a CH2 group. So each has two hydrogens attached. So the alpha hydrogens are present.

But can these undergo keto-enol tautomerism? For a keto-enol tautomerism, the molecule must have an acidic alpha hydrogen, which can deprotonate and form an enol. However, in this case, the alpha positions are CH2 groups, so each has two hydrogens. But for tautomerism, the enol form would need conjugation. Since the molecule is a tricyclic ketone... Wait, but in the case of 1,3,5-trione, the molecule is symmetric, so any tautomer would lead to a similar structure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so symmetrical that it can't undergo tautomerism because the enol form would be the same as the keto form.

Wait, that's a possibility. If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps any enol form would just be identical to the keto form. So no tautomerism. Because the enol form would either not exist or would be the same as the keto form. Alternatively, maybe the enol form isn't possible because the positions don't allow for conjugation.

Wait, let me think of a smaller example. Let's say cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That's a 1,3-diketone. Do those exhibit tautomerism? I think they do. Because the enol form can form between the two ketones, leading to conjugation. But in this case, 1,3,5-trione, the enol form would require a hydrogen from position 2 or 4 or 6, but moving it would require conjugation with the carbonyls. But given the symmetry, maybe the enol form isn't possible, or perhaps it's not lower in energy, so no tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism. Wait, no, each CH2 has two Hs. So that's not the case.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think about benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So in para-benzoquinone, the enol form would involve a hydrogen moving from one position to another, creating a conjugated diene. So the enol form would have conjugated double bonds, making it more stable. So it can undergo tautomerism.

So benzoquinone can show tautomerism. So which of the two (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) does not show tautomerism?

If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't undergo tautomerism, then A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So part A's answer would be that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

Wait, but why can't it undergo tautomerism? Because moving a hydrogen would not lead to a different structure due to symmetry? Or because the molecule is too rigid?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so symmetric that the enol form is the same as the keto form, so no tautomerism is observed. That would make sense. For example, if the enol form is identical or energetically not favorable, the compound doesn't show tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would be the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Now, moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, but as the methyl ester. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. No, wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, but wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, that structure would have the hydroxyl on a secondary carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-O-C-CH2-CH2-OH?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me structure it correctly. The acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Now, can this molecule have a chiral center? The hydroxyl is on the middle carbon (CH2 in the case of propanoic acid). So the carbon with OH is CH2. Wait, no: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) is CH2 with OH. Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2; so the groups attached are: OH, two CH2, and a carbonyl group. Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to the third carbon (COOCH3), the first (CH2OH), and two hydrogens.

Wait, let me number the carbons: 1, 2, 3.

Carbon 1: CH2OH.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 1 and 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon: so it's CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the structure is: the second carbon has two CH2 groups (one attached to OH, the other to COOCH3?), no. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 is the ester group.

The propanoate part is CH2-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Or is it CH3-CHOH-COOCH3?

Ah, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH2) is attached to the OH, two CH2 groups, and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but the second carbon is a CH2. So each of the four bonds is to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, meaning it's connected to two CH2 groups, one OH, and one COOCH3. Wait, but each CH2 has two H's. So the central carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (the two CH2's). So the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, right? So it's not chiral and can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the central carbon is CH2, then it's not a stereogenic center because it doesn't have four different substituents. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but then why is this option an option? Because I'm looking at another compound.

The other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Fumaric acid is a diacid with the structure HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. The trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3 (but the substituents on each end are COOCH3 groups, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, with substituents trans. So the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But wait, more accurately, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So its structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans version: the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would have the same structure but with OMe groups instead of OH.

So structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 
|
C=C
|
O=C-OCH3
O

Wait, no. Let me get the exact structure. Fumarate is the trans-diaxial isomer of maleate. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Therefore, the structure is:

O=C-OCH3
|
C=C (trans)
|
O=C-OCH3

Wait, but when you have a double bond, the substituents are on opposite sides. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule chiral. Because the two ester groups are identical, but the double bond's configuration (E) can lead to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but wait. If the two substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (COOCH3), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So, would this molecule have optical isomerism?

Hmm, because for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry, leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is trans (E configuration). The substituents on each end are the same (two COOCH3 groups). So the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. That means it's not chiral. Because the two halves are mirror images, so the molecule is achiral. So it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, so then why is dimethyl fumarate an option for showing optical isomerism? Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule is symmetrical. Because each end is a mirror image. So the molecule is not chiral.

Wait, so neither of these compounds can show optical isomerism? But that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me re-examine it.

Earlier, I thought that the central carbon (CH2) can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (two CH2 groups). So, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center and can't show optical isomerism.

So, if that's correct, then among the two given compounds, which can show optical isomerism?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon is CH2. So, substituents are two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. Wait, but the two CH2 groups are identical, right? So the central carbon has two CH2 groups, which are the same. So substituents: two same (CH2), one OH, one COOCH3. So four different groups? No, because two of them are the same.

Wait, no. The four substituents would be: CH2OH (from the first carbon), CH2COOCH3 (from the third), and two H's. Wait, no, the central carbon is CH2. So, it's connected to:

- One CH2OH group (from the first carbon),

- One CH2COOCH3 group (from the third),

- Two hydrogen atoms.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the central carbon is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons),

- One OH,

- One COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think of the structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, connected to the first (CH2OH), the third (COOCH3), and two H's.

So the substituents on the second carbon are: CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. So two of them are H's, so it's not a chiral center because you need four different groups. So it can't have optical isomerism.

What about dimethyl fumarate?

As discussed, the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH2–CH2–C(O)OCH3? No, wait. No, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH2–CH2–C(O)OCH3? No, no, wait, fumarate is HO2C–CH=CH–COOH, but in the trans configuration.

So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH=CH–C(O)OCH3, but in trans configuration. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O=C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O=C-OCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration. So the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. Hence, it's not chiral. So it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, so neither of these compounds can show optical isomerism? But that can't be right because the question expects us to choose between them.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the substituents on either side are identical (COOCH3 groups) but on opposite sides. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, then both compounds can't show optical isomerism? That can't be because the options suggest that one of them does. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another approach: maybe I got the structures wrong. Let me think about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate again. Is there a possibility that the structure has a chiral center?

Wait, another possibility: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate could be (CH3)CO-O-CH2-OH. No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2COH-O-CO-OCH3? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let me think. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2, with substituents: two CH2 groups (maybe the same), an OH, and a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. What about the possibility of the molecule being in an enol form, making it chiral? But I don't think that's relevant here. The question is about the compounds in their given forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is in a position that allows for a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Another approach: the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is C4H8O3. Let's count the carbons: methyl (1), then the propanoate part has three carbons, but with a hydroxyl on the second. So, yes, CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon is CH2, which is attached to OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. So substituents are: two H's, OH, and CH2COOCH3. So the groups are not all different, so it can't be a chiral center.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, but then what about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the symmetry. Let me think. In dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral. So it can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but then both compounds can't show optical isomerism, which contradicts the options, because the options have B as either methyl or dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the molecule is chiral due to the arrangement of substituents around the double bond. But if the substituents on each end are identical, the molecule can't have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound.

Wait, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, which is a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So the molecule is not chiral and can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the structure is a meso compound, then it's not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, according to this analysis, neither of the compounds can show optical isomerism, but that can't be correct because the question states that one of them does.

Am I missing something? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about the structures. What about another possibility: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate could have a different structure that allows for a chiral center.

Wait, another structure: could it be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3? So the central carbon (number 2) has substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. That would make it a chiral center because all four substituents are different.

Wait, that's possible. So if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3, then the central carbon (number 2) has CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So four different groups: yes, that would be a chiral center. So the molecule would show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. The name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So:

Structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which I thought earlier has a CH2 in the center. But if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, then the name would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Because the chain would be CH3, then CH(OH), then COOCH3.

Wait, but the IUPAC name depends on the longest chain. Hmm. Let me think. The longest chain would be three carbons. The functional group is the ester (COOCH3), so the chain is numbered from that end. So the positions would be 1 (COOCH3), 2 (C(OH)), 3 (CH3).

So the structure would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the second carbon has CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So this molecule can show optical isomerism.

Wait, but how does that fit with the formula. So the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, that makes the molecule have a chiral center. So this compound would exhibit optical isomerism.

Then, the other compound, dimethyl fumarate, as discussed, can't show optical isomerism because it's a meso compound.

So for part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate cannot.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which wouldn't have a chiral center. But perhaps I was wrong, and the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which would have a chiral center.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in how I constructed the structure. Let me clarify: the IUPAC name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The parent chain is propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH.

The substituent is hydroxyl on the second carbon: so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain with the ester group on the third carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups (the first and third), an OH, and a H (since it's CH2). So four substituents: two CH2 groups, OH, and H.

Wait, because CH2 is connected to two CH2 groups (the first and third carbons), which are same. So the substituents are: two same (CH2 groups), OH, and H. So the central carbon can't have four different groups, so no chiral center. So this would mean that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can't show optical isomerism.

So, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. I think I must have made a mistake in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which would have a chiral center at the second carbon. How would that fit the IUPAC name?

The IUPAC name would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

In that structure, the propanoate part is three carbons: CH3, C(OH)H, COOCH3.

So the substituents are:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH)H (so that's a CH(OH) group)

Carbon 3: COOCH3

So, the substituents on carbon 2 are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H.

So all four substituents are different, hence it's a chiral center.

But wait, wait. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is three carbons. The longest chain is from the ester group to the hydroxyl. So if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, then the ester is on carbon 3. The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the substituents on carbon 2 are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So yes, four different groups, making it chiral.

But wait, that would make the structure CH3-C(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the chain is three carbons. So the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which has a chiral center at C2.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism.

Then, why did I get confused earlier? Because perhaps I was thinking of the structure as CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct structure.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as methyl 2-hydroxybutanoate? No, I think I'm mixing up the names. Let me think. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 connected to the third carbon.

Second carbon: connected to OH and two CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find another approach. If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, it can show optical isomerism. Otherwise, it can't.

If I'm correct that it does have a chiral center, then part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But then, the other option is dimethyl fumarate. If dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it doesn't show optical isomerism. So the correct answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, putting it all together:

Part A: the compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Because it's symmetric, so any tautomer would be the same as the keto form.

Part B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism because it has a chiral center.

Looking at the options:

Option B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, no, according to our analysis, A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options, option A is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Alternatively, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, according to our analysis, A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so part A is correct in options A and C) and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so part B is correct in options A and B). So the correct option is A) A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl.

But wait, earlier I thought that benzoquinone can show tautomerism, so part A's correct answer is the one that doesn't show tautomerism, which is cyclohexane.

So the correct answer is option A: A is cyclohexane, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties as follows:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. It can undergo tautomerism, as it can exist in both keto and enol forms. The enol form involves conjugated double bonds, which are possible due to the aromatic ring's flexibility.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Due to its symmetry, any enol form would be identical to the keto form, making tautomerism impossible. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. The second carbon (C2) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, this compound can show optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration). This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it cannot show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **A**: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of isomers and tautomerism. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound can show optical isomerism.

First, let me understand the terms. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional and stereoisomers. But I think the question is focusing on tautomerism and optical isomerism, which are related to different types of isomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can undergo a structural rearrangement, usually by the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond. An example is between keto and enol forms. So compounds that have this ability will show tautomerism. If a compound can't do that, it doesn't show tautomerism.

Optical isomerism arises when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. This requires the presence of a stereogenic center or some kind of asymmetry in the molecule. So, if a compound has such features, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the compounds given:

For part A, the options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to determine which one doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? I think there are two types: para-benzoquinone and ortho. Either way, both have two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Do they show tautomerism? Well, tautomerism in quinones... Hmm. Quinones are typically in the keto form, so maybe they don't have an enol form because the structure is already conjugated. Alternatively, maybe they can tautomerize, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they can't because the structure is too rigid. Wait, but I remember that quinones can exist in keto forms and maybe some enol forms, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps they don't show tautomerism because they're already in the most stable form.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. So the structure is like three carbonyl groups at 1,3,5 positions. Since all the possible positions for hydrogen are at the same positions, can it undergo tautomerism? Wait, tautomerism usually requires a hydrogen to move from one position to another. In this case, if all the ketones are in a symmetrical arrangement, maybe the molecule can't really undergo tautomerism. Wait, no. Let me think. Each ketone group is at a different carbon, but because it's 1,3,5, each is adjacent to two other ketones. Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetric, so moving a hydrogen might not change anything. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's no acidic hydrogen available for tautomerism. Wait, in a ketone, the alpha hydrogens are acidic, but in 1,3,5-trione, the alpha to each carbonyl is a carbon that's adjacent to other carbonyls. Hmm. So maybe the alpha hydrogens are more acidic than usual, but can they undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

Wait, another thought: For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen that can move from one position to another, usually involving a conjugated system. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups across the ring. I think para-benzoquinone is a stable structure, and maybe it can tautomerize into an enol form. But wait, in the case of 1,4-benzoquinone, the positions are such that any enol form would have two double bonds, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any enol form because the structure is too rigid. Or maybe it can't tautomerize because the positions are already occupied, or perhaps it's more stable as the keto form. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, I should think about which of these two compounds is more likely to undergo tautomerism. Benzoquinone is a diketone, so maybe it can tautomerize. But wait, wait, I think benzoquinone is more likely to have an enol form. Let me think of the structure. For a diketone like 1,4-benzoquinone, the enol form would have conjugated double bonds. So maybe it can tautomerize to an enol, but in reality, if the molecule is more stable in keto form, which it probably is, then it's the dominant form. But the question is about whether it shows tautomerism, not which is more stable. So if it can exist in both forms, it shows tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Another approach: which of these compounds doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, or can't form the enol form?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each ketone is on a carbon that's attached to two other ketones. So each carbonyl group is at a position where the adjacent carbons are also carbonyl groups. So the alpha positions (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls) are connected to two other carbonyls. So, each alpha carbon is CH2? Or is it CH groups? Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Let's number the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Positions 1,3,5 have ketones.

So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-C? No, wait. Wait, cyclohexane has six carbons. So positions 1,3,5 are each carbonyls, so each is a C=O. The positions between them would be CH2 groups, right?

So structure would be:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- ?

Wait, that doesn't quite form a ring. Let me think again. No, the cyclohexane ring is six-membered, with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. Each of these carbons is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So each ketone is at a position that's adjacent to two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Let me imagine the ring: positions 1,3,5 are all double-bonded O. So the ring would have three carbonyl groups. So each of those carbons (1,3,5) is double-bonded O, and the neighboring carbons (2,4,6) would be single-bonded. So, each of these would be CH2 groups.

Now, in such a structure, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are the 2,4,6 positions. So each of these is a CH2 group, meaning they have two hydrogens each. So those are alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but wait: Are the CH2 groups between the ketones? So each ketone is at 1, 3, 5. So between 1 and 3 is position 2 (CH2), between 3 and 5 is position 4 (CH2), and between 5 and 1 is position 6 (CH2). So each of these is a CH2 group. So each has two hydrogens attached. So the alpha hydrogens are present.

But can these undergo keto-enol tautomerism? For a keto-enol tautomerism, the molecule must have an acidic alpha hydrogen, which can deprotonate and form an enol. However, in this case, the alpha positions are CH2 groups, so each has two hydrogens. But for tautomerism, the enol form would need conjugation. Since the molecule is a tricyclic ketone... Wait, but in the case of 1,3,5-trione, the molecule is symmetric, so any tautomer would lead to a similar structure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so symmetrical that it can't undergo tautomerism because the enol form would be the same as the keto form.

Wait, that's a possibility. If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps any enol form would just be identical to the keto form. So no tautomerism. Because the enol form would either not exist or would be the same as the keto form. Alternatively, maybe the enol form isn't possible because the positions don't allow for conjugation.

Wait, let me think of a smaller example. Let's say cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That's a 1,3-diketone. Do those exhibit tautomerism? I think they do. Because the enol form can form between the two ketones, leading to conjugation. But in this case, 1,3,5-trione, the enol form would require a hydrogen from position 2 or 4 or 6, but moving it would require conjugation with the carbonyls. But given the symmetry, maybe the enol form isn't possible, or perhaps it's not lower in energy, so no tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism. Wait, no, each CH2 has two Hs. So that's not the case.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think about benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So in para-benzoquinone, the enol form would involve a hydrogen moving from one position to another, creating a conjugated diene. So the enol form would have conjugated double bonds, making it more stable. So it can undergo tautomerism.

So benzoquinone can show tautomerism. So which of the two (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) does not show tautomerism?

If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't undergo tautomerism, then A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So part A's answer would be that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

Wait, but why can't it undergo tautomerism? Because moving a hydrogen would not lead to a different structure due to symmetry? Or because the molecule is too rigid?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so symmetric that the enol form is the same as the keto form, so no tautomerism is observed. That would make sense. For example, if the enol form is identical or energetically not favorable, the compound doesn't show tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would be the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Now, moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, but as the methyl ester. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. No, wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, but wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, that structure would have the hydroxyl on a secondary carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-O-C-CH2-CH2-OH?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me structure it correctly. The acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Now, can this molecule have a chiral center? The hydroxyl is on the middle carbon (CH2 in the case of propanoic acid). So the carbon with OH is CH2. Wait, no: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) is CH2 with OH. Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2; so the groups attached are: OH, two CH2, and a carbonyl group. Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to the third carbon (COOCH3), the first (CH2OH), and two hydrogens.

Wait, let me number the carbons: 1, 2, 3.

Carbon 1: CH2OH.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 1 and 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon: so it's CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the structure is: the second carbon has two CH2 groups (one attached to OH, the other to COOCH3?), no. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 is the ester group.

The propanoate part is CH2-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Or is it CH3-CHOH-COOCH3?

Ah, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH2) is attached to the OH, two CH2 groups, and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but the second carbon is a CH2. So each of the four bonds is to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, meaning it's connected to two CH2 groups, one OH, and one COOCH3. Wait, but each CH2 has two H's. So the central carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (the two CH2's). So the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, right? So it's not chiral and can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the central carbon is CH2, then it's not a stereogenic center because it doesn't have four different substituents. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but then why is this option an option? Because I'm looking at another compound.

The other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Fumaric acid is a diacid with the structure HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. The trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3 (but the substituents on each end are COOCH3 groups, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, with substituents trans. So the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But wait, more accurately, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So its structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans version: the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would have the same structure but with OMe groups instead of OH.

So structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 
|
C=C
|
O=C-OCH3
O

Wait, no. Let me get the exact structure. Fumarate is the trans-diaxial isomer of maleate. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Therefore, the structure is:

O=C-OCH3
|
C=C (trans)
|
O=C-OCH3

Wait, but when you have a double bond, the substituents are on opposite sides. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule chiral. Because the two ester groups are identical, but the double bond's configuration (E) can lead to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but wait. If the two substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (COOCH3), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So, would this molecule have optical isomerism?

Hmm, because for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry, leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is trans (E configuration). The substituents on each end are the same (two COOCH3 groups). So the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. That means it's not chiral. Because the two halves are mirror images, so the molecule is achiral. So it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, so then why is dimethyl fumarate an option for showing optical isomerism? Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule is symmetrical. Because each end is a mirror image. So the molecule is not chiral.

Wait, so neither of these compounds can show optical isomerism? But that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me re-examine it.

Earlier, I thought that the central carbon (CH2) can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (two CH2 groups). So, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center and can't show optical isomerism.

So, if that's correct, then among the two given compounds, which can show optical isomerism?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon is CH2. So, substituents are two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. Wait, but the two CH2 groups are identical, right? So the central carbon has two CH2 groups, which are the same. So substituents: two same (CH2), one OH, one COOCH3. So four different groups? No, because two of them are the same.

Wait, no. The four substituents would be: CH2OH (from the first carbon), CH2COOCH3 (from the third), and two H's. Wait, no, the central carbon is CH2. So, it's connected to:

- One CH2OH group (from the first carbon),

- One CH2COOCH3 group (from the third),

- Two hydrogen atoms.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the central carbon is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons),

- One OH,

- One COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think of the structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, connected to the first (CH2OH), the third (COOCH3), and two H's.

So the substituents on the second carbon are: CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. So two of them are H's, so it's not a chiral center because you need four different groups. So it can't have optical isomerism.

What about dimethyl fumarate?

As discussed, the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH2–CH2–C(O)OCH3? No, wait. No, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH2–CH2–C(O)OCH3? No, no, wait, fumarate is HO2C–CH=CH–COOH, but in the trans configuration.

So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH=CH–C(O)OCH3, but in trans configuration. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O=C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O=C-OCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration. So the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. Hence, it's not chiral. So it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, so neither of these compounds can show optical isomerism? But that can't be right because the question expects us to choose between them.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the substituents on either side are identical (COOCH3 groups) but on opposite sides. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, then both compounds can't show optical isomerism? That can't be because the options suggest that one of them does. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another approach: maybe I got the structures wrong. Let me think about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate again. Is there a possibility that the structure has a chiral center?

Wait, another possibility: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate could be (CH3)CO-O-CH2-OH. No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2COH-O-CO-OCH3? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let me think. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2, with substituents: two CH2 groups (maybe the same), an OH, and a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. What about the possibility of the molecule being in an enol form, making it chiral? But I don't think that's relevant here. The question is about the compounds in their given forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is in a position that allows for a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Another approach: the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is C4H8O3. Let's count the carbons: methyl (1), then the propanoate part has three carbons, but with a hydroxyl on the second. So, yes, CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon is CH2, which is attached to OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. So substituents are: two H's, OH, and CH2COOCH3. So the groups are not all different, so it can't be a chiral center.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, but then what about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the symmetry. Let me think. In dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral. So it can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but then both compounds can't show optical isomerism, which contradicts the options, because the options have B as either methyl or dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the molecule is chiral due to the arrangement of substituents around the double bond. But if the substituents on each end are identical, the molecule can't have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound.

Wait, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, which is a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So the molecule is not chiral and can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the structure is a meso compound, then it's not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, according to this analysis, neither of the compounds can show optical isomerism, but that can't be correct because the question states that one of them does.

Am I missing something? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about the structures. What about another possibility: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate could have a different structure that allows for a chiral center.

Wait, another structure: could it be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3? So the central carbon (number 2) has substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. That would make it a chiral center because all four substituents are different.

Wait, that's possible. So if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3, then the central carbon (number 2) has CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So four different groups: yes, that would be a chiral center. So the molecule would show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. The name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So:

Structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which I thought earlier has a CH2 in the center. But if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, then the name would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Because the chain would be CH3, then CH(OH), then COOCH3.

Wait, but the IUPAC name depends on the longest chain. Hmm. Let me think. The longest chain would be three carbons. The functional group is the ester (COOCH3), so the chain is numbered from that end. So the positions would be 1 (COOCH3), 2 (C(OH)), 3 (CH3).

So the structure would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the second carbon has CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So this molecule can show optical isomerism.

Wait, but how does that fit with the formula. So the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, that makes the molecule have a chiral center. So this compound would exhibit optical isomerism.

Then, the other compound, dimethyl fumarate, as discussed, can't show optical isomerism because it's a meso compound.

So for part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate cannot.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which wouldn't have a chiral center. But perhaps I was wrong, and the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which would have a chiral center.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in how I constructed the structure. Let me clarify: the IUPAC name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The parent chain is propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH.

The substituent is hydroxyl on the second carbon: so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain with the ester group on the third carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups (the first and third), an OH, and a H (since it's CH2). So four substituents: two CH2 groups, OH, and H.

Wait, because CH2 is connected to two CH2 groups (the first and third carbons), which are same. So the substituents are: two same (CH2 groups), OH, and H. So the central carbon can't have four different groups, so no chiral center. So this would mean that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can't show optical isomerism.

So, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. I think I must have made a mistake in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which would have a chiral center at the second carbon. How would that fit the IUPAC name?

The IUPAC name would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

In that structure, the propanoate part is three carbons: CH3, C(OH)H, COOCH3.

So the substituents are:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH)H (so that's a CH(OH) group)

Carbon 3: COOCH3

So, the substituents on carbon 2 are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H.

So all four substituents are different, hence it's a chiral center.

But wait, wait. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is three carbons. The longest chain is from the ester group to the hydroxyl. So if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, then the ester is on carbon 3. The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the substituents on carbon 2 are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So yes, four different groups, making it chiral.

But wait, that would make the structure CH3-C(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the chain is three carbons. So the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which has a chiral center at C2.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism.

Then, why did I get confused earlier? Because perhaps I was thinking of the structure as CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct structure.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as methyl 2-hydroxybutanoate? No, I think I'm mixing up the names. Let me think. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 connected to the third carbon.

Second carbon: connected to OH and two CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find another approach. If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, it can show optical isomerism. Otherwise, it can't.

If I'm correct that it does have a chiral center, then part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But then, the other option is dimethyl fumarate. If dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it doesn't show optical isomerism. So the correct answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, putting it all together:

Part A: the compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Because it's symmetric, so any tautomer would be the same as the keto form.

Part B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism because it has a chiral center.

Looking at the options:

Option B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, no, according to our analysis, A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options, option A is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Alternatively, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, according to our analysis, A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so part A is correct in options A and C) and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so part B is correct in options A and B). So the correct option is A) A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl.

But wait, earlier I thought that benzoquinone can show tautomerism, so part A's correct answer is the one that doesn't show tautomerism, which is cyclohexane.

So the correct answer is option A: A is cyclohexane, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties as follows:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. It can undergo tautomerism, as it can exist in both keto and enol forms. The enol form involves conjugated double bonds, which are possible due to the aromatic ring's flexibility.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Due to its symmetry, any enol form would be identical to the keto form, making tautomerism impossible. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. The second carbon (C2) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, this compound can show optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration). This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it cannot show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **A**: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

**Answer: A**
