Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction or maybe something related to elimination or addition reactions. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and iodine are used in the preparation of HI, but when HI is in excess, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else? Or maybe it's about removing functional groups.

Wait, wait. Oh, I think this is about the elimination of carbonyl groups. Oh right, the Wolff-Kishner reaction! It's used to remove carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, by converting them into methylene groups. But wait, in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid derivative, but wait no, the molecule has a cyclohexene ring, a formyl group, and a vinyl group.

Wait, let me think. The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring (so already has a double bond), with substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), no wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached. So, the ring has substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH2CH2?), no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's a CH2CH2 group? No, wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the ring has a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene), so the double bonds are at 3 and in the vinyl group at position 5. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with double bonds between C3 and C4, a formyl group at C2, and a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) Wait, no, a vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is CH2-CH2? No, wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is a CH2=CH– group attached. So, the substituent is a double bond as well.

So, the molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), a formyl group (which is a carbonyl, so that's another double bond, but it's part of a carbonyl), and a vinyl group (another double bond). So the starting material has multiple double bonds.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus and HI... I think this is more about dehydrohalogenation or maybe the formation of a diiodide, but wait, another possibility is that this is a deoxygenative decarboxylation. Wait, but wait, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the reaction is removing the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but carboxylic acids aren't directly reactive with HI and P, but maybe in the presence of a base or something else. Or is there another reaction happening? Oh, wait, maybe it's a reaction to remove the carbonyl group.

Wait, in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, you have a carbonyl group (like ketone or aldehyde) treated with a hydrazine to form a hydrazone, then heated under strongly basic conditions (like with NaOH and high heat) to eliminate N2 and form a methylene group. But this seems different because the reagents are red phosphorus and HI.

Oh! Wait, perhaps it's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but that's for reducing ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, but in this case, maybe the reagents are different. Alternatively, the reaction could be the reduction of the carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when a carbonyl is treated with H-I, perhaps it undergoes some kind of addition. But the presence of red phosphorus makes me think it's a different reaction. Oh, wait! I remember that in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can act as a source of iodide ions, and this can lead to the formation of a ylide, which can then participate in some reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the carbonyl group. The starting material is a carboxylic acid, but wait, the compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is at position, perhaps, 1 or 6? Let me think about the numbering. The numbering is such that the formyl is at position 2, the vinyl at 5, and the cyclohexene at position 3. So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Because cyclohexene would be positions 3-4, so the substituents are at 2, 3, 5? Wait, no, cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond, so the positions are such that the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, regardless of the exact structure, perhaps the reaction is the removal of the formyl and carboxylic acid groups. So, when 2-formyl-... is treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is reduced. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is converted into something else.

Wait, but another thought: red phosphorus and HI could be used in the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can deoxygenate carbonyl groups to form alkanes. Oh, right! I think that's right. When a carbonyl group (like aldehyde or ketone) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes deoxygenation, turning into a methylene group (CH2). So, the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2.

So, in this case, the formyl group at position 2 would become CH2. Similarly, the carboxylic acid group at position (wherever it is) would also undergo reaction. Wait, but carboxylic acids are generally not directly deoxygenated under these conditions. Or maybe they are. Or perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted into an acid chloride first, but that's not the case here.

Wait, no, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. How does that react with red phosphorus and HI? Maybe it's not the case. Another possibility: perhaps the carboxylic acid group is decarboxylated. Decarboxylation typically occurs under certain conditions, like heating with a base. But in this case, maybe the reaction is different.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of the possible reactions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the dehydrohalogenation or perhaps the formation of ylides. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the formyl group.

Wait, another approach: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the sum of double bonds, rings, and triple bonds. Each double bond or ring counts as one, a triple bond as two. So, if the product has fewer rings or double bonds, the index would decrease.

The starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), a formyl group (so another double bond, but in a carbonyl), and a vinyl group (another double bond). So, the starting material has three double bonds? Or is the vinyl group part of the ring's substituent? Wait, the vinyl group is an exocyclic double bond, so that's another double bond.

So, the starting molecule has:

- Cyclohexene: one double bond.

- Formyl group: one double bond (C=O).

- Vinyl group: one double bond (CH2=CH–).

So, that's three double bonds. So, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.

Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, what changes? If the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group, that would remove one double bond. Similarly, the vinyl group might undergo some addition or elimination.

Wait, another thing: the vinyl group is a substituent. If the reaction conditions cause the vinyl group to undergo hydrogenation, that would add H and remove the double bond. But I don't think HI and red phosphorus would hydrogenate it; that's usually done with H2 and a catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the HI is adding to the vinyl group. Wait, but excess HI might lead to complete addition. So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) might become CH2CH2I? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, it might add HI across the double bond, leading to CH2I-CH2–, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the reaction might be more about deoxygenation of the formyl group. So, the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2O something? Or CH2.

Wait, I think in the case of a formyl group, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it gets deoxygenated to a methyl group. So, the CHO becomes CH2. So, that removes the carbonyl double bond.

Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) might undergo some reaction. But with excess HI, perhaps it adds across the double bond, making it a single bond. So, the vinyl group becomes CH2CH2–, but that's just a single bond, so another double bond is removed.

Wait, but adding HI to a vinyl group would likely lead to a vicinal diiodide. So, CH2=CH– would become CH2I-CH2I? No, wait, that's not correct. Adding HI to a double bond would probably form an alkyl iodide. So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) would add HI, becoming CH2I-CH2–. But that's a single bond, so the double bond is gone. So, that's another double bond lost.

Additionally, the cyclohexene ring (the ring's double bond) might react. With HI and red phosphorus, I'm not sure if the ring's double bond would be affected. Maybe it's possible that the ring could undergo addition. So, cyclohexene (C6H10) would add HI to become C6H11I.

Wait, but if the ring's double bond is added to, that would remove another double bond. So, let's count:

Original double bonds:

1. Cyclohexene ring: 1

2. Formyl group: 1

3. Vinyl group:1

Total: 3.

After reaction:

- Formyl becomes CH2 → removes 1.

- Vinyl adds HI → becomes single bond → removes 1.

- If the cyclohexene adds HI → becomes single bond → removes 1.

So, all three double bonds are gone. So, the product would have no double bonds, so the index of hydrogen deficiency would be 0.

Wait, but the starting material is a cyclohexene ring; that's a ring (so that's one double bond, but actually, a ring contributes to the index as 1, regardless of whether it's a cycloalkane, cycloalkene, etc. Because a cycloalkene has a ring and a double bond, but the index counts each ring and each double bond as one, so cyclohexene would contribute 2 (one for the ring, one for the double bond).

Wait, wait, no. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as:

Index = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Where C is number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, N nitrogens (but in this case, no N).

Alternatively, the index is the sum of the degrees of unsaturation. Each double bond, each ring, each triple bond (counts as two) contributes to the index.

So, the starting material:

The structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene ring: 6-membered ring with one double bond. So, that's one ring (counts as 1) and one double bond (counts as 1) → total 2.

- Formyl group: CHO. That's a carbonyl group, which is a double bond → +1.

- Vinyl group: CH2=CH–. Another double bond → +1.

So, the total degrees of unsaturation (index of hydrogen deficiency) is 2 (from the ring and double bond in cyclohexene) + 1 (formyl) +1 (vinyl) = 4.

Wait, that's 4. Oh wait, because cyclohexene is a 6-membered ring with one double bond. The formula for cyclohexene is C6H10. The general formula for cycloalkane is CnH2n. For cyclohexene, n=6: C6H10. The degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. Which accounts for one ring and one double bond (so 2).

Then, the formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl, which is one double bond → adds +1.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) is another double bond → +1.

So, total is 2 (from cyclohexene) +1 (CHO) +1 (vinyl) = 4.

So, the starting material has an index of 4.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about what each reaction does.

Red phosphorus and HI can be used to deoxygenate carbonyl groups. So, the formyl group (CHO) → becomes CH2.

But wait, wait, how about the carboxylic acid group? The molecule is a carboxylic acid. So, it's the -COOH group attached to the ring. What happens to that under these reaction conditions?

Another thought: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, carboxylic acids can undergo decarboxylation. Wait, but what reaction conditions cause that? Decarboxylation of carboxylic acids typically requires heating, sometimes with a catalyst. Alternatively, the presence of a strong base or something else. But red phosphorus and HI may not directly cause that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is being converted into a methyl group. Because, as in the case of formyl group deoxygenation, the carboxylic acid could be reduced. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction removes the carboxylic acid group as CO2 or something else.

Wait, let's think about the product. If the formyl group becomes CH2 (removing a double bond, so index decreases by 1), and the vinyl group becomes a single bond (so another decrease by 1), and the cyclohexene ring remains as a single bond? Or does the ring also get hydrogenated.

Alternatively, maybe the ring's double bond is also removed.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are not typically used for hydrogenation. That usually requires H2 and a catalyst.

So, perhaps the cyclohexene ring remains as is. So, that would contribute two to the index (one ring, one double bond). But wait, if the ring's double bond is still present, then it's still a double bond. But if the reaction adds HI across the ring's double bond, then the ring becomes a single bond, which would remove the double bond, but the ring would still contribute one to the index (as a ring without a double bond, but cyclohexane is a single ring with no double bonds, so the degree is 1 for the ring).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently.

Let me imagine the structure:

The ring is cyclohexene (so 6-membered, one double bond). At position 2 is a formyl group (CHO). At position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH–). And the ring has a carboxylic acid group at another position, perhaps position 1.

So, the structure would look something like:

- The ring is cyclohexene (double bond between C3 and C4).

- At C2: formyl (CHO).

- At C5: CH2=CH– (vinyl group).

- At position, say, C1: COOH.

So, when treated with red phosphorus and excess HI.

First, the formyl group (CHO) reacts. It's deoxygenated, turning into CH2. So, formyl (CHO) → CH2. That removes one degree of unsaturation (the C=O double bond).

Second, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) would react. With excess HI, perhaps the double bond in the vinyl group opens up, adding HI across it. So, CH2=CH– would become CH2I-CH2–. That removes the double bond from the vinyl group, decreasing the index by one.

Third, the cyclohexene ring's double bond is between C3 and C4. Would this react with HI? HI in the presence of red phosphorus is a source of iodide and H+. It might add across the double bond. So, the cyclohexene (C3-C4 double bond) would add HI, turning into a single bond, so the ring becomes a cyclohexane, but with an iodide substituent. So, the ring's double bond is gone, so that's another degree of unsaturation removed.

Wait, but when adding HI to a cyclohexene ring, you would get a vicinal diiodide? No, wait, adding HI (H+ and I–) to a double bond would lead to an alkyl iodide. So, the cyclohexene would become cyclohexane with an iodide substituent. So, the ring's double bond is gone, so that's one degree removed.

Additionally, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1: how does that react? Red phosphorus and HI might not directly react with a carboxylic acid, but perhaps the conditions are such that it gets deoxygenated. Wait, another thought: the carboxylic acid could be converted into an acid chloride, but that's not directly relevant here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is removing the COOH group as CO2, which would involve decarboxylation.

But for decarboxylation to occur, the carboxylic acid needs to be activated, perhaps as an ester or something else. Without that, under these conditions (red phosphorus and HI), I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group is converted into an iodide. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is reduced. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI are strong enough reducing agents for that. Wait, but in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can act as a reducing agent. So, maybe the COOH group is reduced to CH2OH. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is deprotonated under the reaction conditions, but I don't think that leads to any change in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is converted into CH2, but that would require a reduction.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible products.

If formyl (CHO) becomes CH2: that's a reduction, removing the carbonyl.

Vinyl (CH2=CH–) after adding HI becomes CH2I-CH2–, which is a single bond.

Cyclohexene ring adds HI, so becomes a cyclohexane with iodide.

And the COOH group: perhaps it remains as is, or it's converted into something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the COOH group is decarboxylated, meaning it loses CO2, turning into a methyl group. So, COOH → CH2.

If that's the case, then the COOH group would reduce from -COOH to -CH2–, which would remove a double bond (the carbonyl in COOH), so that's another degree of unsaturation removed.

So, let's tally up.

Original index: 4.

After reactions:

- Formyl (CHO → CH2): -1.

- Vinyl (CH2=CH– → CH2CH2I): -1.

- Cyclohexene (C6H10 → C6H11I): -1.

- COOH → CH2: -1.

So, total decrease is 4, bringing index from 4 to 0.

But wait, does the COOH group actually get converted into CH2 under these conditions?

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the reagents again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups. So, the formyl group is a carbonyl and would be deoxygenated. The COOH group is also a carbonyl, so perhaps it's also deoxygenated.

So, COOH → CH2, which would remove the carbonyl group, thus another degree.

So, all four degrees are removed.

So, the product would have no double bonds, no rings, and no triple bonds. So, the index would be 0.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.

Wait, but wait. The product after these reactions would have a cyclohexane ring (so one degree for the ring), but if the ring's double bond was added to, then the ring is now cyclohexane, so the index for the ring is 1 (a six-membered ring is one degree). So, let me re-calculate.

If the cyclohexene ring adds HI, it becomes a cyclohexane with an iodide substituent. So, the ring is still a ring, so that's one degree. Plus, the iodide isn't a double bond, so no other degrees from that.

So, the ring contributes 1 degree.

Now, the formyl group is gone (CH2), so that's -1.

The vinyl group is gone (CH2CH2I?), contributing -1.

The COOH group is converted to CH2, so that's -1.

So, total original index was 4.

Now, after reactions, what's left?

- Ring: 1.

- Any other double bonds?

If the cyclohexane is formed, no double bonds. If the vinyl group was converted into a single bond, that's gone. The formyl group is converted into CH2, so gone. The COOH is converted into CH2, so gone.

So, the only degree of unsaturation is the ring (1). So, the index would be 1.

Wait, but that's option A.

Wait, this is conflicting with earlier reasoning. Let me structure this.

Original structure:

- Cyclohexene (ring + double bond) → 2.

- Formyl (CHO) → +1.

- Vinyl (CH2=CH–) → +1.

Total: 4.

After reaction with HI and red phosphorus:

- Formyl → CH2: removes 1.

- Vinyl → CH2CH2I: removes 1.

- Cyclohexene → cyclohexane (ring, which is 1) but no double bond → so that was 2, now becomes 1.

Wait, wait. The ring contributes 1 (as a ring), and the double bond in the ring was another 1. So, when the ring's double bond is removed, that's minus 1. So, the ring's contribution goes from 2 to 1: so the index for the ring is 1.

COOH group: if it's converted into CH2, that removes 1 (the carbonyl double bond).

So, let's recount:

Original index: 4.

After reactions:

- Formyl: -1 → now 3.

- Vinyl: -1 → now 2.

- Cyclohexene: -1 (from 2 to 1) → now 1.

- COOH: -1 → now 0.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up the contributions.

Wait, the initial index is 4, which includes all the degrees of unsaturation.

After reactions, the cyclohexene ring adds HI, so its double bond is gone. So, it contributes only 1 (the ring), not 2.

So, the new index is:

- Ring (cyclohexane): 1.

- Any other double bonds?

The vinyl group is now a single bond, so no.

The formyl group is CH2, so no.

The COOH group is CH2, so no.

So, the only degree is the ring → index 1.

So, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.

Which would be option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the COOH group. If the COOH group is still present as a carbonyl, then that would add another degree. But if it's converted to CH2, that would remove it.

So, in the reaction, the COOH group is at position 1. Under red phosphorus and HI, would it be deoxygenated?

If yes, then it's -1.

If not, it remains, contributing another degree.

So, if COOH is deoxygenated, the index is 1 (from the ring). If not, the index is 2.

But I'm not certain whether the COOH group is deoxygenated under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is not directly reacting, so it remains as a carbonyl, contributing another degree.

But wait, COOH is a carboxylic acid, which is a carbonyl group. So, if the reagents deoxygenate all carbonyl groups, including COOH, then the COOH group would be converted into CH2, removing that degree.

So, in that case, after all reactions, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (1 degree).

No other double bonds.

So, index is 1.

Thus, the answer would be A) 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought the index would be 0. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group remains, so the index would be 2.

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a complete dehalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let me think about the overall structure after the reactions.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

After reaction:

- Formyl (CHO) → CH2.

- Vinyl (CH2=CH–) → CH2CH2I? Or maybe becomes CH2CH2 (but that's not possible without H2).

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group adds HI, becoming CH2I-CH2–.

The cyclohexene (ring with double bond) → adds HI, becoming cyclohexane with an iodide substituent.

The COOH group: if it's deoxygenated, becomes CH2.

So, the product would be:

2-CH2-5-(CH2CH2I)-cyclohexyl-CH2.

Wait, but the exact structure isn't necessary. What's important is the number of double bonds and rings.

So, the ring is now a cyclohexane → one ring (degree 1).

The formyl and vinyl groups are now single bonds, so no double bonds (degrees removed).

The COOH is converted to CH2 → removing its carbonyl (another degree).

So, the index would be 1 (from the ring) + 0 (other double bonds) = 1.

Thus, the index is 1 → option A.

But wait, earlier I thought the index would be 0. So, which is correct?

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group does not react, so it remains as a carbonyl, contributing another degree. So, index would be 1 (ring) + 1 (COOH) = 2.

But I think the reaction conditions would deoxygenate all carbonyl groups, including COOH.

Wait, COOH is a carboxylic acid, which has the structure RCOOH. The carbonyl is part of the COOH group. So, if the reagents deoxygenate all carbonyl groups, the COOH would be converted to RCH2.

So, that would mean the COOH group is also deoxygenated.

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexane ring (degree 1).

- No double bonds from any other groups.

Thus, index is 1.

So, the answer is A) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of the degrees of unsaturation, where each double bond, ring, or triple bond contributes one degree, and each triple bond contributes two degrees. The starting compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:

1. **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond, contributing **2 degrees of unsaturation** (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: A carbonyl group with a double bond, contributing **1 degree of unsaturation**.
3. **Vinyl group (CH₂=CH–)**: A double bond, contributing **1 degree of unsaturation**.
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: A carbonyl group with a double bond, contributing **1 degree of unsaturation**.

Thus, the total index of hydrogen deficiency for the starting compound is **4**.

When the compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations occur:

1. **Formyl group (CHO)**: The carbonyl group is deoxygenated to a methylene group (CH₂), removing **1 degree of unsaturation**.
2. **Vinyl group (CH₂=CH–)**: The double bond is saturated by the addition of HI, converting it to CH₂CH₂I, removing **1 degree of unsaturation**.
3. **Cyclohexene ring**: The double bond in the ring is saturated by the addition of HI, converting the cyclohexene to cyclohexane, removing **1 degree of unsaturation**.
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: The carbonyl group is deoxygenated to a methylene group (CH₂), removing **1 degree of unsaturation**.

After these transformations, the product contains:

- A cyclohexane ring (1 degree of unsaturation due to the ring).
- No remaining double bonds or other degrees of unsaturation.

Thus, the final index of hydrogen deficiency for the product is **1**, corresponding to the single degree of unsaturation from the cyclohexane ring.

**Answer: A**
