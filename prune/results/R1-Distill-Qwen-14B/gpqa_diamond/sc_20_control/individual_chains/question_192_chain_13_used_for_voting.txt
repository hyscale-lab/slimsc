Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The problem is about a spherical conductor with a cavity. The conductor is uncharged, which probably means it doesn't have any net charge initially. There's a small spherical cavity inside it, and the centers of the cavity and the conductor are separated by a distance s. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, the radius of the conductor. So the cavity is entirely within the conductor, but it's not at the center of the conductor.

Now, they place a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to P is L, and from the center of the cavity to P is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor itself is zero. But wait, this is a conductor with a cavity. So the charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor.

Wait, right. When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor gets induced charges opposite to the enclosed charge. So in this case, a +q inside would cause the inner surface to have -q. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q as well. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, so inner surface is -q, so the outer surface must be +q to balance it.

But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, so its total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the conductor as a whole is uncharged, but it's as if the inner and outer surfaces have charges.

But for the electric field outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer charges. Because the conductor's material ensures that the charges on the outer surface are what contribute to the external field. The charges inside the conductor (the induced ones) don't contribute to the external field since the conductor's material shields them.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there would be the same as if all the charge on the conductor were concentrated at its center. Or wait, no, because the conductor is neutral overall, but the outer surface has +q. Hmm, so the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside should be as if a charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, no, because the conductor was initially uncharged, and the cavity had +q, so the inner surface of the conductor has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the total charge on the conductor is zero because outer + inner (-q) = +q - q = 0? No, wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the inner surface is -q, so the outer surface must be +q to make the total conductor's charge zero (-q + q = 0). So the conductor itself behaves as if it has a charge of +q on the outside.

So the point P is outside the conductor. The field at P would be due to the +q on the outer surface. Since the conductor is a sphere, the field outside should be the same as that of a point charge +q at the center.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's outer surface has charge +q, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field at P is as if all the charge +q is at the center. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because for a point charge, the electric field outside is inverse square.

Looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems to fit.

But wait, the problem mentions the point P's distance from the center of the cavity is l, and there's an angle θ involved. Wait, the problem statement says, "The distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is l. Here, l, L > R. The angle between l and s is θ."

Oh, so the setup is more complex than I thought. Let me visualize this. The cavity is inside the conductor, but it's not at the center. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. So the conductor's center is at point O, the cavity's center is at point O', and the distance OO' is s. Then, point P is located somewhere outside the conductor, and its distance from O is L, and from O' is l. The angle between OO' and OP is θ.

Wait, so the point P is at a position where its distance from O' is l, and the line from O' to P makes an angle θ with the line from O to O'.

So, from the conductor's center O, the point P is at distance L, and from the cavity's center O', it's at distance l. The angle between OO' and OP is θ.

So, the displacement vector from O' to P would have components along OO' and perpendicular to it. So the line from O' to P is at an angle θ from OO'.

So, l and s and θ form a triangle perhaps? Let me think about the positions.

Wait, the conductor's radius is R, and the point P is outside, so L is greater than R. Similarly, l is greater than R as well.

But how does this affect the electric field? Let me think. So, since the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, the field outside the conductor is as if all that charge is concentrated at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the cavity is located, the external field is the same as that of a point charge at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait. What about the inner charge? The charge inside the cavity is +q, which causes the inner surface to have -q, and the outer surface +q. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, but the outer surface has +q.

So, the electric field outside the conductor at any point depends only on the charge on the outer surface. So, it's the same as a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor.

Thus, the electric field at point P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², regardless of where P is located outside. Because the conductor shields the inner charges, and the outer charges are symmetrically distributed. So the field outside only depends on the charge of the outer surface and the distance from the center.

So looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, why are the other options presented? Let's think about other possibilities.

Option A is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (l - s cosθ)^2. That's using l and s and the angle, but I don't think that's right because the field outside the conductor is determined by the charge on the outer surface, which is located at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center of the conductor (which is L) is what matters.

Option C uses (l + s cosθ)^2. Hmm, that would be the case if the charge was at O', but it's not. The charge is on the outer surface of the conductor, which is at O. So even if the point P is at a certain angle, the field is based on L.

Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / l². That would be the case if the charge were at O', but it's not. The charge is on the conductor's outer surface, so it's at O, not O'.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves a spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, where $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Conductor Properties**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the total charge on the conductor is zero. The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor develops a charge $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium depends only on the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. The inner charges (induced on the inner surface) do not contribute to the external field due to shielding. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is determined by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Symmetry**: The conductor is spherical, and the charges on its outer surface are distributed symmetrically. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor at any point depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor, which is $L$ in this case. The distance $l$ from the center of the cavity and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the external field because the field is determined by the charge on the outer surface, located at the center of the conductor.

4. **Electric Field Expression**: The electric field due to a point charge $+q$ at a distance $L$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   This matches the expression in option B.

Analysis of the options:
- **Option A**: \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2}\) is incorrect because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, not on $l$ or $\theta$.
- **Option B**: \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}\) is correct because it correctly represents the electric field due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor at a distance $L$.
- **Option C**: \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2}\) is incorrect for the same reason as option A.
- **Option D**: \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}\) is incorrect because it assumes the charge is located at the center of the cavity, which is not the case.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
