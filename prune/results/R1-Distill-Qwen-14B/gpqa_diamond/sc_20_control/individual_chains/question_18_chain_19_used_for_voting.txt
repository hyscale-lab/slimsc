Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. Alright, let's read the question carefully.

We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses are relevant for this particular question. The problem gives us some elemental abundances using the EW method under LTE assumptions. 

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. 

Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms? So like, (n_Si1 / n_Si2) or (n_Si2 / n_Si1)? The question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So probably n_Si1 / n_Si2. Or maybe the other way around? Hmm, the options are all positive, so I need to clarify that.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → So log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=10^(-5)

I think I need to find the [Si/H] for both stars, then calculate the ratio of their silicon abundances.

Wait, because [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(n_X/n_Y)_Sun. So to find [X/Y], we can find the ratio relative to the Sun.

Let me think: For Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. So Fe/H is same as Sun. So [Fe/H]_1=0 means (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → which is 10^(0) =1. So nFe1/nH1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * (Fe/H)_1 = same as Sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun for Mg/H.

But what about [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → which is (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 times (Si/Fe)_sun.

Wait, no. Because [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) → which is log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) ) → which is log( (nX * nY_sun) / (nY * nX_sun) )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → means log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) =0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3

But since [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1/nH_sun)

Wait, because nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → so nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1 / nH_sun)

But for Star_1, nH1 is the hydrogen density. But since in stellar atmospheres, the total number density is often assumed same, but I think for the purpose of these ratios, we can proceed as is.

So let's model this step by step.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is same as Sun. So nFe1 / nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → so nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1. But since in the denominator, nH will be present, perhaps it's better to think in terms of ratios.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1/nH_sun), so nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1) / (nH_sun).

So substituting into (nSi1/nFe1):

nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 → but nFe1 is (nFe_sun * nH1) / (nH_sun) → so nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 * nFe1.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach would be better. Let's express [X/H] for the star in terms of the Sun.

For Star 1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is same as Sun → So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

For Star 1: [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → so (nSi1/nFe1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)

So substituting nFe1 = (nFe_sun * nH1) / (nH_sun) → because nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun)

Then, (nSi1/nFe1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun)

So nSi1 = (10^0.3 * nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * nFe1

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun * nH1) / (nH_sun) → so nSi1 = 10^0.3 * nSi_sun / nFe_sun * nFe_sun * nH1 / nH_sun → The nFe_sun cancels → nSi1 = 10^0.3 * nSi_sun * nH1 / nH_sun.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is on the right track. Maybe instead, let's think in terms of [X/H] for silicon.

Wait, what is [Si/H]_1? Because [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 is given, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

So [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe/H= Sun. So [Fe/H]=0 → (Fe/H) = (Fe/H)_sun → which implies that nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → So, nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 /nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (log(nSi1/nFe1) ) - (log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)) =0.3 → log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3.

But nFe1 is nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

So substituting nFe1 into nSi1:

nSi1 = (nFe1) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 → nSi1 = (nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun)) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 → The nFe_sun cancels, so nSi1 = nSi_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, but nH1 is the number of hydrogens in Star 1. How does that compare to the Sun's?

Hmm, perhaps I should express [Si/H]_1, which would be log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

From above, nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) / nH1 → So nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0.3 → So [Si/H]_1 = log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) → log(10^0.3 )=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star 1's [Si/H] is 0.3.

Similarly, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_2 as well.

Now, looking at Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (nMg2/nSi2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun).

So from [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, we have nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

But nMg2 is also (nMg_sun * nH2 /nH_sun) → because [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = nMg_sun * nH2 /nH_sun.

So equate the two expressions for nMg2:

nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH2/nH_sun) = (1 /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Wait, solving for nSi2:

nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^-0.3.

Wait, wait, let me check that.

Wait, from above: nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH2/nH_sun) = (1 /nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Multiply both sides by nSi_sun:

nSi_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) = 10^0.3 * nSi2.

So, nSi2 = (nSi_sun *nH2/nH_sun) * 10^-0.3.

So, the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 is [nSi1 /nSi2] = [ (nSi_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) ] / [ (nSi_sun * nH2/nH_sun) *10^-0.3 ) ]

Simplify this:

(nSi1/nSi2) = [ (10^0.3) * (nH1/nH_sun) ] / [ (10^-0.3) * (nH2/nH_sun) ) ] → The nH_sun terms cancel.

Which becomes (10^0.3 /10^-0.3) * (nH1/nH2) → 10^(0.6) * (nH1/nH2).

Wait, 10^0.3 /10^-0.3 =10^(0.3 +0.3)=10^0.6.

So, (nSi1/nSi2) = 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2).

But I don't know the ratio of nH1/nH2. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe nH is the same in both stars? Or is it about the overall abundance? Or perhaps the ratio of H is determined by their metallicity? Or perhaps, since [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, and [Mg/H] for Star_2 is 0, maybe the H is the same in both? Or is that a wrong assumption?

Wait, wait. The [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H]_1=0, then (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → the same. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 =0 → same as Sun.

But in the Sun, we have the composition given. So for Star_1, (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → same.

But what about H? The number of H in a star's atmosphere depends on the overall metallicity. Wait, but typically, [Fe/H] is a measure of metallicity. But in this case, both stars have [Fe/H] equal to 0 for Star_1, and [Mg/H] 0 for Star_2. Wait, but Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars? Or do we have to find [H/Fe] for each?

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → so (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → that is, Fe is the same fraction of H as in the Sun.

So, the number of Fe atoms per H atom is same as the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun. But what about [Fe/H]_2? It's not given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the H abundance isn't directly given for each star. So I'm missing something. Let me think differently.

We need to find the silicon abundance ratio between the two stars. Let's think about it in terms of [Si/H] for each.

For Star_1:

We determined that [Si/H]_1=0.3. Because [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. And [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, let's find [Si/H]_2.

We can express [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

So, (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

But we also know [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → So, nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2.

Substituting into (nMg2/nSi2), we have:

( (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2 ) / nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 → Simplify:

(nH2 * nMg_sun) / (nH_sun *nSi2) ) = (nMg_sun *10^0.3) /nSi_sun.

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

nH2 / (nH_sun *nSi2) ) = 10^0.3 /nSi_sun → rearrange for nSi2:

nSi2 = (nH2 * nSi_sun ) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )

But nSi2 is the number of silicon atoms in Star_2. Now, what is [Si/H]_2? It's log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → so:

log(nSi2/nH2) = [Si/H]_2 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)

But from the expression for nSi2, nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3) → so (nSi2/nH2) = (nSi_sun)/(nH_sun *10^0.3) → So,

log( (nSi_sun)/(nH_sun *10^0.3) ) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) + log(1/(10^0.3)) → which is log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3 → So,

log(nSi2/nH2) = [Si/H]_2 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → but from above,

log(nSi2/nH2) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3 → So,

[Si/H]_2 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that can't be right. Or can it?

Wait, let me double-check.

nSi2 = (nH2 * nSi_sun )/(nH_sun * 10^0.3 )

So, nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/(10^0.3)).

So, nSi2/nH2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/(10^0.3 )) ) / nH2 → which is (nSi_sun/(10^0.3 nH_sun )) → So, (nSi2/nH2 ) = (nSi_sun / (nH_sun )) * 10^(-0.3 )

So, [Si/H]_2 = log( (nSi2/nH2) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) → which is log(10^(-0.3 )) → which is -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, now, we have [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, but that can't be the case. How? Because if [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, that means Star_1 has more silicon relative to hydrogen than the Sun. Star_2 has less. So the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 would be (10^0.3 )/(10^-0.3 )=10^0.6 → which is about 3.98, which is around 4. So the ratio would be ~4.

Wait, but the ratio is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) → because [Si/H]_1 is log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0.3 → (nSi1/nH1) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2= -0.3 → (nSi2/nH2) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = (10^0.3)/(10^-0.3) )=10^0.6.

So the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, about 4. So the answer would be option A: ~3.9.

Wait, but earlier I thought of the ratio as nSi1/nSi2, but that would require considering the hydrogen in each star. But according to this, the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) )=10^0.6. So the actual ratio of nSi1/nSi2 would be (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) = (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH2/nH1) → but wait, no, wait.

Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms is nSi1/nSi2. But nSi1 and nSi2 are the number of silicon atoms in each star, but their H might not be the same. So, to find the ratio of silicon atoms, perhaps we need to express each in terms of their hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) is 10^0.6 as we found. But how does that relate to the ratio of silicon atoms?

Hmm, perhaps the actual ratio of silicon atoms would be (nSi1 / nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nH1) * (nH1/nSi2) → Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) )=10^0.6 → which is the ratio of the silicon-to-hydrogen ratios.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So, perhaps it's (nSi1 / nSi2) → but we need to express both in terms of H.

Wait, maybe the photospheric composition is such that for each star, the hydrogen is the same as the Sun? But that can't be right because they have different [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem in terms of the number of atoms per hydrogen atom.

For Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2=-0.3 → nSi2/nH2=10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) )=10^0.6 = about 3.98.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms, which is nSi1/nSi2.

nSi1 = (nSi1/nH1) * nH1.

nSi2 = (nSi2/nH2) * nH2.

So, ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / ( (nSi2/nH2) *nH2 ) ) → = (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH1/nH2) → which is 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2).

But I don't know what nH1 and nH2 are. Hmm, this is a problem. Because the ratio depends on the ratio of H in each star.

Wait, but perhaps the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star's photosphere is the same? Or perhaps the hydrogen abundance is the same? Or is that not the case.

Wait, let's think about the metallicity. [Fe/H]_1=0 → same as sun. [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as sun.

But for Star_2, what about [Fe/H]_2? It's not given. So perhaps the H abundance is the same as the Sun for both stars? But that would mean nH1 =nH2 = same as Sun.

Wait, but no. Because [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun.

If nH1 is the same as the Sun, then nFe1 =nFe_sun.

But that's assuming same H, but stars can have different H densities.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the metallicity doesn't affect the H density. Or perhaps it's considering that the H density is the same in both stars? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars. Because [Fe/H]_1=0 implies same Fe/H as the Sun, but perhaps the H is same as the Sun. But that's not necessarily true because the star's atmosphere could have a different H. But without more info, perhaps we can assume that nH1 and nH2 are the same as the Sun's.

Wait, but the Sun's photosphere has a certain H, and each star's photosphere may have different H.

But maybe I can model it this way: since [Fe/H]_1=0, then the Fe abundance is same as Sun relative to H. So, nFe1 =nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg2=nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

But without knowing the H in each star, perhaps I can't find the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2. Because [Si/H]_1=0.3 and [Si/H]_2=-0.3, their ratio would be 10^0.3 /10^(-0.3)=10^0.6 as I found earlier.

But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which would depend on the absolute number. So if the H is same in both stars, then nSi1/nSi2=10^(0.6) ≈3.98.

But if H is different, the ratio changes. So perhaps the problem assumes that the H is same in both stars. Or perhaps they have same nH.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of nH1 and nH2 can be found from their [Fe/Mg] or something else.

Wait, earlier when trying to compute nSi2, I had:

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

But if Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given, perhaps I can't find much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of Si relative to H, so the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2)=10^0.6.

But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute (nSi1 / nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nSi2) ) → which seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) )=10^{0.6}, which would be approximately 3.98. Which is option A.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A) ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the definitions of stellar abundance ratios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - This implies (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun and (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

   Using [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the hydrogen-to-iron ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the silicon-to-iron ratio in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun. Combining these, the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is (nSi1/nH1) = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

   Thus, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - This implies (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun and (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.

   Using [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the hydrogen-to-magnesium ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the magnesium-to-silicon ratio in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun. Rearranging, the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is (nSi2/nH2) = 10^-0.3 × (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

   Thus, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{H1}})}{(n_{\text{Si2}}/n_{\text{H2}})} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H1}}}{n_{\text{H2}}}.
   \]
   From the abundances, \((n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{H1}}) = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si_sun}}/n_{\text{H_sun}})\) and \((n_{\text{Si2}}/n_{\text{H2}}) = 10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si_sun}}/n_{\text{H_sun}})\). Thus:
   \[
   \frac{(n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{H1}})}{(n_{\text{Si2}}/n_{\text{H2}})} = 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
   \]
   Assuming the hydrogen densities in the two stars are the same (\(n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{H2}}\)), the ratio simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
   \]
   Approximating \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately 3.9.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. Alright, let's read the question carefully.

We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses are relevant for this particular question. The problem gives us some elemental abundances using the EW method under LTE assumptions. 

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. 

Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms? So like, (n_Si1 / n_Si2) or (n_Si2 / n_Si1)? The question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So probably n_Si1 / n_Si2. Or maybe the other way around? Hmm, the options are all positive, so I need to clarify that.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → So log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=10^(-5)

I think I need to find the [Si/H] for both stars, then calculate the ratio of their silicon abundances.

Wait, because [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(n_X/n_Y)_Sun. So to find [X/Y], we can find the ratio relative to the Sun.

Let me think: For Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. So Fe/H is same as Sun. So [Fe/H]_1=0 means (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → which is 10^(0) =1. So nFe1/nH1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * (Fe/H)_1 = same as Sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun for Mg/H.

But what about [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → which is (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 times (Si/Fe)_sun.

Wait, no. Because [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) → which is log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) ) → which is log( (nX * nY_sun) / (nY * nX_sun) )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → means log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) =0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3

But since [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1/nH_sun)

Wait, because nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → so nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1 / nH_sun)

But for Star_1, nH1 is the hydrogen density. But since in stellar atmospheres, the total number density is often assumed same, but I think for the purpose of these ratios, we can proceed as is.

So let's model this step by step.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is same as Sun. So nFe1 / nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → so nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1. But since in the denominator, nH will be present, perhaps it's better to think in terms of ratios.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1/nH_sun), so nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1) / (nH_sun).

So substituting into (nSi1/nFe1):

nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 → but nFe1 is (nFe_sun * nH1) / (nH_sun) → so nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 * nFe1.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach would be better. Let's express [X/H] for the star in terms of the Sun.

For Star 1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is same as Sun → So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

For Star 1: [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → so (nSi1/nFe1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)

So substituting nFe1 = (nFe_sun * nH1) / (nH_sun) → because nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun)

Then, (nSi1/nFe1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun)

So nSi1 = (10^0.3 * nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * nFe1

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun * nH1) / (nH_sun) → so nSi1 = 10^0.3 * nSi_sun / nFe_sun * nFe_sun * nH1 / nH_sun → The nFe_sun cancels → nSi1 = 10^0.3 * nSi_sun * nH1 / nH_sun.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is on the right track. Maybe instead, let's think in terms of [X/H] for silicon.

Wait, what is [Si/H]_1? Because [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 is given, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

So [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe/H= Sun. So [Fe/H]=0 → (Fe/H) = (Fe/H)_sun → which implies that nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → So, nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 /nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (log(nSi1/nFe1) ) - (log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)) =0.3 → log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3.

But nFe1 is nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

So substituting nFe1 into nSi1:

nSi1 = (nFe1) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 → nSi1 = (nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun)) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 → The nFe_sun cancels, so nSi1 = nSi_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, but nH1 is the number of hydrogens in Star 1. How does that compare to the Sun's?

Hmm, perhaps I should express [Si/H]_1, which would be log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

From above, nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) / nH1 → So nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0.3 → So [Si/H]_1 = log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) → log(10^0.3 )=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star 1's [Si/H] is 0.3.

Similarly, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_2 as well.

Now, looking at Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (nMg2/nSi2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)*10^0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun).

So from [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, we have nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)*10^0.3 *nSi2.

But nMg2 is also (nMg_sun * nH2 /nH_sun) → because [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = nMg_sun * nH2 /nH_sun.

So equate the two expressions for nMg2:

nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH2/nH_sun) = (1 /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Wait, solving for nSi2:

nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^-0.3.

Wait, wait, let me check that.

Wait, from above: nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH2/nH_sun) = (1 /nSi_sun) *10^0.3 *nSi2.

Multiply both sides by nSi_sun:

nSi_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) = 10^0.3 * nSi2.

So, nSi2 = (nSi_sun *nH2/nH_sun) * 10^-0.3.

So, the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 is [nSi1 /nSi2] = [ (nSi_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) ] / [ (nSi_sun * nH2/nH_sun) *10^-0.3 ) ]

Simplify this:

(nSi1/nSi2) = [ (10^0.3) * (nH1/nH_sun) ] / [ (10^-0.3) * (nH2/nH_sun) ) ] → The nH_sun terms cancel.

Which becomes (10^0.3 /10^-0.3) * (nH1/nH2) → 10^(0.6) * (nH1/nH2).

Wait, 10^0.3 /10^-0.3 =10^(0.3 +0.3)=10^0.6.

So, (nSi1/nSi2) = 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2).

But I don't know the ratio of nH1/nH2. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe nH is the same in both stars? Or is it about the overall abundance? Or perhaps the ratio of H is determined by their metallicity? Or perhaps, since [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, and [Mg/H] for Star_2 is 0, maybe the H is the same in both? Or is that a wrong assumption?

Wait, wait. The [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H]_1=0, then (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → the same. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 =0 → same as Sun.

But in the Sun, we have the composition given. So for Star_1, (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → same.

But what about H? The number of H in a star's atmosphere depends on the overall metallicity. Wait, but typically, [Fe/H] is a measure of metallicity. But in this case, both stars have [Fe/H] equal to 0 for Star_1, and [Mg/H] 0 for Star_2. Wait, but Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars? Or do we have to find [H/Fe] for each?

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → so (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → that is, Fe is the same fraction of H as in the Sun.

So, the number of Fe atoms per H atom is same as the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun. But what about [Fe/H]_2? It's not given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the H abundance isn't directly given for each star. So I'm missing something. Let me think differently.

We need to find the silicon abundance ratio between the two stars. Let's think about it in terms of [Si/H] for each.

For Star_1:

We determined that [Si/H]_1=0.3. Because [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. And [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, let's find [Si/H]_2.

We can express [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

So, (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

But we also know [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → So, nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2.

Substituting into (nMg2/nSi2), we have:

( (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2 ) / nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 → Simplify:

(nH2 * nMg_sun) / (nH_sun *nSi2) ) = (nMg_sun *10^0.3) /nSi_sun.

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

nH2 / (nH_sun *nSi2) ) = 10^0.3 /nSi_sun → rearrange for nSi2:

nSi2 = (nH2 * nSi_sun ) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )

But nSi2 is the number of silicon atoms in Star_2. Now, what is [Si/H]_2? It's log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → so:

log(nSi2/nH2) = [Si/H]_2 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)

But from the expression for nSi2, nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3) → so (nSi2/nH2) = (nSi_sun)/(nH_sun *10^0.3) → So,

log( (nSi_sun)/(nH_sun *10^0.3) ) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) + log(1/(10^0.3)) → which is log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3 → So,

log(nSi2/nH2) = [Si/H]_2 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → but from above,

log(nSi2/nH2) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3 → So,

[Si/H]_2 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that can't be right. Or can it?

Wait, let me double-check.

nSi2 = (nH2 * nSi_sun )/(nH_sun * 10^0.3 )

So, nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/(10^0.3)).

So, nSi2/nH2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/(10^0.3 )) ) / nH2 → which is (nSi_sun/(10^0.3 nH_sun )) → So, (nSi2/nH2 ) = (nSi_sun / (nH_sun )) * 10^(-0.3 )

So, [Si/H]_2 = log( (nSi2/nH2) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) → which is log(10^(-0.3 )) → which is -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, now, we have [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, but that can't be the case. How? Because if [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, that means Star_1 has more silicon relative to hydrogen than the Sun. Star_2 has less. So the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 would be (10^0.3 )/(10^-0.3 )=10^0.6 → which is about 3.98, which is around 4. So the ratio would be ~4.

Wait, but the ratio is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) → because [Si/H]_1 is log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0.3 → (nSi1/nH1) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2= -0.3 → (nSi2/nH2) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = (10^0.3)/(10^-0.3) )=10^0.6.

So the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, about 4. So the answer would be option A: ~3.9.

Wait, but earlier I thought of the ratio as nSi1/nSi2, but that would require considering the hydrogen in each star. But according to this, the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) )=10^0.6. So the actual ratio of nSi1/nSi2 would be (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) = (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH2/nH1) → but wait, no, wait.

Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms is nSi1/nSi2. But nSi1 and nSi2 are the number of silicon atoms in each star, but their H might not be the same. So, to find the ratio of silicon atoms, perhaps we need to express each in terms of their hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) is 10^0.6 as we found. But how does that relate to the ratio of silicon atoms?

Hmm, perhaps the actual ratio of silicon atoms would be (nSi1 / nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nH1) * (nH1/nSi2) → Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) )=10^0.6 → which is the ratio of the silicon-to-hydrogen ratios.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So, perhaps it's (nSi1 / nSi2) → but we need to express both in terms of H.

Wait, maybe the photospheric composition is such that for each star, the hydrogen is the same as the Sun? But that can't be right because they have different [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem in terms of the number of atoms per hydrogen atom.

For Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2=-0.3 → nSi2/nH2=10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) )=10^0.6 = about 3.98.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms, which is nSi1/nSi2.

nSi1 = (nSi1/nH1) * nH1.

nSi2 = (nSi2/nH2) * nH2.

So, ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / ( (nSi2/nH2) *nH2 ) ) → = (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH1/nH2) → which is 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2).

But I don't know what nH1 and nH2 are. Hmm, this is a problem. Because the ratio depends on the ratio of H in each star.

Wait, but perhaps the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star's photosphere is the same? Or perhaps the hydrogen abundance is the same? Or is that not the case.

Wait, let's think about the metallicity. [Fe/H]_1=0 → same as sun. [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as sun.

But for Star_2, what about [Fe/H]_2? It's not given. So perhaps the H abundance is the same as the Sun for both stars? But that would mean nH1 =nH2 = same as Sun.

Wait, but no. Because [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun.

If nH1 is the same as the Sun, then nFe1 =nFe_sun.

But that's assuming same H, but stars can have different H densities.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the metallicity doesn't affect the H density. Or perhaps it's considering that the H density is the same in both stars? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars. Because [Fe/H]_1=0 implies same Fe/H as the Sun, but perhaps the H is same as the Sun. But that's not necessarily true because the star's atmosphere could have a different H. But without more info, perhaps we can assume that nH1 and nH2 are the same as the Sun's.

Wait, but the Sun's photosphere has a certain H, and each star's photosphere may have different H.

But maybe I can model it this way: since [Fe/H]_1=0, then the Fe abundance is same as Sun relative to H. So, nFe1 =nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg2=nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

But without knowing the H in each star, perhaps I can't find the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2. Because [Si/H]_1=0.3 and [Si/H]_2=-0.3, their ratio would be 10^0.3 /10^(-0.3)=10^0.6 as I found earlier.

But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which would depend on the absolute number. So if the H is same in both stars, then nSi1/nSi2=10^(0.6) ≈3.98.

But if H is different, the ratio changes. So perhaps the problem assumes that the H is same in both stars. Or perhaps they have same nH.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of nH1 and nH2 can be found from their [Fe/Mg] or something else.

Wait, earlier when trying to compute nSi2, I had:

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

But if Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given, perhaps I can't find much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of Si relative to H, so the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2)=10^0.6.

But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute (nSi1 / nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nSi2) ) → which seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) )=10^{0.6}, which would be approximately 3.98. Which is option A.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A) ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the definitions of stellar abundance ratios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - This implies (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun and (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

   Using [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the hydrogen-to-iron ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the silicon-to-iron ratio in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun. Combining these, the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is (nSi1/nH1) = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

   Thus, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - This implies (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun and (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.

   Using [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the hydrogen-to-magnesium ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the magnesium-to-silicon ratio in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun. Rearranging, the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is (nSi2/nH2) = 10^-0.3 × (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

   Thus, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{H1}})}{(n_{\text{Si2}}/n_{\text{H2}})} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H1}}}{n_{\text{H2}}}.
   \]
   From the abundances, \((n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{H1}}) = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si_sun}}/n_{\text{H_sun}})\) and \((n_{\text{Si2}}/n_{\text{H2}}) = 10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si_sun}}/n_{\text{H_sun}})\). Thus:
   \[
   \frac{(n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{H1}})}{(n_{\text{Si2}}/n_{\text{H2}})} = 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
   \]
   Assuming the hydrogen densities in the two stars are the same (\(n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{H2}}\)), the ratio simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
   \]
   Approximating \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately 3.9.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A
