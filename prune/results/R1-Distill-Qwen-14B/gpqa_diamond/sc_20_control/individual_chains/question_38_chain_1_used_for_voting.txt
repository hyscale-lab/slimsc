Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a reaction starting with (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that structure. So, the molecule is an enamine—I remember enamine is a compound with a nitrogen connected to a carbon that's double-bonded to another carbon. The structure would be something like CH2=CH-N with substituents.

The reaction is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A → B. The options give possible reagents A and product B. I need to figure out what reagents are used and what the product is.

Enamine reactions usually involve a few steps. I remember that enamines are typically formed by reacting amines with carbonyl compounds. The process involves deprotonation, then alkylation or another reaction, and finally hydrolysis.

Wait, so the starting material here is an enamine. What's the next step? Oh right, when you have an enamine and you treat it with an acid, it hydrolyzes back into the ketone and an amine. But wait, maybe the reaction is different here.

Wait, but looking at the options, some involve LDA, DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+. LDA is a strong base, which is often used to deprotonate things. DME is a solvent, I think. CH3CH2I is ethyl iodide, a good alkylating agent. H3O+ is acidic workup.

So the starting material is an enamine. Let me think about what the reagents are doing. If I have an enamine, and I add a base like LDA, perhaps deprotonating it somewhere. Then maybe an alkylation step with ethyl iodide, followed by acid workup.

Wait, but the starting enamine is already an iminium ion? Or is it a zwitterionic form? Hmm, not sure. Let's think about the reaction steps for an enamine.

Enamine formation is typically done by first treating an amine with a carbonyl compound. The steps are: (1) form the iminium ion by proton transfer, (2) alkylation with an alkyl halide, and (3) hydrolysis to form the ketone and amine.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is an enamine, and the reaction is adding reagent A to get product B.

So the enamine is perhaps undergoing some kind of alkylation or hydrolysis. Let me recap: the enamine can act as a nucleophile because the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the double bond) is deprotonated, making it a good site for alkylation.

Wait, but if the enamine is already formed, maybe the next step is to perform a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is being used to form a larger molecule via alkylation.

Alternatively, maybe the enamine is being treated with a base to deprotonate it, then an alkylation occurs, and then acid is added to protonate it again.

Looking at the options, both options A and C have a sequence of LDA and DME first, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+.

Wait, perhaps the process is that the enamine is deprotonated by the base (LDA) to form an enolate, which can then react with an electrophile, like ethyl iodide.

Wait, but wait, LDA is a strong base, which deprotonates things, but in the context of an enamine, perhaps it's used to deprotonate the alpha position, making it more nucleophilic.

So, when the enamine is treated with a base like LDA, it deprotonates the alpha carbon, making an enolate. Then, when ethyl iodide is added, it would alkylate the alpha position. Then, under acidic workup (H3O+), perhaps the enamine is hydrolyzed back to a ketone and amine.

Wait, but the enamine is a conjugated system. Let me imagine the structure of the starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(OH)-NMe2+ ? Or perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-CH2- connected via N with Me groups. Wait, perhaps it's an iminium ion, like the enamine protonated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the ethanaminium part is CH2NH+ with substituents. The pentan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the ylidene is a substituent. Let me think: pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the substituent is on the 2-position. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C-(NMe2+), perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the enamine as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NMe2+ ? No, because that's not an enamine; enamine has the structure R2C=CH-NR2. So, the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. So, maybe in this case, the starting material is an enamine that already has a substituent.

So, the reaction is adding reagents A. Looking at the options, perhaps the steps are deprotonation, alkylation, followed by hydrolysis.

Option C says reagent A is (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+. So, step 1: LDA and DME. LDA is a base, deprotonating the enamine. Then step 2: CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide), which would alkylate the enamine. Then step 3: H3O+ (acid workup).

After alkylation, the enamine would have an additional ethyl group. Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and an amine.

Wait, but when you hydrolyze an enamine, you get a ketone and an amine. So, the product B would be a ketone plus an amine.

Looking at the options: option C's product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3. So, that's a seven-carbon chain with the ketone at position 4.

Option A's product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3, a five-carbon ketone.

Wait, the starting enamine is made from a secondary amine (N,N-dimethylethanamine?) and a carbonyl. Let me think: the starting enamine is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the amine part is ethanaminium (CH2NH+), with N-methyl and another substituent, which is the pentan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, maybe the starting enamine was formed from N,N-dimethylethanamine and a carbonyl compound. Wait, if the enamine is formed from a secondary amine, then the general process is: R2NH + ketone → iminium ion → alkylation → hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an enamine from N,N-dimethylethanamine and a carbonyl compound. So, the enamine would be R2C=CH-NR2, where R is methyl groups. When that's treated with LDA, which deprotonates the alpha carbon, making it a better nucleophile. Then, when ethyl iodide is added, it alkylates that position, adding an ethyl group.

Then, upon hydrolysis with acid (H3O+), the enamine would break down to form a ketone and the amine. So, the ketone would have the chain extended by the added ethyl group.

Wait, but the initial enamine's structure is important. So, the enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The pentan-2-ylidene group would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no, it's pentan-2-ylidene, which is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the substituent is on the 2-position. So, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond at position 2, making it CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-? Wait no, pentan-2-ylidene is the substituent where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C2 and C3, so CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but wait, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the substituent on the enamine would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NMe2+ ?

Wait, no, more accurately, the enamine structure is R2C=CH-NR2, so perhaps the substituent is the pentan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the nitrogen. Hmm, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(H)-NMe2+?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe think about the reaction steps instead.

If you have an enamine and you deprotonate it, you can add an alkyl group, then hydrolyze it. So, let's say the starting enamine has a certain chain length. When you add an ethyl group, the chain length increases. Then hydrolysis would give a ketone whose chain is longer than the original.

The starting enamine comes from a secondary amine and a ketone. Let's say the starting amine is N,N-dimethylethanamine. The ketone would be pentan-2-one (if the enamine is pentan-2-ylidene), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the substituent on the nitrogen is pentan-2-ylidene, and another substituent is methyl. So, the structure is (E)-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the nitrogen, which is also attached to a methyl group and a CH2+ group (since it's ethanaminium). Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more like the enamine is formed from N,N-dimethylamine and a carbonyl compound. Let's suppose that the enamine is part of a longer chain.

When the enamine is treated with LDA, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, it deprotonates the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the double bond) to form an enolate. Then, ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) would act as an electrophile, alkylating that position. So, the enamine would now have an additional ethyl group attached.

Then, when acid is added (H3O+), the enamine would hydrolyze. The hydrolysis of an enamine typically gives back the amine and a ketone. So, the ketone would have the ethyl group added, making it longer.

Wait, but if the original enamine is from a ketone, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would make the ketone longer by two carbons. Let me think: the enamine from pentan-2-one would be (after alkylation) have a longer chain, and upon hydrolysis, give a longer ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the original enamine's carbonyl was a four-carbon chain, adding another two carbons via ethyl group, making a six-carbon ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is derived from a three-carbon ketone. Let me think. If the enamine is formed from N,N-dimethylethanamine and a ketone, say propanone (acetone), then the enamine would be something like CH2=CH-CH2-NR2.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the substituent on the nitrogen is a pentan-2-ylidene group (CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3). So, the enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NMe2+.

Wait, no, the structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the ethanaminium part is CH2NH+ with methyl groups attached. The other substituent is the pentan-2-ylidene group. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2 attached to N, which is also attached to a CH2+ and a methyl group. Hmm, not entirely sure, but perhaps that's not critical right now.

So, when the enamine is treated with LDA, it deprotonates the alpha carbon (the one next to the double bond), making it a good nucleophile. Then, ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) alkylates that carbon. So, the enamine now has an additional ethyl group.

After that, when acid is added, the enamine undergoes hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of an enamine typically gives a ketone and an amine. The ketone would have the same number of carbons as the enamine, perhaps plus the added ethyl group.

Wait, the enamine is R2C=CH-NR2. When you alkylate the alpha position (the R2C part), you add a group there. So, the R2C becomes R2C-CH2-Ethyl after alkylation. Then, upon hydrolysis, that becomes a ketone.

Wait, let me think in terms of steps:

1. Enamine is deprotonated by LDA (a strong base), forming an enolate.
2. React with ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.
3. Acid workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the enamine.

So, what's the product? Let's see. The starting enamine has a certain structure, and after alkylation, the alpha carbon has an ethyl group added. When hydrolyzed, that would become a ketone.

So, the original enamine's structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The pentan-2-ylidene is a five-carbon group with a double bond. After adding ethyl via alkylation, maybe the chain becomes longer.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine has a four-carbon chain in the enamine part. So, when we add an ethyl group, the chain becomes six carbons, leading to a six-carbon ketone.

Wait, looking at the options, option C's product is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one has seven carbons with the ketone at position 4.

How would that happen? The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons (CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3). When you add an ethyl group via alkylation, the chain becomes longer.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NMe2+. After alkylation, the CH2 becomes CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl), so the chain becomes longer.

Wait, but maybe the initial enamine is a four-carbon chain. So, adding an ethyl would make it six, or perhaps seven.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is from a three-carbon ketone, so after adding ethyl, the ketone becomes five carbons.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Reagent A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

So, after the steps, the enamine is hydrolyzed to pentan-2-one and an amine. But why would that be? Because the enamine was perhaps a four-carbon structure, adding ethyl would make it longer. Wait, but option A's product is pentan-2-one, which is five carbons. So maybe the starting enamine was a three-carbon ketone, adding one carbon would make four, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is CH3CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. Seven carbons with ketone at position 4.

So how would that form? Starting with a five-carbon substituent (the pentan-2-ylidene), adding an ethyl group (two carbons), perhaps.

Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons, so adding ethyl (two more) would make seven? Hmm, but the position of the ketone is important.

Wait, the initial enamine has a five-carbon substituent. After alkylation, perhaps the chain becomes seven carbons, and upon hydrolysis, the ketone is in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine's structure is such that upon alkylation, the chain increases by two carbons, making the ketone heptan-4-one.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: the reagents in options C and D are similar.

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+; product B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; product B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the difference is in the order of reagents. In option C, LDA and DME are used first, then ethyl iodide, then acid. In option D, the LDA is first, then DME with ethyl iodide and acid.

Wait, but LDA is a strong base and would require a solvent like THF or DME. DME is a common solvent for LDA. So, perhaps step (i) is LDA in DME.

So, the correct sequence would be: LDA in DME to deprotonate, then add ethyl iodide, then acid.

Looking at the options, option C's steps are (i) LDA and DME, (ii) ethyl iodide, (iii) H3O+. That makes sense: deprotonate, alkylate, hydrolyze.

So, the product would be a ketone. If the starting enamine's substituent is pentan-2-ylidene (five carbons), adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. So upon hydrolysis, it would form a seven-carbon ketone.

Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3, which is seven carbons with the ketone at position 4.

So, the product B is heptan-4-one, which is option C or D. Let me check the options again.

Option C says product B is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option D says reagent A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; product B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the order of (ii) in D is DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. That doesn't make much sense. Because after LDA, you might add DME as a solvent, then the alkylating agent. But in D, the steps are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. That would mean all three are used together, which isn't the typical procedure.

So, the correct sequence is (i) LDA and DME, then (ii) CH3CH2I, then (iii) H3O+.

Looking at option C, that's the case. So, the product would be heptan-4-one.

So, the correct answer would be option C or D? Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+; B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B is heptan-4-one.

So, the correct sequence is option C's steps. So, the product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are as in C.

Wait, but looking at the product in option C, B is heptan-4-one. What about the amine?

Wait, when you hydrolyze the enamine, you get a ketone and an amine. So, in the options, some mention both the ketone and the amine.

Looking back, option A's product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Option B's product is pentan-2-one and the same amine. Option C and D's product is heptan-4-one, but they don't mention the amine.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking for the product B, which could be just the ketone. Or perhaps the product B is a mixture, but the options only list the ketone.

So, if the product is heptan-4-one, then the correct option is C or D. But based on the reagent sequence, option C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C says product B is heptan-4-one. So, the reagents are option C's steps.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option C or D. Wait, no. Option C says (i) LDA and DME, (ii) CH3CH2I, (iii) H3O+. That's three steps. Option D's reagents are (i) LDA, (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+ — which is only two steps, which doesn't make sense because you can't add all three reagents at once.

So, the correct reagent sequence is option C, leading to heptan-4-one as product B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, undergoing a sequence of reagents to form a product B. The analysis focuses on the role of the reagents and the transformation of the enamine.

1. **Reagents and Reaction Steps**:
   - **LDA (Lithium Diisopropylamide)**: A strong, non-nucleophilic base used to deprotonate the alpha carbon of the enamine, forming an enolate.
   - **DME (Dimethoxyethane)**: A solvent commonly used with LDA.
   - **CH3CH2I (Ethyl Iodide)**: An alkylating agent that reacts with the enolate to add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.
   - **H3O+ (Acidic Workup)**: Hydrolyzes the enamine to regenerate a ketone and an amine.

   The correct sequence of reagents is:
   - (i) LDA and DME to deprotonate the enamine.
   - (ii) CH3CH2I to alkylate the enolate.
   - (iii) H3O+ to hydrolyze the enamine.

2. **Product Analysis**:
   - The starting enamine has a pentan-2-ylidene group (five carbons). After alkylation with ethyl iodide, the chain length increases by two carbons, resulting in a seven-carbon chain.
   - Upon hydrolysis, the enamine breaks down into a ketone and an amine. The ketone formed is **heptan-4-one**, a seven-carbon chain with the ketone at position 4.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The product is listed as pentan-2-one, which does not match the chain length after alkylation.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. Similar to Option A, the product is pentan-2-one, which is inconsistent with the reaction steps.
   - **Option C**: Correct. The reagents are in the correct sequence (LDA, DME; CH3CH2I; H3O+), and the product is heptan-4-one.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The reagents are listed as a single step (DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+), which is not a logical sequence for the reaction.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it provides the correct sequence of reagents and the correct product, heptan-4-one.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Looking at the options, both options A and C have a sequence of LDA and DME first, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+.

Wait, perhaps the process is that the enamine is deprotonated by the base (LDA) to form an enolate, which can then react with an electrophile, like ethyl iodide.

Wait, but wait, LDA is a strong base, which deprotonates things, but in the context of an enamine, perhaps it's used to deprotonate the alpha position, making it more nucleophilic.

So, when the enamine is treated with a base like LDA, it deprotonates the alpha carbon, making an enolate. Then, when ethyl iodide is added, it would alkylate the alpha position. Then, under acidic workup (H3O+), perhaps the enamine is hydrolyzed back to a ketone and amine.

Or perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-CH2- connected via N with Me groups. Wait, perhaps it's an iminium ion, like the enamine protonated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the ethanaminium part is CH2NH+ with substituents. The pentan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the ylidene is a substituent. Let me think: pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the substituent is on the 2-position. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C-(NMe2+), perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the enamine as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NMe2+ ? No, because that's not an enamine; enamine has the structure R2C=CH-NR2. So, the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. So, maybe in this case, the starting material is an enamine that already has a substituent.

So, the reaction is adding reagents A. Looking at the options, perhaps the steps are deprotonation, alkylation, followed by hydrolysis.

Option C says reagent A is (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+. So, step 1: LDA and DME. LDA is a base, deprotonating the enamine. Then step 2: CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide), which would alkylate the enamine. Then step 3: H3O+ (acid workup).

After alkylation, the enamine would have an additional ethyl group. Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and an amine.

Wait, but when you hydrolyze an enamine, you get a ketone and an amine. So, the product B would be a ketone plus an amine.

Looking at the options: option C's product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3. So, that's a seven-carbon chain with the ketone at position 4.

Option A's product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3, a five-carbon ketone.

Wait, the starting enamine is made from a secondary amine (N,N-dimethylethanamine?) and a carbonyl. Let me think: the starting enamine is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the amine part is ethanaminium (CH2NH+), with N-methyl and another substituent, which is the pentan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, maybe the starting enamine was formed from N,N-dimethylethanamine and a carbonyl compound. Wait, if the enamine is formed from a secondary amine, then the general process is: R2NH + ketone → iminium ion → alkylation → hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an enamine from N,N-dimethylethanamine and a carbonyl compound. So, the enamine would be R2C=CH-NR2, where R is methyl groups. When that's treated with LDA, which deprotonates the alpha carbon, making it a better nucleophile. Then, when ethyl iodide is added, it alkylates that position, adding an ethyl group.

Then, upon hydrolysis with acid (H3O+), the enamine would break down to form a ketone and the amine. So, the ketone would have the chain extended by the added ethyl group.

Wait, but the initial enamine's structure is important. So, the enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The pentan-2-ylidene group would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no, it's pentan-2-ylidene, which is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the substituent is on the 2-position. So, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond at position 2, making it CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-? Wait no, pentan-2-ylidene is the substituent where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C2 and C3, so CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but wait, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the substituent on the enamine would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NMe2+ ?

Wait, no, more accurately, the enamine structure is R2C=CH-NR2, so perhaps the substituent is the pentan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the nitrogen. Hmm, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(H)-NMe2+?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe think about the reaction steps instead.

If you have an enamine and you deprotonate it, you can add an alkyl group, then hydrolyze it. So, let's say the starting enamine has a certain chain length. When you add an ethyl group, the chain length increases. Then hydrolysis would give a ketone whose chain is longer than the original.

The starting enamine comes from a secondary amine and a ketone. Let's say the starting amine is N,N-dimethylethanamine. The ketone would be pentan-2-one (if the enamine is pentan-2-ylidene), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the substituent on the nitrogen is pentan-2-ylidene, and another substituent is methyl. So, the structure is (E)-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the nitrogen, which is also attached to a methyl group and a CH2+ group (since it's ethanaminium). Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more like the enamine is formed from N,N-dimethylamine and a carbonyl compound. Let's suppose that the enamine is part of a longer chain.

When the enamine is treated with LDA, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, it deprotonates the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the double bond) to form an enolate. Then, ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) would act as an electrophile, alkylating that position. So, the enamine would now have an additional ethyl group attached.

Then, when acid is added (H3O+), the enamine would hydrolyze. The hydrolysis of an enamine typically gives back the amine and a ketone. So, the ketone would have the ethyl group added, making it longer.

Wait, but if the original enamine is from a ketone, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would make the ketone longer by two carbons. Let me think: the enamine from pentan-2-one would be (after alkylation) have a longer chain, and upon hydrolysis, give a longer ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the original enamine's carbonyl was a four-carbon chain, adding another two carbons via ethyl group, making a six-carbon ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is derived from a three-carbon ketone. Let me think. If the enamine is formed from N,N-dimethylethanamine and a ketone, say propanone (acetone), then the enamine would be something like CH2=CH-CH2-NR2.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the substituent on the nitrogen is a pentan-2-ylidene group (CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3). So, the enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NMe2+.

Wait, no, the structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the ethanaminium part is CH2NH+ with methyl groups attached. The other substituent is the pentan-2-ylidene group. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2 attached to N, which is also attached to a CH2+ and a methyl group. Hmm, not entirely sure, but perhaps that's not critical right now.

So, when the enamine is treated with LDA, it deprotonates the alpha carbon (the one next to the double bond), making it a good nucleophile. Then, ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) alkylates that carbon. So, the enamine now has an additional ethyl group.

After that, when acid is added, the enamine undergoes hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of an enamine typically gives a ketone and an amine. The ketone would have the same number of carbons as the enamine, perhaps plus the added ethyl group.

Wait, the enamine is R2C=CH-NR2. When you alkylate the alpha position (the R2C part), you add a group there. So, the R2C becomes R2C-CH2-Ethyl after alkylation. Then, upon hydrolysis, that becomes a ketone.

Wait, let me think in terms of steps:

1. Enamine is deprotonated by LDA (a strong base), forming an enolate.
2. React with ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.
3. Acid workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the enamine.

So, what's the product? Let's see. The starting enamine has a certain structure, and after alkylation, the alpha carbon has an ethyl group added. When hydrolyzed, that would become a ketone.

So, the original enamine's structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The pentan-2-ylidene is a five-carbon group with a double bond. After adding ethyl via alkylation, maybe the chain becomes longer.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine has a four-carbon chain in the enamine part. So, when we add an ethyl group, the chain becomes six carbons, leading to a six-carbon ketone.

Wait, looking at the options, option C's product is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one has seven carbons with the ketone at position 4.

How would that happen? The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons (CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3). When you add an ethyl group via alkylation, the chain becomes longer.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-NMe2+. After alkylation, the CH2 becomes CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl), so the chain becomes longer.

Wait, but maybe the initial enamine is a four-carbon chain. So, adding an ethyl would make it six, or perhaps seven.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is from a three-carbon ketone, so after adding ethyl, the ketone becomes five carbons.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Reagent A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

So, after the steps, the enamine is hydrolyzed to pentan-2-one and an amine. But why would that be? Because the enamine was perhaps a four-carbon structure, adding ethyl would make it longer. Wait, but option A's product is pentan-2-one, which is five carbons. So maybe the starting enamine was a three-carbon ketone, adding one carbon would make four, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is CH3CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. Seven carbons with ketone at position 4.

So how would that form? Starting with a five-carbon substituent (the pentan-2-ylidene), adding an ethyl group (two carbons), perhaps.

Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons, so adding ethyl (two more) would make seven? Hmm, but the position of the ketone is important.

Wait, the initial enamine has a five-carbon substituent. After alkylation, perhaps the chain becomes seven carbons, and upon hydrolysis, the ketone is in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine's structure is such that upon alkylation, the chain increases by two carbons, making the ketone heptan-4-one.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: the reagents in options C and D are similar.

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+; product B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; product B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the difference is in the order of reagents. In option C, LDA and DME are used first, then ethyl iodide, then acid. In option D, the LDA is first, then DME with ethyl iodide and acid.

Wait, but LDA is a strong base and would require a solvent like THF or DME. DME is a common solvent for LDA. So, perhaps step (i) is LDA in DME.

So, the correct sequence would be: LDA in DME to deprotonate, then add ethyl iodide, then acid.

Looking at the options, option C's steps are (i) LDA and DME, (ii) ethyl iodide, (iii) H3O+. That makes sense: deprotonate, alkylate, hydrolyze.

So, the product would be a ketone. If the starting enamine's substituent is pentan-2-ylidene (five carbons), adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. So upon hydrolysis, it would form a seven-carbon ketone.

Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3, which is seven carbons with the ketone at position 4.

So, the product B is heptan-4-one, which is option C or D. Let me check the options again.

Option C says product B is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option D says reagent A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; product B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the order of (ii) in D is DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. That doesn't make much sense. Because after LDA, you might add DME as a solvent, then the alkylating agent. But in D, the steps are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. That would mean all three are used together, which isn't the typical procedure.

So, the correct sequence is (i) LDA and DME, then (ii) CH3CH2I, then (iii) H3O+.

Looking at option C, that's the case. So, the product would be heptan-4-one.

So, the correct answer would be option C or D? Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+; B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B is heptan-4-one.

So, the correct sequence is option C's steps. So, the product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are as in C.

Wait, but looking at the product in option C, B is heptan-4-one. What about the amine?

Wait, when you hydrolyze the enamine, you get a ketone and an amine. So, in the options, some mention both the ketone and the amine.

Looking back, option A's product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Option B's product is pentan-2-one and the same amine. Option C and D's product is heptan-4-one, but they don't mention the amine.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking for the product B, which could be just the ketone. Or perhaps the product B is a mixture, but the options only list the ketone.

So, if the product is heptan-4-one, then the correct option is C or D. But based on the reagent sequence, option C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C says product B is heptan-4-one. So, the reagents are option C's steps.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option C or D. Wait, no. Option C says (i) LDA and DME, (ii) CH3CH2I, (iii) H3O+. That's three steps. Option D's reagents are (i) LDA, (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+ — which is only two steps, which doesn't make sense because you can't add all three reagents at once.

So, the correct reagent sequence is option C, leading to heptan-4-one as product B.


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, undergoing a sequence of reagents to form a product B. The analysis focuses on the role of the reagents and the transformation of the enamine.

1. **Reagents and Reaction Steps**:
   - **LDA (Lithium Diisopropylamide)**: A strong, non-nucleophilic base used to deprotonate the alpha carbon of the enamine, forming an enolate.
   - **DME (Dimethoxyethane)**: A solvent commonly used with LDA.
   - **CH3CH2I (Ethyl Iodide)**: An alkylating agent that reacts with the enolate to add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.
   - **H3O+ (Acidic Workup)**: Hydrolyzes the enamine to regenerate a ketone and an amine.

   The correct sequence of reagents is:
   - (i) LDA and DME to deprotonate the enamine.
   - (ii) CH3CH2I to alkylate the enolate.
   - (iii) H3O+ to hydrolyze the enamine.

2. **Product Analysis**:
   - The starting enamine has a pentan-2-ylidene group (five carbons). After alkylation with ethyl iodide, the chain length increases by two carbons, resulting in a seven-carbon chain.
   - Upon hydrolysis, the enamine breaks down into a ketone and an amine. The ketone formed is **heptan-4-one**, a seven-carbon chain with the ketone at position 4.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The product is listed as pentan-2-one, which does not match the chain length after alkylation.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. Similar to Option A, the product is pentan-2-one, which is inconsistent with the reaction steps.
   - **Option C**: Correct. The reagents are in the correct sequence (LDA, DME; CH3CH2I; H3O+), and the product is heptan-4-one.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The reagents are listed as a single step (DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+), which is not a logical sequence for the reaction.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it provides the correct sequence of reagents and the correct product, heptan-4-one.

Answer: C
