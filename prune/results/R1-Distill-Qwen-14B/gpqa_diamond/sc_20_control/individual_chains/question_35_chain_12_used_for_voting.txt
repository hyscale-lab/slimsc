Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, of a muon. It says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator is given as Ay = c * S, with c being h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

I need to find which of the options A-D is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling some basic quantum mechanics. Angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. For spin-1/2 particles like a muon, the spin matrices are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. But wait, in this problem, they're using a different scaling, with c = h/(4π). Wait, h is Planck's constant, right? And ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) would be ħ/2. So c = ħ/2.

The matrix S is given as:
Row 1: 0 -i
Row 2: i 0
Wait, that looks like the Pauli Y matrix? Let me confirm. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], yes. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, often written as σ_y.

So Ay = c * σ_y. Since c is h/(4π) = ħ/2, that's (ħ/2) * σ_y. Oh wait, the spin angular momentum operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So the operator Ay is (ħ/2) times σ_y, which makes sense for the Y-component.

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, we can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write out the matrix Ay. Ay = [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ].

The eigenvalues a satisfy:

|Ay - a I| = 0

Which is:

| -a    -i c      |
| i c   -a       | = 0

So the determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(i c) = a² - (i c)^2. But wait, (i c)^2 is (i^2)(c^2) = (-1)(c²). So the determinant equation becomes a² - (-c²) = a² + c² = 0.

Wait, that would be a² = -c². But that would imply a = ± i c. Wait, that can't be right because eigenvalues of an observable should be real. Oh wait, but wait a second, no. Wait, the angular momentum operator is Hermitian, so Ay should be Hermitian. Wait, is it?

Wait, is Ay Hermitian? Let me think. Ay is c times σ_y. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so σ_y is Hermitian. So c times σ_y would be Hermitian only if c is real. Since c is h/(4π), which is a real positive constant, yes. So Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues should be real. But according to this calculation, a² = -c^2, which would give a imaginary. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the matrix. Let me write Ay explicitly. Ay = c * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix is:

[ 0       -i c ]
[ i c     0 ]

So when I compute the determinant (Ay - a I):

The matrix becomes:

[ -a      -i c    ]
[ i c     -a     ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c).

Wait, (-i c)(i c) is (-i)(i) c^2. (-i)(i) is -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = (i^2)*(-1) c²? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's compute each term. The determinant is (top left)(top right) minus (top right)(bottom left). So:

det = (-a)*(-a) - (-i c)*(i c) 

= a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Wait, (-i c)(i c) is (-i)(i) c².

(-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So (-i c)(i c) = (i^2)*(-1) c²? Wait, no. Let's compute it step by step:

(-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) * c * c = (-i^2) * c².

i^2 is -1, so (-i^2) is -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = 1 * c² = c².

So the determinant becomes a² - c².

Wait, no: because the formula is (Ay - a I)'s determinant, which is a² - (c²) = a² - c² = 0. So a² = c², so a = ± c.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the eigenvalues are a = ± c = ± h/(4π).

Hmm, so the eigenvalues are real, as expected since Ay is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are +/- 2πh, real part +/- h/(4π). Wait, that's not correct because the eigenvalues are purely real, so the imaginary part is zero. So option A is incorrect, because it suggests the eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts +/- 1/2, real parts +/- 1. Hmmm, that would imply the eigenvalue is something like 1 + i (1/2), but that can't be right because Ay is Hermitian, so eigenvalues must be real.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Well, A is the angular momentum, so A² is the square of the vector operator. For a spin-½ system, the eigenfunctions of Ay (eigenstates of S_y) are eigenfunctions of S² (since S² is the same for all components), but not of S_z, because S_x, S_y, S_z don't commute with each other. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A² (since A is spin, so A² is s(s+1)ħ², which is (1/2)(3/2)ħ² = 3ħ²/4). So option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That statement would be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not too clear on this. The basis functions are typically the eigenvectors that form a basis, so if the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. But in general, for a 2x2 matrix, if it's diagonalizable, it has two eigenvectors that form a basis. So D could be correct depending on the phrasing. But the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, maybe. But I need to think more.

Wait, looking back, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So which statements are correct about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C's statement is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Because Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different.

So let's go through the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. So this is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But Az and Ay don't commute, so the eigenstates of Ay won't be eigenstates of Az.

So option C is correct.

Wait, let's double-check the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are a=±c=±h/(4π). So looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). This would imply a complex eigenvalue, which is impossible because Ay is Hermitian. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary part ±1/2, real ±1. Doesn't fit either, since the eigenvalues are real.

So the correct eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which isn't mentioned in the options. Wait, looking back: none of the options A or B directly state this. So perhaps the options are trying to trick us.

Wait, but the problem says, during the calculation, which statement is correct? So perhaps the options are about the process, not the explicit eigenvalue.

Wait, no, the options are about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, option D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis if the operator is diagonalizable, which it is because it's a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues (so it's diagonalizable, unless it's defective). So the eigenvectors form a basis. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis of the matrix operator. Hmm, maybe not exactly. The basis functions are the eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space. So D might be correct.

But let's think: option C is about whether the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² and not of Az. Since A² is s(s+1)ħ², any state with a definite Ay will have a definite A², which is fixed for spin 1/2. So yes, C's statement is correct.

So among the options, C is a correct statement.

So the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, represented as a 2×2 matrix. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is explicitly \( A_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i c \\ i c & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - To find the eigenvalues, solve \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), leading to the characteristic equation \( a^2 - c^2 = 0 \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - The eigenvalues are \( a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are purely real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

2. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Suggests the eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts (e.g., imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \), real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)). This is incorrect because \( A_y \) is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real.
   - **Option B:** Suggests eigenvalues with imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect, as the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are purely real.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so eigenstates of \( A_y \) are also eigenstates of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenstates of \( A_y \) are not eigenstates of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D space, the phrasing of this option is less precise and does not directly address the eigenvalue-eigenvector relationship as clearly as Option C.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, of a muon. It says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator is given as Ay = c * S, with c being h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

I need to find which of the options A-D is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling some basic quantum mechanics. Angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. For spin-1/2 particles like a muon, the spin matrices are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. But wait, in this problem, they're using a different scaling, with c = h/(4π). Wait, h is Planck's constant, right? And ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) would be ħ/2. So c = ħ/2.

The matrix S is given as:
Row 1: 0 -i
Row 2: i 0
Wait, that looks like the Pauli Y matrix? Let me confirm. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], yes. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, often written as σ_y.

So Ay = c * σ_y. Since c is h/(4π) = ħ/2, that's (ħ/2) * σ_y. Oh wait, the spin angular momentum operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So the operator Ay is (ħ/2) times σ_y, which makes sense for the Y-component.

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, we can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write out the matrix Ay. Ay = [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ].

The eigenvalues a satisfy:

|Ay - a I| = 0

Which is:

| -a    -i c      |
| i c   -a       | = 0

So the determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(i c) = a² - (i c)^2. But wait, (i c)^2 is (i^2)(c^2) = (-1)(c²). So the determinant equation becomes a² - (-c²) = a² + c² = 0.

Wait, that would be a² = -c². But that would imply a = ± i c. Wait, that can't be right because eigenvalues of an observable should be real. Oh wait, but wait a second, no. Wait, the angular momentum operator is Hermitian, so Ay should be Hermitian. Wait, is it?

Wait, is Ay Hermitian? Let me think. Ay is c times σ_y. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so σ_y is Hermitian. So c times σ_y would be Hermitian only if c is real. Since c is h/(4π), which is a real positive constant, yes. So Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues should be real. But according to this calculation, a² = -c^2, which would give a imaginary. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the matrix. Let me write Ay explicitly. Ay = c * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix is:

[ 0       -i c ]
[ i c     0 ]

So when I compute the determinant (Ay - a I):

The matrix becomes:

[ -a      -i c    ]
[ i c     -a     ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c).

Wait, (-i c)(i c) is (-i)(i) c^2. (-i)(i) is -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = (i^2)*(-1) c²? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's compute each term. The determinant is (top left)(top right) minus (top right)(bottom left). So:

det = (-a)*(-a) - (-i c)*(i c) 

= a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Wait, (-i c)(i c) is (-i)(i) c².

(-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So (-i c)(i c) = (i^2)*(-1) c²? Wait, no. Let's compute it step by step:

(-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) * c * c = (-i^2) * c².

i^2 is -1, so (-i^2) is -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = 1 * c² = c².

So the determinant becomes a² - c².

Wait, no: because the formula is (Ay - a I)'s determinant, which is a² - (c²) = a² - c² = 0. So a² = c², so a = ± c.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the eigenvalues are a = ± c = ± h/(4π).

Hmm, so the eigenvalues are real, as expected since Ay is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are +/- 2πh, real part +/- h/(4π). Wait, that's not correct because the eigenvalues are purely real, so the imaginary part is zero. So option A is incorrect, because it suggests the eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts +/- 1/2, real parts +/- 1. Hmmm, that would imply the eigenvalue is something like 1 + i (1/2), but that can't be right because Ay is Hermitian, so eigenvalues must be real.

So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A² (since A is spin, so A² is s(s+1)ħ², which is (1/2)(3/2)ħ² = 3ħ²/4). So option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That statement would be correct.

The basis functions are typically the eigenvectors that form a basis, so if the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space.
