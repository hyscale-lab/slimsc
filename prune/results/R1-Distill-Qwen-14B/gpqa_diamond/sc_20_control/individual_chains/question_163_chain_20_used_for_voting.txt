Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. What's the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed? And what's the pH of the resulting solution? The options are A to D.

First, I need to think about Fe(OH)3. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so it's a base. When it reacts with an acid, it should undergo a neutralization reaction. Since the acid is strong and monobasic, it probably donates one H+ ion. So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with a strong acid like HCl or HNO3.

The first step is to write the balanced chemical equation. Fe(OH)3 is a solid, I think? So when it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl, it would produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and the conjugate base of the acid. So the reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O

Wait, right. Because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so each H+ from HCl would neutralize one OH. So three H+ per Fe(OH)3.

But wait, the acid is monobasic, meaning it can donate one H+ per molecule. So for each Fe(OH)3, which has three OH- groups, I need three H+ ions. So three moles of HCl per mole of Fe(OH)3.

So, next, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and Hydrogen is 1. So:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 * 16 = 48
H: 3 * 1 =3
Total molar mass = 55.85 +48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me calculate that more accurately.

0.1 divided by 106.85. Let's see: 106.85 * 0.000936 = 0.1? Let me compute 0.1 /106.85 = approximately 0.000936 mol. So around 9.36e-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter. So volume needed is moles divided by concentration.

Volume (L) = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait! The options have 28.05 cm³ as option C. So that's close. But wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely.

Let me redo the moles part. 0.1 g divided by 106.85 g/mol.

0.1 / 106.85 = let's compute that. Let me use more precise steps.

106.85 is approximately 106.85.

0.1 / 106.85 = 0.00093575 mol. So 9.3575e-4 mol.

Moles of HCl needed: 3 * 9.3575e-4 = 0.00280725 mol.

Concentration of HCl is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.00280725 / 0.1 = 0.0280725 L = 28.0725 cm³. So approximately 28.07 cm³, which is closest to option C's 28.05 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options are approximations. So perhaps 28.05 is the correct volume. That would make option C the volume part.

But wait, the question is about the minimum volume of acid needed. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Because when you add acid to Fe(OH)3, the acid will first neutralize the hydroxide, and then any excess acid will contribute to the solution's pH. But for the minimum volume, maybe you need just enough to fully dissolve the Fe(OH)3. Wait, but in reality, Fe(OH)3 is not very soluble. So adding acid helps dissolve it by converting it into Fe^3+ ions. So the minimum volume is indeed the stoichiometric amount needed to react with Fe(OH)3.

So according to that, the volume is around 28.07 cm³, which would match option C's 28.05 cm³. Now, what about the pH?

The resulting solution will be a solution of FeCl3, which is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). So the solution should be acidic because the Fe^3+ ion is the conjugate acid of the weak base Fe(OH)3.

So the pH will depend on the concentration of Fe^3+ ions in solution.

The total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. Wait, the initial solution is 100 cm³, and we're adding V cm³ of acid. So total volume is 100 + V? Wait, the question says "100 cm3 total volume." Hmm, that might be the final volume. Or is it the initial volume before adding acid?

Wait, the question says: dissolve 0.1g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. So probably, the solution after adding the acid has a total volume of 100 cm³. So the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3 in such a way that the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid used is V, and the final volume is 100 cm³, implying that V is less than 100 cm³. But wait, in the problem statement, it's a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.

"We would like to dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?"

Ah, so the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid added plus the volume of the solution (maybe water) should sum to 100 cm³. Wait, but perhaps the 100 cm³ includes the solution after adding acid. So the acid is added, and the total volume is 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the initial solution is 100 cm³, but that's unclear. Hmm, this is a crucial point.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a solution, and some acid is added to achieve the dissolution. The total volume of the solution after adding the acid is 100 cm³. So the acid is V cm³, and the solution volume after adding is 100 cm³. So the initial solution before adding acid was perhaps less than 100 cm³, and adding V cm³ brings it to 100.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution, and the acid is added to that. But the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So I think the acid is added into the 100 cm³, but that would require knowing whether the acid's volume is included or not. Alternatively, maybe the 100 cm³ is the final volume.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid added (V) is part of the 100 cm³. So when we add V cm³ of acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the solution after adding the acid is 100 cm³.

In that case, to find the concentration of Fe^3+, we have:

Moles of Fe^3+ = moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.00093575 mol.

The volume is 0.1 L (100 cm³), so concentration [Fe^3+] = 0.00093575 / 0.1 = 0.0093575 M.

But wait, the Fe^3+ ion is a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The hydrolysis will produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

To find the pH, we can calculate the concentration of H+ ions produced by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

The hydrolysis reaction can be considered as:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

The K for this reaction is the hydrolysis constant, K_h. K_h is equal to Kw / K_b, where K_b is the base dissociation constant of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, what's the K_b for Fe(OH)3? I don't remember exactly, but I think it's around 6.3e-31 or something very small since Fe(OH)3 is a very weak base. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the K_b value, but since I can't do that, I need to proceed based on what I remember.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. I think the Kb is approximately 6e-31. So K_h = Kw / Kb = 1e-14 / 6e-31 ≈ 1.66667e16.

Wait, that's a very large K_h, which would mean the hydrolysis reaction goes almost to completion, which can't be right. Wait, no, wait: a large K_h would mean the reaction favors products, so more H+ is produced, making the solution more acidic. But if Kb is very small, K_h is very large, which would make the solution very acidic.

Wait, maybe I got Kb wrong. Let me think again. The solubility of Fe(OH)3 is low, but when it does dissolve, it acts as a weak base. So its Kb is small, which would make K_h large. So hydrolysis would produce a lot of H+, making the solution very acidic.

So, the hydrolysis equation is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

But for calculation purposes, perhaps we can consider it as:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

Let me consider that. The equilibrium expression is:

K_h = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+]/[Fe^3+]

But I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to approximate the H+ concentration based on the hydrolysis.

Given that the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.0093575 M, which is approximately 9.3575e-3 M.

Let me denote [Fe^3+] = c = 9.3575e-3 M.

The hydrolysis will produce H+ ions, so let's set up the equation:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

At equilibrium, the change would be:

Fe^3+: c - x → approx c, since x is small compared to c? Wait no, because K_h is very large, so x may be significant.

Wait, but if K_h is large, the reaction goes almost to completion, so x is approximately c. But wait, that can't be, because if K_h is large, the denominator in the expression would be very small, so the reaction would proceed to the right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But I don't know K for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it using the solubility product of Fe(OH)3.

The solubility product K_sp for Fe(OH)3 is known. I think it's around 6e-37. Let me confirm: yes, I think K_sp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6 × 10^-37.

So, for Fe(OH)3, the dissolution is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq)

K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-37.

But in this case, the solution is acidic, so OH^- concentration is low. But when we have Fe^3+ in solution, it can hydrolyze to produce H+ ions, which lowers OH^-.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in an acidic solution.

Wait, but wait. If the solution is acidic, then the OH^- concentration is low, which would shift the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 to the right, making more Fe^3+ available. But in this case, we already have Fe^3+ from Fe(OH)3 reacting with acid. So perhaps the hydrolysis will contribute to the H+ concentration.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it using the charge balance.

In the solution, the main ions are Fe^3+ and Cl^- (from HCl). The solution is acidic, so H+ concentration will be significant, and OH^- is negligible.

The charge balance equation is:

3[Fe^3+] = [H+] - [OH^-]

But since the solution is acidic, [OH^-] is negligible compared to [H+], so approximately:

3[Fe^3+] ≈ [H+]

But wait, that's only true if the solution is dominated by H+ and Fe^3+ doesn't contribute other ions. Alternatively, perhaps the H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ and any excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but in our case, the acid is in stoichiometric amount to neutralize the hydroxide. So let's see: moles of HCl added is 0.00280725 mol, and the moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.00093575 mol. So each Fe(OH)3 requires three H+ ions, so the HCl provides exactly that. So after reaction, all Fe(OH)3 is converted to Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

But wait, the HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates. So the solution will have Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions, and the H+ comes from the dissociation of Fe^3+.

So the solution's H+ concentration is due to the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So, to calculate [H+], we can treat the hydrolysis as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The K for this reaction is K_h, which is Kw / K_sp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, because the reaction is the reverse of the dissolution. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 into Fe^3+ and OH^- has a K_sp of 6e-37. The reverse reaction (Fe^3+ hydrolyzing to form Fe(OH)3 and H+) would have a K equal to 1 / K_sp, but that's not exactly correct because it's not the same as the dissolution. Alternatively, K for the hydrolysis is Kw / K_sp.

Wait, let me think. The dissolution reaction is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- ; K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 =6e-37.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ ; K_h = ?

The K for this reaction can be found by considering the reverse of the dissolution and the autoionization of water.

Wait, perhaps using the equation:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But [Fe(OH)3] is the solubility, which is very low, but since it's a solid, it's effectively a constant. Wait no, because Fe(OH)3 is a solid in this solution, so its concentration is considered constant. So K for the hydrolysis is K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Alternatively, another approach is to relate K_h to K_sp. Let's see:

From the dissolution equation:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- ; K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis equation is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ ; K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Multiplying these two equations together: 

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- 
Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+

Adding them gives:

Fe(OH)3(s) + Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + Fe^3+ + 3OH^- + 3H+.

Wait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, the product of K_sp and K_h is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 * [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] ] = [OH^-]^3 [H+]^3 = (Kw)^3.

So K_sp * K_h = (Kw)^3 → K_h = (Kw)^3 / K_sp.

But Kw is 1e-14, so (1e-14)^3 =1e-42.

So K_h = 1e-42 / 6e-37 ≈ 1.6667e-6.

So K_h ≈ 1.6667e-6.

Wait, that's a very small K_h. So the reaction doesn't proceed much, which means hydrolysis doesn't produce a lot of H+ ions. So the solution might not be as acidic as I thought earlier.

But wait, why is K_h so small?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

K_sp for Fe(OH)3 is 6e-37.

The reaction for hydrolysis is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant, so K = (solid) * [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But to find K:

The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)3(s) → Fe^3+ + 3OH^- ; K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse reaction (hydrolysis) is Fe^3+ + 3OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+.

Wait, perhaps another way: the reaction for hydrolysis can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's not included in the expression. So K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But we can relate this to K_sp.

From the dissolution, [Fe^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3.

Substituting into the hydrolysis K expression:

K = [H+]^3 / (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) ) = [H+]^3 [OH^-]^3 / K_sp = ( [H+][OH^-] )^3 / K_sp.

But [H+][OH^-] = Kw = 1e-14.

So K = (1e-14)^3 / K_sp.

So K = (1e-42) / (6e-37) ) ≈ 1.6667e-6.

So K ≈ 1.6667e-6.

Hmm, that's a K_h of about 1.6667e-6.

So now, using this K_h, which is 1.6667e-6, we can find the [H+].

Let me denote [Fe^3+] as c = 0.0093575 M.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

Let x be the concentration of H+ produced per Fe^3+ ion. So for each mole of Fe^3+ that reacts, 3 moles of H+ are produced.

So the change would be:

[Fe^3+] = c - x ≈ c (if x is small compared to c).

[H+] = 3x.

Wait, no. Because each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+ ions. So if x is the amount of Fe^3+ that reacts, then [H+] increases by 3x.

But because K_h is small (1.6667e-6), x might be small, so we can approximate [Fe^3+] ≈ c.

So K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] ≈ ( (3x)^3 ) / c = (27 x^3)/c.

Set this equal to K_h:

27 x^3 / c = K_h → x^3 = (K_h * c) / 27.

x^3 = (1.6667e-6 * 9.3575e-3) / 27.

Let me compute that:

1.6667e-6 * 9.3575e-3 = approx 1.563e-8.

Divide by 27: 1.563e-8 / 27 ≈ 5.787e-10.

So x^3 = 5.787e-10 → x = cube root of 5.787e-10.

Cube root of 1e-9 is 1e-3. 5.787e-10 is slightly less than 6e-10, so cube root is roughly (5.787e-10)^(1/3) ≈ 8.3e-4.

So x ≈ 8.3e-4 M.

Then [H+] = 3x ≈ 2.49e-3 M.

So pH = -log(2.49e-3) ≈ 2.606.

Wait, but let me compute that precisely.

[H+] = 3x = 3 * 8.3e-4 ≈ 2.49e-3.

pH = -log(2.49e-3) → log(2.49e-3) is log(2.49) + log(1e-3) → log(2.49) ≈ 0.396, so 0.396 -3 = -2.604. pH is 2.604.

So approximately pH 2.60.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³.

Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³.

Hmm, but my calculation for volume is around 28.07 cm³, which is close to option C's 28.05 cm³, but the pH I calculated is about 2.60, which isn't matching any option exactly. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution may have excess H+ because some H+ comes from the acid.

Wait, no, because the acid is added in stoichiometric amount, which is just enough to neutralize the Fe(OH)3. So all the H+ in solution comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, another approach: maybe the hydrolysis produces H+ and the solution's pH is determined by that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should treat the solution as a hydrolysis solution and use the formula for weak acids.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.0093575 M.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ according to:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The expression is K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

We have K = 1.6667e-6.

So let [H+] = y.

Then, (y^3)/(0.0093575 - y) ≈ 1.6667e-6.

Assuming y is much smaller than 0.0093575, we can approximate denominator as 0.0093575.

So y^3 ≈ 1.6667e-6 * 0.0093575.

Compute 1.6667e-6 * 0.0093575 = approx 1.563e-8.

So y^3 = 1.563e-8 → y ≈ cube root of 1.563e-8.

Cube root of 1e-8 is 1e-2.666, but let me compute it numerically.

1.563e-8 = 1.563 × 10^-8.

Cube root is (1.563)^(1/3) × (10^-8)^(1/3) ≈ 1.16 × 1e-2.666.

Wait, 10^-8 is (10^-3)^3 × 10^-(-1) → Wait, 10^-8 = (1e-3)^3 × 1e-(-1) → No, perhaps I should compute it as 10^-8 is (10^(-8/3))^3. 8/3 is 2.666..., so 1e-8 is (1e-2.666...)^3. So cube root is 1e-2.666.

But 1e-2.666 is about 2.154e-3. So 1.16 × 2.154e-3 ≈ 2.5e-3.

Wait, that's the [H+], so y ≈ 2.5e-3. pH is about 2.60.

But none of the options have pH 2.60. Option B is pH 2.69, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that x is small isn't valid, and I need to solve the equation without approximation.

Let me set up the equation without approximation.

The equation is:

(y^3) / (c - y) = K_h → y^3 = K_h (c - y)

Where c = 0.0093575 M, K_h = 1.6667e-6.

So:

y^3 + 1.6667e-6 y - (1.6667e-6 * c) = 0.

Let me compute 1.6667e-6 * c = 1.6667e-6 * 9.3575e-3 ≈ 1.563e-8.

So equation becomes:

y^3 + 1.6667e-6 y - 1.563e-8 = 0.

This is a cubic equation. Solving this exactly might be tricky, but perhaps I can make an initial guess and iterate.

Let me assume y is about 2.5e-3 as before.

Compute LHS: (2.5e-3)^3 + 1.6667e-6*(2.5e-3) -1.563e-8.

(2.5e-3)^3 = 1.5625e-8.

1.6667e-6 * 2.5e-3 = 4.16675e-9.

So total: 1.5625e-8 +4.16675e-9 -1.563e-8 ≈ (1.5625e-8 -1.563e-8) +4.16675e-9 ≈ (-0.5e-10) +4.16675e-9 ≈ 4.1667e-9 - 5e-11 ≈ 4.116e-9.

Which is positive, but equation is 0. So y is lower than 2.5e-3.

Wait, perhaps trying y=2.4e-3.

Compute (2.4e-3)^3 = 13.824e-9 =1.3824e-8.

1.6667e-6 * 2.4e-3 = 3.999e-9.

So LHS: 1.3824e-8 +3.999e-9 -1.563e-8 = (1.3824e-8 -1.563e-8) +3.999e-9 = (-1.806e-9) +3.999e-9 = 2.193e-9 → still positive.

Try y=2.2e-3.

(2.2e-3)^3=10.648e-9=1.0648e-8.

1.6667e-6 *2.2e-3=3.6667e-9.

LHS: 1.0648e-8 +3.6667e-9 -1.563e-8 = (1.0648e-8 -1.563e-8) +3.6667e-9 = (-5e-9) +3.6667e-9 = (-1.3333e-9) → negative.

So between 2.2e-3 and 2.4e-3.

Wait, perhaps using linear approximation between these points.

At y=2.2e-3: LHS is -1.333e-9.

At y=2.4e-3: LHS is 2.193e-9.

We can model the function as linear between these two points.

We need LHS=0.

The change in y is 0.2e-3 (from 2.2 to 2.4e-3), and the change in LHS is 3.526e-9 (from -1.333e-9 to 2.193e-9).

We need to find dy such that (from y=2.2e-3) LHS increases by 1.333e-9.

dy = (1.333e-9) / (3.526e-9 per 0.2e-3) ) = (1.333 /3.526 ) * 0.2e-3 ≈ (0.378) * 0.2e-3 ≈ 0.0756e-3.

So y ≈ 2.2e-3 + 0.0756e-3 = 2.2756e-3.

So y≈2.276e-3.

[H+] ≈ 2.276e-3 → pH = -log(2.276e-3) ≈ 2.644.

Hmm, about 2.64.

Looking at the options, option B is pH 2.69. Close but not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in K_h calculation. Let me recheck.

Earlier, I thought K_h = (Kw)^3 / K_sp.

Wait, K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis equation is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's constant, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But from the dissolution, [Fe^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3.

Substituting into K:

K = [H+]^3 / (K_sp / [OH^-]^3 ) ) → [H+]^3 [OH^-]^3 / K_sp = ( [H+][OH^-] )^3 / K_sp = (Kw)^3 / K_sp.

So K = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-37 = 1e-42 /6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 = approximately 1.6667e-6.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that the solution also has Cl^- ions from HCl, which are spectator ions and don't affect pH.

So, perhaps my calculation of pH around 2.64 is more accurate than the initial 2.60.

But the options don't have 2.64.

Looking at the options:

Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³.

Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, when I calculated the volume, I assumed that the moles of HCl needed is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so each mole requires 3 H+.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of moles of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, molar mass of Fe(OH)3:

Fe: 55.845 g/mol.

O: 16.00 g/mol ×3 = 48.00.

H: 1.008 ×3 = 3.024.

Total: 55.845 +48.00 +3.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

So 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = approx 0.0009357 mol.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

But perhaps I should carry more decimal places.

0.1 / 106.869 = 0.0009357 mol.

HCl needed: 3 × 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

Volume = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.

So option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close.

So the volume is about 28.07, which rounds to 28.05? Or perhaps the options approximate to two decimal places.

But regardless, the correct volume is around 28.05 cm³, which matches option C.

Now, the pH calculation: 

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise [H+] value. Let me recalculate the [H+].

Using the equation:

y^3 = K_h * (c - y).

With c = 0.009357 mol/L.

K_h =1.6667e-6.

Let me set up the equation:

y^3 + 1.6667e-6 y - 1.6667e-6 * 0.009357 = 0.

Compute 1.6667e-6 * 0.009357 = 1.563e-8.

So equation: y^3 +1.6667e-6 y -1.563e-8 =0.

Assume y=2.27e-3.

Compute y^3: (2.27e-3)^3 ≈ 11.69e-9 =1.169e-8.

1.6667e-6 * y ≈ 3.78e-9.

Sum: 1.169e-8 +3.78e-9 =1.547e-8.

Subtract 1.563e-8 → 1.547e-8 -1.563e-8 = -1.6e-10.

So negative. So y is a bit higher.

Try y=2.28e-3.

y^3 ≈ (2.28e-3)^3 = 2.28^3 ×1e-9 = approx 11.79 ×1e-9 =1.179e-8.

1.6667e-6 *2.28e-3 =3.8e-9.

Sum: 1.179e-8 +3.8e-9 =1.559e-8.

Subtract 1.563e-8 →1.559e-8 -1.563e-8 = -4e-10.

Still negative. Try y=2.29e-3.

y^3: (2.29)^3 = approx 12. → 12e-9 =1.2e-8.

1.6667e-6 *2.29e-3 → approx 3.816e-9.

Sum:1.2e-8 +3.816e-9 =1.5816e-8.

Subtract 1.563e-8 → 1.5816e-8 -1.563e-8 =1.86e-9.

Now, positive. So y is between 2.28e-3 and 2.29e-3.

Let me use linear approximation.

At y=2.28e-3, LHS is -4e-10.

At y=2.29e-3, LHS is +1.86e-9.

The change in y is 1e-4 (from 2.28 to 2.29e-3).

The change in LHS is 2.26e-9.

We need to find dy such that LHS increases by 4e-10.

dy = (4e-10) / (2.26e-9 per 1e-4) ) → (4e-10) / (2.26e-9) → approx 0.177e-4.

So y ≈2.28e-3 +0.177e-4 → 2.28177e-3.

So y ≈2.2818e-3.

[H+] = 2.2818e-3 M.

pH = -log(2.2818e-3) → let's compute.

log(2.2818e-3) = log(2.2818) + log(1e-3) → 0.3585 -3 = -2.6415.

So pH ≈ 2.6415, about 2.64.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option B, pH 2.69, but that's higher than our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the hydrolysis produces 3 H+ per Fe^3+ ion. So the correct approach is to set [H+] = 3x, where x is the concentration of Fe^3+ that reacts.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the equilibrium expression correctly.

Let me try another approach. Let me denote the concentration of Fe^3+ as c = 0.0093575 M.

The reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium concentrations are:

[Fe^3+] = c - x

[Fe(OH)3] = x (solid, but treated as x)

[H+] = 3x

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = x (3x)^3 / (c - x) = (27 x^4) / (c - x).

But since K is very small (1.6667e-6), x is much smaller than c. So c -x ≈ c.

So approximately, K ≈ (27 x^4) / c → x^4 = (K c) /27.

x^4 = (1.6667e-6 * 0.0093575) /27 → (1.563e-8)/27 ≈ 5.787e-10.

x = (5.787e-10)^(1/4).

Compute 5.787e-10^(1/4):

Let me think: 1e-8 is (1e-2)^4. 5.787e-10 is 5.787 ×1e-10.

1e-10 is (1e-2.5)^4.

Let me compute (5.787e-10)^(1/4):

Take natural log: ln(5.787e-10) ≈ ln(5.787) + ln(1e-10) → 1.754 + (-23.02585) = -21.27185.

Divide by 4: -5.31796.

Exponentiate: e^-5.31796 ≈ 0.00506.

Wait, wait no. Let me think: 1e-10 is (1e-2.5)^4. So 5.787e-10 is about 5.787 times that. So the fourth root would be (5.787)^(1/4) × 1e-2.5.

(5.787)^(1/4) ≈ 1.55 (since 1.5^4=5.06, 1.6^4=6.55). So approx 1.55.

1e-2.5 is 3.16e-3.

So x ≈ 1.55 * 3.16e-3 ≈ 4.91e-3 M.

Wait, but this can't be right because x can't be larger than c=0.0093575 M. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the correct formula. Another approach: Let me consider that the reaction produces 3 H+ ions per Fe^3+ ion.

The correct equilibrium expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6.

So [H+]^3 = 1.6667e-6 * [Fe^3+].

[Fe^3+] = 0.0093575 - x, where x is the amount of Fe^3+ that reacts.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.0093575, [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.0093575.

So [H+]^3 ≈ 1.6667e-6 * 0.0093575 →1.563e-8.

[H+] = cube root of 1.563e-8 → approximately 2.5e-3 M.

pH = -log(2.5e-3) ≈ 2.60.

So the pH is around 2.60.

But none of the options match this. The closest option is option B, pH 2.69, which uses a volume of about 30 cm³. But earlier, our volume calculation was around 28 cm³, which matches option C.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the volume change. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: dissolve 0.1g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. So the final solution volume is 100 cm³. The volume of acid added is V cm³, and V plus the initial solution's volume (maybe 100 cm³ minus V) equals 100 cm³. Wait, no, if the initial solution is, say, some volume, and then you add V cm³ of acid, making the total 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the initial volume is 100 cm³, and the acid is added, making the total volume more than 100? Or perhaps the solution is prepared by adding the acid to the Fe(OH)3, and the total is 100 cm³.

Wait, the problem states: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the final solution is 100 cm³.

So the volume of acid added (V) plus the volume of the solution (perhaps water) equals 100 cm³.

But without knowing the initial volume of the solution before adding acid, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the acid is added to reach the 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a minimal amount of water, and then acid is added up to 100 cm³.

So, the volume of acid added is V, and the total solution is V + initial volume = 100 cm³. But without knowing the initial volume, perhaps we can assume it's negligible, making the solution's volume approximately V cm³. But that doesn't align with the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ includes the acid added. So the volume of acid is V, and the total solution is 100 cm³. So the concentration of Fe^3+ is moles / 0.1 L.

So, with that, the [Fe^3+] is 0.0093575 mol / 0.1 L = 0.093575 M.

Wait, that changes things.

Wait, if the solution's volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), then [Fe^3+] = 0.0093575 mol / 0.1 L = 0.093575 M.

So, earlier, I thought [Fe^3+] was 0.0093575 M, but actually it's 9.3575e-2 M.

That's a big difference.

So, recalculating pH with [Fe^3+] =0.093575 M.

Using the same K_h =1.6667e-6.

The equation is:

[H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+].

[H+]^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.093575 ≈ 1.563e-7.

So [H+] = cube root of 1.563e-7 → approximately 5.38e-3 M.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) → log(5.38e-3) is log(5.38) + log(1e-3) → 0.731 + (-3) = -2.269. So pH ≈ 2.269, about 2.27.

That's closer to option C's pH of 2.04. Hmm, but it's not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made another mistake. Let me compute cube root of 1.563e-7.

Cube root of 1e-6 is 1e-2. Cube root of 1.563e-7 = cube root(1.563e-7) = cube root(1.563) * cube root(1e-7) ≈ 1.16 * 4.64e-3 → approx 5.41e-3.

So [H+] =5.41e-3 → pH = -log(5.41e-3) ≈ 2.266.

But none of the options match this. Option C's pH is 2.04, which is lower than this. Option B's pH is 2.69, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the calculation without making approximations.

Let me compute [H+]^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.093575 = 1.563e-7.

[H+] = (1.563e-7)^(1/3).

Let me compute 1.563e-7:

= 1.563 × 10^-7.

Cube root: (1.563)^(1/3) × 10^(-7/3).

10^(-7/3) = 10^(-2.3333) ≈ 4.64e-3.

(1.563)^(1/3) ≈ 1.16.

So [H+] ≈ 1.16 ×4.64e-3 ≈5.406e-3.

pH= -log(5.406e-3) → log(5.406e-3)= log(5.406) + (-3) → 0.7325 -3= -2.2675 → pH=2.2675.

So about pH 2.27.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option C with pH 2.04, but that's lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h value.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is more acidic because the Fe^3+ hydrolysis is more significant when the concentration is higher.

Wait, if [Fe^3+] is higher, then [H+] would be higher, leading to a lower pH. Wait, according to the calculation, pH is 2.27, which is more acidic than 2.60, which makes sense because higher [Fe^3+] would produce more H+.

But the options don't have 2.27.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³.

Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, K_h is Kw^3 / K_sp = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-37 = 1e-42 /6e-37 = 1.6667e-6. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct pH is around 2.27, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the acid is not just H+ but a monobasic strong acid, which means it contributes one H+ per molecule, so the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH by considering that the solution contains Fe^3+ and the strong acid.

Wait, but the acid is added in stoichiometric amount. So all the Fe(OH)3 is neutralized, and the solution contains Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

So the H+ comes solely from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But according to our calculation, [H+] is about 5.4e-3, pH around 2.27.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a mistake, and the correct answer isn't listed. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the Fe^3+ concentration. Let me recheck.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g /106.869 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol.

Volume of solution: 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.

Concentration [Fe^3+] = 0.0009357 / 0.1 = 0.009357 M → no, that's 9.357e-3 M.

Wait, no, earlier I thought the solution's volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), so [Fe^3+] = 0.0009357 / 0.1 =0.009357 M.

Wait, that's 9.357e-3 M, not 0.09357 M. Earlier, I thought the concentration was 0.09357 M, but that's incorrect.

So earlier calculation was wrong. So let's correct that.

So [Fe^3+] = 9.357e-3 M.

So [H+]^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 9.357e-3 →1.6667e-6 *9.357e-3 = 1.563e-8.

So [H+] = cube root of 1.563e-8 → approximately 2.5e-3 M.

pH = -log(2.5e-3) ≈2.60.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the solution is more complex. Maybe the acid is in excess, and contributes to the H+ concentration.

Wait, the moles of HCl added are exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So all Fe(OH)3 is neutralized, and no excess H+ comes from HCl. So the H+ comes only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

So pH is around 2.60, but the options don't have this. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the hydrolysis equation more accurately.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The correct K expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's treated as a constant, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But K is 1.6667e-6.

So [H+]^3 = K * [Fe^3+].

[H+]^3 =1.6667e-6 *9.357e-3 = 1.563e-8.

So [H+] = cube root(1.563e-8) → approximately 2.5e-3 M.

pH ≈2.60.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the volume of acid needed is 30.09 cm³, and the pH is around 2.69.

But why would the volume be higher than our calculated 28 cm³? Let me check the initial calculation.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.0009357 mol.

Moles of HCl needed:3 *0.0009357=0.002807 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M HCl: 0.002807 /0.1=0.02807 L=28.07 cm³.

So the volume is 28.07 cm³, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³.

So the volume part is correct. But then the pH should be around 2.60.

But according to the options, option C has pH 2.04, which is much lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the pH calculation is wrong and I should consider that the solution is FeCl3, which is a strong electrolyte, and the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the pH using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But perhaps I should use the formula for a weak acid:

For a solution of a weak acid with concentration c and ionization constant Ka, the pH can be approximated using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( (Ka * c) )

But in this case, the hydrolysis produces H+ from Fe^3+.

Wait, but Fe^3+ is acting as a weak acid, so perhaps using the formula:

Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA].

But in this case, HA is Fe^3+, A- is Fe(OH)^2+, and H+ comes from water.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a weak acid:

[H+] = sqrt( Ka * c )

But with Ka = K_h and c = [Fe^3+] =9.357e-3 M.

Ka = K_h =1.6667e-6.

So [H+] = sqrt(1.6667e-6 *9.357e-3) = sqrt(1.563e-8) ≈1.25e-4.

Wait, that can't be right because that would give [H+] =1.25e-4, pH=3.90.

But that's even higher than earlier calculations.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the formula sqrt(Ka *c) is for a weak acid where the dissociation is HA → H+ + A-.

But in this case, the reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+, which is a base hydrolysis, not a acid dissociation. So perhaps the correct formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation:

[H+] = sqrt( (Kw^2) / (K_sp * c) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer to the hydrolysis calculation method.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here, and perhaps the correct option is option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

But according to our calculations, the pH is around 2.60, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, perhaps K_h is not (Kw^3)/K_sp but something else.

Let me think again. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- ; K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 =6e-37.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ ; K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Multiplying K_sp and K_h gives:

K_sp * K_h = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 * [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = [OH^-]^3 [H+]^3 = (1e-14)^3 =1e-42.

So K_h = (1e-42)/ K_sp = (1e-42)/(6e-37) =1.6667e-6, which is correct.

So the calculation seems correct, but the pH comes to about 2.60, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction isn't 3:1 but 1:3.

Wait, no, Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so each requires one H+.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry earlier. Let me re-express the reaction.

Fe(OH)3 reacts with HCl:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O.

So yes, 3 moles of HCl per mole of Fe(OH)3.

So the initial calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, despite the pH discrepancy. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution's volume isn't 100 cm³, but the acid is added to 100 cm³ of solution. So the total volume is 100 cm³, and the acid volume is V, which makes the total solution V plus the initial solution (maybe already 100 cm³). That would complicate things, but perhaps it's the case.

Wait, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a certain volume, and then V cm³ of acid is added, making the total volume 100 cm³.

So the initial volume before adding acid is 100 - V cm³.

The concentration of Fe^3+ would then be (0.0009357 mol) / (0.1 L) )=0.009357 M.

So the pH calculation remains the same.

So perhaps the pH should be around 2.60, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, accepting that the pH is 2.04.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_sp value.

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct K_sp for Fe(OH)3. I think I was wrong earlier; K_sp is about 6e-37, which I used, but perhaps it's different.

Wait, according to some references, the K_sp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.0 ×10^-37. So my calculation was correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the options, the correct volume is 28.05 cm³, which is option C. But the pH doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the pH is calculated using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the hydrolysis reaction and solve the cubic equation accurately.

The equation is:

y^3 = K_h * (c - y).

With c =9.357e-3 M, K_h=1.6667e-6.

So y^3 +1.6667e-6 y - (1.6667e-6 *9.357e-3) =0.

Compute 1.6667e-6 *9.357e-3 =1.563e-8.

Equation: y^3 +1.6667e-6 y -1.563e-8 =0.

Assume y ≈2.5e-3.

Compute LHS: (2.5e-3)^3 +1.6667e-6*(2.5e-3) -1.563e-8.

=1.5625e-8 +4.16675e-9 -1.563e-8 = (1.5625e-8 -1.563e-8) +4.166e-9 ≈ (-5e-10) +4.166e-9 ≈4.116e-9.

Which is positive. So y is lower than 2.5e-3.

Wait, perhaps trying y=2.4e-3.

(2.4e-3)^3=13.824e-9=1.3824e-8.

1.6667e-6 *2.4e-3=3.999e-9.

LHS:1.3824e-8 +3.999e-9 -1.563e-8= (1.3824e-8 -1.563e-8) +3.999e-9= (-1.806e-9) +3.999e-9=2.193e-9.

Still positive. Try y=2.3e-3.

(2.3e-3)^3=12.167e-9=1.2167e-8.

1.6667e-6 *2.3e-3=3.833e-9.

LHS:1.2167e-8 +3.833e-9 -1.563e-8= (1.2167e-8 -1.563e-8) +3.833e-9= (-3.463e-9) +3.833e-9=3.7e-10.

Still positive. Try y=2.2e-3.

(2.2e-3)^3=10.648e-9=1.0648e-8.

1.6667e-6 *2.2e-3=3.6667e-9.

LHS:1.0648e-8 +3.6667e-9 -1.563e-8= (1.0648e-8 -1.563e-8) +3.6667e-9= (-5e-9) +3.6667e-9= -1.3333e-9.

Negative. So solution is between y=2.2e-3 and 2.3e-3.

Using linear approximation:

At y=2.2e-3, LHS=-1.333e-9.

At y=2.3e-3, LHS=3.7e-10.

We need to find dy such that LHS=0.

Change in y: 0.1e-3.

Change in LHS: 3.7e-10 - (-1.333e-9) =1.703e-9.

We need to cover 1.333e-9 to reach zero from y=2.2e-3.

So dy = (1.333e-9 /1.703e-9) *0.1e-3 ≈ (0.782) *0.1e-3=0.0782e-3.

So y=2.2e-3 +0.0782e-3=2.2782e-3.

So [H+]=2.2782e-3 → pH=-log(2.2782e-3)=2.64.

Still not matching the options.

Given all this, perhaps the intended answer is option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04, but I'm not confident about the pH part.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction with a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid (e.g., HCl) is:

**Fe(OH)₃ + 3HCl → FeCl₃ + 3H₂O**

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃} = 55.85 + 3(16.00) + 3(1.008) = 106.869 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)₃} = \frac{0.1}{106.869} \approx 0.0009357 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Moles of HCl required
Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of HCl. Thus:
\[
\text{Moles of HCl} = 3 \times 0.0009357 \approx 0.002807 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Volume of HCl required
The concentration of HCl is 0.1 M. The volume of HCl required is:
\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{\text{Concentration of HCl}} = \frac{0.002807}{0.1} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{L} = 28.07 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

### Step 4: pH of the resulting solution
The solution contains Fe³⁺ ions from the dissociation of FeCl₃. The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:
\[
[\text{Fe³⁺}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe³⁺}}{\text{Total volume of solution}} = \frac{0.0009357}{0.1} \approx 0.009357 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ in water is:
\[
\text{Fe³⁺} + 3\text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)₂⁺} + 3\text{H⁺}.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:
\[
K_h = \frac{[\text{H⁺}]^3}{[\text{Fe³⁺}]}.
\]
The relationship between \(K_h\), \(K_w\), and \(K_{sp}\) of Fe(OH)₃ is:
\[
K_h = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{sp}}.
\]
Given \(K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14}\) and \(K_{sp} = 6 \times 10^{-37}\):
\[
K_h = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-14})^3}{6 \times 10^{-37}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-42}}{6 \times 10^{-37}} \approx 1.6667 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Using the hydrolysis equilibrium:
\[
K_h = \frac{[\text{H⁺}]^3}{[\text{Fe³⁺}]} \implies [\text{H⁺}]^3 = K_h \cdot [\text{Fe³⁺}].
\]
Substitute \(K_h = 1.6667 \times 10^{-6}\) and \([\text{Fe³⁺}] = 0.009357 \, \text{M}\):
\[
[\text{H⁺}]^3 = (1.6667 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (0.009357) \approx 1.563 \times 10^{-8}.
\]
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = \sqrt[3]{1.563 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log{[\text{H⁺}]} = -\log{(2.5 \times 10^{-3})} \approx 2.60.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
- **Volume of HCl**: Calculated as 28.07 cm³, which matches option C (28.05 cm³).
- **pH**: Calculated as approximately 2.60, but none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is C (pH 2.04), though this discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or assumptions.

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of HCl required is 28.05 cm³, corresponding to option C.
