Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find Z, the partition function, which involves summing over all possible states the exponential of (-beta E), right?

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E). So each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being +1 or -1. Since there are three spins, each with two possibilities, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

But calculating each term individually for 8 states might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values of the energy E for each state.

The energy expression is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Let me compute the sum inside, let's call it H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J H.

Each term in H is the product of two spins. Since each spin is ±1, each product is either +1 (when spins are the same) or -1 (when opposite). So each term contributes +1 or -1.

Wait, so H is the sum of three such terms. Let's find all possible values of H.

Alternatively, maybe I can categorize the states based on the number of pairs that are aligned. Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute H for each of the 8 states.

Let me list all possible states and compute H for each.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
H = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 +1 +1 = 3.
So E = -J * 3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
H = 1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.
E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
H = 1*(-1) + 1*(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.
E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
H = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.
E = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
H = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.
E = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
H = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.
E = J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.
E = J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
H = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
E = -J*3.

Wait, so looking at the states:

- Only two states have H=3. Those are all spins up or all down.
- The other six states have H = -1, leading to E = J.

Wait, but wait a minute, let me double-check state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

H = (1*1) + (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct.

Similarly, state 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

H = (1*(-1)) + (1*1) + (-1*1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. Correct.

So, yes, in all 8 states, only two have H=3, and the other six have H=-1.

Wait, but wait another moment: what about the state where S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1? Let me compute H again:

H = (1*-1) + (1*-1) + (-1*-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. Correct.

So, yes, only two states have H=3 and the rest have H=-1.

So the energy for each state is either E = -3J (for H=3) or E = J (for H=-1).

Now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E).

Each state contributes exp(-beta E) to Z.

So, for the two states where E = -3J, each contributes exp(-beta*(-3J)) = exp(3 beta J).

Each of the six states where E = J contributes exp(-beta * J) = exp(-beta J).

Thus, Z = 2 * exp(3 beta J) + 6 * exp(-beta J).

Wait, but looking at the options provided:

Option A) 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because our first part is 2 e^(3Jβ).

Option B)2 e^(3Jβ)+6 e^(-Jβ) → Yes, that's what I have.

Option C)2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ) → No, different exponents.

Option D)6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ) → No, and exponents are 2, not 1.

Wait, but wait another thought: Did I make a mistake in the exponent signs?

No, because in the partition function, each term is exp(-beta E). So when E is -3J, it's exp(-beta*(-3J))= exp(3 beta J). When E is +J, it's exp(-beta J).

So Z = 2 e^{3 beta J} + 6 e^{- beta J}.

So looking at the options, option B is that.

Wait, but checking the options again:

Option B: Z=2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ) → Yes.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1 / kT \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. Each state corresponds to a specific combination of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). The energy \( E \) depends on the sum \( H = S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \), which can take values \( H = 3 \) or \( H = -1 \) based on the alignment of spins.

### Step 1: Classify states based on \( H \)
- **States with \( H = 3 \):** These occur when all three spins are aligned (either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)). There are \( 2 \) such states.
- **States with \( H = -1 \):** These occur when two spins are aligned and one is opposite. There are \( 6 \) such states.

### Step 2: Compute contributions to \( Z \)
For each state, the energy is \( E = -J H \). Substituting \( H \) into the partition function:
- For states with \( H = 3 \): \( E = -3J \), so the contribution is \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3\beta J} \).
- For states with \( H = -1 \): \( E = J \), so the contribution is \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus:
\[
Z = 2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 3: Match with options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A:** \( Z = 2 e^{-3J\beta} + 6 e^{J\beta} \) → Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta} \) → Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2 e^{2J\beta} + 6 e^{-2J\beta} \) → Incorrect, as the exponents are wrong.
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6 e^{2J\beta} + 2 e^{-2J\beta} \) → Incorrect, as the exponents and coefficients are wrong.

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
