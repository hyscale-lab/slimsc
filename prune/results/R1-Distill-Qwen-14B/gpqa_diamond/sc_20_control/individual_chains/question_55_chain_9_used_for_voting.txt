Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The given NMR data is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. I remember that NMR can give information about the structure, especially the protons and their neighboring groups. Let me think about each part of the spectrum.

First, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. I think that's probably a proton in an aromatic environment, but wait, acetates are esters, not aromatic. Oh wait, no, maybe an allylic position. Alternatively, maybe a vinyl proton. Because 7 ppm is upfield for an aromatic proton, but perhaps it's a substituted vinyl group.

Wait, acetate derivatives are esters where the acetyl group is attached to another group. The other part being either propenyl or butenyl, depending on the option. So the structure would be something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group.

Let me think about the possible structures.

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: The structure would be CH2CH2 with the ester group on one end, and the substituents on the same side. Wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH3? Or maybe it's CH2CH-OAc for propenyl. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? No, wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2- but with a double bond. So maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's clarify the structures. The options are:

- Cis-propenyl acetate: The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but in the cis configuration. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so perhaps the ester is on the end, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, propenyl is usually CH2=CHCH2-; so the substituents on the double bond would be CH2-OAc and CH2CH2? Wait, no, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, that's not right. Let me get the structure right.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, wait. For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no, maybe it's CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? No, that's allyl acetate. Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, maybe it's CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? But that's allyl acetate, which is a propenyl group. Hmm, perhaps the question is about substituents on the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's acrolein acetate or something else. No, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the four options are about butenyl and propenyl. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar, but with a four-carbon chain.

Wait, but the question says the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. So the groups attached to the ester oxygen (O) are propenyl or butenyl, and the configuration (cis or trans) refers to the double bond in the R group.

So, for propenyl acetate, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's not possible because that would be OAc-O-CH2CH=CH2, which is allyl acetate. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, which is propenyl acetate. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the ester group on C3.

Similarly, butenyl would be a four-carbon group with a double bond.

So, butenyl would have four carbons, like CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but that's a single bond. Alternatively, it's CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which would make the double bond at the first position.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structures:

Propenyl acetate: CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, that's not possible because O would be attached to CH2, which is attached to CH=CH2. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then, the configuration (cis or trans) would refer to the substituents on the double bond.

Wait, but in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituents would be CH3CO-O- on C2 and CH2 on C1. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about the NMR data again.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a relatively large coupling constant, which suggests it's a trans coupling between two protons on adjacent carbons with a double bond. So perhaps this is a vinyl proton that's coupled with another proton across the double bond. So maybe the structure has a double bond with two protons on adjacent carbons.

Looking at the other peaks: 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, that's a bit more complex. Maybe this is another vinyl proton, perhaps adjacent to a CH2 group or something else. 

The 2.1 ppm is a singlet integrating for 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons, like the acetyl group (COO-) in the acetate. So that's the CH3CO part.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet integrating for 3H. So this is a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH group. Because a doublet suggests it's coupled to one neighboring proton.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond, and a methyl group attached to that CH2. Let me think.

Wait, for example, if we have a structure like CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3CO-O-CH2-C=CH2, but that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps for the structure, let's think of it as CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then, the protons on the double bond would be on CH2=CH-. So the protons on the CH2 would be split into a doublet because of the coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in that case, the protons on the CH2=CH-OAc would have certain coupling. Let me imagine this structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be split into a triplet or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's try to match the NMR data.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. That's a big coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling across a double bond, so maybe a proton on one end of a double bond coupled with a proton on the adjacent carbon.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quartets). That's a more complex splitting. Maybe this proton is next to two different sets of protons, leading to a multiplet.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is likely next to a double bond. Because a doublet for a methyl group indicates it's next to one proton. So perhaps the structure has a CH2 group next to a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-OAc? No, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, but that's a four-carbon group, which would be butenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the protons on C2 would be CH2, and the OAc is on C3.

In that case, the H on C2 (CH2) would be next to the double bond. Let me think about the NMR.

For propenyl acetate, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which is allyl acetate. But the options are propenyl and butenyl, so perhaps I'm on the right track.

In allyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2OAc), the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (i.e., the CH2 next to the double bond) would show coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3.

In such a structure, the protons on C1 (CH2) would couple with the protons on C2 (CH2), but wait, no, that's not possible because C2 would be attached to OAc.

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly.

The structure would be: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So, C1: CH2=, C2: CH-, C3: CH2-OAc.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more like OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 of the R group.

In this case, the protons on C3 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond.

Let me think about the NMR.

The CH2CH=CH2 group would have protons on C2 and C3.

The H on C3 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond, so their coupling would be with the H on C2, which is part of the double bond.

So, the H on C3 (CH2) would be a triplet because they're adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but the data shows a peak at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering everything.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3. No, wait, that would be a different structure. Let's think about the butenyl options.

Butenyl would have four carbons. So, for example, CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Wait, but that would be a single bond. Alternatively, the double bond is between C1 and C2, making the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc.

But then the OAc is on the fourth carbon. Hmm, but the NMR data doesn't show a quartet for a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. That would be allyl acetate, but perhaps the options are considering butenyl and propenyl.

Let me get back to the NMR data.

The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. That's probably a vinyl proton with a trans coupling. So maybe it's a proton on C2 and another on C3, but I'm not sure.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quartets), which suggests that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Maybe it's a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and another substituent.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), so a methyl group attached to a CH group. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-OAc. Wait, that's a butenyl group.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)2? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2OAc)-CH3. Then the butenyl group would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and a substituent on C3, which is CH(CH2OAc)CH3.

But the NMR data doesn't show a triplet or something else for that methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH2OAc)CH3. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Then, the CH(CH3) would have a methyl group attached, and the CH2=CH would have two protons.

Wait, let's model this structure.

Structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc.

In this case, the protons on CH2= would be on C1, and the CH(CH3) would be on C3.

So, the CH2=CH group would have protons that are coupled. The protons on C1 would see the protons on C2, which is a CH group. Wait, but in this structure, C2 would be a CH, not CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. The protons on the double bond (C1 and C2) would be split.

The H on C1 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond, and perhaps coupled with the H on C2 (CH). But since H on C2 is a CH (and perhaps has other substituents), maybe that's where the coupling comes in.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to match the NMR data.

Looking at the peak at 7.0 ppm, a doublet with J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling between two protons. So it's likely a proton on one carbon and another on an adjacent carbon, but on opposite sides of the double bond.

The 5.5 ppm peak, a dq, which is a doublet of quartets. So this proton is coupled to two sets of protons. Perhaps it's a CH group that is adjacent to a CH2 and another CH or something else.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that's next to another proton. So perhaps a structure like CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc.

In that case, the CH(CH3) would have a methyl group, and the CH adjacent to the double bond would have a proton that's coupled to the adjacent proton.

Let me think about the splitting. If the CH(CH3) is on C3, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the H on C2 (CH) would be adjacent to the H on C1 (CH2) and the H on C3 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling between the protons on the double bond.

In the case of trans coupling (J=16 Hz), the protons on either end of the double bond are trans to each other. So, for example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2OAc, the H on C1 (CH2) and H on C2 (CH2) would be trans if the double bond is in between.

Wait, no. Wait, let's consider a trans double bond. The two H's on either end are on opposite sides. So, for CH2=CHCH2OAc, the H on C1 (CH2) would be on one side, and the H on C2 (CH2) would be on the opposite side, so they are trans.

Wait, that's correct. So, if the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, then the H on C1 (CH2) and the H on C2 (CH2) would be trans and couple with each other, giving a J around 16 Hz.

So, in this structure, the H on C2 (CH2) would be next to the H on C1 (CH2=) and also next to the H on C3 (CH2OAc). So their splitting would be more complex.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR signals.

In CH2=CHCH2OAc, the protons on the CH2= would be split into a triplet because they are adjacent to the CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would show a triplet because they are next to a CH2 group, but perhaps in the NMR, it's appearing as a doublet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about coupling patterns.

In a trans double bond, the H's on either end are trans and couple with each other. So, in CH2=CHCH2OAc, the H's on CH2= (C1) and the H on CH2 (C2) would be trans.

So the H on C1 would be a doublet because it's coupled to the H on C2, which is trans, J=16 Hz.

Similarly, the H on C2 would be a doublet, but also coupled to the H on C3 (CH2OAc), which would split each peak into a triplet. But wait, the NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) and another at 5.5 (dq). So maybe the 7.0 is the H on C1, which is a doublet due to coupling with C2, and the 5.5 is the H on C2, which is coupled with both C1 and C3, leading to a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the 7.0 ppm is the H on C1, which is a doublet because it's only coupled to the H on C2 (trans) with J=16 Hz. The H on C2 would be coupled to both the H on C1 (J=16) and the two H's on C3 (CH2), leading to a splitting into a quartet for each of the two H's on C3. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of quartets.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a single peak, so perhaps it's an overlapping of multiple peaks. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 5.5 is a dq, which is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the H on C2 is coupled to two different sets: one with J=16 Hz (from C1) and another with a smaller J (from C3's CH2).

Wait, but the CH2 on C3 would have two H's, leading to a triplet. So the H on C2 would have coupling to each of the two H's on C3, leading to a triplet. But also, it's coupled to the H on C1, leading to a doublet. So the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets, not quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, if the H on C2 is coupled to two H's on C3, each with a certain J, and also coupled to the H on C1, that would result in a triplet for each of the C3 H's, but combined with the doublet from C1, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. In this case, the H on C2 would be coupled to the H on C1 (trans) and the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which is a single H. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets, perhaps.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, where the H on C2 is next to a CH2 group, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the H on C1 (CH2=) which is coupled to the H on C2 (CH2), giving a doublet.

The H on C2 (CH2) would be next to the H on C1 (doublet) and adjacent to the H on C3 (CH2OAc), which is a CH2 group. So the H on C2 would be a triplet, but in the NMR, it's appearing as a doublet of quartets. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something else. Let me think of the butenyl options.

Wait, butenyl would have four carbons and a double bond. Let's say the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Then, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be coupled to H on C2 (CH2), which is trans, giving a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

The H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to H on C1 (J=16 Hz) and to the H on C3 (CH2), which is a single bond, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a peak at 5.5 ppm as a dq, so perhaps this isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3. Then, the H on C1 would be coupled to the H on C2, which is adjacent and trans. The H on C2 would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and to the H on CH2OAc (if any), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: the acetate group (OAc) is a good electrondonor, so the adjacent protons would be deshielded, appearing upfield or downfield depending on the structure.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is likely the OAc's methyl group (CH3COO-), as it's not split because it's attached to an electronegative oxygen and has no neighboring protons.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), so a methyl group attached to a CH group. That suggests a structure where a methyl is attached to a carbon that's adjacent to another CH group, perhaps with a double bond nearby.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH2OAc)CH3. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, so the H on C1 would be at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would be at 1.6 ppm as a doublet, since it's attached to a CH group.

Wait, no. The CH(CH3) would have three H's? No, CH(CH3) is a CH with two CH3's attached? No, that's not right. CH(CH3) would be a CH with a methyl group attached, so it's a CH2? Wait, no, CH(CH3) is a carbon attached to two H's and a methyl group.

Wait, no, CH(CH3) would have one H, because it's CH with two substituents: CH3 and another group. Wait, perhaps the methyl group is attached to a CH that's adjacent to the double bond.

So, for example, the structure could be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc.

In that case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H), at 7.0 ppm.

The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and to the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which has a methyl group. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets, perhaps, but the NMR shows it as a dq (doublet of quartets), which may not fit.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would have a methyl group attached, making the H on C3 a quartet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. In that case, the H on C1 would be a doublet (J=16), the H on C2 would be a triplet (coupled to C1 and C3), and the H on C3 (CH2OAc) would be a quartet (coupled to C2). But the NMR only shows two peaks in the 5-7 ppm region, so maybe this isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3. Then, the H on C1 would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans), and the H on C3 would be a triplet. But I'm not sure about the other peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (allyl acetate). Let's think about that.

In allyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2OAc), the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet, coupled to the H on C2 (CH2), which is trans. The H on C2 would be coupled to both C1 and C3 (CH2OAc), making it a triplet. The H on C3 (CH2OAc) would be a quartet, coupled to C2.

But in the NMR data, we only see two peaks in the 5-7 ppm range. Wait, the NMR data shows:

7.0 (1H, d, J=16 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)

So only two protons in that region, which suggests perhaps only one set of protons is present. So maybe the structure isn't as I thought.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted propenyl group, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3. But then, the H on C2 would be adjacent to C3's OAc group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the options and their structures.

Options are Cis-propenyl acetate (C), Trans-propenyl acetate (B), Cis-butenyl acetate (A), Trans-butenyl acetate (D).

Let me think about the structures.

Cis-propenyl acetate: the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the substituents on the double bond are on the same side. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3.

In the cis configuration, the groups on either end of the double bond would be on the same side. So, in this case, the OAc is on C3, which is CH2-OAc, and the CH2 on C1 would have two H's.

Wait, perhaps in cis-propenyl acetate, the substituents are the same on both ends, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the substituents on the same side.

Similarly, Trans-propenyl acetate would have the substituents on opposite sides.

But in terms of the NMR, the difference between cis and trans would be in the coupling constants and the splitting patterns.

Wait, but for a double bond, the coupling between the H's on adjacent carbons (on either end of the double bond) would be trans in configuration, leading to a larger J (like 16 Hz). So whether the substituents are cis or trans would affect the splitting.

Wait, but the configuration (cis/trans) refers to the arrangement of substituents around the double bond, not the coupling between protons. So the coupling J would be the same regardless of cis or trans, as long as the protons are on opposite sides.

Wait, but that's not correct. The coupling constant J depends on the dihedral angle between the two protons. For a trans double bond, the H's on adjacent carbons would be in a trans arrangement, leading to a larger J (like 16 Hz). For cis, they would be on the same side, leading to a smaller J, perhaps around 10 Hz or so.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall: the dihedral angle for trans (anti) is 180°, leading to a larger coupling constant (like 16 Hz). For cis (syn), the dihedral angle is 0°, leading to a smaller coupling, maybe around 10 Hz. So in the NMR, a J of 16 Hz suggests a trans arrangement.

Therefore, if the peak at 7.0 ppm is due to a trans coupling, then the substituents on the double bond are trans, which would correspond to the trans configuration.

Wait, but the problem is that the options include both propenyl and butenyl. So perhaps I should determine whether the structure is propenyl or butenyl based on the NMR.

Looking at the NMR data, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group. So perhaps the structure is a butenyl group, where after the double bond, there's a CH group with a methyl attached.

For example, in trans-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc.

So the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans, J=16 Hz), and the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 and C3.

Wait, the structure would be CH2=C-CH(CH3)-OAc. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to a CH(CH3) group.

So the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to the H on C1 (doublet), and also to the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which is a single H. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets. But the NMR shows it as a doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all the coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is coupled to two H's on C3, but that would require C3 to have two H's. Wait, no, CH(CH3) has only one H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and C3 (two H's), leading to a triplet or quartet. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. In that case, the H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to C1 (CH2=) and C3 (CH2), leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Let me think about that.

In this structure, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans), the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and C3 (CH(CH2OAc)), which has two H's and a CH2OAc group. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of triplets or something else, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the number of protons in each region.

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d) suggests a single proton in that region. The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) suggests another single proton. The 2.1 ppm (3H, s) is the OAc's methyl. The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl attached to a CH.

So, perhaps the structure is a propenyl group where the OAc is on the end, and there's a methyl attached to a CH adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, for example, the structure could be CH2=CH-CH(OAc)-CH3, but that would be a four-carbon chain, which would be butenyl. Wait, that would make it CH2=CHCH(OAc)CH3, but that doesn't seem right because the OAc would be on a CH, not a CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, which is allyl acetate. In this case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans), at 7.0 ppm. The H on C2 (CH2) would be a triplet, but the NMR shows a peak at 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals in the NMR.

The NMR has four signals:

1. 7.0 ppm (1H, d)
2. 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
3. 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
4. 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

So, there are four different types of protons.

The 7.0 and 5.5 are likely from the double bond. The 2.1 is the OAc methyl. The 1.6 is a methyl attached to a CH.

So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Let's see:

- The H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans), at 7.0 ppm.
- The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and to the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which is a single H. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets. Hmm, not matching.
Wait, but the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would have two substituents: a methyl group and the OAc. So the H on C3 would be a singlet? No, because it's attached to a CH and next to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this as a diastereotopic situation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH3)CH2OAc.

In this case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet. The H on C2 (C(CH3)) would be a singlet because it's attached to two CH3 groups and the double bond. But that doesn't fit the NMR data either.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. In this case:

- H on C1 (CH2=) → doublet at 7.0 ppm (coupled to C2's H, J=16).
- H on C2 (CH2) → coupled to C1 and C3 (CH2OAc), so a triplet.
- H on C3 (CH2OAc) → coupled to C2, so a quartet.

But the NMR shows only two peaks in the 5-7 ppm region, so this might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Let's model that:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but perhaps not, depending on substitution.
Wait, no, in this structure, C1 would be CH2, C2 would be CH, and C3 would be CH(CH3)OAc.

So, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, J=16). The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and C3. The H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would be a singlet? No, because it's attached to a CH and next to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 would be a doublet of quartets because it's coupled to C1 and to the two H's on C3. But C3 only has one H, so that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is the OAc's CH3, so that's clear.

The 1.6 ppm is a methyl attached to a CH, which suggests a structure like CH(CH3).

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (1H) with J=16, which suggests a trans coupling to another H.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (1H), which suggests that H is coupled to two sets of protons: perhaps one with J= something and another with a smaller J.

So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, where the H on C2 is coupled to C1 (J=16) and to the H on C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and possibly to other H's.

Wait, but in that structure, the H on C3 is a CH(CH3), which would have one H. So the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and C3 (J=something), leading to a doublet of doublets. But the NMR shows a dq, which is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps this isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc-CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (allyl acetate), but the NMR would have more peaks in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's not correct because esters are O-CO-O.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling in the 5.5 ppm peak. The fact that it's a doublet of quartets suggests that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with two coupling partners.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Then, the H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to C1 (CH2=) and C3 (CH2), leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a dq, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3, which would make the H on C2 (CH) coupled to C1 (CH2=) and to the two H's on C3 (CH2CH3). So the H on C2 would be a doublet of triplets, but the NMR shows a dq.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 and C3 (which has a CH(CH2OAc)CH3 group). The H on C3 would have two H's, leading to a triplet coupling.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate → butenyl group with cis substituents around the double bond.

B) Trans-propenyl acetate → propenyl group with trans substituents.

C) Cis-propenyl acetate → propenyl group with cis substituents.

D) Trans-butenyl acetate → butenyl group with trans substituents.

Now, the NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), which is a trans coupling, so the substituents are trans. Therefore, the configuration would be trans, so options B and D are possible.

But wait, the options for propenyl are Cis and Trans, and butenyl are Cis and Trans.

If the J=16 Hz suggests a trans arrangement, then the substituents on the double bond are trans. So for propenyl, that would be trans-propenyl acetate (option B), and for butenyl, trans-butenyl acetate (option D).

Now, the question is whether the structure is propenyl or butenyl.

Looking at the integral, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which would be more likely in a butenyl structure, perhaps as a branch.

In a propenyl group, you might not have a methyl attached to a CH adjacent to the double bond. Whereas, in a butenyl group, you could have a CH(CH3) group.

For example, in trans-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. No, that's not a branch.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2OAc)-CH3. No, that's more complicated.

Alternatively, the butenyl group could have a branch, like CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. But that's a four-carbon chain with a branch. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, making it a butenyl group.

Wait, CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc is actually a four-carbon chain (since CH(CH3) is the third carbon), making it butenyl.

In this structure, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, J=16), appearing at 7.0 ppm.

The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and C3 (CH(CH3)). So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which is more than two couplings.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) has two H's, but that's not possible because it's a CH.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and the two H's on C3 (CH2OAc), leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a dq.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Perhaps I should think about the number of neighboring protons.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl attached to a CH that has one neighboring H. So the structure would be something like CH(CH3)-something.

In the trans-butenyl acetate structure (option D), perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Then, the H on C2 (CH2) would be a triplet, but the NMR doesn't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and the H on C3 (CH2CH2OAc), which is a CH2 group, leading to a quartet.

Wait, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which suggests the H is coupled to two groups, each with two protons. So perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH2 group and another CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. In this case, the H on C2 (CH2) would be a triplet, but the NMR shows 5.5 as a dq.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3, but that would have more carbons than butenyl.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH3)CH2OAc. In this case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (J=16), and the H on C2 (C(CH3)) would be a singlet, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I think I'm going around in circles here. Let's try to make a decision based on the information.

The J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling, so the substituents are trans. So the options are B (Trans-propenyl acetate) and D (Trans-butenyl acetate).

Now, let's think about the other signals.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) suggests a proton coupled to two sets of protons. For a trans-propenyl structure, perhaps it's the H on the CH2 next to the double bond, which is coupled to the H on the double bond and to the H on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, in trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, where the substituents on the double bond (CH2OAc and CH3) are trans.

In this case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (J=16), appearing at 7.0 ppm.

The H on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond and the CH2OAc group. So the H on C2 would be a triplet, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the integration. The 7.0 and 5.5 ppm peaks each have 1H, so perhaps there's only one proton on each of those carbons.

If the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, then the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet, the H on C2 (CH) would be a doublet of doublets, and the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would be a singlet. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, where the H on C2 (CH2) is a triplet, but that's not matching the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 and C3's CH2, leading to a quartet.

But the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which suggests coupling to two groups, each with two protons.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is coupled to the H on C1 (J=16) and to the two H's on C3 (CH2), leading to a doublet of quartets. That would fit the 5.5 ppm peak.

So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. But wait, that's a three-carbon chain, making it propenyl.

So, in this structure, the H on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to C1 (CH2=) and C3 (CH2OAc). So:

- H on C1 (CH2=) → doublet (J=16), 7.0 ppm.
- H on C2 (CH2) → adjacent to C1 (two H's) and C3 (two H's), so triplet from C1 and quartet from C3, leading to a triplet of quartets, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3. Then, the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and the two H's on C3 (CH2CH3), leading to a doublet of quartets. That matches the NMR.

So, in this case, the H on C2 would be at 5.5 ppm, a doublet of quartets.

The H on C1 (CH2=) would be at 7.0 ppm, a doublet.

The 2.1 ppm is the OAc's methyl.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) would come from the CH2CH3 group in C3. Wait, but the CH2CH3 is a -CH2CH3 group, which would have a triplet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3. But the NMR only shows a doublet at 1.6 ppm, which suggests a single CH3 group attached to a CH.

Wait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps this structure isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: the presence of a doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH or something else.

So, the structure might be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, making it a butenyl group.

In this structure:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but in reality, it's a double bond, so each has one H. Wait, no, CH2= would have two H's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc.

Then:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but in the NMR, it's a doublet (1H). So perhaps only one H is present, which suggests a different structure.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH3)CH2OAc.

Then:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but the NMR shows only one H in that region, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc-CH(CH3), but that would imply a longer chain, which might not fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the key points are:

- J=16 Hz → trans coupling → trans configuration.
- The presence of a methyl group attached to a CH (1.6 ppm, d).
- The structure is likely a butenyl group because of the methyl attached to a CH.

Therefore, the correct option would be D) Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, but let's confirm:

Trans-butenyl acetate would have a structure like CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but that doesn't explain the 1.6 ppm methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, which would be a four-carbon (butenyl) structure with a methyl branch.

In this structure:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but NMR shows 1H. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be a CH, and the H on C3 would be CH2, but I'm not sure about the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 and C3's CH2, leading to a doublet of quartets, which matches the NMR.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the information, I think the correct answer is D) Trans-butenyl acetate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**  
   This peak corresponds to a proton in a vinyl environment, coupled to another proton across a double bond with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). This indicates a **trans configuration** for the double bond.

2. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**  
   This peak is a doublet of quartets, suggesting a proton coupled to two distinct sets of protons. This is consistent with a proton on a carbon adjacent to a double bond and a CH2 group.

3. **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**  
   This singlet corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl (OAc) group, which is not split due to the lack of neighboring protons.

4. **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**  
   This doublet indicates a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another proton.

### Structural Considerations:
- The **trans configuration** (J = 16 Hz) suggests that the double bond in the structure is in the **trans arrangement**. This eliminates Cis-propenyl acetate (C) and Cis-butenyl acetate (A).
- The presence of a methyl group attached to a CH (1.6 ppm, d) suggests a **butenyl group** rather than a propenyl group. This eliminates Trans-propenyl acetate (B).
- The remaining option is **Trans-butenyl acetate**, which has a butenyl group with a trans double bond. The structure is consistent with the NMR data:
  - The **7.0 ppm peak** corresponds to the proton on the CH2 group adjacent to the trans double bond.
  - The **5.5 ppm peak** corresponds to the proton on the CH group adjacent to the double bond and the CH2 group.
  - The **2.1 ppm peak** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl group.
  - The **1.6 ppm peak** corresponds to the methyl group attached to the CH group.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as it matches the trans configuration, the coupling constants, and the splitting patterns observed.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The given NMR data is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. I remember that NMR can give information about the structure, especially the protons and their neighboring groups. Let me think about each part of the spectrum.

First, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. I think that's probably a proton in an aromatic environment, but wait, acetates are esters, not aromatic. Oh wait, no, maybe an allylic position. Alternatively, maybe a vinyl proton. Because 7 ppm is upfield for an aromatic proton, but perhaps it's a substituted vinyl group.

Wait, acetate derivatives are esters where the acetyl group is attached to another group. The other part being either propenyl or butenyl, depending on the option. So the structure would be something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group.

Let me think about the possible structures.

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: The structure would be CH2CH2 with the ester group on one end, and the substituents on the same side. Wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH3? Or maybe it's CH2CH-OAc for propenyl. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? No, wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2- but with a double bond. So maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's clarify the structures. The options are:

- Cis-propenyl acetate: The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but in the cis configuration. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so perhaps the ester is on the end, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, propenyl is usually CH2=CHCH2-; so the substituents on the double bond would be CH2-OAc and CH2CH2? Wait, no, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, that's not right. Let me get the structure right.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, wait. For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no, maybe it's CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? No, that's allyl acetate. Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, maybe it's CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? But that's allyl acetate, which is a propenyl group. Hmm, perhaps the question is about substituents on the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's acrolein acetate or something else. No, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the four options are about butenyl and propenyl. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar, but with a four-carbon chain.

Wait, but the question says the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. So the groups attached to the ester oxygen (O) are propenyl or butenyl, and the configuration (cis or trans) refers to the double bond in the R group.

So, for propenyl acetate, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's not possible because that would be OAc-O-CH2CH=CH2, which is allyl acetate. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, which is propenyl acetate. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the ester group on C3.

Similarly, butenyl would be a four-carbon group with a double bond.

So, butenyl would have four carbons, like CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but that's a single bond. Alternatively, it's CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which would make the double bond at the first position.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structures:

Propenyl acetate: CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, that's not possible because O would be attached to CH2, which is attached to CH=CH2. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then, the configuration (cis or trans) would refer to the substituents on the double bond.

Wait, but in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituents would be CH3CO-O- on C2 and CH2 on C1. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about the NMR data again.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a relatively large coupling constant, which suggests it's a trans coupling between two protons on adjacent carbons with a double bond. So perhaps this is a vinyl proton that's coupled with another proton across the double bond. So maybe the structure has a double bond with two protons on adjacent carbons.

Looking at the other peaks: 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, that's a bit more complex. Maybe this is another vinyl proton, perhaps adjacent to a CH2 group or something else. 

The 2.1 ppm is a singlet integrating for 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons, like the acetyl group (COO-) in the acetate. So that's the CH3CO part.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet integrating for 3H. So this is a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH group. Because a doublet suggests it's coupled to one neighboring proton.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond, and a methyl group attached to that CH2. Let me think.

Wait, for example, if we have a structure like CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3CO-O-CH2-C=CH2, but that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps for the structure, let's think of it as CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then, the protons on the double bond would be on CH2=CH-. So the protons on the CH2 would be split into a doublet because of the coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in that case, the protons on the CH2=CH-OAc would have certain coupling. Let me imagine this structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be split into a triplet or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's try to match the NMR data.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. That's a big coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling across a double bond, so maybe a proton on one end of a double bond coupled with a proton on the adjacent carbon.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quartets). That's a more complex splitting. Maybe this proton is next to two different sets of protons, leading to a multiplet.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is likely next to a double bond. Because a doublet for a methyl group indicates it's next to one proton. So perhaps the structure has a CH2 group next to a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-OAc? No, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, but that's a four-carbon group, which would be butenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the protons on C2 would be CH2, and the OAc is on C3.

In that case, the H on C2 (CH2) would be next to the double bond. Let me think about the NMR.

For propenyl acetate, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which is allyl acetate. But the options are propenyl and butenyl, so perhaps I'm on the right track.

In allyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2OAc), the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (i.e., the CH2 next to the double bond) would show coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3.

In such a structure, the protons on C1 (CH2) would couple with the protons on C2 (CH2), but wait, no, that's not possible because C2 would be attached to OAc.

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly.

The structure would be: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So, C1: CH2=, C2: CH-, C3: CH2-OAc.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more like OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 of the R group.

In this case, the protons on C3 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond.

Let me think about the NMR.

The CH2CH=CH2 group would have protons on C2 and C3.

The H on C3 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond, so their coupling would be with the H on C2, which is part of the double bond.

So, the H on C3 (CH2) would be a triplet because they're adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but the data shows a peak at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering everything.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3. No, wait, that would be a different structure. Let's think about the butenyl options.

Butenyl would have four carbons. So, for example, CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Wait, but that would be a single bond. Alternatively, the double bond is between C1 and C2, making the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc.

But then the OAc is on the fourth carbon. Hmm, but the NMR data doesn't show a quartet for a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. That would be allyl acetate, but perhaps the options are considering butenyl and propenyl.

Let me get back to the NMR data.

The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. That's probably a vinyl proton with a trans coupling. So maybe it's a proton on C2 and another on C3, but I'm not sure.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quartets), which suggests that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Maybe it's a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and another substituent.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), so a methyl group attached to a CH group. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-OAc. Wait, that's a butenyl group.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)2? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2OAc)-CH3. Then the butenyl group would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and a substituent on C3, which is CH(CH2OAc)CH3.

But the NMR data doesn't show a triplet or something else for that methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH2OAc)CH3. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Then, the CH(CH3) would have a methyl group attached, and the CH2=CH would have two protons.

Wait, let's model this structure.

Structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc.

In this case, the protons on CH2= would be on C1, and the CH(CH3) would be on C3.

So, the CH2=CH group would have protons that are coupled. The protons on C1 would see the protons on C2, which is a CH group. Wait, but in this structure, C2 would be a CH, not CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. The protons on the double bond (C1 and C2) would be split.

The H on C1 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond, and perhaps coupled with the H on C2 (CH). But since H on C2 is a CH (and perhaps has other substituents), maybe that's where the coupling comes in.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to match the NMR data.

Looking at the peak at 7.0 ppm, a doublet with J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling between two protons. So it's likely a proton on one carbon and another on an adjacent carbon, but on opposite sides of the double bond.

The 5.5 ppm peak, a dq, which is a doublet of quartets. So this proton is coupled to two sets of protons. Perhaps it's a CH group that is adjacent to a CH2 and another CH or something else.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that's next to another proton. So perhaps a structure like CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc.

In that case, the CH(CH3) would have a methyl group, and the CH adjacent to the double bond would have a proton that's coupled to the adjacent proton.

Let me think about the splitting. If the CH(CH3) is on C3, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the H on C2 (CH) would be adjacent to the H on C1 (CH2) and the H on C3 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling between the protons on the double bond.

In the case of trans coupling (J=16 Hz), the protons on either end of the double bond are trans to each other. So, for example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2OAc, the H on C1 (CH2) and H on C2 (CH2) would be trans if the double bond is in between.

Wait, no. Wait, let's consider a trans double bond. The two H's on either end are on opposite sides. So, for CH2=CHCH2OAc, the H on C1 (CH2) would be on one side, and the H on C2 (CH2) would be on the opposite side, so they are trans.

Wait, that's correct. So, if the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, then the H on C1 (CH2) and the H on C2 (CH2) would be trans and couple with each other, giving a J around 16 Hz.

So, in this structure, the H on C2 (CH2) would be next to the H on C1 (CH2=) and also next to the H on C3 (CH2OAc). So their splitting would be more complex.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR signals.

In CH2=CHCH2OAc, the protons on the CH2= would be split into a triplet because they are adjacent to the CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would show a triplet because they are next to a CH2 group, but perhaps in the NMR, it's appearing as a doublet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about coupling patterns.

In a trans double bond, the H's on either end are trans and couple with each other. So, in CH2=CHCH2OAc, the H's on CH2= (C1) and the H on CH2 (C2) would be trans.

So the H on C1 would be a doublet because it's coupled to the H on C2, which is trans, J=16 Hz.

Similarly, the H on C2 would be a doublet, but also coupled to the H on C3 (CH2OAc), which would split each peak into a triplet. But wait, the NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) and another at 5.5 (dq). So maybe the 7.0 is the H on C1, which is a doublet due to coupling with C2, and the 5.5 is the H on C2, which is coupled with both C1 and C3, leading to a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the 7.0 ppm is the H on C1, which is a doublet because it's only coupled to the H on C2 (trans) with J=16 Hz. The H on C2 would be coupled to both the H on C1 (J=16) and the two H's on C3 (CH2), leading to a splitting into a quartet for each of the two H's on C3. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of quartets.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a single peak, so perhaps it's an overlapping of multiple peaks. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 5.5 is a dq, which is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the H on C2 is coupled to two different sets: one with J=16 Hz (from C1) and another with a smaller J (from C3's CH2).

Wait, but the CH2 on C3 would have two H's, leading to a triplet. So the H on C2 would have coupling to each of the two H's on C3, leading to a triplet. But also, it's coupled to the H on C1, leading to a doublet. So the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets, not quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, if the H on C2 is coupled to two H's on C3, each with a certain J, and also coupled to the H on C1, that would result in a triplet for each of the C3 H's, but combined with the doublet from C1, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. In this case, the H on C2 would be coupled to the H on C1 (trans) and the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which is a single H. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets, perhaps.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, where the H on C2 is next to a CH2 group, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the H on C1 (CH2=) which is coupled to the H on C2 (CH2), giving a doublet.

The H on C2 (CH2) would be next to the H on C1 (doublet) and adjacent to the H on C3 (CH2OAc), which is a CH2 group. So the H on C2 would be a triplet, but in the NMR, it's appearing as a doublet of quartets. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something else. Let me think of the butenyl options.

Wait, butenyl would have four carbons and a double bond. Let's say the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Then, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be coupled to H on C2 (CH2), which is trans, giving a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

The H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to H on C1 (J=16 Hz) and to the H on C3 (CH2), which is a single bond, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a peak at 5.5 ppm as a dq, so perhaps this isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3. Then, the H on C1 would be coupled to the H on C2, which is adjacent and trans. The H on C2 would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and to the H on CH2OAc (if any), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: the acetate group (OAc) is a good electrondonor, so the adjacent protons would be deshielded, appearing upfield or downfield depending on the structure.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is likely the OAc's methyl group (CH3COO-), as it's not split because it's attached to an electronegative oxygen and has no neighboring protons.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), so a methyl group attached to a CH group. That suggests a structure where a methyl is attached to a carbon that's adjacent to another CH group, perhaps with a double bond nearby.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH2OAc)CH3. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, so the H on C1 would be at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would be at 1.6 ppm as a doublet, since it's attached to a CH group.

Wait, no. The CH(CH3) would have three H's? No, CH(CH3) is a CH with two CH3's attached? No, that's not right. CH(CH3) would be a CH with a methyl group attached, so it's a CH2? Wait, no, CH(CH3) is a carbon attached to two H's and a methyl group.

Wait, no, CH(CH3) would have one H, because it's CH with two substituents: CH3 and another group. Wait, perhaps the methyl group is attached to a CH that's adjacent to the double bond.

So, for example, the structure could be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc.

In that case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H), at 7.0 ppm.

The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and to the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which has a methyl group. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets, perhaps, but the NMR shows it as a dq (doublet of quartets), which may not fit.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would have a methyl group attached, making the H on C3 a quartet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. In that case, the H on C1 would be a doublet (J=16), the H on C2 would be a triplet (coupled to C1 and C3), and the H on C3 (CH2OAc) would be a quartet (coupled to C2). But the NMR only shows two peaks in the 5-7 ppm region, so maybe this isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3. Then, the H on C1 would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans), and the H on C3 would be a triplet. But I'm not sure about the other peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (allyl acetate). Let's think about that.

In allyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2OAc), the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet, coupled to the H on C2 (CH2), which is trans. The H on C2 would be coupled to both C1 and C3 (CH2OAc), making it a triplet. The H on C3 (CH2OAc) would be a quartet, coupled to C2.

But in the NMR data, we only see two peaks in the 5-7 ppm range. Wait, the NMR data shows:

7.0 (1H, d, J=16 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)

So only two protons in that region, which suggests perhaps only one set of protons is present. So maybe the structure isn't as I thought.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted propenyl group, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3. But then, the H on C2 would be adjacent to C3's OAc group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the options and their structures.

Options are Cis-propenyl acetate (C), Trans-propenyl acetate (B), Cis-butenyl acetate (A), Trans-butenyl acetate (D).

Let me think about the structures.

Cis-propenyl acetate: the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the substituents on the double bond are on the same side. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3.

In the cis configuration, the groups on either end of the double bond would be on the same side. So, in this case, the OAc is on C3, which is CH2-OAc, and the CH2 on C1 would have two H's.

Wait, perhaps in cis-propenyl acetate, the substituents are the same on both ends, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the substituents on the same side.

Similarly, Trans-propenyl acetate would have the substituents on opposite sides.

But in terms of the NMR, the difference between cis and trans would be in the coupling constants and the splitting patterns.

Wait, but for a double bond, the coupling between the H's on adjacent carbons (on either end of the double bond) would be trans in configuration, leading to a larger J (like 16 Hz). So whether the substituents are cis or trans would affect the splitting.

Wait, but the configuration (cis/trans) refers to the arrangement of substituents around the double bond, not the coupling between protons. So the coupling J would be the same regardless of cis or trans, as long as the protons are on opposite sides.

Wait, but that's not correct. The coupling constant J depends on the dihedral angle between the two protons. For a trans double bond, the H's on adjacent carbons would be in a trans arrangement, leading to a larger J (like 16 Hz). For cis, they would be on the same side, leading to a smaller J, perhaps around 10 Hz or so.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall: the dihedral angle for trans (anti) is 180°, leading to a larger coupling constant (like 16 Hz). For cis (syn), the dihedral angle is 0°, leading to a smaller coupling, maybe around 10 Hz. So in the NMR, a J of 16 Hz suggests a trans arrangement.

Therefore, if the peak at 7.0 ppm is due to a trans coupling, then the substituents on the double bond are trans, which would correspond to the trans configuration.

Wait, but the problem is that the options include both propenyl and butenyl. So perhaps I should determine whether the structure is propenyl or butenyl based on the NMR.

Looking at the NMR data, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group. So perhaps the structure is a butenyl group, where after the double bond, there's a CH group with a methyl attached.

For example, in trans-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc.

So the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans, J=16 Hz), and the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 and C3.

Wait, the structure would be CH2=C-CH(CH3)-OAc. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to a CH(CH3) group.

So the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to the H on C1 (doublet), and also to the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which is a single H. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets. But the NMR shows it as a doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all the coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is coupled to two H's on C3, but that would require C3 to have two H's. Wait, no, CH(CH3) has only one H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and C3 (two H's), leading to a triplet or quartet. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. In that case, the H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to C1 (CH2=) and C3 (CH2), leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Let me think about that.

In this structure, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans), the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and C3 (CH(CH2OAc)), which has two H's and a CH2OAc group. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of triplets or something else, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the number of protons in each region.

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d) suggests a single proton in that region. The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) suggests another single proton. The 2.1 ppm (3H, s) is the OAc's methyl. The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl attached to a CH.

So, perhaps the structure is a propenyl group where the OAc is on the end, and there's a methyl attached to a CH adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, for example, the structure could be CH2=CH-CH(OAc)-CH3, but that would be a four-carbon chain, which would be butenyl. Wait, that would make it CH2=CHCH(OAc)CH3, but that doesn't seem right because the OAc would be on a CH, not a CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, which is allyl acetate. In this case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans), at 7.0 ppm. The H on C2 (CH2) would be a triplet, but the NMR shows a peak at 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals in the NMR.

The NMR has four signals:

1. 7.0 ppm (1H, d)
2. 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
3. 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
4. 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

So, there are four different types of protons.

The 7.0 and 5.5 are likely from the double bond. The 2.1 is the OAc methyl. The 1.6 is a methyl attached to a CH.

So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Let's see:

- The H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, trans), at 7.0 ppm.
- The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and to the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which is a single H. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets. Hmm, not matching.
Wait, but the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would have two substituents: a methyl group and the OAc. So the H on C3 would be a singlet? No, because it's attached to a CH and next to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this as a diastereotopic situation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH3)CH2OAc.

In this case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet. The H on C2 (C(CH3)) would be a singlet because it's attached to two CH3 groups and the double bond. But that doesn't fit the NMR data either.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. In this case:

- H on C1 (CH2=) → doublet at 7.0 ppm (coupled to C2's H, J=16).
- H on C2 (CH2) → coupled to C1 and C3 (CH2OAc), so a triplet.
- H on C3 (CH2OAc) → coupled to C2, so a quartet.

But the NMR shows only two peaks in the 5-7 ppm region, so this might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Let's model that:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but perhaps not, depending on substitution.
Wait, no, in this structure, C1 would be CH2, C2 would be CH, and C3 would be CH(CH3)OAc.

So, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, J=16). The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and C3. The H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would be a singlet? No, because it's attached to a CH and next to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 would be a doublet of quartets because it's coupled to C1 and to the two H's on C3. But C3 only has one H, so that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is the OAc's CH3, so that's clear.

The 1.6 ppm is a methyl attached to a CH, which suggests a structure like CH(CH3).

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (1H) with J=16, which suggests a trans coupling to another H.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (1H), which suggests that H is coupled to two sets of protons: perhaps one with J= something and another with a smaller J.

So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, where the H on C2 is coupled to C1 (J=16) and to the H on C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and possibly to other H's.

Wait, but in that structure, the H on C3 is a CH(CH3), which would have one H. So the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and C3 (J=something), leading to a doublet of doublets. But the NMR shows a dq, which is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps this isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc-CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (allyl acetate), but the NMR would have more peaks in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's not correct because esters are O-CO-O.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling in the 5.5 ppm peak. The fact that it's a doublet of quartets suggests that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with two coupling partners.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Then, the H on C2 (CH2) would be coupled to C1 (CH2=) and C3 (CH2), leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a dq, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3, which would make the H on C2 (CH) coupled to C1 (CH2=) and to the two H's on C3 (CH2CH3). So the H on C2 would be a doublet of triplets, but the NMR shows a dq.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 and C3 (which has a CH(CH2OAc)CH3 group). The H on C3 would have two H's, leading to a triplet coupling.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate → butenyl group with cis substituents around the double bond.

B) Trans-propenyl acetate → propenyl group with trans substituents.

C) Cis-propenyl acetate → propenyl group with cis substituents.

D) Trans-butenyl acetate → butenyl group with trans substituents.

Now, the NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), which is a trans coupling, so the substituents are trans. Therefore, the configuration would be trans, so options B and D are possible.

But wait, the options for propenyl are Cis and Trans, and butenyl are Cis and Trans.

If the J=16 Hz suggests a trans arrangement, then the substituents on the double bond are trans. So for propenyl, that would be trans-propenyl acetate (option B), and for butenyl, trans-butenyl acetate (option D).

Now, the question is whether the structure is propenyl or butenyl.

Looking at the integral, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which would be more likely in a butenyl structure, perhaps as a branch.

In a propenyl group, you might not have a methyl attached to a CH adjacent to the double bond. Whereas, in a butenyl group, you could have a CH(CH3) group.

For example, in trans-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. No, that's not a branch.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2OAc)-CH3. No, that's more complicated.

Alternatively, the butenyl group could have a branch, like CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. But that's a four-carbon chain with a branch. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, making it a butenyl group.

Wait, CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc is actually a four-carbon chain (since CH(CH3) is the third carbon), making it butenyl.

In this structure, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (coupled to C2's H, J=16), appearing at 7.0 ppm.

The H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and C3 (CH(CH3)). So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which is more than two couplings.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) has two H's, but that's not possible because it's a CH.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and the two H's on C3 (CH2OAc), leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a dq.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Perhaps I should think about the number of neighboring protons.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl attached to a CH that has one neighboring H. So the structure would be something like CH(CH3)-something.

In the trans-butenyl acetate structure (option D), perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Then, the H on C2 (CH2) would be a triplet, but the NMR doesn't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 and the H on C3 (CH2CH2OAc), which is a CH2 group, leading to a quartet.

Wait, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which suggests the H is coupled to two groups, each with two protons. So perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH2 group and another CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. In this case, the H on C2 (CH2) would be a triplet, but the NMR shows 5.5 as a dq.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3, but that would have more carbons than butenyl.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH3)CH2OAc. In this case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (J=16), and the H on C2 (C(CH3)) would be a singlet, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I think I'm going around in circles here. Let's try to make a decision based on the information.

The J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling, so the substituents are trans. So the options are B (Trans-propenyl acetate) and D (Trans-butenyl acetate).

Now, let's think about the other signals.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) suggests a proton coupled to two sets of protons. For a trans-propenyl structure, perhaps it's the H on the CH2 next to the double bond, which is coupled to the H on the double bond and to the H on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, in trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, where the substituents on the double bond (CH2OAc and CH3) are trans.

In this case, the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet (J=16), appearing at 7.0 ppm.

The H on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond and the CH2OAc group. So the H on C2 would be a triplet, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the integration. The 7.0 and 5.5 ppm peaks each have 1H, so perhaps there's only one proton on each of those carbons.

If the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, then the H on C1 (CH2=) would be a doublet, the H on C2 (CH) would be a doublet of doublets, and the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) would be a singlet. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, where the H on C2 (CH2) is a triplet, but that's not matching the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 and C3's CH2, leading to a quartet.

But the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which suggests coupling to two groups, each with two protons.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is coupled to the H on C1 (J=16) and to the two H's on C3 (CH2), leading to a doublet of quartets. That would fit the 5.5 ppm peak.

So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. But wait, that's a three-carbon chain, making it propenyl.

So, in this structure, the H on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to C1 (CH2=) and C3 (CH2OAc). So:

- H on C1 (CH2=) → doublet (J=16), 7.0 ppm.
- H on C2 (CH2) → adjacent to C1 (two H's) and C3 (two H's), so triplet from C1 and quartet from C3, leading to a triplet of quartets, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3. Then, the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled to C1 (J=16) and the two H's on C3 (CH2CH3), leading to a doublet of quartets. That matches the NMR.

So, in this case, the H on C2 would be at 5.5 ppm, a doublet of quartets.

The H on C1 (CH2=) would be at 7.0 ppm, a doublet.

The 2.1 ppm is the OAc's methyl.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) would come from the CH2CH3 group in C3. Wait, but the CH2CH3 is a -CH2CH3 group, which would have a triplet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3. But the NMR only shows a doublet at 1.6 ppm, which suggests a single CH3 group attached to a CH.

Wait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps this structure isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: the presence of a doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH or something else.

So, the structure might be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, making it a butenyl group.

In this structure:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but in reality, it's a double bond, so each has one H. Wait, no, CH2= would have two H's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc.

Then:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but in the NMR, it's a doublet (1H). So perhaps only one H is present, which suggests a different structure.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH3)CH2OAc.

Then:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but the NMR shows only one H in that region, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc-CH(CH3), but that would imply a longer chain, which might not fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the key points are:

- J=16 Hz → trans coupling → trans configuration.
- The presence of a methyl group attached to a CH (1.6 ppm, d).
- The structure is likely a butenyl group because of the methyl attached to a CH.

Therefore, the correct option would be D) Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, but let's confirm:

Trans-butenyl acetate would have a structure like CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but that doesn't explain the 1.6 ppm methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, which would be a four-carbon (butenyl) structure with a methyl branch.

In this structure:

- C1: CH2= → H's are two, but NMR shows 1H. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be a CH, and the H on C3 would be CH2, but I'm not sure about the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the H on C2 would be coupled to C1 and C3's CH2, leading to a doublet of quartets, which matches the NMR.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the information, I think the correct answer is D) Trans-butenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**  
   This peak corresponds to a proton in a vinyl environment, coupled to another proton across a double bond with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). This indicates a **trans configuration** for the double bond.

2. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**  
   This peak is a doublet of quartets, suggesting a proton coupled to two distinct sets of protons. This is consistent with a proton on a carbon adjacent to a double bond and a CH2 group.

3. **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**  
   This singlet corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl (OAc) group, which is not split due to the lack of neighboring protons.

4. **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**  
   This doublet indicates a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another proton.

### Structural Considerations:
- The **trans configuration** (J = 16 Hz) suggests that the double bond in the structure is in the **trans arrangement**. This eliminates Cis-propenyl acetate (C) and Cis-butenyl acetate (A).
- The presence of a methyl group attached to a CH (1.6 ppm, d) suggests a **butenyl group** rather than a propenyl group. This eliminates Trans-propenyl acetate (B).
- The remaining option is **Trans-butenyl acetate**, which has a butenyl group with a trans double bond. The structure is consistent with the NMR data:
  - The **7.0 ppm peak** corresponds to the proton on the CH2 group adjacent to the trans double bond.
  - The **5.5 ppm peak** corresponds to the proton on the CH group adjacent to the double bond and the CH2 group.
  - The **2.1 ppm peak** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl group.
  - The **1.6 ppm peak** corresponds to the methyl group attached to the CH group.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as it matches the trans configuration, the coupling constants, and the splitting patterns observed.
