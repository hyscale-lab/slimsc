Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, also called formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta (β) value, the more stable the complex.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. So, I think the blue complex is probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ or maybe another dithiocyanato form. Wait, the complexes are formed step by step. Let me think about the possible complexes.

The problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, these are the stability constants for each step of complex formation. For Co(II) and SCN-, the complexes would be:

- Co^2+ (free ion) → β1 is for the first complex, maybe Co(SCN)^+ with charge +1? Because each SCN- is -1, so one would make Co^2+ → Co^3+ (no, wait, Co^2+ plus SCN^- would be CoSCN^+? Because 2+ + (-1) → +1 charge. So β1 is for the first ionization.

Wait, no, the formation of a complex. So, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, right? Because each SCN- is a ligand. So, each step adds another SCN-.

Wait, the stability constants are given for each successive addition of SCN- to the cobalt ion. So:

β1 = formation of [Co(SCN)]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-.
β2 = formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) from [Co(SCN)]^+ and SCN^-.
β3 = formation of [Co(SCN)_3]^- from [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) and SCN^-.
β4 = formation of [Co(SCN)_4]^(2−) from [Co(SCN)_3]^- and SCN^-.

Wait, but the problem is about the dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), right? Because each SCN contributes -1, two of them would make -2, plus Co^2+ gives 0 charge.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) in the solution.

To find the distribution of species, we need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex. The total cobalt species will be the sum of all possible complexes and the free ion.

But wait, there are four possible complexes (n=1 to 4) plus the free Co^2+.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the formation constants and the concentrations.

The general expression for the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is:

f_n = ( [complex] ) / ( [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] )

Each [complex] can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration and the ligand concentration (SCN^-).

The formula for [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β1β2[SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1β2β3...βn [SCN^-]^n )

Alternatively, each [Co(SCN)_n] can be expressed as [Co^2+] multiplied by the product of β's up to n, multiplied by [SCN]^n, all divided by the sum of all possible terms from n=0 to 4.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to consider the formation step by step, using the given stability constants and concentrations.

Given:

- [SCN^-] = 0.1 M
- Total Co concentration, c(Co) = 1e-2 M

Assuming all Co is in one of the forms: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

The total concentration is the sum of all these species.

The formation constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

First, let's denote [Co^2+] as x. Then:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [CoSCN^+][SCN^-] = 40 * (0.9 x) * 0.1 = 40 * 0.09 x = 3.6 x

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 [Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-] = 63 * (3.6 x) * 0.1 = 63 * 0.36 x = 22.68 x

[Co(SCN)_4^2−] = β4 [Co(SCN)_3^-][SCN^-] = 16 * (22.68 x) * 0.1 = 16 * 2.268 x = 36.288 x

Wait, but actually, the formation of each complex is given by the product of the previous β and the current ligand. So, the nth complex's concentration is βn multiplied by the (n-1)th complex and SCN.

Alternatively, the concentration of each complex can be written as:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] * [SCN^-]

But the way to express each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of [Co^2+] is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = ( β1 β2 ... βn ) [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

So, for n=1: β1, [SCN]^1.

n=2: β1β2, [SCN]^2.

n=3: β1β2β3, [SCN]^3.

n=4: β1β2β3β4, [SCN]^4.

So, for each n, the concentration is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (product β1 to βn) * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^n.

So, let's compute these products.

Compute for each n:

n=1: β1 =9.

n=2: β1β2=9*40=360.

n=3: 360 *63= 22680.

n=4: 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but that's the product up to each n. So:

[Co^2+] =x

[CoSCN^+] = 9 * x * (0.1) =0.9x.

[Co(SCN)_2] = (9*40) * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 * x * 0.01= 3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3] = (9*40*63)*x*(0.1)^3 = 22680 * x * 0.001= 22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4] = (9*40*63*16)*x*(0.1)^4 = 362880 * x * 0.0001= 36.288 x.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right, because if [Co(SCN)_4] is 36.288 x and [Co^2+] is x, the sum would be x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x.

But the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So:

x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = c(Co) =1e-2.

Adding these up:

1x +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So total is 64.468 x = 0.01 M.

So x = 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Wait, that's the concentration of Co^2+.

But then the fractions of each species can be calculated as their concentration divided by the total.

So the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is [Co(SCN)_2] / c(Co).

[Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6 x = 3.6 * 1.55e-4 ≈ 5.58e-5 M.

Total c(Co) is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is (5.58e-5) / (0.01) = 0.00558, which is 0.558% That can't be right because that's way lower than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Oh wait, maybe I shouldn't be multiplying all the β's for each step, but each β is for the nth step.

Wait, another approach: The fraction of each species can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait, for each complex, the numerator is the product of β's up to n multiplied by [SCN]^n, and the denominator is the sum of all terms up to n=4.

So, in this case, the denominator would be:

D = 1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4.

Wait, let me compute each term:

Compute each term:

Term0: 1 (n=0, free Co^2+)
Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9
Term2: β1*β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6
Term3: β1β2β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 * 0.001=22.68
Term4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288

Adding all the terms:

Term0:1

Term1:0.9 → sum:1.9

Term2:3.6 → sum:5.5

Term3:22.68 → sum:28.18

Term4:36.288 → sum:64.468

So D=64.468.

Each term represents the contribution of each species. So:

f0 = Term0 / D =1/64.468 ≈0.0155 →1.55% (free Co^2+)
f1 = 0.9/64.468 ≈0.01394 →1.394% (CoSCN^+)
f2=3.6/64.468≈0.0558 →5.58% (Co(SCN)_2^0)
f3=22.68/64.468≈0.352 →35.2% (Co(SCN)_3^-)
f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5628 →56.28% (Co(SCN)_4^2-)

Wait, but when I add these fractions: 1.55 +1.394 is ~2.94; +5.58→8.52; +35.2→43.72; +56.28→100. So that adds up.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. The dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is n=2. So f2 is approximately 5.58%.

But wait, the options given are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, 5.58% isn't even an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I got the β's wrong. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the β values are for each successive complex, but the way I used them as cumulative products may be incorrect. Because sometimes stability constants can be given as the constant for each step, not the overall constant.

Wait, another approach: The fraction of each species can be calculated using the individual stepwise formation constants.

The fraction of the nth complex is given by:

f_n = ( [Co(SCN)_n] ) / c_total

Where [Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn) [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

But [Co^2+] can be found from the total concentration and the sum of all species.

Alternatively, you can use the expression:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did earlier. So why is the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] only about 5.58%?

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the interpretation of the β's.

Wait, perhaps the β's are given as the overall formation constants, not the stepwise ones. No, no, stability constants are usually stepwise, meaning each β is for adding one ligand. So I think my approach was correct.

Wait, but the problem is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Maybe the blue complex is not [Co(SCN)_2]^0 but [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Because I've heard that Co with four SCN ligands is also blue but I'm not certain. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the colors. Or perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- or another. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but that's what I calculated as 5.58%.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's recompute the denominator:

Term0:1

Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9 → sum=1.9

Term2: β1*β2 [SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6 → sum=5.5

Term3: β1β2β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *0.1^3= 22680*0.001=22.68 → sum=28.18

Term4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.1^4= 362880 *0.0001=36.288 → sum=64.468

So denominator is 64.468.

Then, the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0558, which is 5.58%.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in what the question is asking. Wait, the question says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species".

Wait, dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands. So it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So n=2. So the fraction is 5.58%, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I have the wrong approach. Maybe the problem is using log beta values? Or maybe I got the stability constants for the wrong complexes.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constant given is for the overall complex, not stepwise. For example, β for [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is 16. Then, the other β's are for each step.

Wait, but the way the question presented the β's is as "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So probably βn is for the nth complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

But in that case, the total complex would be the product of all the β's up to that point.

Wait, perhaps the way to calculate the fraction is using the cumulative product up to n=2.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, that's what I did.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the dithiocyanato complex as the first complex, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the overall stability constant for each complex, but that's unlikely because the way they are presented suggests they are stepwise.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the terms. Let me recompute each term.

Let me compute each term in the denominator again:

Term0: 1

Term1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

Term2: β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 =9*40 * (0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6

Term3: β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3= 22680 * 0.001=22.68

Term4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4= 362880 *0.0001= 36.288

Adding all terms: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Now, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is term2, which is 3.6/64.468 = 0.0558 or 5.58%.

That's the same as before.

But the options don't have this. So I must be misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and another form. Or perhaps the blue color is a different complex, like [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which has a higher fraction.

Wait, the options are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

Looking at my earlier fractions, f3 is approximately 35.2%, which is close to option C (38.1%) but not exact.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator or terms.

Wait, let me recalculate each term with more precise numbers.

Compute each term again:

Term0 =1.

Term1=9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2=9 *40 * (0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3=9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 = (9*40=360; 360 *63=22680) *0.001=22.68.

Term4=9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880. Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001 →362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Add all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.0558, which is 5.58%.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the sum of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and another dithiocyanato complex? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term 'dithiocyanato'.

Wait, dithiocyanato could imply two SCN- ligands, so n=2. So the only species is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Some sources define the stability constant as the constant for the formation of the complex from the previous one. For example, β2 is the constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^−.

In that case, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be β1 * β2.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the overall formation constant for each complex, not the stepwise β's. But that would change things.

For example, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be β1 * β2. But that's what I used.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the β's are for each complex, meaning β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. Then, the fractions would be calculated differently.

Wait, but if that's the case, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be β2 [SCN]^2 / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So let me try this alternative approach.

In this case:

f2 = ( β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN]=0.1.

Compute denominator:

1 + (9*0.1) + (40*(0.1)^2) + (63*(0.1)^3) + (16*(0.1)^4 )

Compute each term:

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9 → sum:1.9

Term2:40 *0.01=0.4 → sum:2.3

Term3:63 *0.001=0.063 → sum:2.363

Term4:16 *0.0001=0.0016 → sum:2.3646

So denominator=2.3646.

Numerator for f2:40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

So f2=0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, which is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, this approach seems different. Which is correct? I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, in this approach, the fractions are based on the individual complex's stability constants, not the cumulative product. So for each complex, the term is βn [SCN]^n. But that's how the fractions are calculated before, but I think that approach is incorrect because each step is dependent on the previous complexes.

Wait, perhaps the general formula for the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = ( K_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + K_1 [SCN] + K_2 [SCN]^2 + ... + K_4 [SCN]^4 )

where K_n is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

But in this problem, each K_n is the product of all β's up to n. So K_1=β1, K_2=β1β2, K_3=β1β2β3, K_4=β1β2β3β4.

So then:

K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

Denominator would be 1 + 9*(0.1) + 360*(0.1)^2 + 22680*(0.1)^3 + 362880*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 =1.

9*0.1=0.9 → sum:1.9.

360*0.01=3.6 → sum:5.5.

22680*0.001=22.68 → sum:28.18.

362880 *0.0001=36.288 → sum:64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Then, f2 = K2 * (0.1)^2 / denominator = 360 * 0.01 =3.6 → 3.6/64.468 ≈0.0558 (5.58%).

So that's same as before.

But in the alternative approach where K_n is just βn, so K1=9, K2=40, etc., the denominator is 2.3646 and f2 becomes 16.9% (option D). But that approach seems incorrect because each K should be the product of the stepwise β's.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the definition of the stability constant. In some cases, the stability constant for the nth complex is the overall constant, which is the product of the β's up to n.

In this problem, the way the β's are given is as the stepwise constants, so K_n = product of β1 to βn.

So the correct approach is the first one, which gives f2≈5.58%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the β's as the overall constants for each complex, not the stepwise. Let me try that.

If β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

Then, the denominator would be:

1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

With β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

1.

9*0.1=0.9 → sum=1.9.

40*0.01=0.4 → sum=2.3.

63*0.001=0.063 → sum=2.363.

16*0.0001=0.0016 → sum=2.3646.

So denominator=2.3646.

Now, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β2 [SCN]^2 / denominator =40*(0.01)/2.3646 ≈0.4/2.3646≈0.169, which is 16.9%, option D.

But why would the problem present the β's as the overall constants instead of stepwise? Because the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." That phrasing suggests they're the stepwise constants. But if they're the overall constants, then the answer would be 16.9%, option D.

But I'm not certain which is correct. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of all complexes with two SCN ligands. But that doesn't make sense because each complex has a specific number of ligands.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the blue color as a different complex, not necessarily the dithiocyanato. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is blue, and perhaps the question is asking about that.

In that case, the fraction would be f4=36.288 /64.468≈56.28%, which is not any of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

In that case, f3=22.68/64.468≈35.2%, which is close to option C (38.1%) but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps the calculation is done in a different way. Let me try to approach it using the formation constants and total concentrations.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Each [Co(SCN)_n] can be written as:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β1 β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4

So, let's let [Co^2+] =x.

Then,

[CoSCN^+] =9 x *0.1 =0.9x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 =9*40 x (0.1)^2= 360 x *0.01=3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =9*40*63 x (0.1)^3= 22680 x *0.001=22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2−=9*40*63*16 x (0.1)^4=362880 x *0.0001=36.288 x.

Total c_total =x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = (1+0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288)x =64.468 x.

Given that c_total =1e-2 M, so:

64.468 x = 0.01 → x=0.01 /64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M.

Now, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is (3.6 x) / (0.01) = (3.6 *1.55e-4 ) /0.01.

3.6 *1.55e-4 =5.58e-4.

5.58e-4 /0.01 =0.0558, which is 5.58%.

Again, this brings me back to the same result.

But the options don't include this. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the [Co^2+] calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the total Co concentration is the sum of all species:

x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = x*(1 +0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288) =x*(64.468).

So x=0.01 /64.468 =1.550e-4 M.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 3.6 x =3.6 *1.55e-4=5.58e-5 M.

The percentage is (5.58e-5 /0.01)*100 =0.558%.

No, that can't be right. Wait, the denominator is 0.01, which is the total Co concentration. So the fraction is 5.58e-5 /0.01 =0.00558, which is 0.558%, not 5.58%.

Wait, wait, wait! That's a mistake. So I think I messed up a decimal point earlier.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 3.6 x, x is 1.55e-4.

3.6 *1.55e-4 = 5.58e-5 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is (5.58e-5) /0.01 = 0.00558 → 0.558%.

But that's even worse than before. That's way too low.

Wait, no, wait. No, the total Co is 0.01 M, which is 10mM. So [Co(SCN)_2] is 5.58e-5 M.

So in terms of moles, the fraction is (5.58e-5 / 0.01) *100 = (5.58e-3) ) *100 = 0.558%.

That's 0.558%, which is way off from the options.

But the options are all over 10%, so I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, perhaps the given β's are for the overall complex constants, not the stepwise. Let me try that approach again.

Assume that β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

So β1=9 → K1=9.

β2=40 → K2=40.

β3=63 → K3=63.

β4=16 → K4=16.

Then, the denominator D is:

D=1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

[SCN]=0.1.

So:

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9 → sum 1.9.

Term2:40 *0.01=0.4 → sum 2.3.

Term3:63 *0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363.

Term4:16 *0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

The fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is K2 [SCN]^2 / D =40 *0.01 /2.3646 =0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier approach using stepwise β's gives a different result. Which is correct?

I think the confusion comes from how the β's are defined. If β's are stepwise, the correct calculation is the first approach, but if they are overall, it's the second. The problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. Stability constants are usually given as stepwise, but perhaps in this problem, they're given as overall.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the term "stability constant" as the overall formation constant for each complex. So β1 is the overall K for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

In that case, the fraction would be as above, leading to 16.9%, which is option D.

But why is the answer not matching the initial approach? Because the options don't include 5.58%.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering the stepwise β's. Let me re-examine the stability constants.

Stability constants are typically given as stepwise constants. For example, the first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ with β1=9.

The second step is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 with β2=40.

The third step is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^− with β3=63.

Fourth step is [Co(SCN)_3]^− + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^2− with β4=16.

In this case, the overall formation constants for each complex are:

K1=β1=9.

K2=β1 β2=9*40=360.

K3=β1 β2 β3=9*40*63=22680.

K4=β1 β2 β3 β4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Thus, the denominator D is:

1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

Which is 1 +9*(0.1) +360*(0.1)^2 +22680*(0.1)^3 +362880*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 →1.

9*0.1=0.9 → sum=1.9.

360*(0.01)=3.6 → sum=5.5.

22680*(0.001)=22.68 → sum=28.18.

362880*(0.0001)=36.288 → sum=64.468.

So D=64.468.

The fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is K2 [SCN]^2 / D = 360 *0.01 /64.468 =3.6/64.468 ≈0.0558 →5.58%.

But since the options are not matching, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the β's as the overall K's for each complex.

In that case, the fraction is 16.9%, option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for all dithiocyanato complexes, which includes any complex with two SCN- ligands. But that doesn't make sense here because each complex has a specific number of ligands.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that ligand concentration affects the formation, but I think I did that correctly.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses log β values, but the given β's are already in linear scale.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the reverse of the formation constants, but that would change the approach entirely.

Wait, perhaps the denominator I calculated is wrong. Let me recompute:

Denominator D =1 + (β1 [SCN]) + (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) + (β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4).

So:

β1 [SCN]=9 *0.1=0.9.

β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9*40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6.

β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *0.001=22680 *0.001=22.68.

β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So adding all: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^0's fraction is 3.6 /64.468 =0.0558 →5.58%.

But none of the options match that.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which would include [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and any others, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato refers to any complex with two SCN's, but in this case, it's only [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the dithiocyanato complex but the tetrathiocyanato complex. But that doesn't align with the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about which β corresponds to which complex is wrong. Maybe β4=16 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but that would change everything.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is mixed. Let me assume that the β's are given in a different order. Suppose the β's are for n=1 to n=4, but perhaps the complexes are ordered differently.

Wait, for example, if beta4 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then the calculation would be different. But that seems unlikely; the numbering usually goes in order.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the β's. But that would change the approach entirely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the fractions are calculated using the logarithm of the terms, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the formation of the complex in a different way, such as using the metal's charge.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the stability constants are given for the overall complexes. For example, [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} has a stability constant βn.

Thus, the fraction for each complex is βn [SCN]^n / denominator, where denominator is sum of all βk [SCN]^k for k=1 to4.

Wait, but that approach would give:

f2 = β2 [SCN]^2 / (β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but the denominator would exclude the free Co^2+.

But that approach is wrong because the free Co^2+ should be included in the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator includes all the terms, including 1 for the free ion.

So, f_n = βn [SCN]^n / D, where D is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Using this, for n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0:

f2 =40*(0.1)^2 / (1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4 )

Compute denominator:

1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

Numerator=40 *0.01=0.4.

So f2=0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%, option D.

But earlier, using the stepwise method, it's 5.58%. So which is correct?

The problem states that the β's are the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. Stability constants are typically given as stepwise, not overall. So the correct approach would be the first one, leading to 5.58%, but that's not an option.

But given that option D is 16.9%, and that's what comes from treating the β's as overall, perhaps the intended approach is the latter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition where each β is the constant for the nth complex relative to the first complex.

Wait, perhaps the overall approach is correct as per the stepwise β's, but the answer is not among the options, which suggests I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the fractions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of the concentrations of the blue complexes, which might be more than one. For example, if [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and [Co(SCN)_4]^2− are both blue, then their fractions would add.

But that's speculative. The question doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- which has a fraction of 35.2%, which is close to option C (38.1%).

But 35.2 is the fraction for n=3.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

That would be (3.6 +22.68)/64.468 =26.28/64.468≈0.4078 →40.78%, which is close to option A (42.3%).

But that's speculative, and the question doesn't state that.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in a different way, such as considering that the β's are given in logarithmic form, but the problem states they're β's, not log β's.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the β's. Let me see.

If β is 1/9, then the terms would be different.

But that seems unlikely as the β's are given as 9,40, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses the negative log of the β's, but that's not applicable here.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the intended approach is to treat the β's as overall constants, leading to option D (16.9%).

But I'm not fully confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but the question is about a different complex.

Wait, perhaps the dithiocyanato refers to a different complex, like [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

In that case, the fraction is 22.68/64.468≈0.352→35.2%, which is option C (38.1%) when rounded up.

But 35.2 is not 38.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done with more precise terms.

Let me compute the denominator again with more precise numbers.

Compute each term:

Term0:1.

Term1=9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2=9*40 *0.01=3.6.

Term3=9*40*63 *0.001=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So D=1+0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So fractions:

f0=1/64.468≈0.0155 →1.55%.

f1=0.9/64.468≈0.01394 →1.394%.

f2=3.6/64.468≈0.0558 →5.58%.

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.352 →35.2%.

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5628 →56.28%.

Total ≈100%.

So the fractions are:

f2≈5.58%,

f3≈35.2%.

So the only option close to 35% is option C (38.1%), but it's not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me compute f3 more precisely.

22.68 /64.468 = ?

22.68 ÷64.468.

64.468 ×0.35 =22.5638.

Which is close to 22.68.

So 0.35 gives 22.5638, which is a bit less than 22.68.

The difference is 22.68 -22.5638=0.1162.

So 0.35 + (0.1162 /64.468) ≈0.35 +0.0018=0.3518→35.18%.

Which is approximately 35.2%.

So the closest option is C (38.1%) but it's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and [Co(SCN)_3]^−, which would be 3.6 +22.68 =26.28 →26.28/64.468≈40.78%, which is close to option A (42.3%).

But the question doesn't state that.

I'm really stuck here. Based on the calculations, the correct answer according to the stepwise β's is 5.58%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, if the β's are treated as overall, the answer is 16.9% (option D).

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the stability constants in a different way, such as taking the logarithm or using a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using an approximation where higher-order terms are neglected.

But given the options, option D is the only one that fits the alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is not listed.

But given the options, I think the intended approach is to treat β's as overall constants, leading to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species, the stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the given concentrations ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, total Co concentration = 10⁻² M) are used. The stability constants are interpreted as stepwise formation constants, meaning each β represents the equilibrium constant for adding one SCN⁻ ligand to the previous complex.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**:
   The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
   \]
   where \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Denominator Calculation**:
   Each term in the denominator is computed as:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   \text{Term}_0 &= 1, \\
   \text{Term}_1 &= \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
   \text{Term}_2 &= \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 3.6, \\
   \text{Term}_3 &= \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 22.68, \\
   \text{Term}_4 &= \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 36.288.
   \end{align*}
   \]
   Adding these terms gives the denominator:
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468.
   \]

3. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:
   The numerator for [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is:
   \[
   \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 3.6.
   \]
   Thus, the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.0558 \, \text{or} \, 5.58\%.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (42.3%)**: This corresponds to the fraction of [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, not [Co(SCN)₂]⁰.
- **Option B (25.6%)**: This does not match any calculated fraction.
- **Option C (38.1%)**: This is close to the fraction of [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (35.2%) but not exact.
- **Option D (16.9%)**: This corresponds to the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ if the β values are interpreted as overall constants rather than stepwise constants.

### Conclusion:
The calculations based on stepwise β values yield 5.58% for [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, which is not listed as an option. However, if the β values are treated as overall constants, the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ becomes 16.9%, aligning with Option D. Given the problem's phrasing and the provided options, the intended interpretation likely treats the β values as overall constants.
