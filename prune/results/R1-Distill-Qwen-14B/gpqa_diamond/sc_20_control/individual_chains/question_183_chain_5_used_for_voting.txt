Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency in a product formed from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) to do dehydrohalogenation or maybe some elimination, but wait, no, in this case, I think it's more about the oxymercuration or maybe the hydrolysis of a double bond. Wait, no, I think when you have a dienophile or something, but perhaps I should think about the reaction in more detail.

Wait, wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is usually used for the hydrolysis of nitriles. Oh wait, no, wait, that's with HCN and then hydrolysis. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used for the dehydrohalogenation, like in elimination reactions. But wait, in the presence of excess HI, maybe it's a different scenario. Oh right, I remember that when phosphorus is used with HI, it's called the Hoffman elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the addition across double bonds.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw its structure. So the cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 2, 3, and 5? Wait, cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Or wait, the numbering... Let me think. The name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond starting at position 3, I think. Oh wait, the ene is at position 3 and 4, perhaps.

Wait, the structure: cyclohexene ring with substituents. The carboxylic acid group is at position 3? No, wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, and the carboxylic acid is attached to the same carbon as the double bond starts. So at position 3, we have a double bond (so 3 and 4 are double bonded), and also a carboxylic acid group. But wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Or maybe position 1? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the numbering.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 2, 3, and 5. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3, the formyl group is at position 2, and the vinyl group is at position 5. So the structure would be a cyclohexene where positions 2 has a formyl (CHO), position 5 has a vinyl (CH₂=CH-), and position 3 is part of the double bond (so the ring is double-bonded between 3 and 4). Wait, maybe the double bond is between 3 and 4, and the carboxylic acid is at position 3.

But perhaps I should think about the reaction. The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that when red phosphorus reacts with HI, it forms H3P and I2. Wait, no, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the hydrolysis of a nitrile, but our starting material doesn't have a nitrile, so that can't be.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a cleavage of a double bond. Red phosphorus and HI are used to effect the hydrolysis of alkenes. Oh right! I remember now. The reaction called the hydroboration, but no, wait, that's with BH3. Alternatively, in the presence of H2O and HgSO4, it's acid-catalyzed hydration. Oh wait, wait, no, the specific reaction I'm thinking of is the addition of HX across a double bond. But when you have a cyclic diene and you treat it with HI, perhaps it's adding across the double bond.

Wait, wait, but the starting molecule has two double bonds. Let me look again: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene has a double bond (3-en), and the vinyl group is a CH₂=CH- attached at position 5. So the molecule has two double bonds: one in the ring (position 3-4) and another in the vinyl group (position 5, the CH₂=CH-).

So when this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? Oh! I think that reaction is the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but no, that's for ketones. Hmm, another approach: maybe the ring's double bond is undergoing some addition. Wait, perhaps the red phosphorus is acting as a catalyst for some kind of ring-opening or addition.

Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing concepts. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is often used for the cleavage of nitriles to produce amines and carboxylic acids, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, when alkenes are treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a halogenation reaction. Wait, no, adding HI to an alkene would typically be an addition reaction, like electrophilic addition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI across the double bonds in the molecule. So each double bond would add HI. Let's think: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond (3-en), and the vinyl group has another double bond.

So when HI adds to each double bond, each would get an H and I addition. But wait, what's the product of adding HI to a cyclohexene ring? Let me think. Adding H and I across the double bond would result in a di-substituted cyclohexane. But since the ring is already substituted with the formyl and vinyl groups, how would that affect the addition?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't just adding HI to both double bonds. Maybe one of the double bonds is more reactive than the other. The cyclohexene ring's double bond is part of a conjugated system with the carboxylic acid group. Wait, the carboxylic acid is at position 3, the formyl at 2, and the vinyl at 5. So maybe the ring's double bond is conjugated with the substituents, making it more or less reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-elimination, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: the index of hydrogen deficiency is determined by the number of rings plus the number of double bonds (each ring or double bond contributes one to the index). So the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring (which is a ring plus a double bond, so that's two), plus the vinyl group's double bond (one more), and any other rings or double bonds.

Wait, the starting molecule: cyclohexene has a ring (6-membered) and a double bond inside, so that's one ring and one double bond. Then the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH₂=CH-, so that's another double bond. So in total, the starting molecule has 2 rings (wait, no, the cyclohexene is a single ring) and two double bonds (the ring's double bond and the vinyl group's). So the index of hydrogen deficiency for the starting material is 3: 1 (from the ring) + 2 double bonds.

Wait, no, wait. The index of hydrogen deficiency (DoH) is calculated as DoH = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, assuming no halogens or nitrogen. So let's compute that for the starting material.

But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, let's count the parts. The cyclohexene ring has one ring and one double bond. The vinyl group has another double bond. So that's two double bonds and one ring, making a total of three. So DoH is 3.

Now, after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm. What's the product? Let me think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI in excess. Oh! I think that when an alkyne is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a hydration reaction. But wait, our starting material doesn't have any triple bonds.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is an example of the oxymercuration or hydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation, but that typically uses other reagents like OsO4.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI—what happens when they react with alkenes or alkynes. Oh! I remember that for alkenes, HI can add across the double bond in an addition reaction. So in our case, the starting molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene's and the vinyl group's. So adding HI to each would result in each double bond becoming a single bond with adjacent H and I atoms.

Wait, but if the reaction is adding HI across each double bond, then each double bond would become a single bond with H and I. So the product would have two single bonds where double bonds were, and perhaps some hydroxyl groups or other substituents. But wait, I think the addition of HI would lead to vicinal diiodides. So each double bond would add HI, resulting in two vicinal diiodide groups.

But wait, the starting molecule also has a carboxylic acid group. How would that affect the reaction? Carboxylic acids are generally not very reactive towards addition reactions unless under specific conditions. So perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the carboxylic acid group.

So after adding HI to both double bonds, the product would have the cyclohexane ring (no double bond, so no ring contribution now? Wait, no. The ring was part of a cyclohexene, so when the double bond is broken, the ring becomes a cyclohexane, but it's still a ring, so that contributes one to the DoH. Then, the other double bond (vinyl) would also add HI, breaking that as well. So the product would have a cyclohexane ring (so one ring) and the two double bonds would now be single bonds, so no more double bonds. Wait, but that would reduce the DoH.

Wait, wait, the starting material has a ring (6-membered, so that's one) and two double bonds (cyclohexene's and vinyl's), so DoH = 3. After reaction with HI, each double bond is converted to a single bond with H and I added. So the ring remains, but the two double bonds are saturated. So the product would have one ring and no double bonds. So DoH would be 1.

Wait, but let me re-calculate. The ring is a cyclohexane (no double bond), so it contributes 1. The other substituents: the formyl and vinyl groups. The vinyl group was CH₂=CH-, which after adding HI becomes CH₂-I-CH₂-I? No, wait, addition of HI to a double bond would be adding H and I across the double bond. So the CH₂=CH- becomes CH₂-I-CH2-H? No, wait, when HI adds to a double bond, it's an addition of H+ and I- across the double bond. So for a vinyl group, CH₂=CH-R, adding HI would give CH₂-I-CH₂-R, but given the geometry, it could be anti or not.

Wait, but maybe the reaction doesn't stop at adding HI to both double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage. Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can also lead to the cleavage of triple bonds, but again, our starting molecule doesn't have any.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the formyl group. The formyl group is a CHO group. Can HI react with a formyl group? I'm not sure. Maybe in the presence of red phosphorus, but I don't recall.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. Let's imagine the starting molecule: it's a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid at position 3, a formyl group at position 2, and a vinyl group at position 5. The ring has a double bond between 3 and 4.

When HI is added, under the influence of red phosphorus, it might add across the double bonds. So the cyclohexene's double bond would add HI, leading to a diiodide. The vinyl group's double bond would add HI as well. So the product would have a cyclohexane ring with two iodine atoms from the cyclohexene's addition, and the vinyl group would become a diiodide as well.

But wait, after addition, the cyclohexane ring would have two iodines added across the former double bond. So the ring is now a single bond, and the substituents (formyl, vinyl, etc.) are attached.

But wait, the product would have the cyclohexane ring (1 ring) and any other double bonds left? No, because both double bonds (ring and vinyl) have been saturated. So the product would have one ring and no double bonds. So DoH would be 1.

Wait, but wait. The starting molecule had two double bonds and a ring: DoH = 3. After reaction, the ring is still there (so 1), and the two double bonds are gone. So DoH is 1.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me count again. The product after reaction has a cyclohexane ring (so 1 ring) and no double bonds. So the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1. So the answer would be A) 1.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't just add HI to the double bonds but maybe opens the ring or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to a cleavage of the ring. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction affects the formyl group. The formyl group is CHO. If HI reacts with that, it might undergo some kind of reaction, like adding H to the carbonyl, but I'm not sure. For example, the formyl group could be converted into a CH₂OH group or something like that.

Wait, but the formyl group is at position 2. How would HI affect that? Maybe it would add H and I, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the formyl group could be reduced, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI typically do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but I don't think so because that usually uses other reagents.

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is a peroxide effect, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product's structure. The product would have the cyclohexane ring with substituents:

- At position 2: formyl group (CHO) -> perhaps reacts but I'm not certain.
- At position 5: former vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) -> becomes CH₂-I-CH2- after adding HI.
- The ring's double bond (3-4) becomes a single bond with two iodines added.

So the product would have the cyclohexane ring (still a ring, so DoH +=1), and the formyl group remains (no change), the vinyl becomes a diiodide (no double bond, so DoH doesn't change there). So the total DoH would be 1.

Wait, but what about the formyl group? If it doesn't react, then no change in DoH. So the product would have one ring and no double bonds, so DoH=1.

So the answer should be A) 1.

The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoH) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is a cyclohexene ring with:
   - A carboxylic acid group at position 3.
   - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2.
   - A vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at position 5.
   - A double bond in the cyclohexene ring (between carbons 3 and 4).  
   Thus, the starting material has:
   - 1 ring (cyclohexene).
   - 2 double bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl group).  
   Therefore, the DoH of the starting material is **3**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**:  
   Red phosphorus and HI typically facilitate the addition of HI across double bonds. In this reaction:
   - The double bond in the cyclohexene ring reacts with HI, converting it into a single bond with adjacent H and I atoms.
   - The double bond in the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) also reacts with HI, converting it into a single bond with adjacent H and I atoms.  
   The reaction does not affect the carboxylic acid group or the formyl group.

3. **Structure of the Product**:  
   After the reaction:
   - The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring (still a ring, contributing 1 to the DoH).
   - Both double bonds (in the ring and the vinyl group) are saturated, contributing nothing to the DoH.  
   The product has:
   - 1 ring (cyclohexane).
   - No double bonds.  
   Therefore, the DoH of the product is **1**.

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.
