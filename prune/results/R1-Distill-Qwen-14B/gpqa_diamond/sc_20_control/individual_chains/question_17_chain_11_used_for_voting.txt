Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says we have a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think stochiometric here means that the ratio of calcium to EDTA is 1:1, so each Ca is bound with one EDTA. The pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about protons interfering with the complex formation. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so maybe that's just to remind me about standard conditions.

The K value given is 5x10^10. I'm pretty sure that K here is the formation constant, which tells me about the stability of the complex. A high K means the complex is very stable because it favors the formation of the complex from its ions.

So, the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in this solution. Right, because in a complex, not all calcium is free; some is tied up in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the free Ca²+ concentration will be less than the initial concentration of the complex.

Wait, wait. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So let's model this. The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be written as:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The formation constant K_f is given by:

K_f = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+] [EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in this case, the solution has the complex already formed. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. I need to find [Ca²+].

But wait, don't I need the concentration of EDTA as well? Oh, right, because EDTA is in solution as well. But wait, if the complex is formed stoichiometrically, each mole of Ca uses a mole of EDTA. So the initial EDTA concentration would be equal to the initial Ca²+ concentration, but that might change when the complex forms.

Wait, let me think again. If the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, that implies that all the Ca²+ and EDTA have formed the complex. But wait, no, because when you add them together, some might not form the complex, but I think in this problem, it's given that the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

So the dissociation would be:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The K for this reverse reaction would be 1/K_f, since K_f is for the formation. So K_inverse = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, the expression is K_inverse = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]

But wait, in this solution, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, does that mean that the only species are the complex and the dissociated ions?

Assuming that the EDTA and Ca²+ concentrations are both very low due to the high K_f, so the complex is mostly intact. So, we can model it as:

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x, but wait, x is the amount that dissociates. However, since K_inverse is so small, x will be really small compared to 0.02, so [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02.

Thus, K_inverse ≈ x^2 / 0.02.

So, solving for x:

x^2 = K_inverse * 0.02

x^2 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13

Taking square root:

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute that again.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is the same as 3.16e-7. So x is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

So, the concentration of free Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, so that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The formation constant is 5e10, so the dissociation constant is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Then, using K_inverse = (Ca)(EDTA)/ (CaEDTA) ≈ (x)(x)/0.02 → x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait: sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) which is 2 * (3.16e-7) → 6.32e-7. So yes, approximately 6.3e-7, which matches option C.

To determine the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_{\text{inverse}} \) is the reciprocal of the formation constant \( K_f \), given as:

\[
K_{\text{inverse}} = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of free calcium ions (\([Ca^{2+}]\)) and free EDTA (\([EDTA^{4-}]\)) are equal due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation. Let the concentration of dissociated ions be \( x \). Then:

\[
K_{\text{inverse}} = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}.
\]

Assuming that the concentration of the dissociated complex is negligible compared to the total complex concentration (\( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
K_{\text{inverse}} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_{\text{inverse}} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
x = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
