Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, let's see. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. I think I need to draw it out or at least visualize it to understand how many bonds I'm dealing with.

Wait, the question provides some bond energies. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. I remember that the formula is something like the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, wait. Formation enthalpy is the energy change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, the approach is to calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the elements and then the energy released when the bonds in the compound form.

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies, so maybe the method is to calculate the total bond energies in the molecule and relate that to the formation enthalpy. Or perhaps I should consider the enthalpy of atomization and the bond energies.

Wait, the problem says the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert an element into its atoms in the gas phase. So for carbon, that's 1000 kJ per mole to turn it into C atoms.

So the molecule in question is made up of carbon and hydrogen. So, each carbon in the molecule is bonded to other carbons and hydrogens. But how do I approach calculating the formation enthalpy?

Wait, formation enthalpy (ΔHf°) is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For example, for a hydrocarbon, it's formed from carbon ( graphite ) and hydrogen gas ( H2 ).

So, to calculate ΔHf°, I think the formula is:

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

But wait, the reactants here are the elements in their standard states. So for this molecule, the elements are C (graphite) and H2.

Alternatively, I've heard of using the atomization method. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization approach. The steps are: 

1. Break down the compound into its constituent atoms (atomization), which requires energy.
2. Then, form the bonds in the compound, which releases energy.
But I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Another approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation based on the sum of the bond energies in the molecule. Wait, maybe the formula is:

ΔHf° = (Number of C atoms × Enthalpy of C atomization) + (Number of H atoms × Enthalpy of H atomization) - (Sum of bond energies in the molecule)

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies, not enthalpy of atomization for H. Oh, right, the bond energy for H-H is given as 100 kJ/mol. So the enthalpy of atomization for hydrogen would be half of that because each H atom in H2 is bonded with another. So each H atom has a bond energy of 50 kJ/mol, but wait, no. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break all bonds in the molecule to get atoms. So for H2, bond energy is 100 kJ/mol per mole of H2. So to get H atoms, you need to spend 100 kJ per mole of H2.

Wait, but for each mole of H2, you get 2 moles of H atoms. So per mole of H atom, the enthalpy of atomization would be 50 kJ? Because 100 kJ per mole H2 gives 2 moles H, so each H atom is 50 kJ. Hmm, perhaps not, because the bond energy is given per mole of the bond. So, for H-H, each mole of bond requires 100 kJ to break. So each mole of H2 requires 100 kJ to split into 2 moles of H atoms. So the enthalpy of atomization for H is 50 kJ/mol (per H atom). But wait, the problem might not require that because the bond energies are given.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total bond energies in the compound and subtract from the total bond energies of the elements (in their standard states) to get the formation enthalpy.

Wait, the general formula I've come across before is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Atoms of each element × enthalpy of atomization)] - [Σ (Bonds in the molecule × bond energy)]

But wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Because when you form bonds, energy is released, so it's bonds in the reactants (elements) minus bonds in the products (molecule). Or maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula: 

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]

But wait, the reactants in this case are the elements in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite and hydrogen is H2.

Wait, let's think of the process. Formation of the compound from elements. So, the elements (reactants) are broken down into their atoms (atomization), which requires energy, and then these atoms form the bonds in the compound, releasing energy.

So, the total enthalpy change would be:

ΔHf° = (Bond energies of reactants) - (Bond energies of products)

But wait, the reactants are the elements in standard states, which are in bonds. So, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds in the elements. For example, for C (graphite), each C is in a covalent network, but I think for simplicity, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for C. So each C atom in the molecule comes from breaking that bond in graphite, but perhaps in this problem, we're given the enthalpy of atomization, which is the energy required to convert 1 mole of C into gaseous atoms.

Similarly, for H2, the bond energy is 100 kJ/mol. So, for each H2 molecule, we need to spend 100 kJ to split into H atoms.

So, for the molecule in question, let's count the number of C and H atoms.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons and hydrogens.

First, each (CH3)2 group: each has 2 CH3 groups, so 2*(3 H) = 6 H, but each CH3 has 1 C, so each (CH3)2 group has 2 Cs.

Wait, the formula of the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me think about each part:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH. So that's a group with two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is double-bonded to another CH.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the molecular formula.

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 C and 6 H.

Wait, no. Let's break it down step by step.

The molecule's structure:

It starts with (CH3)2C=CH-..., then a CH2, then a CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of C and H atoms.

Each C in the molecule:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH-: the C here is connected to two CH3 groups, one C (from the double bond), and one CH group.

Wait, maybe I should write the entire formula.

Wait, the molecule is 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene or something else? Hmm, perhaps not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me count the number of C and H in the molecule.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: that's 3 C (since (CH3)2C is 3 C, then the =CH adds another C? Wait, no: (CH3)2C is a single C attached to two CH3, then a double bond to another CH. So that part is (CH3)2C=CH. So that's 3 C (the central C in (CH3)2C, the one it's double-bonded to, and the CH3 groups may count as part of that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each C and H.

Wait, the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me expand this:

Each group:

1. (CH3)2C: that's 3 C (since it's a central C attached to two CH3 groups).

Wait, no, (CH3)2C is a central carbon connected to two CH3 groups, so that's 1 C for the center, plus two CH3, each adding one C. So total of 3 C in (CH3)2C.

Then, the next part is =CH-, so that's another C attached via double bond, so that's 4 C so far.

After that, -CH2-: that's another C, so 5.

Then, -CH(CH3)-: another C, making 6.

Then, -CH2-: another C, 7.

Then, -CH=C(CH3)2: two more C (the double-bonded C and the one attached to the (CH3)2 groups). So 1 more (CH3)2C brings it to 9.

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Let me count each part:

Start with (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down as:

- (CH3)2C: 3 C (the central C and two from CH3 groups? Wait no, each CH3 has one C. So (CH3)2C has 1 (central) + 2*(1) = 3? No, because each CH3 is a group attached to the central C. So the central C is one, each CH3 is a group with one C. So (CH3)2C is 3 C.

Wait, maybe it's easier to count each carbon in the entire molecule.

Let me number each carbon:

1. The first (CH3)2C: the central C is C1, each CH3's C is C2 and C3.

2. Then, the double bond is to C4 (from =CH-).

3. Then, the next is CH2: C5.

4. Then, CH(CH3): C6.

5. Next, CH2: C7.

6. Then, CH=C(CH3)2: C8 is the CH, and C9 is the central C in C(CH3)2.

Wait, so that's 9 carbons in total.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try drawing the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a molecule with two double bonds. Let me think: each (CH3)2C group is a substituent on either side of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's 1,3-pentadiene derivative. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 2,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-hexatriene or something else. Maybe not necessary for counting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H atoms.

Each (CH3)2C: each CH3 has 3 H. So (CH3)2C has 2*(3) + 3 (from the central C's H?) Wait, no. Wait, (CH3)2C is a group where the central C is attached to two CH3 groups and maybe another group.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at the entire formula.

The molecular formula is C9H14.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me count:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C group contributes 3 C (if I'm right before) and 6 H.

But perhaps let me count all H.

Each (CH3)2C group has two CH3 groups, each with 3 H: 2*3=6 H.

The =CH- group: the CH has 1 H.

Then, the next CH2 has 2 H.

Then, CH(CH3) has 3 H.

Next CH2 has 2 H.

Then, CH=C has 1 H.

Then, (CH3)2 group: two CH3 groups, 2*3=6 H.

Wait, but maybe I should look at each part:

Let me write the entire structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each part:

(CH3)2C=CH: this is (CH3)2-C=CH-

So, for this group:

In (CH3)2C, each CH3 has 3 H. So 2 * 3 H =6 H.

The C in (CH3)2C is bonded to another CH (the double bond), so perhaps that C has three substituents: two CH3 and one CH. So it's (CH3)2C-CH2? Maybe not. Wait, the group is (CH3)2C=CH-.

So, the C=C is between C1 and C2. C1 is (CH3)2-C, and C2 is CH.

So, C1: has two CH3 groups, one C=C, and one single bond to the next group.

Wait, perhaps I should just count each H in the entire molecule.

Let me think:

- Each (CH3)2C=CH-: Each CH3 has 3 H, so 2*3=6 H. The C=CH has one H (because CH). So that's 6 +1=7 H from the first part.

But wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So after the first (CH3)2C=CH, there's a CH2 group.

So for the CH2: 2 H.

Then, CH(CH3): that's 3 H (since it's CH(CH3) group, which has one H attached to C, and the CH3 has 3 H).

Next, another CH2: 2 H.

Then, CH=C: the CH has one H, and the C=C is connected to (CH3)2 group.

The (CH3)2 group has two CH3, each contributing 3 H: 2 *3=6 H.

So adding them all up:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 6 (from two CH3) +1 (CH) =7 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 3 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH=C: 1 H.

CH2: 2 H.

Wait, no, wait the structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 after the CH=C is part of the CH=C group? Hmm, perhaps I should recount.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write each part and count the H:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : two CH3 (2*3=6 H) and CH (1 H → total 7 H so far).

2. CH2- : 2 H → total 9.

3. CH(CH3)- : CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 → total 4 → cumulative 13.

4. CH2- : 2 → 15.

5. CH=C(CH3)2 : CH has 1 H; C=C is connected to two CH3 groups, each with 3 H → 2*3=6 H → 1+6=7 H → cumulative 15 +7 =22 H.

Wait, but wait, the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me consider each group:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 2 CH3 → 6 H; CH → 1 H. Total 7.

- CH2: 2 H → total 9.

- CH(CH3): CH has 1 H; CH3 has 3 H → 4 → total 13.

- CH2: 2 → 15.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H; the C=C is connected to two CH3 groups, each 3 H → 2*3=6 → total 1 +6=7 H → total 15 +7=22.

Wait, but let me recount:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-: 6+1=7.

CH2-: 2 → 9.

CH(CH3)-: 1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) =4 → 13.

CH2-: 2 →15.

CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (from CH) + (each CH3 has 3 → 2*3=6) → 7 → 15+7=22.

Wait, but that gives 22 H in total. So the molecular formula would be C9H22? Wait, the molecular formula is C9H14.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, each (CH3)2C group is 3 C and 6 H. Then, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons:

1. (CH3)2C: 3 C (C1, C2, C3)

2. =CH- : C4.

3. CH2-: C5.

4. CH(CH3)-: C6.

5. CH2-: C7.

6. CH=C: C8 and C9.

Wait, that's 9 C in total.

Hydrogen count:

Each CH3 has 3 H: there are 8 CH3 groups in the entire molecule (each (CH3)2 group contributes two, and there are two of them at the ends). So 8 *3=24 H.

Wait, but the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2 group has two CH3: 2 *3=6 H per (CH3)2 group. There are two such groups (at the ends), so 2 *6=12 H.

Then, the other parts: each CH has 1 H, and each CH2 has 2 H.

Let me count:

- The (CH3)2C=CH-: 2 CH3 → 6 H; the CH has 1 → 7 H.

- The CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C: 

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 H (from CH) +3 H (from CH3) →4.

CH2: 2.

CH=C: 1 H (from CH).

Wait, but the (CH3)2 at the end contributes two CH3 → 6 H.

So let's add up:

- Initial (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 +1 =7.

- CH2: 2 → total 9.

- CH(CH3):1 (CH) +3 (CH3) →4 → total 13.

- CH2: 2 →15.

- CH=C: 1 →16.

- (CH3)2 at the end: 2*3=6 →22.

So total H is 22. But the molecular formula would be C9H22. But the question says (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So perhaps I did that correctly.

But wait, the user's question is to calculate the enthalpy of formation. The options are A) 11200 kJ/mol, B) 67.4 kJ/mol, C) 11.44 kJ/g, D) 1900 kJ/g.

But wait, the options have a mix of kJ/mol and kJ/g. So perhaps the answer is in kJ/mol, which would be option A or B, or maybe C and D are per gram.

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies in kJ/mol, so the answer should be in kJ/mol, which would be options A or B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

So, the approach is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of elements in standard state)] - [Σ (Bond energies in the molecule)]

But the elements are in their standard states, which are graphite for C and H2 for H.

So, for each C atom, the bond energy from graphite is 1000 kJ/mol (the enthalpy of atomization). For each H atom, since H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, each H atom comes from H2, so we need to break that bond. So for each H atom, the energy is 50 kJ (because each H2 molecule requires 100 kJ to split into two H atoms, so per H atom, it's 50 kJ).

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. So, how do I get the bond energies for the elements in their standard states?

Wait, for C in graphite, the bond energy is not given. But the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. So, each C atom in graphite must be held together with a bond energy that, when atomized, requires 1000 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total bond energies from the elements (C and H2) and subtract the bond energies in the compound.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf°(compound) = [ (Number of C atoms × enthalpy of C atomization) + (Number of H atoms × (H-H bond energy / 2)) ] - (Sum of bond energies in the compound).

Wait, because each H atom in H2 is obtained by breaking the H-H bond, which costs 100 kJ/mol bond. So per mole of H atom, it's 50 kJ. So, for each H atom, we have 50 kJ.

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies, not enthalpy of atomization for H. So if H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, then each H atom's enthalpy of atomization is 50 kJ per mole of H atom.

So, for the compound, which has C9H22:

Number of C atoms =9 → 9 ×1000 kJ/mol=9000 kJ.

Number of H atoms=22 →22 ×50 kJ/mol=1100 kJ.

So total bond energy from elements: 9000 +1100=10100 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, if the compound has 9 C and 22 H atoms, then the total energy to atomize all the C and H from their standard states is 9*1000 + 22*(100/2) =9000 + 22*50 =9000 +1100=10100 kJ/mol.

Then, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is the sum of all the bonds in the compound.

But wait, the bonds in the compound are C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So, I need to count how many of each bond are present in the molecule.

Let me think about the structure again.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me break it into parts:

Each (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds (from the two CH3 groups), and a C=C bond.

Wait, but each (CH3)2C group is connected to other carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

So, for each C in the molecule, I can count the number of bonds it has.

But perhaps it's easier to count each type of bond.

C-C bonds: Each single bond between two Cs counts as one C-C bond.

C=C bonds: Each double bond counts as one C=C bond (since each double bond is a single bond in terms of counting, but with higher energy).

C-H bonds: Each C-H single bond counts as one.

So, let's count all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

First, I'll count the C-C bonds.

Looking at the structure:

- The molecule has a chain of Cs connected by single bonds, except where there are double bonds.

So, let's identify the number of C-C single bonds.

Each (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds (each CH3 is attached via C-C).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each C-C bond in the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count all the C-C bonds:

Each CH2 group contributes one C-C bond.

Each CH(CH3) contributes one C-C bond.

But perhaps a better approach is to note how many C-C single bonds are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a structure with multiple single bonds and two double bonds.

Wait, the molecule has two double bonds: one in (CH3)2C=CH- and another in CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each double bond is a C=C.

So, number of C=C bonds: 2.

Now, for C-C bonds: Each single bond between two Cs counts as one.

Let me try to count:

Each CH2 group has one C-C bond (between the two Cs in CH2-CH2).

Each CH(CH3) has one C-C bond.

Let me try to list each C and its bonds.

But perhaps a better approach is to think of the molecule as a chain with some substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the degree of unsaturation to find the number of double bonds, but that's not directly helpful for counting bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count all the C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps this is taking too long. Let me think of another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 8 C-C bonds and 2 C=C bonds, and the rest are C-H bonds.

Wait, the molecule has 9 C atoms, so the number of C-C bonds is (9 - number of C=C bonds)×something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps each C-C bond is a single bond, and each C=C is a double bond (so, each contributes to the total bond count).

Wait, let me think: Each C in the molecule is connected to other Cs via single or double bonds.

So, the total number of C-C bonds can be calculated as follows.

Each C in the molecule forms bonds with other Cs and Hs.

For each C, the number of bonds is equal to the number of valence electrons used.

But perhaps it's easier to approach systematically.

In a molecule, the number of C-C single bonds plus twice the number of C=C double bonds plus other bonds equals the total valence.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me approach it this way: for each C, count the number of bonds to other Cs, and sum all, then divide by 2 (since each bond is counted twice).

Alternatively, each C-C bond is counted once.

Let me proceed:

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me list the structure as a series of carbon atoms connected in a chain, with substituents.

So the structure can be written as:

C1 (CH3)2-C2=C3-CH2-C4-CH(CH3)-C5-CH2-C6=CH-C7-C8(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to number the carbons.

So, let me number them as C1 to C9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's try again.

The structure is:

C1 (CH3)2—C2=C3—CH2—C4—CH(CH3)—C5—CH2—C6=CH—C7—C8(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the correct structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 9 carbons arranged with two double bonds.

But perhaps the best approach is to count each type of bond.

So, let's count:

C-C bonds: each single bond between two C atoms.

C=C bonds: each double bond counts as one (since each double bond has two π bonds, but bond energy is considered per bond type).

C-H bonds: all single bonds between C and H.

So, for the molecule:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C group: Each CH3 contributes one C-C bond (since each CH3 is attached to the central C). So for (CH3)2C, there are two C-C bonds (each CH3 is attached via C-C).

Then, the C=C between C2 and C3.

Then, C3 is connected to C4 via a single bond (CH2-CH2).

C4 is connected to C5 via a single bond.

C5 is connected to C6 via a single bond.

C6 is connected to C7 via a double bond (C6=C7).

C7 is connected to C8 via a single bond.

C8 is connected to two CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to count the C-C bonds.

Each (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds (since each CH3 is attached via a C-C bond). There are two such groups in the molecule: one at the beginning and one at the end.

So that's 2 groups ×2 C-C bonds =4.

Then, the C=C bonds: two in the molecule.

Now, the rest of the C-C bonds are in the chain.

Looking at the chain: between C3 and C4 (CH2-CH2): one C-C bond.

Between C4 and C5 (CH2-CH(CH3)): one C-C bond.

Between C5 and C6 (CH2-CH): one C-C bond.

Between C6 and C7 (CH=C): another C-C bond.

Between C7 and C8 (CH-C(CH3)2): one C-C bond.

So that's 5 C-C bonds in the chain.

Adding that: 4 (from the groups) +5 (chain) =9 C-C bonds.

Plus, each C=C bond is a double bond, which is two C-C bonds? No, wait, each double bond is a single bond but with higher energy. So the C=C counts as one bond for the purpose of counting, but has higher energy.

Wait, no. Each bond in the molecule is either single, double, etc. So, each C=C bond is a single instance but with higher bond energy.

Wait, no. The number of bonds in the molecule is as follows:

Each C-C single bond is one bond, each C=C is one bond (but with higher bond energy), and each C-H is one bond.

So, for the molecule:

Number of C-C single bonds:

Each (CH3)2C group: two bonds each → 2 groups ×2 =4.

In the chain:

Between C3 and C4: 1.

C4 to C5:1.

C5 to C6:1.

C6 to C7:1.

C7 to C8:1.

So 5 single C-C bonds in the chain.

Plus, the two C=C bonds.

So total C-C bonds (single) =4 +5=9.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

So total C-C bonds (single) is 9, and C=C is 2.

Now, total C-C bonds for bond energy calculation: each C-C is 200 kJ/mol. So 9 ×200=1800 kJ.

Each C=C is 300 kJ/mol. So 2 ×300=600 kJ.

Now, C-H bonds: each C connected to H has a C-H bond.

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds → for each (CH3)2 group, 2×3=6 C-H bonds. There are two such groups, so 2×6=12.

In the chain:

Each CH group has one C-H.

Each CH2 has two C-H.

Let me go through the molecule:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 

Each CH3 has 3 C-H → 2×3=6.

The CH has 1 C-H → total 7.

2. CH2-: 2 C-H.

3. CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 C-H, and the CH3 has 3 →4.

4. CH2-: 2.

5. CH=C: the CH has 1 C-H.

6. (CH3)2: each CH3 has 3 →2×3=6.

Wait, but that's the (CH3)2 group. So:

Each group contributes:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 (CH3) +1 (CH) =7.

- CH2-:2.

- CH(CH3)-:1 (CH) +3 (CH3) =4.

- CH2-:2.

- CH=C:1 (CH).

- (CH3)2:6.

Wait, but that counts the (CH3)2 group at the end, which has 6 C-H bonds.

Adding them up:

7 (first part) + 2 +4 +2 +1 +6 =22 C-H bonds.

So, 22 C-H bonds ×400 kJ/mol each.

Wait, no: each C-H bond is 400 kJ/mol. So 22 ×400=8800 kJ.

Wait, but wait, no. Each C-H bond contributes 400 kJ/mol to the bond energy. So total C-H bond energy is 22 ×400=8800 kJ.

Now, summing all the bonds:

C-C single:9 ×200=1800.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:22 ×400=8800.

Total bond energy in the molecule:1800 +600 +8800=11200 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's interesting. So the total bond energy in the molecule is 11200 kJ/mol.

Now, the total bond energy from the elements is:

Each C atom: 1000 kJ/mol →9 C →9×1000=9000.

Each H atom: H2's bond energy is 100 kJ/mol, so per H atom, 50 kJ/mol. 22 H →22×50=1100.

Total from elements:9000 +1100=10100 kJ/mol.

Now, the enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = [Bond energy of elements] - [Bond energy of compound]

Which is 10100 -11200 =-1100 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that gives a negative value, which would imply the reaction is exothermic. But the options don't have a negative value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula reversed. Maybe it's [Bond energy of compound] - [Bond energy of elements].

Because the formation enthalpy is the energy released when bonds form. So, if I form the compound from atoms, the energy released would be the sum of bond energies in the compound minus the energy required to break the bonds in the elements.

So, ΔHf°= (Sum of bond energies in compound) - (Sum of bond energies in elements).

In this case, 11200 -10100=1100 kJ/mol.

But that's positive, indicating endothermic formation, which seems unlikely for a hydrocarbon. But perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, let me double-check the bond counts.

C-C bonds:9 at 200 each →9×200=1800.

C=C bonds:2 at 300 each →600.

C-H bonds:22 at 400 →8800.

Total:1800+600+8800=11200.

Elements:

9 C at 1000 →9000.

22 H at 50 →1100.

Total:10100.

So ΔHf°=11200-10100=1100 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1100. Wait, looking back:

Options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g.

So 1100 isn't an option. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in counting the bonds?

Wait, perhaps I counted the C-C bonds incorrectly. Let me recount the C-C bonds.

Wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me think of it as a chain with substituents.

Each (CH3)2C group is at both ends.

In the chain:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain has 7 carbons between the two (CH3)2C groups? Or perhaps 8? Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

(CH3)2C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-CH2-C(CH3)2.

Wait, no. The actual structure has two double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count C-C single bonds.

Wait, perhaps each (CH3)2C group contributes two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to the central C). So two groups ×2=4.

Then, in the chain, each single bond between Cs counts as one.

The chain structure is:

C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

So, between C and CH: that's a C-C single bond.

CH to CH2: C-C.

CH2 to CH(CH3): C-C.

CH(CH3) to CH2: C-C.

CH2 to CH: C-C.

CH to C: C-C.

Wait, that's 5 C-C single bonds in the chain.

So total C-C single bonds:4 (from groups) +5 (chain)=9.

C=C bonds:2.

So yes, 9 C-C single bonds and 2 C=C.

So that part is correct.

Now, C-H bonds:22 as before.

So the calculation of 11200 for the compound's bond energy is correct.

Elements:10100.

So 11200-10100=1100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have that. Let's look again at the options.

Option A is 11200, which is the bond energy of the compound. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf°= sum of bond energies of products - sum of bond energies of reactants.

In this case, the reactant is the elements (C and H2), and product is the compound.

So, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds in the elements.

So, for each C atom, 1000 kJ/mol.

Each H atom in H2:100 kJ/mol per H2.

So, for the reaction:

9 C (graphite) + (22/2) H2 → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The bond energies on the reactant side:

9×1000 (C's) + (11 ×100) (H2) →9000 +1100=10100.

On the product side: sum of bond energies in the molecule is 11200.

So, the enthalpy change is products (bond energies) minus reactants (bond energies):

ΔHf°=11200 -10100=1100 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the bonds.

Wait, perhaps the C-C bonds are not all single. Let me recount the C-C single bonds.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C-C single bonds:

1. (CH3)2C: two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to central C).

2. C=C: one bond.

3. CH2-CH2: one.

4. CH2-CH(CH3): one.

5. CH(CH3)-CH2: one.

6. CH2-CH: one.

7. CH=C: one.

Wait, but CH=C is a double bond, so that's a C=C.

Wait, so in the chain, how many C-C single bonds are there?

- Between (CH3)2C and the next C: that's the C=C, so no single bond.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain after the first (CH3)2C is:

C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

So, the chain has:

C=CH is a double bond (C=C).

Then, CH-CH2: single bond.

CH2-CH(CH3): single.

CH(CH3)-CH2: single.

CH2-CH: single.

CH-C: single (in the other double bond).

Wait, so the chain has 5 single C-C bonds.

Plus the two C-C from the (CH3)2 groups.

So 2*(2) +5=9.

So that part is correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of bond energies in the elements minus the sum in the compound.

In that case, it would be 10100 -11200 =-1100, which would be exothermic. But that's negative, and the options don't have that.

But the options include A)11200, which is the sum of the compound's bonds. So perhaps the question is asking for the bond energy content of the molecule, not the formation enthalpy.

Wait, but the question states: "Calculate the enthalpy of formation".

So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = sum of bond energies in the reactants (elements) - sum of bond energies in the products (molecule).

But that would be 10100 -11200 =-1100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps I've miscounted the C-H bonds.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group has 6 C-H.

The =CH has 1.

CH2 has 2.

CH(CH3) has 4 (1 from CH and 3 from CH3).

Another CH2 has 2.

CH=C has 1.

The other (CH3)2 has 6.

So total:

6 (from first group) +1 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 =22.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was to calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, but the question says 'enthalpy of formation'.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

ΔHf° = (sum of bonds in reactants) - (sum of bonds in products).

Which would be 10100 -11200 =-1100.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the bond energies, but perhaps the bond energies given are in kJ per bond, not per mole.

Wait, no, the problem states bond energies are in kJ/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Let me recount the C-C bonds:

Each (CH3)2 group contributes two C-C bonds.

In the chain:

C=CH is a double bond, so no C-C single bond there.

Then:

CH-CH2: single bond →1.

CH2-CH(CH3): single →2.

CH(CH3)-CH2: single →3.

CH2-CH: single →4.

CH-CH2: before the double bond →5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's count each C-C single bond.

1. (CH3)2C group: two C-C bonds.

2. CH2-CH2: one.

3. CH2-CH(CH3): one.

4. CH(CH3)-CH2: one.

5. CH2-CH: one.

6. CH-C (before the second double bond): one.

So that's 6 C-C bonds plus the two from the (CH3)2 groups: 6+2=8.

Wait, that's different from before. So perhaps I previously overcounted.

If there are 8 C-C single bonds, plus 2 C=C bonds.

Then:

C-C:8 ×200=1600.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:22 ×400=8800.

Total:1600+600=2200; 2200+8800=11000.

Wait, 11000.

Then, bond energies of elements:10100.

So ΔHf°=11000-10100=900 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting the C-C bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 7.

Let me try this approach: each carbon in the chain (except the ends) has two C-C bonds.

Wait, no, that's not accurate because the ends are connected to CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct number is 7 C-C single bonds and 2 C=C.

So:

7×200=1400.

2×300=600.

22×400=8800.

Total=1400+600=2000; 2000+8800=10800.

Then, 10800-10100=700.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct number of C-C bonds is 8.

So:

8 ×200=1600.

2 ×300=600.

Total from C-C and C=C:2200.

C-H:8800.

Total:2200+8800=11000.

ΔHf°=11000-10100=900.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm double-counting some bonds.

Another approach: the total number of bonds in the molecule can be calculated using the formula:

Total bonds = (Σ valence electrons)/2.

But wait, for hydrocarbons, each carbon has 4 valence electrons, each H has 1.

So, for C9H22:

C:9 ×4=36.

H:22 ×1=22.

Total valence electrons=36 +22=58.

But each bond is two electrons, so total bonds=58/2=29.

Now, in the molecule, there are 2 double bonds (each counts as one bond but has two π bonds? No, in bond energy terms, each double bond is considered as one bond but with higher energy.

So, number of single bonds:29 -2=27.

But each single bond, double bond, etc., contributes to the total.

Wait, but the bond energies are summed as:

Each single bond: C-C (200), C-H (400).

Each double bond: C=C (300).

So, I need to find how many C-C single, C=C, and C-H bonds are present.

But perhaps the total bonds are 27 single and 2 double →29.

Now, let me denote:

Let x = number of C-C single bonds.

y= number of C=C bonds.

z= number of C-H bonds.

We know that:

x + y + z = total bonds =29.

But also, each C contributes to the bonds.

Each C has 4 bonds.

For 9 Cs:

Σ (bonds per C) =9×4=36.

But each C-C bond is shared between two Cs, so:

x ×2 + y ×2 + z ×1 =36.

Because each C-C bond contributes to two Cs, each C=C contributes to two Cs, and each C-H contributes to one C.

So:

2x + 2y + z =36.

And we have x + y + z =29.

So, subtract:

(2x +2y +z) - (x +y +z) =36-29 →x + y=7.

We also have y=2 (since two double bonds).

So x +2=7 →x=5.

So, x=5 C-C single bonds.

y=2 C=C.

z=29 -5-2=22 C-H.

So now, the counts are:

C-C single:5.

C=C:2.

C-H:22.

Thus, bond energies:

C-C:5×200=1000.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:22×400=8800.

Total:1000+600=1600; 1600+8800=10400.

Then, bond energies of elements:

9×1000 +22×50=9000+1100=10100.

ΔHf°=10400 -10100=300 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either. Hmm.

Wait, but according to this, the correct number of C-C single bonds is 5, not 9 as I previously thought.

So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I was counting the C-C bonds in each (CH3)2C group as two each, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, each (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds, one for each CH3 attached to the central C. So each (CH3)2C contributes two C-C bonds. So two such groups would contribute 4.

But according to this new calculation, the total C-C single bonds are 5, which would mean that the chain contributes 1 C-C single bond.

Hmm, perhaps the chain has only one C-C single bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the chain has fewer C-C bonds.

But this is getting too time-consuming, and perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as per the new values.

So, according to the system of equations, the number of C-C single bonds is 5.

Thus, total bond energy in the molecule is 5×200 +2×300 +22×400 =1000 +600 +8800=10400.

Then, ΔHf°=10400 -10100=300 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 300.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the system of equations.

Let me recheck the equations:

Σ (bonds) = x + y + z =29.

Σ (valence electrons) =2*(x*2 + y*2 + z*1) =2*(2x +2y +z).

But wait, each C-C bond contributes 2 electrons from each C → total of 4 electrons per C-C bond? No, each bond is two electrons. So a single C-C bond is two electrons.

Wait, no: each bond is a sharing of two electrons (one from each atom).

So, for C-C single bonds, each contributes 2 electrons from the two C atoms.

Wait, perhaps the proper way to approach the system is:

Each C-C single bond contributes 2 electrons.

Each C=C bond contributes 4 electrons (since it's a double bond).

Each C-H bond contributes 2 electrons.

But perhaps this is complicating things. Let me try the approach again.

Each C has 4 bonds.

So, for 9 C atoms: 9 ×4=36.

Each C-C single bond contributes to two Cs: each contributes 1 to each C.

Each C=C bond contributes 2 to each C.

Each C-H contributes 1 to the C.

So:

Let x = number of C-C single bonds.

y = number of C=C bonds.

z = number of C-H bonds.

Each x contributes 2 to the total (each bond contributes 1 to each C).

Each y contributes 4 (2 per C, two Cs).

Each z contributes 1 to the C.

So:

2x +4y +z =36.

Also, total bonds: x + y + z=29.

But since each C-C single bond is one bond, each C=C is one bond, each C-H is one bond.

So, subtracting:

(2x +4y +z) =36.

(x + y + z) =29.

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(2x +4y +z) - (x +y +z) =36-29 →x +3y =7.

Since y=2 (two double bonds), x +3*2=7 →x=7-6=1.

So x=1.

Thus, C-C single bonds:1.

C=C:2.

C-H:z=29 -1-2=26.

Wait, that's different from before. So z=26.

So, bonds:

C-C:1×200=200.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:26×400=10400.

Total bond energy:200+600=800; 800+10400=11200.

Then, bond energies from elements:10100.

ΔHf°=11200-10100=1100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 1100. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed x=1, I get:

Using x=1, y=2, z=26.

But when I counted earlier, I thought there were 5 C-C single bonds. But according to this, it's 1. Which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the system of equations is correct, and I made a mistake in the earlier counting.

Thus, the correct bond energies would be 11200, leading to ΔHf°=1100.

But since this doesn't match the options, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the question might have a typo, or perhaps the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the enthalpy of formation as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the products.

So:

ΔHf° = (sum of bonds in reactants) - (sum of bonds in products).

Which would be 10100 -11200 =-1100 kJ/mol.

But none of the options have this. The closest is option A, which is 11200, the sum of the product's bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the bond energy content of the molecule, not the formation enthalpy.

But the options include A as 11200 kJ/mol, which I calculated as the sum of the bonds.

But the question specifically says 'enthalpy of formation', which is ΔHf°.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the system of equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molecular weight to see if any of the per gram options make sense.

Molecular weight of C9H22 is (9×12)+(22×1)=108 +22=130 g/mol.

If option B is 67.4 kJ/mol, that's 0.518 kJ/g (67.4 /130 ≈0.518).

Which is about 518 kJ/kg.

But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach entirely.

Another approach: enthalpy of formation can be calculated as:

ΔHf° = (sum of enthalpy of atomization of C × number of C) + (sum of bond energy of H2 × number of H/2) ) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule)

Wait, that might be the correct formula.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C × ΔH_C) + (n_H × (ΔH_H2 /2)) ] - (Σ bond energies in compound)

Which would be:

[9×1000 +22×(100/2)] - [sum of bonds]

= [9000 +22×50] - [sum of bonds]

= [9000 +1100] - [sum of bonds]

=10100 - sum of bonds.

Which would give:

ΔHf°=10100 - sum of bonds.

But if sum of bonds is 11200, then ΔHf°=10100-11200 =-1100.

Which is exothermic.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = sum of bonds in compound - sum of bonds in elements.

Which would be 11200 -10100=1100.

But again, not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the bond energy of the molecule per mole, which is 11200 kJ/mol, which is option A.

But the question asks for the enthalpy of formation, not the bond energy.

But since the options don't have 1100, perhaps option B is correct. But I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using heats of combustion or some other method, but the problem provides bond energies, so that's not applicable.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me see:

Wait, the sum of bonds in the compound is 11200 kJ/mol. Sum of bonds in elements is 10100.

So, 10100 -11200 =-1100. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question asks for the enthalpy of atomization, which would be 11200 kJ/mol, matching option A.

But the question clearly states 'enthalpy of formation', which is the formation from elements, not from atoms.

Given all this, I'm unable to reconcile the calculation with the options provided. However, based on the bond energy sum, the closest option is A)11200 kJ/mol. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B)67.4, but I don't see how.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the problem provides bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The enthalpy of formation, ΔHf°, can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{[Bond energies of elements in standard state]} - \text{[Bond energies in the compound]}
\]

### Step 1: Bond energies of elements in standard state
- **Carbon (C):** The enthalpy of atomization is given as **1000 kJ/mol**. For 9 moles of carbon in the compound:
  \[
  9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]
- **Hydrogen (H):** The bond energy of H-H is **100 kJ/mol**, so the enthalpy of atomization for each H atom is:
  \[
  \frac{100}{2} = 50 \, \text{kJ/mol per H atom}
  \]
  For 22 moles of hydrogen in the compound:
  \[
  22 \times 50 = 1100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

**Total bond energy of elements:**
\[
9000 + 1100 = 10100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Bond energies in the compound
The compound contains:
- **C-C single bonds:** Counted as 5 (based on the structure and system of equations).
  \[
  5 \times 200 = 1000 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]
- **C=C double bonds:** 2 double bonds.
  \[
  2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]
- **C-H bonds:** 22 single bonds.
  \[
  22 \times 400 = 8800 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

**Total bond energy in the compound:**
\[
1000 + 600 + 8800 = 10400 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Enthalpy of formation
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{[Bond energies of elements]} - \text{[Bond energies in the compound]}
\]
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = 10100 - 10400 = -300 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A (11200 kJ/mol):** This matches the total bond energy of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation.
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol):** This does not match the calculated value of -300 kJ/mol.
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g):** This is a per gram value, which is inconsistent with the kJ/mol units provided in the problem.
- **Option D (1900 kJ/g):** Similarly inconsistent with the units and calculated value.

The calculated enthalpy of formation is **-300 kJ/mol**, but none of the options match this value. Based on the bond energy sum provided in the problem, the closest match is **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**, which represents the total bond energy of the compound.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, let's see. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. I think I need to draw it out or at least visualize it to understand how many bonds I'm dealing with.

Wait, the question provides some bond energies. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. I remember that the formula is something like the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, wait. Formation enthalpy is the energy change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, the approach is to calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the elements and then the energy released when the bonds in the compound form.

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies, so maybe the method is to calculate the total bond energies in the molecule and relate that to the formation enthalpy. Or perhaps I should consider the enthalpy of atomization and the bond energies.

Wait, the problem says the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert an element into its atoms in the gas phase. So for carbon, that's 1000 kJ per mole to turn it into C atoms.

So the molecule in question is made up of carbon and hydrogen. So, each carbon in the molecule is bonded to other carbons and hydrogens. But how do I approach calculating the formation enthalpy?

Wait, formation enthalpy (ΔHf°) is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For example, for a hydrocarbon, it's formed from carbon ( graphite ) and hydrogen gas ( H2 ).

So, to calculate ΔHf°, I think the formula is:

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

But wait, the reactants here are the elements in their standard states. So for this molecule, the elements are C (graphite) and H2.

Alternatively, I've heard of using the atomization method. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization approach. The steps are: 

1. Break down the compound into its constituent atoms (atomization), which requires energy.
2. Then, form the bonds in the compound, which releases energy.
But I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Another approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation based on the sum of the bond energies in the molecule. Wait, maybe the formula is:

ΔHf° = (Number of C atoms × Enthalpy of C atomization) + (Number of H atoms × Enthalpy of H atomization) - (Sum of bond energies in the molecule)

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies, not enthalpy of atomization for H. Oh, right, the bond energy for H-H is given as 100 kJ/mol. So the enthalpy of atomization for hydrogen would be half of that because each H atom in H2 is bonded with another. So each H atom has a bond energy of 50 kJ/mol, but wait, no. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break all bonds in the molecule to get atoms. So for H2, bond energy is 100 kJ/mol per mole of H2. So to get H atoms, you need to spend 100 kJ per mole of H2.

Wait, but for each mole of H2, you get 2 moles of H atoms. So per mole of H atom, the enthalpy of atomization would be 50 kJ? Because 100 kJ per mole H2 gives 2 moles H, so each H atom is 50 kJ. Hmm, perhaps not, because the bond energy is given per mole of the bond. So, for H-H, each mole of bond requires 100 kJ to break. So each mole of H2 requires 100 kJ to split into 2 moles of H atoms. So the enthalpy of atomization for H is 50 kJ/mol (per H atom). But wait, the problem might not require that because the bond energies are given.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total bond energies in the compound and subtract from the total bond energies of the elements (in their standard states) to get the formation enthalpy.

Wait, the general formula I've come across before is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Atoms of each element × enthalpy of atomization)] - [Σ (Bonds in the molecule × bond energy)]

But wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Because when you form bonds, energy is released, so it's bonds in the reactants (elements) minus bonds in the products (molecule). Or maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula: 

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]

But wait, the reactants in this case are the elements in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite and hydrogen is H2.

Wait, let's think of the process. Formation of the compound from elements. So, the elements (reactants) are broken down into their atoms (atomization), which requires energy, and then these atoms form the bonds in the compound, releasing energy.

So, the total enthalpy change would be:

ΔHf° = (Bond energies of reactants) - (Bond energies of products)

But wait, the reactants are the elements in standard states, which are in bonds. So, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds in the elements. For example, for C (graphite), each C is in a covalent network, but I think for simplicity, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for C. So each C atom in the molecule comes from breaking that bond in graphite, but perhaps in this problem, we're given the enthalpy of atomization, which is the energy required to convert 1 mole of C into gaseous atoms.

Similarly, for H2, the bond energy is 100 kJ/mol. So, for each H2 molecule, we need to spend 100 kJ to split into H atoms.

So, for the molecule in question, let's count the number of C and H atoms.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons and hydrogens.

First, each (CH3)2 group: each has 2 CH3 groups, so 2*(3 H) = 6 H, but each CH3 has 1 C, so each (CH3)2 group has 2 Cs.

Wait, the formula of the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me think about each part:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH. So that's a group with two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is double-bonded to another CH.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the molecular formula.

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 C and 6 H.

Wait, no. Let's break it down step by step.

The molecule's structure:

It starts with (CH3)2C=CH-..., then a CH2, then a CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of C and H atoms.

Each C in the molecule:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH-: the C here is connected to two CH3 groups, one C (from the double bond), and one CH group.

Wait, maybe I should write the entire formula.

Wait, the molecule is 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene or something else? Hmm, perhaps not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me count the number of C and H in the molecule.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: that's 3 C (since (CH3)2C is 3 C, then the =CH adds another C? Wait, no: (CH3)2C is a single C attached to two CH3, then a double bond to another CH. So that part is (CH3)2C=CH. So that's 3 C (the central C in (CH3)2C, the one it's double-bonded to, and the CH3 groups may count as part of that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each C and H.

Wait, the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me expand this:

Each group:

1. (CH3)2C: that's 3 C (since it's a central C attached to two CH3 groups).

Wait, no, (CH3)2C is a central carbon connected to two CH3 groups, so that's 1 C for the center, plus two CH3, each adding one C. So total of 3 C in (CH3)2C.

Then, the next part is =CH-, so that's another C attached via double bond, so that's 4 C so far.

After that, -CH2-: that's another C, so 5.

Then, -CH(CH3)-: another C, making 6.

Then, -CH2-: another C, 7.

Then, -CH=C(CH3)2: two more C (the double-bonded C and the one attached to the (CH3)2 groups). So 1 more (CH3)2C brings it to 9.

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Let me count each part:

Start with (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down as:

- (CH3)2C: 3 C (the central C and two from CH3 groups? Wait no, each CH3 has one C. So (CH3)2C has 1 (central) + 2*(1) = 3? No, because each CH3 is a group attached to the central C. So the central C is one, each CH3 is a group with one C. So (CH3)2C is 3 C.

Wait, maybe it's easier to count each carbon in the entire molecule.

Let me number each carbon:

1. The first (CH3)2C: the central C is C1, each CH3's C is C2 and C3.

2. Then, the double bond is to C4 (from =CH-).

3. Then, the next is CH2: C5.

4. Then, CH(CH3): C6.

5. Next, CH2: C7.

6. Then, CH=C(CH3)2: C8 is the CH, and C9 is the central C in C(CH3)2.

Wait, so that's 9 carbons in total.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try drawing the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a molecule with two double bonds. Let me think: each (CH3)2C group is a substituent on either side of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's 1,3-pentadiene derivative. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 2,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-hexatriene or something else. Maybe not necessary for counting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H atoms.

Each (CH3)2C: each CH3 has 3 H. So (CH3)2C has 2*(3) + 3 (from the central C's H?) Wait, no. Wait, (CH3)2C is a group where the central C is attached to two CH3 groups and maybe another group.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at the entire formula.

The molecular formula is C9H14.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me count:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C group contributes 3 C (if I'm right before) and 6 H.

But perhaps let me count all H.

Each (CH3)2C group has two CH3 groups, each with 3 H: 2*3=6 H.

The =CH- group: the CH has 1 H.

Then, the next CH2 has 2 H.

Then, CH(CH3) has 3 H.

Next CH2 has 2 H.

Then, CH=C has 1 H.

Then, (CH3)2 group: two CH3 groups, 2*3=6 H.

Wait, but maybe I should look at each part:

Let me write the entire structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each part:

(CH3)2C=CH: this is (CH3)2-C=CH-

So, for this group:

In (CH3)2C, each CH3 has 3 H. So 2 * 3 H =6 H.

The C in (CH3)2C is bonded to another CH (the double bond), so perhaps that C has three substituents: two CH3 and one CH. So it's (CH3)2C-CH2? Maybe not. Wait, the group is (CH3)2C=CH-.

So, the C=C is between C1 and C2. C1 is (CH3)2-C, and C2 is CH.

So, C1: has two CH3 groups, one C=C, and one single bond to the next group.

Wait, perhaps I should just count each H in the entire molecule.

Let me think:

- Each (CH3)2C=CH-: Each CH3 has 3 H, so 2*3=6 H. The C=CH has one H (because CH). So that's 6 +1=7 H from the first part.

But wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So after the first (CH3)2C=CH, there's a CH2 group.

So for the CH2: 2 H.

Then, CH(CH3): that's 3 H (since it's CH(CH3) group, which has one H attached to C, and the CH3 has 3 H).

Next, another CH2: 2 H.

Then, CH=C: the CH has one H, and the C=C is connected to (CH3)2 group.

The (CH3)2 group has two CH3, each contributing 3 H: 2 *3=6 H.

So adding them all up:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 6 (from two CH3) +1 (CH) =7 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 3 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH=C: 1 H.

CH2: 2 H.

Wait, no, wait the structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 after the CH=C is part of the CH=C group? Hmm, perhaps I should recount.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write each part and count the H:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : two CH3 (2*3=6 H) and CH (1 H → total 7 H so far).

2. CH2- : 2 H → total 9.

3. CH(CH3)- : CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 → total 4 → cumulative 13.

4. CH2- : 2 → 15.

5. CH=C(CH3)2 : CH has 1 H; C=C is connected to two CH3 groups, each with 3 H → 2*3=6 H → 1+6=7 H → cumulative 15 +7 =22 H.

Wait, but wait, the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me consider each group:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 2 CH3 → 6 H; CH → 1 H. Total 7.

- CH2: 2 H → total 9.

- CH(CH3): CH has 1 H; CH3 has 3 H → 4 → total 13.

- CH2: 2 → 15.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H; the C=C is connected to two CH3 groups, each 3 H → 2*3=6 → total 1 +6=7 H → total 15 +7=22.

Wait, but let me recount:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-: 6+1=7.

CH2-: 2 → 9.

CH(CH3)-: 1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) =4 → 13.

CH2-: 2 →15.

CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (from CH) + (each CH3 has 3 → 2*3=6) → 7 → 15+7=22.

Wait, but that gives 22 H in total. So the molecular formula would be C9H22? Wait, the molecular formula is C9H14.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, each (CH3)2C group is 3 C and 6 H. Then, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons:

1. (CH3)2C: 3 C (C1, C2, C3)

2. =CH- : C4.

3. CH2-: C5.

4. CH(CH3)-: C6.

5. CH2-: C7.

6. CH=C: C8 and C9.

Wait, that's 9 C in total.

Hydrogen count:

Each CH3 has 3 H: there are 8 CH3 groups in the entire molecule (each (CH3)2 group contributes two, and there are two of them at the ends). So 8 *3=24 H.

Wait, but the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2 group has two CH3: 2 *3=6 H per (CH3)2 group. There are two such groups (at the ends), so 2 *6=12 H.

Then, the other parts: each CH has 1 H, and each CH2 has 2 H.

Let me count:

- The (CH3)2C=CH-: 2 CH3 → 6 H; the CH has 1 → 7 H.

- The CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C: 

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 H (from CH) +3 H (from CH3) →4.

CH2: 2.

CH=C: 1 H (from CH).

Wait, but the (CH3)2 at the end contributes two CH3 → 6 H.

So let's add up:

- Initial (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 +1 =7.

- CH2: 2 → total 9.

- CH(CH3):1 (CH) +3 (CH3) →4 → total 13.

- CH2: 2 →15.

- CH=C: 1 →16.

- (CH3)2 at the end: 2*3=6 →22.

So total H is 22. But the molecular formula would be C9H22. But the question says (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So perhaps I did that correctly.

But wait, the user's question is to calculate the enthalpy of formation. The options are A) 11200 kJ/mol, B) 67.4 kJ/mol, C) 11.44 kJ/g, D) 1900 kJ/g.

But wait, the options have a mix of kJ/mol and kJ/g. So perhaps the answer is in kJ/mol, which would be option A or B, or maybe C and D are per gram.

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies in kJ/mol, so the answer should be in kJ/mol, which would be options A or B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

So, the approach is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of elements in standard state)] - [Σ (Bond energies in the molecule)]

But the elements are in their standard states, which are graphite for C and H2 for H.

So, for each C atom, the bond energy from graphite is 1000 kJ/mol (the enthalpy of atomization). For each H atom, since H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, each H atom comes from H2, so we need to break that bond. So for each H atom, the energy is 50 kJ (because each H2 molecule requires 100 kJ to split into two H atoms, so per H atom, it's 50 kJ).

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. So, how do I get the bond energies for the elements in their standard states?

Wait, for C in graphite, the bond energy is not given. But the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. So, each C atom in graphite must be held together with a bond energy that, when atomized, requires 1000 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total bond energies from the elements (C and H2) and subtract the bond energies in the compound.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf°(compound) = [ (Number of C atoms × enthalpy of C atomization) + (Number of H atoms × (H-H bond energy / 2)) ] - (Sum of bond energies in the compound).

Wait, because each H atom in H2 is obtained by breaking the H-H bond, which costs 100 kJ/mol bond. So per mole of H atom, it's 50 kJ. So, for each H atom, we have 50 kJ.

Wait, but the problem gives bond energies, not enthalpy of atomization for H. So if H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, then each H atom's enthalpy of atomization is 50 kJ per mole of H atom.

So, for the compound, which has C9H22:

Number of C atoms =9 → 9 ×1000 kJ/mol=9000 kJ.

Number of H atoms=22 →22 ×50 kJ/mol=1100 kJ.

So total bond energy from elements: 9000 +1100=10100 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, if the compound has 9 C and 22 H atoms, then the total energy to atomize all the C and H from their standard states is 9*1000 + 22*(100/2) =9000 + 22*50 =9000 +1100=10100 kJ/mol.

Then, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is the sum of all the bonds in the compound.

But wait, the bonds in the compound are C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So, I need to count how many of each bond are present in the molecule.

Let me think about the structure again.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me break it into parts:

Each (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds (from the two CH3 groups), and a C=C bond.

Wait, but each (CH3)2C group is connected to other carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

So, for each C in the molecule, I can count the number of bonds it has.

But perhaps it's easier to count each type of bond.

C-C bonds: Each single bond between two Cs counts as one C-C bond.

C=C bonds: Each double bond counts as one C=C bond (since each double bond is a single bond in terms of counting, but with higher energy).

C-H bonds: Each C-H single bond counts as one.

So, let's count all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

First, I'll count the C-C bonds.

Looking at the structure:

- The molecule has a chain of Cs connected by single bonds, except where there are double bonds.

So, let's identify the number of C-C single bonds.

Each (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds (each CH3 is attached via C-C).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each C-C bond in the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count all the C-C bonds:

Each CH2 group contributes one C-C bond.

Each CH(CH3) contributes one C-C bond.

But perhaps a better approach is to note how many C-C single bonds are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a structure with multiple single bonds and two double bonds.

Wait, the molecule has two double bonds: one in (CH3)2C=CH- and another in CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each double bond is a C=C.

So, number of C=C bonds: 2.

Now, for C-C bonds: Each single bond between two Cs counts as one.

Let me try to count:

Each CH2 group has one C-C bond (between the two Cs in CH2-CH2).

Each CH(CH3) has one C-C bond.

Let me try to list each C and its bonds.

But perhaps a better approach is to think of the molecule as a chain with some substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the degree of unsaturation to find the number of double bonds, but that's not directly helpful for counting bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count all the C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps this is taking too long. Let me think of another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 8 C-C bonds and 2 C=C bonds, and the rest are C-H bonds.

Wait, the molecule has 9 C atoms, so the number of C-C bonds is (9 - number of C=C bonds)×something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps each C-C bond is a single bond, and each C=C is a double bond (so, each contributes to the total bond count).

Wait, let me think: Each C in the molecule is connected to other Cs via single or double bonds.

So, the total number of C-C bonds can be calculated as follows.

Each C in the molecule forms bonds with other Cs and Hs.

For each C, the number of bonds is equal to the number of valence electrons used.

But perhaps it's easier to approach systematically.

In a molecule, the number of C-C single bonds plus twice the number of C=C double bonds plus other bonds equals the total valence.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me approach it this way: for each C, count the number of bonds to other Cs, and sum all, then divide by 2 (since each bond is counted twice).

Alternatively, each C-C bond is counted once.

Let me proceed:

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me list the structure as a series of carbon atoms connected in a chain, with substituents.

So the structure can be written as:

C1 (CH3)2-C2=C3-CH2-C4-CH(CH3)-C5-CH2-C6=CH-C7-C8(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to number the carbons.

So, let me number them as C1 to C9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's try again.

The structure is:

C1 (CH3)2—C2=C3—CH2—C4—CH(CH3)—C5—CH2—C6=CH—C7—C8(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the correct structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 9 carbons arranged with two double bonds.

But perhaps the best approach is to count each type of bond.

So, let's count:

C-C bonds: each single bond between two C atoms.

C=C bonds: each double bond counts as one (since each double bond has two π bonds, but bond energy is considered per bond type).

C-H bonds: all single bonds between C and H.

So, for the molecule:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C group: Each CH3 contributes one C-C bond (since each CH3 is attached to the central C). So for (CH3)2C, there are two C-C bonds (each CH3 is attached via C-C).

Then, the C=C between C2 and C3.

Then, C3 is connected to C4 via a single bond (CH2-CH2).

C4 is connected to C5 via a single bond.

C5 is connected to C6 via a single bond.

C6 is connected to C7 via a double bond (C6=C7).

C7 is connected to C8 via a single bond.

C8 is connected to two CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to count the C-C bonds.

Each (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds (since each CH3 is attached via a C-C bond). There are two such groups in the molecule: one at the beginning and one at the end.

So that's 2 groups ×2 C-C bonds =4.

Then, the C=C bonds: two in the molecule.

Now, the rest of the C-C bonds are in the chain.

Looking at the chain: between C3 and C4 (CH2-CH2): one C-C bond.

Between C4 and C5 (CH2-CH(CH3)): one C-C bond.

Between C5 and C6 (CH2-CH): one C-C bond.

Between C6 and C7 (CH=C): another C-C bond.

Between C7 and C8 (CH-C(CH3)2): one C-C bond.

So that's 5 C-C bonds in the chain.

Adding that: 4 (from the groups) +5 (chain) =9 C-C bonds.

Plus, each C=C bond is a double bond, which is two C-C bonds? No, wait, each double bond is a single bond but with higher energy. So the C=C counts as one bond for the purpose of counting, but has higher energy.

Wait, no. Each bond in the molecule is either single, double, etc. So, each C=C bond is a single instance but with higher bond energy.

Wait, no. The number of bonds in the molecule is as follows:

Each C-C single bond is one bond, each C=C is one bond (but with higher bond energy), and each C-H is one bond.

So, for the molecule:

Number of C-C single bonds:

Each (CH3)2C group: two bonds each → 2 groups ×2 =4.

In the chain:

Between C3 and C4: 1.

C4 to C5:1.

C5 to C6:1.

C6 to C7:1.

C7 to C8:1.

So 5 single C-C bonds in the chain.

Plus, the two C=C bonds.

So total C-C bonds (single) =4 +5=9.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

So total C-C bonds (single) is 9, and C=C is 2.

Now, total C-C bonds for bond energy calculation: each C-C is 200 kJ/mol. So 9 ×200=1800 kJ.

Each C=C is 300 kJ/mol. So 2 ×300=600 kJ.

Now, C-H bonds: each C connected to H has a C-H bond.

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds → for each (CH3)2 group, 2×3=6 C-H bonds. There are two such groups, so 2×6=12.

In the chain:

Each CH group has one C-H.

Each CH2 has two C-H.

Let me go through the molecule:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 

Each CH3 has 3 C-H → 2×3=6.

The CH has 1 C-H → total 7.

2. CH2-: 2 C-H.

3. CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 C-H, and the CH3 has 3 →4.

4. CH2-: 2.

5. CH=C: the CH has 1 C-H.

6. (CH3)2: each CH3 has 3 →2×3=6.

Wait, but that's the (CH3)2 group. So:

Each group contributes:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 (CH3) +1 (CH) =7.

- CH2-:2.

- CH(CH3)-:1 (CH) +3 (CH3) =4.

- CH2-:2.

- CH=C:1 (CH).

- (CH3)2:6.

Wait, but that counts the (CH3)2 group at the end, which has 6 C-H bonds.

Adding them up:

7 (first part) + 2 +4 +2 +1 +6 =22 C-H bonds.

So, 22 C-H bonds ×400 kJ/mol each.

Wait, no: each C-H bond is 400 kJ/mol. So 22 ×400=8800 kJ.

Wait, but wait, no. Each C-H bond contributes 400 kJ/mol to the bond energy. So total C-H bond energy is 22 ×400=8800 kJ.

Now, summing all the bonds:

C-C single:9 ×200=1800.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:22 ×400=8800.

Total bond energy in the molecule:1800 +600 +8800=11200 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's interesting. So the total bond energy in the molecule is 11200 kJ/mol.

Now, the total bond energy from the elements is:

Each C atom: 1000 kJ/mol →9 C →9×1000=9000.

Each H atom: H2's bond energy is 100 kJ/mol, so per H atom, 50 kJ/mol. 22 H →22×50=1100.

Total from elements:9000 +1100=10100 kJ/mol.

Now, the enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = [Bond energy of elements] - [Bond energy of compound]

Which is 10100 -11200 =-1100 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that gives a negative value, which would imply the reaction is exothermic. But the options don't have a negative value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula reversed. Maybe it's [Bond energy of compound] - [Bond energy of elements].

Because the formation enthalpy is the energy released when bonds form. So, if I form the compound from atoms, the energy released would be the sum of bond energies in the compound minus the energy required to break the bonds in the elements.

So, ΔHf°= (Sum of bond energies in compound) - (Sum of bond energies in elements).

In this case, 11200 -10100=1100 kJ/mol.

But that's positive, indicating endothermic formation, which seems unlikely for a hydrocarbon. But perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, let me double-check the bond counts.

C-C bonds:9 at 200 each →9×200=1800.

C=C bonds:2 at 300 each →600.

C-H bonds:22 at 400 →8800.

Total:1800+600+8800=11200.

Elements:

9 C at 1000 →9000.

22 H at 50 →1100.

Total:10100.

So ΔHf°=11200-10100=1100 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1100. Wait, looking back:

Options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g.

So 1100 isn't an option. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in counting the bonds?

Wait, perhaps I counted the C-C bonds incorrectly. Let me recount the C-C bonds.

Wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me think of it as a chain with substituents.

Each (CH3)2C group is at both ends.

In the chain:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain has 7 carbons between the two (CH3)2C groups? Or perhaps 8? Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

(CH3)2C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-CH2-C(CH3)2.

Wait, no. The actual structure has two double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count C-C single bonds.

Wait, perhaps each (CH3)2C group contributes two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to the central C). So two groups ×2=4.

Then, in the chain, each single bond between Cs counts as one.

The chain structure is:

C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

So, between C and CH: that's a C-C single bond.

CH to CH2: C-C.

CH2 to CH(CH3): C-C.

CH(CH3) to CH2: C-C.

CH2 to CH: C-C.

CH to C: C-C.

Wait, that's 5 C-C single bonds in the chain.

So total C-C single bonds:4 (from groups) +5 (chain)=9.

C=C bonds:2.

So yes, 9 C-C single bonds and 2 C=C.

So that part is correct.

Now, C-H bonds:22 as before.

So the calculation of 11200 for the compound's bond energy is correct.

Elements:10100.

So 11200-10100=1100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have that. Let's look again at the options.

Option A is 11200, which is the bond energy of the compound. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf°= sum of bond energies of products - sum of bond energies of reactants.

In this case, the reactant is the elements (C and H2), and product is the compound.

So, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds in the elements.

So, for each C atom, 1000 kJ/mol.

Each H atom in H2:100 kJ/mol per H2.

So, for the reaction:

9 C (graphite) + (22/2) H2 → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The bond energies on the reactant side:

9×1000 (C's) + (11 ×100) (H2) →9000 +1100=10100.

On the product side: sum of bond energies in the molecule is 11200.

So, the enthalpy change is products (bond energies) minus reactants (bond energies):

ΔHf°=11200 -10100=1100 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the bonds.

Wait, perhaps the C-C bonds are not all single. Let me recount the C-C single bonds.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C-C single bonds:

1. (CH3)2C: two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to central C).

2. C=C: one bond.

3. CH2-CH2: one.

4. CH2-CH(CH3): one.

5. CH(CH3)-CH2: one.

6. CH2-CH: one.

7. CH=C: one.

Wait, but CH=C is a double bond, so that's a C=C.

Wait, so in the chain, how many C-C single bonds are there?

- Between (CH3)2C and the next C: that's the C=C, so no single bond.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain after the first (CH3)2C is:

C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

So, the chain has:

C=CH is a double bond (C=C).

Then, CH-CH2: single bond.

CH2-CH(CH3): single.

CH(CH3)-CH2: single.

CH2-CH: single.

CH-C: single (in the other double bond).

Wait, so the chain has 5 single C-C bonds.

Plus the two C-C from the (CH3)2 groups.

So 2*(2) +5=9.

So that part is correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of bond energies in the elements minus the sum in the compound.

In that case, it would be 10100 -11200 =-1100, which would be exothermic. But that's negative, and the options don't have that.

But the options include A)11200, which is the sum of the compound's bonds. So perhaps the question is asking for the bond energy content of the molecule, not the formation enthalpy.

Wait, but the question states: "Calculate the enthalpy of formation".

So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = sum of bond energies in the reactants (elements) - sum of bond energies in the products (molecule).

But that would be 10100 -11200 =-1100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps I've miscounted the C-H bonds.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group has 6 C-H.

The =CH has 1.

CH2 has 2.

CH(CH3) has 4 (1 from CH and 3 from CH3).

Another CH2 has 2.

CH=C has 1.

The other (CH3)2 has 6.

So total:

6 (from first group) +1 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 =22.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was to calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, but the question says 'enthalpy of formation'.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

ΔHf° = (sum of bonds in reactants) - (sum of bonds in products).

Which would be 10100 -11200 =-1100.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the bond energies, but perhaps the bond energies given are in kJ per bond, not per mole.

Wait, no, the problem states bond energies are in kJ/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Let me recount the C-C bonds:

Each (CH3)2 group contributes two C-C bonds.

In the chain:

C=CH is a double bond, so no C-C single bond there.

Then:

CH-CH2: single bond →1.

CH2-CH(CH3): single →2.

CH(CH3)-CH2: single →3.

CH2-CH: single →4.

CH-CH2: before the double bond →5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's count each C-C single bond.

1. (CH3)2C group: two C-C bonds.

2. CH2-CH2: one.

3. CH2-CH(CH3): one.

4. CH(CH3)-CH2: one.

5. CH2-CH: one.

6. CH-C (before the second double bond): one.

So that's 6 C-C bonds plus the two from the (CH3)2 groups: 6+2=8.

Wait, that's different from before. So perhaps I previously overcounted.

If there are 8 C-C single bonds, plus 2 C=C bonds.

Then:

C-C:8 ×200=1600.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:22 ×400=8800.

Total:1600+600=2200; 2200+8800=11000.

Wait, 11000.

Then, bond energies of elements:10100.

So ΔHf°=11000-10100=900 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting the C-C bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 7.

Let me try this approach: each carbon in the chain (except the ends) has two C-C bonds.

Wait, no, that's not accurate because the ends are connected to CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct number is 7 C-C single bonds and 2 C=C.

So:

7×200=1400.

2×300=600.

22×400=8800.

Total=1400+600=2000; 2000+8800=10800.

Then, 10800-10100=700.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct number of C-C bonds is 8.

So:

8 ×200=1600.

2 ×300=600.

Total from C-C and C=C:2200.

C-H:8800.

Total:2200+8800=11000.

ΔHf°=11000-10100=900.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm double-counting some bonds.

Another approach: the total number of bonds in the molecule can be calculated using the formula:

Total bonds = (Σ valence electrons)/2.

But wait, for hydrocarbons, each carbon has 4 valence electrons, each H has 1.

So, for C9H22:

C:9 ×4=36.

H:22 ×1=22.

Total valence electrons=36 +22=58.

But each bond is two electrons, so total bonds=58/2=29.

Now, in the molecule, there are 2 double bonds (each counts as one bond but has two π bonds? No, in bond energy terms, each double bond is considered as one bond but with higher energy.

So, number of single bonds:29 -2=27.

But each single bond, double bond, etc., contributes to the total.

Wait, but the bond energies are summed as:

Each single bond: C-C (200), C-H (400).

Each double bond: C=C (300).

So, I need to find how many C-C single, C=C, and C-H bonds are present.

But perhaps the total bonds are 27 single and 2 double →29.

Now, let me denote:

Let x = number of C-C single bonds.

y= number of C=C bonds.

z= number of C-H bonds.

We know that:

x + y + z = total bonds =29.

But also, each C contributes to the bonds.

Each C has 4 bonds.

For 9 Cs:

Σ (bonds per C) =9×4=36.

But each C-C bond is shared between two Cs, so:

x ×2 + y ×2 + z ×1 =36.

Because each C-C bond contributes to two Cs, each C=C contributes to two Cs, and each C-H contributes to one C.

So:

2x + 2y + z =36.

And we have x + y + z =29.

So, subtract:

(2x +2y +z) - (x +y +z) =36-29 →x + y=7.

We also have y=2 (since two double bonds).

So x +2=7 →x=5.

So, x=5 C-C single bonds.

y=2 C=C.

z=29 -5-2=22 C-H.

So now, the counts are:

C-C single:5.

C=C:2.

C-H:22.

Thus, bond energies:

C-C:5×200=1000.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:22×400=8800.

Total:1000+600=1600; 1600+8800=10400.

Then, bond energies of elements:

9×1000 +22×50=9000+1100=10100.

ΔHf°=10400 -10100=300 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either. Hmm.

Wait, but according to this, the correct number of C-C single bonds is 5, not 9 as I previously thought.

So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I was counting the C-C bonds in each (CH3)2C group as two each, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, each (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds, one for each CH3 attached to the central C. So each (CH3)2C contributes two C-C bonds. So two such groups would contribute 4.

But according to this new calculation, the total C-C single bonds are 5, which would mean that the chain contributes 1 C-C single bond.

Hmm, perhaps the chain has only one C-C single bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the chain has fewer C-C bonds.

But this is getting too time-consuming, and perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as per the new values.

So, according to the system of equations, the number of C-C single bonds is 5.

Thus, total bond energy in the molecule is 5×200 +2×300 +22×400 =1000 +600 +8800=10400.

Then, ΔHf°=10400 -10100=300 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 300.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the system of equations.

Let me recheck the equations:

Σ (bonds) = x + y + z =29.

Σ (valence electrons) =2*(x*2 + y*2 + z*1) =2*(2x +2y +z).

But wait, each C-C bond contributes 2 electrons from each C → total of 4 electrons per C-C bond? No, each bond is two electrons. So a single C-C bond is two electrons.

Wait, no: each bond is a sharing of two electrons (one from each atom).

So, for C-C single bonds, each contributes 2 electrons from the two C atoms.

Wait, perhaps the proper way to approach the system is:

Each C-C single bond contributes 2 electrons.

Each C=C bond contributes 4 electrons (since it's a double bond).

Each C-H bond contributes 2 electrons.

But perhaps this is complicating things. Let me try the approach again.

Each C has 4 bonds.

So, for 9 C atoms: 9 ×4=36.

Each C-C single bond contributes to two Cs: each contributes 1 to each C.

Each C=C bond contributes 2 to each C.

Each C-H contributes 1 to the C.

So:

Let x = number of C-C single bonds.

y = number of C=C bonds.

z = number of C-H bonds.

Each x contributes 2 to the total (each bond contributes 1 to each C).

Each y contributes 4 (2 per C, two Cs).

Each z contributes 1 to the C.

So:

2x +4y +z =36.

Also, total bonds: x + y + z=29.

But since each C-C single bond is one bond, each C=C is one bond, each C-H is one bond.

So, subtracting:

(2x +4y +z) =36.

(x + y + z) =29.

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(2x +4y +z) - (x +y +z) =36-29 →x +3y =7.

Since y=2 (two double bonds), x +3*2=7 →x=7-6=1.

So x=1.

Thus, C-C single bonds:1.

C=C:2.

C-H:z=29 -1-2=26.

Wait, that's different from before. So z=26.

So, bonds:

C-C:1×200=200.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:26×400=10400.

Total bond energy:200+600=800; 800+10400=11200.

Then, bond energies from elements:10100.

ΔHf°=11200-10100=1100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 1100. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed x=1, I get:

Using x=1, y=2, z=26.

But when I counted earlier, I thought there were 5 C-C single bonds. But according to this, it's 1. Which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the system of equations is correct, and I made a mistake in the earlier counting.

Thus, the correct bond energies would be 11200, leading to ΔHf°=1100.

But since this doesn't match the options, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the question might have a typo, or perhaps the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the enthalpy of formation as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the products.

So:

ΔHf° = (sum of bonds in reactants) - (sum of bonds in products).

Which would be 10100 -11200 =-1100 kJ/mol.

But none of the options have this. The closest is option A, which is 11200, the sum of the product's bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the bond energy content of the molecule, not the formation enthalpy.

But the options include A as 11200 kJ/mol, which I calculated as the sum of the bonds.

But the question specifically says 'enthalpy of formation', which is ΔHf°.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the system of equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molecular weight to see if any of the per gram options make sense.

Molecular weight of C9H22 is (9×12)+(22×1)=108 +22=130 g/mol.

If option B is 67.4 kJ/mol, that's 0.518 kJ/g (67.4 /130 ≈0.518).

Which is about 518 kJ/kg.

But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach entirely.

Another approach: enthalpy of formation can be calculated as:

ΔHf° = (sum of enthalpy of atomization of C × number of C) + (sum of bond energy of H2 × number of H/2) ) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule)

Wait, that might be the correct formula.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C × ΔH_C) + (n_H × (ΔH_H2 /2)) ] - (Σ bond energies in compound)

Which would be:

[9×1000 +22×(100/2)] - [sum of bonds]

= [9000 +22×50] - [sum of bonds]

= [9000 +1100] - [sum of bonds]

=10100 - sum of bonds.

Which would give:

ΔHf°=10100 - sum of bonds.

But if sum of bonds is 11200, then ΔHf°=10100-11200 =-1100.

Which is exothermic.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = sum of bonds in compound - sum of bonds in elements.

Which would be 11200 -10100=1100.

But again, not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the bond energy of the molecule per mole, which is 11200 kJ/mol, which is option A.

But the question asks for the enthalpy of formation, not the bond energy.

But since the options don't have 1100, perhaps option B is correct. But I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using heats of combustion or some other method, but the problem provides bond energies, so that's not applicable.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me see:

Wait, the sum of bonds in the compound is 11200 kJ/mol. Sum of bonds in elements is 10100.

So, 10100 -11200 =-1100. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question asks for the enthalpy of atomization, which would be 11200 kJ/mol, matching option A.

But the question clearly states 'enthalpy of formation', which is the formation from elements, not from atoms.

Given all this, I'm unable to reconcile the calculation with the options provided. However, based on the bond energy sum, the closest option is A)11200 kJ/mol. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B)67.4, but I don't see how.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the problem provides bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The enthalpy of formation, ΔHf°, can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{[Bond energies of elements in standard state]} - \text{[Bond energies in the compound]}
\]

### Step 1: Bond energies of elements in standard state
- **Carbon (C):** The enthalpy of atomization is given as **1000 kJ/mol**. For 9 moles of carbon in the compound:
  \[
  9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]
- **Hydrogen (H):** The bond energy of H-H is **100 kJ/mol**, so the enthalpy of atomization for each H atom is:
  \[
  \frac{100}{2} = 50 \, \text{kJ/mol per H atom}
  \]
  For 22 moles of hydrogen in the compound:
  \[
  22 \times 50 = 1100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

**Total bond energy of elements:**
\[
9000 + 1100 = 10100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Bond energies in the compound
The compound contains:
- **C-C single bonds:** Counted as 5 (based on the structure and system of equations).
  \[
  5 \times 200 = 1000 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]
- **C=C double bonds:** 2 double bonds.
  \[
  2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]
- **C-H bonds:** 22 single bonds.
  \[
  22 \times 400 = 8800 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

**Total bond energy in the compound:**
\[
1000 + 600 + 8800 = 10400 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Enthalpy of formation
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{[Bond energies of elements]} - \text{[Bond energies in the compound]}
\]
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = 10100 - 10400 = -300 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A (11200 kJ/mol):** This matches the total bond energy of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation.
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol):** This does not match the calculated value of -300 kJ/mol.
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g):** This is a per gram value, which is inconsistent with the kJ/mol units provided in the problem.
- **Option D (1900 kJ/g):** Similarly inconsistent with the units and calculated value.

The calculated enthalpy of formation is **-300 kJ/mol**, but none of the options match this value. Based on the bond energy sum provided in the problem, the closest match is **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**, which represents the total bond energy of the compound.
