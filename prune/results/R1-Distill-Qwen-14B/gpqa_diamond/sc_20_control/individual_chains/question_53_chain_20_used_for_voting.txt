Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. Hmm.

Alright, first, the IR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters typically have strong absorption around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹, right? So that confirms the presence of an ester, which means the molecule has an -O-CO-O- group or something like that. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are like RCOOR'. So in the structure, there's an ester functional group.

Next, the NMR information. The 1H NMR shows six signals. Let's see what each part tells us. 

First, two signals for aromatic-H. So the aromatic ring is di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached. Since there are two signals, each for a set of equivalent protons, the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two different sets of aromatic protons. For a 6-membered ring, like benzene, di-substituted rings can have different substitution patterns. For example, para, ortho, or meta. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in an aromatic ring, if two substituents are in the para positions, the ring is symmetric, so all the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving a single peak. But if they are in the meta positions, maybe it's different. Or maybe it's a 1,2 or 1,3 substitution. Hmm, but wait, the aromatic protons have two signals. So that suggests that the substituents are in positions that create two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are adjacent (ortho), then the ring might have two sets: the protons adjacent to each substituent, and perhaps others. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is at position 1 and the other at position 3 (meta), leading to two different types of aromatic protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents that are not symmetric, leading to two distinct sets of aromatic protons.

Wait, but the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the ring has two substituents. Let's think about the substitution pattern. For example, if it's para-substituted, then all the aromatic protons are equivalent, leading to one peak. But if it's ortho, then maybe the two substituents are adjacent, causing the ring to have two types of protons: those next to the substituents and the others. Or maybe it's meta. Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the substitution affects the NMR signals. Let me think: para substitution would have two substituents opposite each other. Then, the ring would have two equivalent sets of protons, maybe. Or wait, no. For example, if the substituents are both at the para positions, the ring would have four equivalent protons in two sets of two each. Wait, but that might lead to two signals. Because, each substituent is in the para position, so the ring is symmetric. So, for example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (meta), then the ring has two types of H: the ones adjacent to substituents and the ones opposite. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe if the substituents are in positions 1 and 2 (ortho), then the ring has more split signals. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the substitution pattern leading to two aromatic signals. For example, in the case of para-substituted, you might have two equivalent sets of H, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal di-substitution (ortho), leading to two different types of H.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to think about the number of protons in each set. The question says there are two signals for aromatic-H. So each signal corresponds to a set of equivalent protons. So the aromatic ring must have two distinct sets of H, each with the same chemical environment.

So, possible substitution patterns: maybe the substituents are in meta positions, leading to two different sets of H. Or, if the substituents are in adjacent (ortho) positions, which could lead to two distinct sets. Alternatively, perhaps the di-substitution leads to a para arrangement which, for some reason, gives two signals. I'm a bit stuck on this part, but maybe I can move on and see how the other NMR signals fit.

Moving on, the NMR also shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. The description says one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. That suggests that the vinyl groups are in different environments. For example, perhaps one vinyl group is adjacent to an oxygen (like in an ester), and the other is somewhere else. Or maybe the ester group is part of a substituent on the aromatic ring.

Then, two signals for –CH3 groups. And no signals for –CH2. So the molecule must have two methyl groups, and no methylene groups (–CH2–). So the structure has two –CH3 groups, each in a different environment, leading to two separate signals.

Putting this together: the compound is an ester, di-substituted on a benzene ring. The substituents are such that the ring has two types of aromatic protons. Additionally, there are two vinyl groups (maybe as substituents on the ring), each contributing their own signals, and two methyl groups, perhaps as part of the ester groups.

Wait, but let's think about ester structures. An ester would have the structure RCOOR'. So perhaps one substituent is a COOR' group. Then, perhaps the other substituent could be another group, maybe a vinyl group or a methyl group. But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl Hs, which might suggest that there are two different vinyl groups attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the benzene ring are an ester group and a vinyl group, but that might not account for all the signals. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like a COOR group) and the other substituent is a vinyl group, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but the NMR indicates two signals for vinyl-H. So perhaps the substituents are two vinyl groups, but that might not make sense with an ester. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and another substituent is a vinyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents that include an ester group and a vinyl ester group. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The degree of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For C11H12O2: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2= 6. So 6 degrees: 1 ring (benzene) and 2 double bonds or rings. But benzene is 3 double bonds. Wait, no. Each ring or double bond is one degree. So a benzene ring (3 degrees), an ester (which has a double bond, 1 degree), and perhaps a double bond from a vinyl group (another degree). Hmm, 3+1+1=5. Wait, but 6 degrees. So maybe another ring or a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure includes an ester group, a benzene ring, and a vinyl group, which would account for 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester double bond) +1 (vinyl) =5. So for C11H12O2, 6 degrees would mean another double bond or ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the benzene are an ester and a vinyl group. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and another group. But I'm not getting it yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are two ester groups or one ester and another group that contributes to the NMR signals.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. Two signals for vinyl-H. So, perhaps two different vinyl groups, each with their own environment.

Wait, what if the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester (like O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-). But then, the vinyl group would have protons split in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group (like O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group. But then, the vinyl group would have its own protons.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and another doublet of quartets. Hmm. So perhaps one vinyl group is adjacent to another group, causing the doublet, and the other is in a different environment.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are two ester groups, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents on the benzene are an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and another group that has a vinyl structure, like a CH2CH2 group? No, that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group and another group that has a vinyl structure. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The presence of an ester group (O2) is confirmed. So all options have two oxygen atoms.

Now, the molecular formula must reflect the structure. Let's think about the groups.

The ester group is RCOOR', which contributes to the formula. So for RCOOR', the formula is (R is an alkyl group) CnH2n+1COOCH2m+1. So perhaps the substituents on the benzene are an ester and another group.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is an ester group, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl signals, so maybe the substituents include a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a group with a vinyl group and a methyl ester group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are two different ester groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group, which would have the vinyl protons.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl signals. So perhaps each substituent contributes a vinyl group. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group that has a vinyl group attached to it. For example, a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO-. But then, that's part of the substituent, which is attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group, leading to a structure like benzene with O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't include a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. Then, the vinyl protons would be from the CH2=CH- group.

So, in that case, the substituent would be a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the structure would be benzene with an ester substituent that has a vinyl group (like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the ring). Then, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH- part.

In such a case, the two vinyl protons (the two CH2=CH- groups) would split into specific signals.

But wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. So perhaps there are two different vinyl groups. Hmm, but if the substituent is a single vinyl ester, then it would have two protons on the CH2=CH- part. How would that split the signal? Let me think.

In the vinyl ester group, the structure is CH2=CHCOOR. The CH2=CH- group has two protons. In the NMR, depending on the neighboring groups, these would split. For example, the CH2=CH- group would have a coupling with each other, leading to a doublet. But wait, in the presence of adjacent substituents, maybe.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH2COOR, but that's not possible because that would be a single bond, not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group. But then, the vinyl would have protons that couple with each other, leading to specific splitting patterns.

The NMR shows two vinyl signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the benzene has two substituents, each containing a vinyl group. But that's unlikely because the question says di-substituted. Oh, wait, the benzene is di-substituted, so each substituent may have their own vinyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group and the other is an ester group. So, for example, one substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the ring, and the other substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R).

In that case, the vinyl group would have protons that might split into a certain pattern. But wait, if the substituents are in the meta positions, perhaps the coupling between the two vinyl groups would cause more splitting, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the vinyl-H signals in the NMR show one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each vinyl group is adjacent to another group with protons, causing the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps one vinyl group is part of an ester substituent (like CH2=CHCOOR) and another substituent is a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both vinyl groups attached to the ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) attached, each in different positions. Then, the vinyl group would have two protons, each in a different environment, leading to two signals.

Wait, but if the substituents are para, then the vinyl group might have equivalent protons, but that doesn't fit with the two signals. So maybe the substituents are in the meta or ortho positions, leading to two different environments for the vinyl-H.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of protons each signal corresponds to.

The NMR has six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3.

Each aromatic signal's integration would tell me how many H's are in each set. But since the question doesn't provide integration values, perhaps we can't use that. So I have to rely on the splitting patterns and the number of signals.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So the molecule has two methyl groups, each in different environments. For example, maybe one is part of an ester group (like O-CO-OCH3), and the other is a methyl group attached to another part, like a substituent.

Wait, but in an ester, the R' is usually an alkyl group. So, for example, if the substituent is an ester group O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, then the CH3 would be at the end of a chain, and perhaps that would give a singlet. But in this case, the NMR has two methyl signals. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps one methyl group is part of an ester (like O-CO-OCH3), and another methyl group is attached elsewhere, like to a vinyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible structures that fit the given NMR.

The presence of an ester implies an O-CO-O group. So the molecule must have that. The di-substituted benzene ring would have two groups attached. One of them is likely the ester group. The other substituent could be another group that includes a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl ester (like CH2=CHCOO-) and the other is a methyl group. Then, the methyl would show up as a singlet, but the question says two methyl signals. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). Then, the ester group's R could be a methyl group, and the vinyl group's adjacent structure would cause splitting.

Wait, but then the ester group would be O-CO-OCH3, which would give a singlet for the methyl. But the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So perhaps there's another methyl group elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH3, but that would be a CH2 group, which the NMR says is absent. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with two CH3 groups, but that would require more than two substituents, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group. But that would have a CH(CH3)2 structure, leading to a singlet for the CH3 groups, but again, the NMR shows two CH3 signals.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the substituents are both ester groups, but that seems unlikely for a di-substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group, and each substituent has a methyl group.

Wait, for example, the substituents could be an ester group (like O-CO-OCH2CH3) and a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. But then, the CH3 in the ester would be a triplet (from the CH2), but the CH3 in the vinyl group would be a triplet as well from the vinyl's CH2. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a propenyl group, which includes a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like this: the benzene has two substituents. One is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3), and the other is a vinyl group attached to another substituent, such as CH2=CH- group.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again about the possible NMR signals.

The aromatic protons: two signals. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions. Then, the protons adjacent to the substituents would be equivalent, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the substituents are in meta positions, perhaps each substituent causes a different environment for the adjacent H's.

The vinyl protons: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. So, perhaps one vinyl proton is adjacent to another proton (causing a doublet), and the other is adjacent to two different protons, leading to a quartet. Or maybe the coupling is with more than one proton.

Wait, a vinyl group's protons are usually a pair that are coupled with each other, leading to a doublet. But if one of those protons is also coupled with another group, like a substituent, that could split into a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps each vinyl group is in a different environment, leading to different splitting patterns.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, which would have a structure like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. Then, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH- part.

In such a case, the CH2=CH- group's protons would each couple with each other. The trans coupling would result in a doublet. But if the substituent is attached in a position that causes one of the protons to be adjacent to another group, that might change the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinyl protons is adjacent to an oxygen, causing a different splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, such as CH2=CHCOO- attached to the ring. Then, the CH2=CH- part would have two protons that are coupled, leading to a doublet. But then, where does the doublet of quartets come from?

Hmm.

Another thought: the two substituents on the benzene are an ester group and another group that includes a vinyl group and a methyl group. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (so the ester is ethyl or propyl), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3. But in this case, the vinyl group's protons would be part of a CH2=CH-CH3 structure. The protons on the CH2=CH- would split into a certain pattern.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl signals. So perhaps each substituent contributes a vinyl group, but that might not be the case since it's a di-substituted ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So, the structure would be something like benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3 (that's an ethyl ester), but that doesn't have a vinyl group. Alternatively, benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (a propyl ester), but that also doesn't include vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but again, not a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Then, the CH2-CH=CH2 would have vinyl protons. So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Then, the CH=CH2 group would have two protons, which are on the CH2 and CH= parts.

In such a case, the vinyl protons (on CH=CH2) would be split based on their neighboring groups. The CH2 group would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH= group.

Wait, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not a vinyl. Oh wait, I meant benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In that case, the vinyl group is CH=CH2, attached via a CH2 group to the ester oxygen. So, the CH2 group is between the ester and the vinyl.

In such a scenario, the vinyl protons (on CH=CH2) would be as follows: the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have two protons.

Wait, but the vinyl group is CH=CH2, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, perhaps it's CH2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In that case, the CH2 group is adjacent to the CH=CH2. So the vinyl protons would be on the CH=CH2. Let's think about their NMR signals.

The CH2 group (CH2-O-CO-O-) would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH=CH2 group. The CH2 protons would be next to a CH that's part of a double bond, leading to coupling.

Wait, but the vinyl group in the substituent would be CH2-CH=CH2. So the protons on the CH= would be adjacent to the CH2, leading to possible splitting.

But I'm not entirely sure how that would translate into the NMR signals. Let's think about the structure O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. The CH2 is between the ester and the vinyl. So the CH2's protons would be split by the vinyl protons. The vinyl protons (on CH=CH2) would each be split by the adjacent CH2 and any other neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl ester and doesn't include a vinyl group, so that wouldn't explain the NMR data.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the molecular formula.

Let's consider the options:

Option A) C11H14O2
Option B) C12H14O2
Option C) C12H12O2
Option D) C11H12O2

Each one has a different number of carbons and hydrogens.

The ester group contributes (COOR) groups, which have O2.

The benzene ring has 6 carbons, but the substituents add more.

Wait, wait, the benzene is part of the molecule, so the substituents add R and R' groups.

So the formula would be C6H4 (from benzene) + R + R', where each R and R' are substituent groups.

The total formula would be C(6 + a + b) H(4 + 2a' + 2b') O2, depending on what R and R' are.

Wait, but benzene is C6H6. When two substituents are added, each substituent replaces a hydrogen. So the formula would be C6H4 (if two substituents are added). But each substituent can add more carbons and hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps each substituent has a certain number of carbons and hydrogens.

For example, if one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. Let's say R is methyl (CH3), then the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is -O-CO-OCH3. That substituent contributes 3 carbons (from O-CO-OCH3) and has 3 oxygen atoms? Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O, so the substituent is O-CO-O-R. So R is, say, methyl: then substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 carbons (2 from COO and 1 from CH3).

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene as O-CO-O-R, which would add (for R=CH3) 3 carbons (the ester group and the methyl). So the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3, adding 3 carbons and 3 oxygens. Wait, but the overall formula would have O2. So perhaps the other substituent doesn't have any oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- attached to another group. For example, if the substituent is CH2=CHCH3, that would be a propene group attached to the benzene.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

Let me try to calculate for each option.

Option D: C11H12O2. Benzene is 6 carbons. So substituents add 5 carbons. Oxygen is 2.

So substituents contribute 5 C, and 2 O (the ester).

The benzene has 6 C, substituents add 5 C, so total 11 C. That fits option D.

But how?

Wait, the substituents would be two groups on the benzene. Let's say substituent 1 is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, and substituent 2 is another group, say, a vinyl group with a methyl group.

For substituent 1: O-CO-O-R. Let’s say R is methyl (CH3). So substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 C (O-CO-OCH3: 3 C's from the ester group).

Substituent 2: perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3. Wait, that's a propene group (CH2=CHCH3) attached as a substituent. So substituent 2 would have 3 C's (CH2=CHCH3).

So substituent 1: 3 C; substituent 2: 3 C. Total substituents: 6 C. Benzene is 6 C, so total C would be 6 + 6 =12, but option D is C11. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be just a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), but that would add 2 C's. So substituent 1 (ester) adds 3 C, substituent 2 (vinyl) adds 2 C. Total substituent C:5. Benzene is 6. Total C:11. That fits option D (C11H12O2).

So, substituents would be O-CO-OCH3 (ester) and CH2=CH2 (vinyl). But wait, CH2=CH2 is ethylene, which is a substituent that's a vinyl group (CH2=CH- attached to the ring). But then, the substituent would be CH2=CH-.

Wait, but that's a substituent with two C's. So substituent 1 (ester) is 3 C, substituent 2 (vinyl) is 2 C. So total substituents:5, benzene 6, total C:11. That fits.

Now, the hydrogen count.

Benzene has 6 H. When two substituents are added, each replacing a H. So 6-2=4 H from the ring.

Ester substituent (O-CO-OCH3): the methyl group contributes 3 H, and the ester oxygen is attached to the ring. The substituent itself doesn't add any H beyond the methyl.

Vinyl substituent (CH2=CH-): this group has 2 H (the CH2 and CH groups). Wait, CH2=CH- is a substituent attached to the ring, so the structure would be benzene-CH2=CH-? No, that would be a substituent with a double bond attached to the ring. Wait, more accurately, it would be benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. No, for a vinyl substituent, it's benzene-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, perhaps it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't include a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached as CH2=CH-.

Wait, the substituent would be attached at the benzene ring as CH2=CH-. So the substituent is CH2=CH-, which is a vinyl group with two C's and two H's (the CH2 and CH groups). But that would leave the substituent as CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that would be a substituent with two C and two H. So total H from substituents would be methyl (3 H) + vinyl substituent (2 H) =5 H. Plus the 4 H from the ring. So total H would be 4 +5 =9. But the option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2=CHCH3 group. So substituent 2 is a propene group (three C's, three H's? Let's see: CH2=CHCH3 has 6 H's? No, wait, CH2=CHCH3 has 6 H's: CH2 (2 H), CH (2 H), and CH3 (3 H). Wait, no: each CH2 would have 2 H, each CH has 1 H, and CH3 has 3 H. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH3. So in total, the substituent has 2 (from CH2) +1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) =6 H? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH3. Each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H. So total H is 2 +1 +3 =6. Plus, the substituent is attached to the benzene as a single bond, so the H attached to the benzene is not part of the substituent's structure. So substituent 2 has 6 H.

Substituent 1 (ester) is O-CO-OCH3. The methyl group has 3 H.

So substituent H's: 6 (from substituent 2) +3 (from substituent 1) =9.

Benzene ring H's: 6 -2 (since two substituents) =4.

Total H: 4 +9 =13. But option D has 12 H. Hmm, that's one over. Not sure if this approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with only one substituent, like CH2=CH2, which has two C's and two H's (each CH2). So substituent 2 would have 4 H's: each CH2 has 2 H. Then substituent 1 (ester) has 3 H (methyl). So substituent H's: 3 +4=7. Benzene ring H's: 4. Total H:11. But option D is H12. So that's one less than needed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. Like CH2=CHCH3, but that seems to complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to the ring, but that would mean the substituent is a methyl group, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so that would fit. But then, where does the vinyl group come from?

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is an ester group, and substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. So substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3. So substituent 2 contributes three C's and six H's. Substituent 1 (ester) contributes three C's and three H's. So substituents contribute 6 C's and 9 H's. Benzene has 6 C's and 4 H's (since two substituents). So total C:6 +6=12. Wait, but the formula options for C12 are options B and C.

But substituents contribute 6 C's. Benzene is 6, so total C is 12. So the formula would be C12H (4 +9=13?) plus any H's from the substituents. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me calculate this properly.

Molecular formula: benzene (C6H6) plus substituents.

Each substituent replaces a H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (ester). This has a formula of O-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. Which is (O2) and (CH3). So the substituent adds 3 C (COOCH3), and 3 O.

Wait, but the overall formula of the compound is C11H12O2 or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then substituent 1 adds 3 C (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and 5 H (the ethyl group: CH2CH3 has 5 H? No, ethyl is CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H's.

Substituent 2: perhaps a vinyl group with a methyl group attached, like CH2=CHCH3. That would be 3 C and 6 H.

So substituents contribute C:3 (ester) +3 (vinyl methyl group) =6 C. Benzene is 6 C → total 12 C.

Hydrogens: benzene has 6-2=4 H. Substituent 1: ethyl ester has 5 H in the ethyl group. Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH3 has 6 H. So substituents contribute 5+6=11 H. Total H:4 +11=15. But the formula options have H counts like 12, 14, etc. So 15 isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group without any additional substituents, like CH2=CH-. So substituent 2 contributes 2 C and 2 H (each CH2 has 2 H? No, CH2=CH- would have 2 H (from CH2) and 1 H (from CH), but that's attached to the ring, so perhaps it's CH2=CH-R, where R is the benzene.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula another way.

The formula options are:

A) C11H14O2: degree of unsaturation (DoU) = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

B) C12H14O2: DoU=(2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6.

C) C12H12O2: (2*12 +2 -12)/2=(26-12)/2=7.

D) C11H12O2: DoU=(2*11 +2 -12)/2=(24-12)/2=6.

The benzene ring provides 3 DoU (as it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds).

The ester group contributes one DoU (the double bond in the carbonyl).

So benzene (3) + ester (1) =4 DoU. The total DoU for the compound should be 4 plus any other rings or double bonds.

Looking at the options:

Option A: DoU=5 → 4 from benzene and ester, leaving 1 more DoU. Which could be a double bond.

Option B: DoU=6 → 4 from benzene and ester, leaving 2 more DoU. Could be two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: DoU=7 → 3 more DoU.

Option D: DoU=6 → 2 more DoU.

Hmm.

In the NMR, there are two vinyl groups (two signals for vinyl H). So that suggests two double bonds (from the vinyl groups). Each vinyl group is a double bond, contributing 1 DoU each. So that's 2 more DoU. So total DoU would be benzene (3) + ester (1) + 2 (vinyl) =6. So the total DoU should be 6.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: DoU=6 → this would fit.

Option D: DoU=6 → also fits.

Hmm, so options B and D have 6 DoU.

So the correct molecular formula is either B or D.

Now, looking at the molecular formula.

If option B is C12H14O2, and D is C11H12O2.

Which one fits with the NMR data?

The NMR shows six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3.

Assuming the structure has a benzene ring (6 C), two substituents which include an ester and a vinyl group with methyl groups.

So the substituents would add more C and H.

Let's think about option B: C12H14O2.

Benzene (6 C) + substituents adding 6 C → 6+6=12.

The substituents would be an ester and a vinyl group with a methyl group.

Ester substituent: O-CO-O-R. Let's say R is ethyl (CH2CH3), which adds 2 C and 5 H (CH2CH3). Then, substituent 1 contributes 3 C (COO) + 2 C (ethyl) =5 C? Wait, COO is two O's, but the substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. So that's substituent 1: 3 C (COO) + 2 C (ethyl) =5 C. But benzene is 6 C, so substituent 2 would have to add 1 C. Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3, which contributes 3 C.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH3 → 5 C (COO is 2 C, OCH2CH3 is 3 C → total 5 C). Substituent 2: vinyl group attached as CH2=CHCH3 → adds 3 C. So total substituents:5+3=8 C. Benzene:6 → total 14 C, which is more than option B's 12. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester) → substituent 1 has 4 C (COO plus 3 C from propyl). Substituent 2: a methyl group attached to a vinyl, like CH2=CHCH3 → substituent 2 has 3 C. So substituents add 4 +3=7 C. Benzene 6 → total 13 C. But option B is 12 C. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) → which contributes 3 C (COO and CH3). Substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached as CH2=CH2 → which contributes 2 C. So substituents add 3+2=5 C. Benzene:6 → total 11 C. But option B is 12 C. So that's not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) → substituent 1 adds 3 C (COO) + 2 C (ethyl) =5 C. Substituent 2 is a methyl group (CH3) → adds 1 C. So substituents add 5 +1=6 C. Benzene:6 → total 12 C. That fits option B (C12H14O2). 

Now, let's calculate the H count.

Benzene has 6 H. Two substituents replace two H's → 4 H left.

Substituent 1 (ethyl ester): O-CO-OCH2CH3 → the ethyl group contributes 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H's? No, CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H's. So substituent 1 adds 5 H.

Substituent 2 (methyl group): CH3 → 3 H.

So substituent H's:5 +3=8. Benzene H's:4. Total H:4+8=12. But option B is C12H14O2, which has 14 H. So that's two H short.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl. Let me think again.

Wait, substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to the ring, like CH2=CH-.

So substituent 2 is CH2=CH- → adds 2 C and 3 H? Wait, CH2=CH- attached to the ring would have 2 H on the CH2 and 1 H on the CH (since the CH is bonded to the ring). So substituent 2 contributes 3 H.

Substituent 1 (ethyl ester): 5 H. So substituent H's:5+3=8. Benzene H's:4 → total 12 H. But option B is C12H14O2 → 14 H. So still two H's missing.

Wait, maybe the substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl attached, like CH2=CHCH3. So substituent 2 would add 3 C, 6 H. Substituent 1 (ethyl ester) adds 5 H. So substituent H's:5+6=11. Benzene H's:4 → total 15 H. But option B is C12H14O2 (14 H). So that's one H over.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group without any substituents. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH- → which adds 3 H (2 from CH2, 1 from CH).

Substituent 1 (ethyl ester): 5 H.

Substituent H's:5+3=8. Benzene H's:4 → 12 H. But option B requires 14 H. So where are the missing two H's?

Wait, perhaps the substituents have more H's. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a CH2CH3 group attached. So substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2CH3. That would add 4 C and 8 H. Substituent 1 (ethyl ester):5 H. Substituent H's:5+8=13. Benzene H's:4 → 17 H. But that's way over option B's 14.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), which contributes 3 H. Substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl (CH2=CHCH3), which contributes 6 H. So substituent H's:3+6=9. Benzene H's:4 → 13 H. Option B is 14, so still one H missing.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a CH2 group, like CH2=CHCH2-. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3 → 3 H), and substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to another methyl, like CH2=CHCH3 (which contributes 6 H). Substituent H's: 3+6=9. Benzene H's:4 → 13 H. Still one short of option B's 14 H.

Hmm.

Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

The correct answer must have 12 C (options B and C) or 11 C (A and D). The DoU fits B and D.

Wait, the correct formula must have 12 C because the substituents include more than 6 C.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is an ethyl ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3), which is 5 C (COO and ethyl). Substituent 2 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), which is 2 C. So substituents add 5+2=7 C. Benzene is 6 → total 13 C. But none of the options have 13 C.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3. That's 3 C. Substituent 1 is a methyl ester (3 C). So substituents add 3+3=6 C. Benzene is 6 → total 12 C. That fits option B (C12H14O2).

Now, H count:

Benzene:6 → 6-2=4 H.

Substituent 1: methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) → 3 H.

Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH3 → 6 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H).

So substituent H's:3 +6=9. Total H:4+9=13. But option B is C12H14O2 (14 H). So one H missing.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Then substituent 2 contributes 4 C and 8 H. Substituent 1 contributes 3 C and 3 H. Benzene H's:4. Total C:6+3+4=13 → not in the options. H would be 4+3+8=15 → option B has 14, so one H too many.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible structure.

The structure is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and a vinyl group. Let's say substituent 1 is an ester (O-CO-O-R) and substituent 2 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

The substituent 2 would have two H on the CH2 and one H on the CH. So substituent 2 contributes 3 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) → 5 C, 5 H.

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- → 2 C, 3 H.

So substituents contribute 5+3=8 H. Benzene contributes 4 H → total 12 H.

But option B has 14 H. So we're missing 2 H. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to another CH2 group. For example, substituent 2 is CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. So substituent 2 is 3 C and 6 H.

So substituent 1 (ethyl ester) contributes 5 H, substituent 2 contributes 6 H. Substituents total 11 H. Benzene 4 → total 15 H. But option B is 14 H. So one H over.

Hmm. I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should think differently.

Another approach: The NMR shows two CH3 groups. So the structure must have two methyl groups.

Each methyl group would contribute 3 H. So two methyl groups → 6 H.

The substituent groups: one is an ester (R-O-CO-O-R'), and the other is a vinyl group.

So, substituent 1: ester group with a methyl (O-CO-OCH3) → contributes 3 H.

Substituent 2: a vinyl group attached to another methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3 → contributes 3 H (from CH3).

So substituent H's:3 (ester) +3 (vinyl methyl) =6 H.

The ring: 4 H.

Other substituents: perhaps the ester's R' is a methyl, and the vinyl substituent's R is a methyl.

So substituents contribute 3 (ester methyl) +6 (vinyl methyl's group) H.

Wait, no. The vinyl substituent (CH2=CHCH3) contributes 6 H (as earlier). Ester substituent (O-CO-OCH3) contributes 3 H.

So substituent H's:6+3=9. Ring H's:4. Total H:13. But option B is 14, which is one more H.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the vinyl substituent is a CH2=CH- group, which contributes 3 H. So substituent H's:3 (ester) +3 (vinyl) =6. Ring H's:4. Total 10 H. That's way under option B's 14.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the NMR shows that there are two signals for –CH3 groups. So the molecule has two methyl groups, each in different environments.

So substituent 1 must have a methyl group (like O-CO-OCH3), and substituent 2 must have another methyl group (like CH3 attached to something else).

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 → 3 H.

Substituent 2: perhaps a propenyl group with a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3 → 3 H from the CH3.

So substituents contribute 3+3=6 H.

The ring contributes 4 H.

Other H's come from the vinyl groups. The vinyl groups have two signals.

Wait, vinyl groups would have H's. The substituent 2 (CH2=CHCH3) has two CH2 groups: the CH2= and the CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the substituent is CH2=CHCH3. So the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to CH3.

So the two vinyl protons are on the CH2=CH- part. So the H on CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH, leading to a certain pattern.

In the NMR, the vinyl signals are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So one of the vinyl protons is coupled with another proton, and the other is coupled with two different sets, leading to a quartet.

Alternatively, each vinyl proton is coupled with the other, but in different ways due to substituents.

But I'm not sure. 

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The molecular formula must have 12 C (options B and C) or 11 C (A and D).

The DoU is 6, fitting options B and D.

Looking at the options, option B is C12H14O2, which has 12 C and 14 H.

If the substituents contribute 6 C (each substituent adding 3 C), then benzene is 6 → total 12 C.

Hydrogen count: substituent 1 (ester) contributes 3 H (methyl), substituent 2 contributes 6 H (vinyl methyl group), and the ring contributes 4 H. Total H:3+6+4=13. But option B has 14 H. So where's the missing H?

Ah, perhaps the substituent has more H's. Maybe substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl, which has more H's.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with two methyl groups, but that doesn't fit the NMR showing two CH3 signals.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a CH2CH3 group, which would add more H's.

Wait, substituent 2 could be CH2=CHCH2CH3. That's a four-carbon substituent. So substituent 2 adds 4 C and 8 H.

Substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

So substituents add 3+4=7 C. Benzene is 6 → total 13 C → not matching any option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2=CH-O-R group. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to the ring, and substituent 1 is an ester with a vinyl group.

Wait, substituent 2 is CH3 attached to the ring. So substituent 2 contributes 1 C and 3 H.

Substituent 1 is an ester with a vinyl group, like O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2. Then substituent 1 adds 5 C (O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2) and 5 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H, CH2 has 2 H).

So substituent H's: substituent 1 has 5 H, substituent 2 has 3 H. Total substituent H's:8. Benzene H's:4. Total H:12.

But option B is C12H14O2 → 14 H. So still two H's short.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 has more H's. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a propyl ester with a vinyl group.

I'm getting stuck. Given the time, I'll have to make a choice.

The correct answer is likely option B) C12H14O2.

But wait, why? Let me think about the molecular formula again.

If the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and the other is a vinyl group (CH2=CHCH3).

Ester substituent: adds 5 C (COO plus ethyl) and 5 H (ethyl's H).

Vinyl substituent: adds 3 C and 6 H.

So substituents:5+3=8 C. Benzene:6 → total 14 C? No, that can't be. Wait, no, benzene is 6 C, substituents add 8 C → 14 C, but the formula options don't have that. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H), substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3 (3 C, 6 H). So substituents add 6 C → benzene 6 +6=12 C. That fits option B.

H count: substituent 1:3 H, substituent 2:6 H. Ring:4 H. Total H:3+6+4=13. But option B has 14 H → one more H needed.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2CH3 (but that's 4 C, 8 H). Substituent 1:3 C,3 H. Substituents:7 C → benzene 6 → 13 C → no option.

Hmm.

Another possibility: substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester). That's 4 C (COO and propyl) and 5 H (propyl group).

Substituent 2 is CH2=CH2 → 2 C, 2 H.

So substituents add 4+2=6 C. Benzene 6 → 12 C → option B or C.

H count: substituent 1:5 H, substituent 2:2 H. Ring:4 H. Total:11 H. But option B has 14 H → 3 H missing.

This isn't working.

Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D) C11H12O2.

But why?

Wait, option D is C11H12O2.

DoU is 6 → which fits with the data.

The substituents would be 5 C (since benzene is 6 C, 6+5=11).

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C,3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH3 (3 C,6 H).

So substituents add 3+3=6 C, which is 6+6=12 → no, doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group (CH3) → 1 C, 3 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH3 → 5 C,5 H.

So substituents:5+1=6 C. Benzene:6 → 12 C, which doesn't fit D (11 C).

Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with option A) C11H14O2. Wait, no, because DoU is 5.

No, the correct DoU is 6. So options B and D.

In the end, I think the correct answer is option D) C11H12O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The IR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, while the NMR spectrum provides the following details:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals, suggesting two distinct sets of aromatic protons. This implies that the substituents on the benzene ring are in positions that create two different environments for the aromatic protons (e.g., meta or ortho substitution).
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. This indicates two vinyl groups in different environments, with coupling patterns consistent with vinyl protons.
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals, indicating two distinct methyl groups in different environments, with no signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups.

### Key Analysis of the Molecular Formula Options:
The molecular formula options are:
- **A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂**
- **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂**
- **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂**
- **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂**

#### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):
The DoU is calculated as:
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
\]
- **A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 5
- **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 6
- **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 7
- **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6

The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, and the ester group contributes 1 DoU. The NMR data suggests two vinyl groups, adding 2 DoU, for a total of 6 DoU. This matches options **B** and **D**.

#### Molecular Formula Fits:
1. **Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**:
   - Benzene contributes 6 carbons.
   - Substituents must add 6 carbons. A plausible structure includes an ester group (e.g., O-CO-OCH₃) and a vinyl group with a methyl group (e.g., CH₂=CHCH₃). This accounts for all 12 carbons.
   - Hydrogen count: Benzene contributes 4 hydrogens (after substituents replace 2 hydrogens). The ester group contributes 3 hydrogens (from the methyl group), and the vinyl group contributes 6 hydrogens (from CH₂=CHCH₃). Total hydrogens = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13. However, the formula requires 14 hydrogens, leaving one hydrogen unaccounted for.

2. **Option D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**:
   - Benzene contributes 6 carbons.
   - Substituents must add 5 carbons. A plausible structure includes an ester group (e.g., O-CO-OCH₃) and a vinyl group (e.g., CH₂=CH-). This accounts for all 11 carbons.
   - Hydrogen count: Benzene contributes 4 hydrogens. The ester group contributes 3 hydrogens (from the methyl group), and the vinyl group contributes 3 hydrogens (from CH₂=CH-). Total hydrogens = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10. However, the formula requires 12 hydrogens, leaving 2 hydrogens unaccounted for.

#### Conclusion:
Both options **B** and **D** have inconsistencies in the hydrogen count based on the proposed structures. However, the NMR data and the requirement for two distinct methyl groups and two vinyl groups suggest that **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** (option **D**) is the most plausible formula, as it aligns better with the substitution pattern and the absence of methylene groups.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. Hmm.

Alright, first, the IR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters typically have strong absorption around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹, right? So that confirms the presence of an ester, which means the molecule has an -O-CO-O- group or something like that. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are like RCOOR'. So in the structure, there's an ester functional group.

Next, the NMR information. The 1H NMR shows six signals. Let's see what each part tells us. 

First, two signals for aromatic-H. So the aromatic ring is di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached. Since there are two signals, each for a set of equivalent protons, the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two different sets of aromatic protons. For a 6-membered ring, like benzene, di-substituted rings can have different substitution patterns. For example, para, ortho, or meta. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in an aromatic ring, if two substituents are in the para positions, the ring is symmetric, so all the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving a single peak. But if they are in the meta positions, maybe it's different. Or maybe it's a 1,2 or 1,3 substitution. Hmm, but wait, the aromatic protons have two signals. So that suggests that the substituents are in positions that create two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are adjacent (ortho), then the ring might have two sets: the protons adjacent to each substituent, and perhaps others. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is at position 1 and the other at position 3 (meta), leading to two different types of aromatic protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents that are not symmetric, leading to two distinct sets of aromatic protons.

Wait, but the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the ring has two substituents. Let's think about the substitution pattern. For example, if it's para-substituted, then all the aromatic protons are equivalent, leading to one peak. But if it's ortho, then maybe the two substituents are adjacent, causing the ring to have two types of protons: those next to the substituents and the others. Or maybe it's meta. Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the substitution affects the NMR signals. Let me think: para substitution would have two substituents opposite each other. Then, the ring would have two equivalent sets of protons, maybe. Or wait, no. For example, if the substituents are both at the para positions, the ring would have four equivalent protons in two sets of two each. Wait, but that might lead to two signals. Because, each substituent is in the para position, so the ring is symmetric. So, for example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (meta), then the ring has two types of H: the ones adjacent to substituents and the ones opposite. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe if the substituents are in positions 1 and 2 (ortho), then the ring has more split signals. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the substitution pattern leading to two aromatic signals. For example, in the case of para-substituted, you might have two equivalent sets of H, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal di-substitution (ortho), leading to two different types of H.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to think about the number of protons in each set. The question says there are two signals for aromatic-H. So each signal corresponds to a set of equivalent protons. So the aromatic ring must have two distinct sets of H, each with the same chemical environment.

So, possible substitution patterns: maybe the substituents are in meta positions, leading to two different sets of H. Or, if the substituents are in adjacent (ortho) positions, which could lead to two distinct sets. Alternatively, perhaps the di-substitution leads to a para arrangement which, for some reason, gives two signals. I'm a bit stuck on this part, but maybe I can move on and see how the other NMR signals fit.

Moving on, the NMR also shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. The description says one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. That suggests that the vinyl groups are in different environments. For example, perhaps one vinyl group is adjacent to an oxygen (like in an ester), and the other is somewhere else. Or maybe the ester group is part of a substituent on the aromatic ring.

Then, two signals for –CH3 groups. And no signals for –CH2. So the molecule must have two methyl groups, and no methylene groups (–CH2–). So the structure has two –CH3 groups, each in a different environment, leading to two separate signals.

Putting this together: the compound is an ester, di-substituted on a benzene ring. The substituents are such that the ring has two types of aromatic protons. Additionally, there are two vinyl groups (maybe as substituents on the ring), each contributing their own signals, and two methyl groups, perhaps as part of the ester groups.

Wait, but let's think about ester structures. An ester would have the structure RCOOR'. So perhaps one substituent is a COOR' group. Then, perhaps the other substituent could be another group, maybe a vinyl group or a methyl group. But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl Hs, which might suggest that there are two different vinyl groups attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the benzene ring are an ester group and a vinyl group, but that might not account for all the signals. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like a COOR group) and the other substituent is a vinyl group, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but the NMR indicates two signals for vinyl-H. So perhaps the substituents are two vinyl groups, but that might not make sense with an ester. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and another substituent is a vinyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents that include an ester group and a vinyl ester group. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The degree of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For C11H12O2: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2= 6. So 6 degrees: 1 ring (benzene) and 2 double bonds or rings. But benzene is 3 double bonds. Wait, no. Each ring or double bond is one degree. So a benzene ring (3 degrees), an ester (which has a double bond, 1 degree), and perhaps a double bond from a vinyl group (another degree). Hmm, 3+1+1=5. Wait, but 6 degrees. So maybe another ring or a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure includes an ester group, a benzene ring, and a vinyl group, which would account for 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester double bond) +1 (vinyl) =5. So for C11H12O2, 6 degrees would mean another double bond or ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the benzene are an ester and a vinyl group. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and another group. But I'm not getting it yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are two ester groups or one ester and another group that contributes to the NMR signals.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. Two signals for vinyl-H. So, perhaps two different vinyl groups, each with their own environment.

Wait, what if the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester (like O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-). But then, the vinyl group would have protons split in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group (like O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group. But then, the vinyl group would have its own protons.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and another doublet of quartets. Hmm. So perhaps one vinyl group is adjacent to another group, causing the doublet, and the other is in a different environment.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are two ester groups, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents on the benzene are an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and another group that has a vinyl structure, like a CH2CH2 group? No, that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group and another group that has a vinyl structure. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The presence of an ester group (O2) is confirmed. So all options have two oxygen atoms.

Now, the molecular formula must reflect the structure. Let's think about the groups.

The ester group is RCOOR', which contributes to the formula. So for RCOOR', the formula is (R is an alkyl group) CnH2n+1COOCH2m+1. So perhaps the substituents on the benzene are an ester and another group.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is an ester group, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl signals, so maybe the substituents include a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a group with a vinyl group and a methyl ester group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are two different ester groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group, which would have the vinyl protons.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl signals. So perhaps each substituent contributes a vinyl group. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group that has a vinyl group attached to it. For example, a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO-. But then, that's part of the substituent, which is attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group, leading to a structure like benzene with O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't include a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. Then, the vinyl protons would be from the CH2=CH- group.

So, in that case, the substituent would be a vinyl group attached to the ester. So the structure would be benzene with an ester substituent that has a vinyl group (like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the ring). Then, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH- part.

In such a case, the two vinyl protons (the two CH2=CH- groups) would split into specific signals.

But wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. So perhaps there are two different vinyl groups. Hmm, but if the substituent is a single vinyl ester, then it would have two protons on the CH2=CH- part. How would that split the signal? Let me think.

In the vinyl ester group, the structure is CH2=CHCOOR. The CH2=CH- group has two protons. In the NMR, depending on the neighboring groups, these would split. For example, the CH2=CH- group would have a coupling with each other, leading to a doublet. But wait, in the presence of adjacent substituents, maybe.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH2COOR, but that's not possible because that would be a single bond, not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group. But then, the vinyl would have protons that couple with each other, leading to specific splitting patterns.

The NMR shows two vinyl signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the benzene has two substituents, each containing a vinyl group. But that's unlikely because the question says di-substituted. Oh, wait, the benzene is di-substituted, so each substituent may have their own vinyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group and the other is an ester group. So, for example, one substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the ring, and the other substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R).

In that case, the vinyl group would have protons that might split into a certain pattern. But wait, if the substituents are in the meta positions, perhaps the coupling between the two vinyl groups would cause more splitting, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the vinyl-H signals in the NMR show one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each vinyl group is adjacent to another group with protons, causing the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps one vinyl group is part of an ester substituent (like CH2=CHCOOR) and another substituent is a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both vinyl groups attached to the ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) attached, each in different positions. Then, the vinyl group would have two protons, each in a different environment, leading to two signals.

Wait, but if the substituents are para, then the vinyl group might have equivalent protons, but that doesn't fit with the two signals. So maybe the substituents are in the meta or ortho positions, leading to two different environments for the vinyl-H.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of protons each signal corresponds to.

The NMR has six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3.

Each aromatic signal's integration would tell me how many H's are in each set. But since the question doesn't provide integration values, perhaps we can't use that. So I have to rely on the splitting patterns and the number of signals.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So the molecule has two methyl groups, each in different environments. For example, maybe one is part of an ester group (like O-CO-OCH3), and the other is a methyl group attached to another part, like a substituent.

Wait, but in an ester, the R' is usually an alkyl group. So, for example, if the substituent is an ester group O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, then the CH3 would be at the end of a chain, and perhaps that would give a singlet. But in this case, the NMR has two methyl signals. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps one methyl group is part of an ester (like O-CO-OCH3), and another methyl group is attached elsewhere, like to a vinyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible structures that fit the given NMR.

The presence of an ester implies an O-CO-O group. So the molecule must have that. The di-substituted benzene ring would have two groups attached. One of them is likely the ester group. The other substituent could be another group that includes a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl ester (like CH2=CHCOO-) and the other is a methyl group. Then, the methyl would show up as a singlet, but the question says two methyl signals. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). Then, the ester group's R could be a methyl group, and the vinyl group's adjacent structure would cause splitting.

Wait, but then the ester group would be O-CO-OCH3, which would give a singlet for the methyl. But the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So perhaps there's another methyl group elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH3, but that would be a CH2 group, which the NMR says is absent. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with two CH3 groups, but that would require more than two substituents, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group. But that would have a CH(CH3)2 structure, leading to a singlet for the CH3 groups, but again, the NMR shows two CH3 signals.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the substituents are both ester groups, but that seems unlikely for a di-substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group, and each substituent has a methyl group.

Wait, for example, the substituents could be an ester group (like O-CO-OCH2CH3) and a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. But then, the CH3 in the ester would be a triplet (from the CH2), but the CH3 in the vinyl group would be a triplet as well from the vinyl's CH2. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a propenyl group, which includes a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like this: the benzene has two substituents. One is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3), and the other is a vinyl group attached to another substituent, such as CH2=CH- group.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again about the possible NMR signals.

The aromatic protons: two signals. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions. Then, the protons adjacent to the substituents would be equivalent, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the substituents are in meta positions, perhaps each substituent causes a different environment for the adjacent H's.

The vinyl protons: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. So, perhaps one vinyl proton is adjacent to another proton (causing a doublet), and the other is adjacent to two different protons, leading to a quartet. Or maybe the coupling is with more than one proton.

Wait, a vinyl group's protons are usually a pair that are coupled with each other, leading to a doublet. But if one of those protons is also coupled with another group, like a substituent, that could split into a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps each vinyl group is in a different environment, leading to different splitting patterns.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, which would have a structure like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. Then, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH- part.

In such a case, the CH2=CH- group's protons would each couple with each other. The trans coupling would result in a doublet. But if the substituent is attached in a position that causes one of the protons to be adjacent to another group, that might change the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinyl protons is adjacent to an oxygen, causing a different splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, such as CH2=CHCOO- attached to the ring. Then, the CH2=CH- part would have two protons that are coupled, leading to a doublet. But then, where does the doublet of quartets come from?

Hmm.

Another thought: the two substituents on the benzene are an ester group and another group that includes a vinyl group and a methyl group. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (so the ester is ethyl or propyl), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3. But in this case, the vinyl group's protons would be part of a CH2=CH-CH3 structure. The protons on the CH2=CH- would split into a certain pattern.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl signals. So perhaps each substituent contributes a vinyl group, but that might not be the case since it's a di-substituted ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So, the structure would be something like benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3 (that's an ethyl ester), but that doesn't have a vinyl group. Alternatively, benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (a propyl ester), but that also doesn't include vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but again, not a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Then, the CH2-CH=CH2 would have vinyl protons. So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Then, the CH=CH2 group would have two protons, which are on the CH2 and CH= parts.

In such a case, the vinyl protons (on CH=CH2) would be split based on their neighboring groups. The CH2 group would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH= group.

Wait, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not a vinyl. Oh wait, I meant benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In that case, the vinyl group is CH=CH2, attached via a CH2 group to the ester oxygen. So, the CH2 group is between the ester and the vinyl.

In such a scenario, the vinyl protons (on CH=CH2) would be as follows: the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have two protons.

Wait, but the vinyl group is CH=CH2, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, perhaps it's CH2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In that case, the CH2 group is adjacent to the CH=CH2. So the vinyl protons would be on the CH=CH2. Let's think about their NMR signals.

The CH2 group (CH2-O-CO-O-) would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH=CH2 group. The CH2 protons would be next to a CH that's part of a double bond, leading to coupling.

Wait, but the vinyl group in the substituent would be CH2-CH=CH2. So the protons on the CH= would be adjacent to the CH2, leading to possible splitting.

But I'm not entirely sure how that would translate into the NMR signals. Let's think about the structure O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. The CH2 is between the ester and the vinyl. So the CH2's protons would be split by the vinyl protons. The vinyl protons (on CH=CH2) would each be split by the adjacent CH2 and any other neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl ester and doesn't include a vinyl group, so that wouldn't explain the NMR data.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the molecular formula.

Let's consider the options:

Option A) C11H14O2
Option B) C12H14O2
Option C) C12H12O2
Option D) C11H12O2

Each one has a different number of carbons and hydrogens.

The ester group contributes (COOR) groups, which have O2.

The benzene ring has 6 carbons, but the substituents add more.

Wait, wait, the benzene is part of the molecule, so the substituents add R and R' groups.

So the formula would be C6H4 (from benzene) + R + R', where each R and R' are substituent groups.

The total formula would be C(6 + a + b) H(4 + 2a' + 2b') O2, depending on what R and R' are.

Wait, but benzene is C6H6. When two substituents are added, each substituent replaces a hydrogen. So the formula would be C6H4 (if two substituents are added). But each substituent can add more carbons and hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps each substituent has a certain number of carbons and hydrogens.

For example, if one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. Let's say R is methyl (CH3), then the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is -O-CO-OCH3. That substituent contributes 3 carbons (from O-CO-OCH3) and has 3 oxygen atoms? Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O, so the substituent is O-CO-O-R. So R is, say, methyl: then substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 carbons (2 from COO and 1 from CH3).

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene as O-CO-O-R, which would add (for R=CH3) 3 carbons (the ester group and the methyl). So the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3, adding 3 carbons and 3 oxygens. Wait, but the overall formula would have O2. So perhaps the other substituent doesn't have any oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- attached to another group. For example, if the substituent is CH2=CHCH3, that would be a propene group attached to the benzene.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

Let me try to calculate for each option.

Option D: C11H12O2. Benzene is 6 carbons. So substituents add 5 carbons. Oxygen is 2.

So substituents contribute 5 C, and 2 O (the ester).

The benzene has 6 C, substituents add 5 C, so total 11 C. That fits option D.

But how?

Wait, the substituents would be two groups on the benzene. Let's say substituent 1 is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, and substituent 2 is another group, say, a vinyl group with a methyl group.

For substituent 1: O-CO-O-R. Let’s say R is methyl (CH3). So substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 C (O-CO-OCH3: 3 C's from the ester group).

Substituent 2: perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3. Wait, that's a propene group (CH2=CHCH3) attached as a substituent. So substituent 2 would have 3 C's (CH2=CHCH3).

So substituent 1: 3 C; substituent 2: 3 C. Total substituents: 6 C. Benzene is 6 C, so total C would be 6 + 6 =12, but option D is C11. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be just a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), but that would add 2 C's. So substituent 1 (ester) adds 3 C, substituent 2 (vinyl) adds 2 C. Total substituent C:5. Benzene is 6. Total C:11. That fits option D (C11H12O2).

So, substituents would be O-CO-OCH3 (ester) and CH2=CH2 (vinyl). But wait, CH2=CH2 is ethylene, which is a substituent that's a vinyl group (CH2=CH- attached to the ring). But then, the substituent would be CH2=CH-.

Wait, but that's a substituent with two C's. So substituent 1 (ester) is 3 C, substituent 2 (vinyl) is 2 C. So total substituents:5, benzene 6, total C:11. That fits.

Now, the hydrogen count.

Benzene has 6 H. When two substituents are added, each replacing a H. So 6-2=4 H from the ring.

Ester substituent (O-CO-OCH3): the methyl group contributes 3 H, and the ester oxygen is attached to the ring. The substituent itself doesn't add any H beyond the methyl.

Vinyl substituent (CH2=CH-): this group has 2 H (the CH2 and CH groups). Wait, CH2=CH- is a substituent attached to the ring, so the structure would be benzene-CH2=CH-? No, that would be a substituent with a double bond attached to the ring. Wait, more accurately, it would be benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. No, for a vinyl substituent, it's benzene-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, perhaps it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't include a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached as CH2=CH-.

Wait, the substituent would be attached at the benzene ring as CH2=CH-. So the substituent is CH2=CH-, which is a vinyl group with two C's and two H's (the CH2 and CH groups). But that would leave the substituent as CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that would be a substituent with two C and two H. So total H from substituents would be methyl (3 H) + vinyl substituent (2 H) =5 H. Plus the 4 H from the ring. So total H would be 4 +5 =9. But the option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2=CHCH3 group. So substituent 2 is a propene group (three C's, three H's? Let's see: CH2=CHCH3 has 6 H's? No, wait, CH2=CHCH3 has 6 H's: CH2 (2 H), CH (2 H), and CH3 (3 H). Wait, no: each CH2 would have 2 H, each CH has 1 H, and CH3 has 3 H. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH3. So in total, the substituent has 2 (from CH2) +1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) =6 H? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH3. Each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H. So total H is 2 +1 +3 =6. Plus, the substituent is attached to the benzene as a single bond, so the H attached to the benzene is not part of the substituent's structure. So substituent 2 has 6 H.

Substituent 1 (ester) is O-CO-OCH3. The methyl group has 3 H.

So substituent H's: 6 (from substituent 2) +3 (from substituent 1) =9.

Benzene ring H's: 6 -2 (since two substituents) =4.

Total H: 4 +9 =13. But option D has 12 H. Hmm, that's one over. Not sure if this approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with only one substituent, like CH2=CH2, which has two C's and two H's (each CH2). So substituent 2 would have 4 H's: each CH2 has 2 H. Then substituent 1 (ester) has 3 H (methyl). So substituent H's: 3 +4=7. Benzene ring H's: 4. Total H:11. But option D is H12. So that's one less than needed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. Like CH2=CHCH3, but that seems to complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to the ring, but that would mean the substituent is a methyl group, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so that would fit. But then, where does the vinyl group come from?

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is an ester group, and substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. So substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3. So substituent 2 contributes three C's and six H's. Substituent 1 (ester) contributes three C's and three H's. So substituents contribute 6 C's and 9 H's. Benzene has 6 C's and 4 H's (since two substituents). So total C:6 +6=12. Wait, but the formula options for C12 are options B and C.

But substituents contribute 6 C's. Benzene is 6, so total C is 12. So the formula would be C12H (4 +9=13?) plus any H's from the substituents. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me calculate this properly.

Molecular formula: benzene (C6H6) plus substituents.

Each substituent replaces a H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (ester). This has a formula of O-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. Which is (O2) and (CH3). So the substituent adds 3 C (COOCH3), and 3 O.

Wait, but the overall formula of the compound is C11H12O2 or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then substituent 1 adds 3 C (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and 5 H (the ethyl group: CH2CH3 has 5 H? No, ethyl is CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H's.

Substituent 2: perhaps a vinyl group with a methyl group attached, like CH2=CHCH3. That would be 3 C and 6 H.

So substituents contribute C:3 (ester) +3 (vinyl methyl group) =6 C. Benzene is 6 C → total 12 C.

Hydrogens: benzene has 6-2=4 H. Substituent 1: ethyl ester has 5 H in the ethyl group. Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH3 has 6 H. So substituents contribute 5+6=11 H. Total H:4 +11=15. But the formula options have H counts like 12, 14, etc. So 15 isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group without any additional substituents, like CH2=CH-. So substituent 2 contributes 2 C and 2 H (each CH2 has 2 H? No, CH2=CH- would have 2 H (from CH2) and 1 H (from CH), but that's attached to the ring, so perhaps it's CH2=CH-R, where R is the benzene.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula another way.

The formula options are:

A) C11H14O2: degree of unsaturation (DoU) = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

B) C12H14O2: DoU=(2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6.

C) C12H12O2: (2*12 +2 -12)/2=(26-12)/2=7.

D) C11H12O2: DoU=(2*11 +2 -12)/2=(24-12)/2=6.

The benzene ring provides 3 DoU (as it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds).

The ester group contributes one DoU (the double bond in the carbonyl).

So benzene (3) + ester (1) =4 DoU. The total DoU for the compound should be 4 plus any other rings or double bonds.

Looking at the options:

Option A: DoU=5 → 4 from benzene and ester, leaving 1 more DoU. Which could be a double bond.

Option B: DoU=6 → 4 from benzene and ester, leaving 2 more DoU. Could be two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: DoU=7 → 3 more DoU.

Option D: DoU=6 → 2 more DoU.

Hmm.

In the NMR, there are two vinyl groups (two signals for vinyl H). So that suggests two double bonds (from the vinyl groups). Each vinyl group is a double bond, contributing 1 DoU each. So that's 2 more DoU. So total DoU would be benzene (3) + ester (1) + 2 (vinyl) =6. So the total DoU should be 6.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: DoU=6 → this would fit.

Option D: DoU=6 → also fits.

Hmm, so options B and D have 6 DoU.

So the correct molecular formula is either B or D.

Now, looking at the molecular formula.

If option B is C12H14O2, and D is C11H12O2.

Which one fits with the NMR data?

The NMR shows six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3.

Assuming the structure has a benzene ring (6 C), two substituents which include an ester and a vinyl group with methyl groups.

So the substituents would add more C and H.

Let's think about option B: C12H14O2.

Benzene (6 C) + substituents adding 6 C → 6+6=12.

The substituents would be an ester and a vinyl group with a methyl group.

Ester substituent: O-CO-O-R. Let's say R is ethyl (CH2CH3), which adds 2 C and 5 H (CH2CH3). Then, substituent 1 contributes 3 C (COO) + 2 C (ethyl) =5 C? Wait, COO is two O's, but the substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. So that's substituent 1: 3 C (COO) + 2 C (ethyl) =5 C. But benzene is 6 C, so substituent 2 would have to add 1 C. Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3, which contributes 3 C.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH3 → 5 C (COO is 2 C, OCH2CH3 is 3 C → total 5 C). Substituent 2: vinyl group attached as CH2=CHCH3 → adds 3 C. So total substituents:5+3=8 C. Benzene:6 → total 14 C, which is more than option B's 12. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester) → substituent 1 has 4 C (COO plus 3 C from propyl). Substituent 2: a methyl group attached to a vinyl, like CH2=CHCH3 → substituent 2 has 3 C. So substituents add 4 +3=7 C. Benzene 6 → total 13 C. But option B is 12 C. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) → which contributes 3 C (COO and CH3). Substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached as CH2=CH2 → which contributes 2 C. So substituents add 3+2=5 C. Benzene:6 → total 11 C. But option B is 12 C. So that's not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) → substituent 1 adds 3 C (COO) + 2 C (ethyl) =5 C. Substituent 2 is a methyl group (CH3) → adds 1 C. So substituents add 5 +1=6 C. Benzene:6 → total 12 C. That fits option B (C12H14O2). 

Now, let's calculate the H count.

Benzene has 6 H. Two substituents replace two H's → 4 H left.

Substituent 1 (ethyl ester): O-CO-OCH2CH3 → the ethyl group contributes 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H's? No, CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H's. So substituent 1 adds 5 H.

Substituent 2 (methyl group): CH3 → 3 H.

So substituent H's:5 +3=8. Benzene H's:4. Total H:4+8=12. But option B is C12H14O2, which has 14 H. So that's two H short.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl. Let me think again.

Wait, substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to the ring, like CH2=CH-.

So substituent 2 is CH2=CH- → adds 2 C and 3 H? Wait, CH2=CH- attached to the ring would have 2 H on the CH2 and 1 H on the CH (since the CH is bonded to the ring). So substituent 2 contributes 3 H.

Substituent 1 (ethyl ester): 5 H. So substituent H's:5+3=8. Benzene H's:4 → total 12 H. But option B is C12H14O2 → 14 H. So still two H's missing.

Wait, maybe the substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl attached, like CH2=CHCH3. So substituent 2 would add 3 C, 6 H. Substituent 1 (ethyl ester) adds 5 H. So substituent H's:5+6=11. Benzene H's:4 → total 15 H. But option B is C12H14O2 (14 H). So that's one H over.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group without any substituents. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH- → which adds 3 H (2 from CH2, 1 from CH).

Substituent 1 (ethyl ester): 5 H.

Substituent H's:5+3=8. Benzene H's:4 → 12 H. But option B requires 14 H. So where are the missing two H's?

Wait, perhaps the substituents have more H's. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a CH2CH3 group attached. So substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2CH3. That would add 4 C and 8 H. Substituent 1 (ethyl ester):5 H. Substituent H's:5+8=13. Benzene H's:4 → 17 H. But that's way over option B's 14.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), which contributes 3 H. Substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl (CH2=CHCH3), which contributes 6 H. So substituent H's:3+6=9. Benzene H's:4 → 13 H. Option B is 14, so still one H missing.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a CH2 group, like CH2=CHCH2-. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3 → 3 H), and substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to another methyl, like CH2=CHCH3 (which contributes 6 H). Substituent H's: 3+6=9. Benzene H's:4 → 13 H. Still one short of option B's 14 H.

Hmm.

Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

The correct answer must have 12 C (options B and C) or 11 C (A and D). The DoU fits B and D.

Wait, the correct formula must have 12 C because the substituents include more than 6 C.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is an ethyl ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3), which is 5 C (COO and ethyl). Substituent 2 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), which is 2 C. So substituents add 5+2=7 C. Benzene is 6 → total 13 C. But none of the options have 13 C.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3. That's 3 C. Substituent 1 is a methyl ester (3 C). So substituents add 3+3=6 C. Benzene is 6 → total 12 C. That fits option B (C12H14O2).

Now, H count:

Benzene:6 → 6-2=4 H.

Substituent 1: methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) → 3 H.

Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH3 → 6 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H).

So substituent H's:3 +6=9. Total H:4+9=13. But option B is C12H14O2 (14 H). So one H missing.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Then substituent 2 contributes 4 C and 8 H. Substituent 1 contributes 3 C and 3 H. Benzene H's:4. Total C:6+3+4=13 → not in the options. H would be 4+3+8=15 → option B has 14, so one H too many.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible structure.

The structure is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and a vinyl group. Let's say substituent 1 is an ester (O-CO-O-R) and substituent 2 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

The substituent 2 would have two H on the CH2 and one H on the CH. So substituent 2 contributes 3 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) → 5 C, 5 H.

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- → 2 C, 3 H.

So substituents contribute 5+3=8 H. Benzene contributes 4 H → total 12 H.

But option B has 14 H. So we're missing 2 H. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to another CH2 group. For example, substituent 2 is CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. So substituent 2 is 3 C and 6 H.

So substituent 1 (ethyl ester) contributes 5 H, substituent 2 contributes 6 H. Substituents total 11 H. Benzene 4 → total 15 H. But option B is 14 H. So one H over.

Hmm. I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should think differently.

Another approach: The NMR shows two CH3 groups. So the structure must have two methyl groups.

Each methyl group would contribute 3 H. So two methyl groups → 6 H.

The substituent groups: one is an ester (R-O-CO-O-R'), and the other is a vinyl group.

So, substituent 1: ester group with a methyl (O-CO-OCH3) → contributes 3 H.

Substituent 2: a vinyl group attached to another methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3 → contributes 3 H (from CH3).

So substituent H's:3 (ester) +3 (vinyl methyl) =6 H.

The ring: 4 H.

Other substituents: perhaps the ester's R' is a methyl, and the vinyl substituent's R is a methyl.

So substituents contribute 3 (ester methyl) +6 (vinyl methyl's group) H.

Wait, no. The vinyl substituent (CH2=CHCH3) contributes 6 H (as earlier). Ester substituent (O-CO-OCH3) contributes 3 H.

So substituent H's:6+3=9. Ring H's:4. Total H:13. But option B is 14, which is one more H.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the vinyl substituent is a CH2=CH- group, which contributes 3 H. So substituent H's:3 (ester) +3 (vinyl) =6. Ring H's:4. Total 10 H. That's way under option B's 14.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the NMR shows that there are two signals for –CH3 groups. So the molecule has two methyl groups, each in different environments.

So substituent 1 must have a methyl group (like O-CO-OCH3), and substituent 2 must have another methyl group (like CH3 attached to something else).

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 → 3 H.

Substituent 2: perhaps a propenyl group with a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3 → 3 H from the CH3.

So substituents contribute 3+3=6 H.

The ring contributes 4 H.

Other H's come from the vinyl groups. The vinyl groups have two signals.

Wait, vinyl groups would have H's. The substituent 2 (CH2=CHCH3) has two CH2 groups: the CH2= and the CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the substituent is CH2=CHCH3. So the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to CH3.

So the two vinyl protons are on the CH2=CH- part. So the H on CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH, leading to a certain pattern.

In the NMR, the vinyl signals are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So one of the vinyl protons is coupled with another proton, and the other is coupled with two different sets, leading to a quartet.

Alternatively, each vinyl proton is coupled with the other, but in different ways due to substituents.

But I'm not sure. 

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The molecular formula must have 12 C (options B and C) or 11 C (A and D).

The DoU is 6, fitting options B and D.

Looking at the options, option B is C12H14O2, which has 12 C and 14 H.

If the substituents contribute 6 C (each substituent adding 3 C), then benzene is 6 → total 12 C.

Hydrogen count: substituent 1 (ester) contributes 3 H (methyl), substituent 2 contributes 6 H (vinyl methyl group), and the ring contributes 4 H. Total H:3+6+4=13. But option B has 14 H. So where's the missing H?

Ah, perhaps the substituent has more H's. Maybe substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl, which has more H's.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with two methyl groups, but that doesn't fit the NMR showing two CH3 signals.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a CH2CH3 group, which would add more H's.

Wait, substituent 2 could be CH2=CHCH2CH3. That's a four-carbon substituent. So substituent 2 adds 4 C and 8 H.

Substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

So substituents add 3+4=7 C. Benzene is 6 → total 13 C → not matching any option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2=CH-O-R group. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to the ring, and substituent 1 is an ester with a vinyl group.

Wait, substituent 2 is CH3 attached to the ring. So substituent 2 contributes 1 C and 3 H.

Substituent 1 is an ester with a vinyl group, like O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2. Then substituent 1 adds 5 C (O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2) and 5 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H, CH2 has 2 H).

So substituent H's: substituent 1 has 5 H, substituent 2 has 3 H. Total substituent H's:8. Benzene H's:4. Total H:12.

But option B is C12H14O2 → 14 H. So still two H's short.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 has more H's. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a propyl ester with a vinyl group.

I'm getting stuck. Given the time, I'll have to make a choice.

The correct answer is likely option B) C12H14O2.

But wait, why? Let me think about the molecular formula again.

If the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and the other is a vinyl group (CH2=CHCH3).

Ester substituent: adds 5 C (COO plus ethyl) and 5 H (ethyl's H).

Vinyl substituent: adds 3 C and 6 H.

So substituents:5+3=8 C. Benzene:6 → total 14 C? No, that can't be. Wait, no, benzene is 6 C, substituents add 8 C → 14 C, but the formula options don't have that. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H), substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3 (3 C, 6 H). So substituents add 6 C → benzene 6 +6=12 C. That fits option B.

H count: substituent 1:3 H, substituent 2:6 H. Ring:4 H. Total H:3+6+4=13. But option B has 14 H → one more H needed.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2CH3 (but that's 4 C, 8 H). Substituent 1:3 C,3 H. Substituents:7 C → benzene 6 → 13 C → no option.

Hmm.

Another possibility: substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester). That's 4 C (COO and propyl) and 5 H (propyl group).

Substituent 2 is CH2=CH2 → 2 C, 2 H.

So substituents add 4+2=6 C. Benzene 6 → 12 C → option B or C.

H count: substituent 1:5 H, substituent 2:2 H. Ring:4 H. Total:11 H. But option B has 14 H → 3 H missing.

This isn't working.

Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D) C11H12O2.

But why?

Wait, option D is C11H12O2.

DoU is 6 → which fits with the data.

The substituents would be 5 C (since benzene is 6 C, 6+5=11).

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C,3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH3 (3 C,6 H).

So substituents add 3+3=6 C, which is 6+6=12 → no, doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group (CH3) → 1 C, 3 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH3 → 5 C,5 H.

So substituents:5+1=6 C. Benzene:6 → 12 C, which doesn't fit D (11 C).

Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with option A) C11H14O2. Wait, no, because DoU is 5.

No, the correct DoU is 6. So options B and D.

In the end, I think the correct answer is option D) C11H12O2.


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The IR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, while the NMR spectrum provides the following details:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals, suggesting two distinct sets of aromatic protons. This implies that the substituents on the benzene ring are in positions that create two different environments for the aromatic protons (e.g., meta or ortho substitution).
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. This indicates two vinyl groups in different environments, with coupling patterns consistent with vinyl protons.
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals, indicating two distinct methyl groups in different environments, with no signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups.

### Key Analysis of the Molecular Formula Options:
The molecular formula options are:
- **A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂**
- **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂**
- **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂**
- **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂**

#### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):
The DoU is calculated as:
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
\]
- **A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 5
- **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 6
- **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 7
- **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6

The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, and the ester group contributes 1 DoU. The NMR data suggests two vinyl groups, adding 2 DoU, for a total of 6 DoU. This matches options **B** and **D**.

#### Molecular Formula Fits:
1. **Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**:
   - Benzene contributes 6 carbons.
   - Substituents must add 6 carbons. A plausible structure includes an ester group (e.g., O-CO-OCH₃) and a vinyl group with a methyl group (e.g., CH₂=CHCH₃). This accounts for all 12 carbons.
   - Hydrogen count: Benzene contributes 4 hydrogens (after substituents replace 2 hydrogens). The ester group contributes 3 hydrogens (from the methyl group), and the vinyl group contributes 6 hydrogens (from CH₂=CHCH₃). Total hydrogens = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13. However, the formula requires 14 hydrogens, leaving one hydrogen unaccounted for.

2. **Option D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**:
   - Benzene contributes 6 carbons.
   - Substituents must add 5 carbons. A plausible structure includes an ester group (e.g., O-CO-OCH₃) and a vinyl group (e.g., CH₂=CH-). This accounts for all 11 carbons.
   - Hydrogen count: Benzene contributes 4 hydrogens. The ester group contributes 3 hydrogens (from the methyl group), and the vinyl group contributes 3 hydrogens (from CH₂=CH-). Total hydrogens = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10. However, the formula requires 12 hydrogens, leaving 2 hydrogens unaccounted for.

#### Conclusion:
Both options **B** and **D** have inconsistencies in the hydrogen count based on the proposed structures. However, the NMR data and the requirement for two distinct methyl groups and two vinyl groups suggest that **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** (option **D**) is the most plausible formula, as it aligns better with the substitution pattern and the absence of methylene groups.

ANSWER: D
