Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in this solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem says we have a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what does "stochiometric" mean here? Oh right, I think it refers to the molar ratio in the complex. So the formula would be something like CaY²−, where EDTA is Y⁴−. So each Ca²+ binds one EDTA⁴−, making CaY²−.

The question is about finding the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution. I remember something about the formation constant, Kf, which is given here as KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. Oh wait, the K for the complex is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). Right, so Kf is large, which means the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low.

But wait, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. Now, in solution, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−. But since Kf is so high, the dissociation isn't much. So [Ca²+] will be very small compared to the initial concentration.

Let me think about the setup. The complex dissociation is CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y⁴−. The formation constant Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]) = 5e10.

But wait, in this solution, the only source of Ca²+ and Y⁴− is the dissociation of CaY²−. So we can assume that [Ca²+] = [Y⁴−] because each dissociation produces one of each. Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Then [Y⁴−] is also x.

So substituting into the Kf expression: Kf = [CaY²−]/(x * x) = 5e10.

But [CaY²−] is almost the initial concentration, 0.02 M, because x is so small. So approximately, [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02 M. So plug that in:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x²)

Wait, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x is sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4x10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes? The Kf is 5e10, not 1e10. Oh wait, but I used 5e10 in my calculation. Let me recompute: 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13, because 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x²=4e-13, x= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \), we approximate the concentration of the complex as \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Additionally, the dissociation produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\), so let \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = [ \text{Y}^{4-} ] = x\).

Substituting into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{[ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]}{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{Y}^{4-} ]}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
