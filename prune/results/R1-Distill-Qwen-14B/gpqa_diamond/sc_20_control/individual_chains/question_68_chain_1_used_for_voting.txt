Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

So, there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.

Hmm. I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction. But wait, the magnetic field is first along Z, then suddenly switches to Y. So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, I think.

Wait, let me think. The magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz, and when the magnetic field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sz. So the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>. But then the field is turned off, so maybe the system's state doesn't change instantaneously because the Hamiltonian becomes zero. Then, the field is turned on along Y. So now the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Wait, the magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma S. Because when the magnetic field is in the z-direction, the energy is proportional to Sz. But when it's in the y-direction, the energy is proportional to Sy. So the Hamiltonian will be H = - mu · B, right? Because the energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is -mu·B. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is often written as H = - gamma S · B. Or wait, mu is gamma S, so H = - mu · B. So when B is along y, H becomes gamma B Sy (since mu = gamma S, and the dot product would be along y). So H = gamma B Sy.

Wait, wait, signs. The energy is U = -mu·B. But mu is given as gamma S_z. Wait, no, mu is gamma S, so it's a vector. So when B is along +Z, mu is along +Z, so the dot product mu · B would be positive. But when B is along +Y, mu's projection is along Y, so the energy would depend on Sy.

Wait, so after the field is turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy. Because mu is gamma S, so mu · B is gamma (S · B). So H = - mu · B = - gamma (S · B).

But wait, the initial state was an eigenstate of Sz, right? Because when B was along Z, the particle's spin aligned along Z, so the state was |+z> or |-z>.

After the field is turned off (so H=0), the state doesn't change instantaneously. Then, the field is turned on in Y, so H becomes proportional to Sy.

So the system's state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which means it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking for <mu_z> over time, which is <gamma Sz>.

I think the approach here is to model the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian and find the expectation value of Sz over time.

So the initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z>, since the magnetic moment was aligned along +Z.

The Hamiltonian after the field is turned on is H = gamma B Sy. Wait, let me get the sign right. The energy is H = - mu · B. mu is gamma S, so H = - gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, H is - gamma B Sy. So H = - gamma B Sy.

Wait, but Sy is the spin operator in the y-direction. So H is proportional to Sy. The eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of Sy.

The time evolution is given by |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |psi(0)>.

But in this problem, I think ħ is set to 1, or perhaps the units are chosen such that gamma B has units of energy. Hmm, not sure, but let's proceed.

The state |+z> can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

Let me write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

The |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So, |psi(0)> = |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me confirm: Actually, I think |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2), multiplied by 1/sqrt(2). Yes.

So |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). That makes sense because when you add the two, you get (|+z> + |-z> + |+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) = (2|+z>)/sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z> ), but wait no, because |+y> and |-y> are orthonormal. So the expansion coefficients are correct.

So the initial state |+z> is a superposition of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y>.

Each eigenstate |+y> has energy E_+ = <H> for that state. Since H = - gamma B Sy, and Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, but wait, in our case, the spin matrices are Sx, Sy, Sz with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in our problem, perhaps we can set ħ=1 for simplicity. Wait, but in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma Sz. Hmm.

Wait, let me clarify. The spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But maybe in this problem, we're using units where ħ=1, so the eigenvalues are ±1/2. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written without considering ħ, so the spin components S have eigenvalues ±1/2. Hmm, but the exact units might not matter for the frequency, as the gamma and B would carry the necessary units.

So H = - gamma B Sy. The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>.

The energy eigenvalues for |+y> is E_+ = <H> = - gamma B * (1/2), because Sy |+y> = (1/2) |+y>.

Similarly, E_- = gamma B (1/2) because Sy |-y> = (-1/2) |-y>, so H |-y> = -gamma B (-1/2) |-y> = (gamma B / 2) |-y>.

Wait, let me compute:

H = - gamma B Sy.

Sy has eigenvalues +1/2 for |+y> and -1/2 for |-y>.

So E_+ = - gamma B * (1/2) = - (gamma B)/2.

E_- = - gamma B * (-1/2) = (gamma B)/2.

So the energies are E_+ and E_-.

The initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So when we apply the time evolution operator, each component evolves with its own phase.

So |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t) |+z> = (exp(-i E_+ t) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t) |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Because H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, so the time evolution is exp(-i E_+ t) |+y>, same for |-y>.

So |psi(t)> = [ exp(-i E_+ t) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we want to compute the expectation value of Sz, which is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.

Wait, mu = gamma S, so mu_z = gamma S_z.

So <mu_z> is gamma < S_z >. Therefore, to find the oscillation frequency, we'll compute <S_z> and see how it varies with time.

The expectation value <S_z> is ( <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) > ).

But let's compute this. Since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of Sy, not Sz. So S_z can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> by expanding |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

Wait, another approach is to note that the time evolution under H will cause transitions between the |+y> and |-y> states, but since our initial state was |+z>, which is a combination of these, the expectation value of Sz might oscillate.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value of S_z as a function of time.

We can write |psi(t)> as ( e^{-i E_+ t} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

But to find <S_z>, we can write S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Alternatively, since |+y> and |-y> are combinations of |+z> and |-z>, perhaps express S_z in the Sy basis.

Wait, another approach is to expand |psi(t)> in the Sz basis.

Wait, let me think. |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting into |psi(t)>:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{-i E_+ t} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i E_- t} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).

Multiply the denominators:  sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.

So |psi(t)> = [ e^{-i E_+ t} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i E_- t} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / (2).

Factor out |+z> and |-z>:

= [ (e^{-i E_+ t} + e^{-i E_- t}) |+z> + (e^{-i E_+ t} - e^{-i E_- t}) |-z> ] / 2.

Hmm. Now, the coefficients for |+z> and |-z> are:

For |+z>: [ e^{-i E_+ t} + e^{-i E_- t} ] / 2.

For |-z>: [ e^{-i E_+ t} - e^{-i E_- t} ] / 2.

Now, to compute <S_z>, we need to find <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t)>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>.

But wait, in the problem statement, the particle is spin 1/2, so S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But perhaps, as I'm getting confused with the units, maybe it's better to set ħ=1 for simplicity, so S_z |+z> = (1/2)|+z>, and similarly S_z |-z> = (-1/2)|-z>.

So the expectation value <S_z> is:

= [ ( [e^{i E_+ t} + e^{i E_- t} ] / 2 ) * (1/2) ) * (e^{-i E_+ t} + e^{-i E_- t}) / 2 ) 
  + ( [e^{i E_+ t} - e^{i E_- t} ] / 2 ) * (-1/2) ) * (e^{-i E_+ t} - e^{-i E_- t}) / 2 ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, considering that the system is in a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, which are eigenstates of H, and the time evolution is just a phase factor for each.

So the state |psi(t)> is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, each with their own phase.

To find <S_z>, perhaps it's easier to calculate <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

We can write this as (1/2) [ < +y | + < -y | ) exp(i (E_+ - E_-) t) e^{-i E_- t} exp( i (E_+ - E_-) t) e^{-i E_+ t} ) ].

Wait, perhaps that's not the best approach. Alternatively, since |+y> and |-y> are orthogonal, the cross terms will vanish when calculating expectation values. Let me see.

Wait, |psi(t)> = [a |+y> + b |-y> ], where a = exp(-i E_+ t) and b= exp(-i E_- t), divided by sqrt(2).

Then, <S_z> = [ (a* < +y | + b* < -y | ) S_z (a |+y> + b |-y> ) ] / 2.

Expanding this, we get:

= [ a* a < +y | S_z | +y > + a* b < +y | S_z | -y > + b* a < -y | S_z | +y > + b* b < -y | S_z | -y > ] / 2.

Now, since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of Sy, not Sz, so < +y | S_z | -y > might not be zero.

Wait, what's S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis?

Alternatively, perhaps express S_z in terms of S+ and S-.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the matrix elements.

Since |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So S_z |+y> = (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2) = ( (1/2) |+z> + (-1/2) |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2) = (1/2)(|+z> - |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2) = (|+z> - |-z> )/(2 sqrt(2)) ) = (1/2) (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (1/2) | -y >.

Similarly, S_z |-y> = (S_z |+z> - S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2) = ( (1/2)|+z> - (-1/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2) = ( [ (|+z> ) + |-z> ] ) / (2 sqrt(2)) ) = (1/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (1/2) |+y> .

So < +y | S_z | +y > = < +y | (1/2) | -y > = (1/2) < +y | -y > = 0, because |+y> and |-y> are orthogonal.

Similarly, < +y | S_z | -y > = (1/2) < +y | +y > = (1/2)(1) = 1/2.

Similarly, < -y | S_z | +y > = (1/2) < -y | +y > = 0.

And < -y | S_z | -y > = (1/2) < -y | -y > = 1/2.

So putting this back into the expression for <S_z>:

= [ |a|^2 (0) + a* b (1/2) + b* a (0) + |b|^2 (1/2) ] / 2.

Since a and b are complex exponentials, their magnitudes squared are 1. So this becomes:

= [ 0 + (1/2) a* b + 0 + (1/2) |b|^2 ] / 2.

Wait, no, wait. The expansion is:

[ a* a (0) ) + a* b (1/2) + b* a (0) + b* b (1/2) ] / 2.

So that's [ (1/2) a* b + (1/2) b* b ] / 2.

Wait, but a* b is exp( i (E_+ - E_-) t ), and b* b is 1.

Wait, no: a = exp( -i E_+ t ), b = exp( -i E_- t ), so a* = exp( i E_+ t ), b* = exp( i E_- t ), and a* b = exp( i (E_+ - E_- ) t ), and b* a = exp( i (E_- - E_+ ) t ) = exp( -i (E_+ - E_- ) t ).

So, putting it all together:

<S_z> = [ (1/2) a* b + (1/2) b* a ] / 2.

Wait, no, looking back:

Wait, the expression is [ (1/2) a* b + (1/2) b* a ] / 2.

So that's [ (1/2)( a* b + b* a ) ] / 2.

Which is ( a* b + b* a ) / 4.

But a* b = exp( i (E_+ - E_- ) t ), and b* a = exp( -i (E_+ - E_- ) t ), which are complex conjugates of each other.

So their sum is 2 Re( a* b ) = 2 cos( (E_+ - E_-) t ).

So, <S_z> = (2 cos( (E_+ - E_- ) t )) /4 = (1/2) cos( (E_+ - E_- ) t ).

Wait, but wait, let me compute (E_+ - E_-).

E_+ is -gamma B/2.

E_- is gamma B / 2.

So E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B/2) - (gamma B/2) ) = -gamma B.

The cosine is even, so cos( (E_+ - E_- ) t ) = cos( - gamma B t ) = cos( gamma B t ).

So <S_z> = (1/2) cos( gamma B t ).

So the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is gamma B.

But wait, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>, so <mu_z> = gamma * (1/2) cos( gamma B t ), which oscillates at frequency gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when the magnetic field is along y, the Larmor frequency is determined by the energy splitting between the eigenstates, which is E_- - E_+ = gamma B.

But the oscillation frequency in the expectation value would be proportional to the energy difference divided by hbar, but I think in the way the Hamiltonian is written, the energy is in units where hbar=1, so the frequency is (E_- - E_+)/ (2 pi), but wait, no, the time dependence comes from exp(-i E t / ħ), but if ħ is set to 1, then the frequency is E.

Wait, in the expression for <S_z>, the argument was (E_+ - E_-) t. E_+ - E_- is (-gamma B/2 ) - (gamma B/2 ) ) = -gamma B.

So the cosine term is cos( - gamma B t ) = cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B, which matches.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then suddenly turned off and reactivated along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, either $|+z\rangle$ or $|-z\rangle$. Assuming the initial state is $|+z\rangle$, it is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $S_y$, $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

2. **Hamiltonian After Field Switch**: When the magnetic field is along $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y.
   \]
   The eigenstates of $H$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues:
   \[
   E_+ = -\frac{\gamma B}{2}, \quad E_- = \frac{\gamma B}{2}.
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\rangle$ evolves under $H$ as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{e^{-iE_+t}|+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t}|-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**: The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is computed as:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and using the relations for $S_z$ in the $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ basis, the result simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ arises from the cosine term, with angular frequency equal to the energy difference between the eigenstates divided by $\hbar$. Since $\hbar$ is set to 1 in the problem, the frequency is:
   \[
   f = \gamma B.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **option B**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

So, there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.

Hmm. I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction. But wait, the magnetic field is first along Z, then suddenly switches to Y. So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, I think.

Wait, let me think. The magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz, and when the magnetic field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sz. So the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>. But then the field is turned off, so maybe the system's state doesn't change instantaneously because the Hamiltonian becomes zero. Then, the field is turned on along Y. So now the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Wait, the magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma S. Because when the magnetic field is in the z-direction, the energy is proportional to Sz. But when it's in the y-direction, the energy is proportional to Sy. So the Hamiltonian will be H = - mu · B, right? Because the energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is -mu·B. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is often written as H = - gamma S · B. Or wait, mu is gamma S, so H = - mu · B. So when B is along y, H becomes gamma B Sy (since mu = gamma S, and the dot product would be along y). So H = gamma B Sy.

Wait, wait, signs. The energy is U = -mu·B. But mu is given as gamma S_z. Wait, no, mu is gamma S, so it's a vector. So when B is along +Z, mu is along +Z, so the dot product mu · B would be positive. But when B is along +Y, mu's projection is along Y, so the energy would depend on Sy.

Wait, so after the field is turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy. Because mu is gamma S, so mu · B is gamma (S · B). So H = - mu · B = - gamma (S · B).

But wait, the initial state was an eigenstate of Sz, right? Because when B was along Z, the particle's spin aligned along Z, so the state was |+z> or |-z>.

After the field is turned off (so H=0), the state doesn't change instantaneously. Then, the field is turned on in Y, so H becomes proportional to Sy.

So the system's state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which means it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking for <mu_z> over time, which is <gamma Sz>.

I think the approach here is to model the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian and find the expectation value of Sz over time.

So the initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z>, since the magnetic moment was aligned along +Z.

The Hamiltonian after the field is turned on is H = gamma B Sy. Wait, let me get the sign right. The energy is H = - mu · B. mu is gamma S, so H = - gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, H is - gamma B Sy. So H = - gamma B Sy.

Wait, but Sy is the spin operator in the y-direction. So H is proportional to Sy. The eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of Sy.

The time evolution is given by |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |psi(0)>.

But in this problem, I think ħ is set to 1, or perhaps the units are chosen such that gamma B has units of energy. Hmm, not sure, but let's proceed.

The state |+z> can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

Let me write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

The |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So, |psi(0)> = |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me confirm: Actually, I think |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2), multiplied by 1/sqrt(2). Yes.

So |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). That makes sense because when you add the two, you get (|+z> + |-z> + |+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) = (2|+z>)/sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z> ), but wait no, because |+y> and |-y> are orthonormal. So the expansion coefficients are correct.

So the initial state |+z> is a superposition of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y>.

Each eigenstate |+y> has energy E_+ = <H> for that state. Since H = - gamma B Sy, and Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, but wait, in our case, the spin matrices are Sx, Sy, Sz with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in our problem, perhaps we can set ħ=1 for simplicity. Wait, but in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma Sz. Hmm.

Wait, let me clarify. The spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But maybe in this problem, we're using units where ħ=1, so the eigenvalues are ±1/2. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written without considering ħ, so the spin components S have eigenvalues ±1/2. Hmm, but the exact units might not matter for the frequency, as the gamma and B would carry the necessary units.

So H = - gamma B Sy. The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>.

The energy eigenvalues for |+y> is E_+ = <H> = - gamma B * (1/2), because Sy |+y> = (1/2) |+y>.

Similarly, E_- = gamma B (1/2) because Sy |-y> = (-1/2) |-y>, so H |-y> = -gamma B (-1/2) |-y> = (gamma B / 2) |-y>.

Wait, let me compute:

H = - gamma B Sy.

Sy has eigenvalues +1/2 for |+y> and -1/2 for |-y>.

So E_+ = - gamma B * (1/2) = - (gamma B)/2.

E_- = - gamma B * (-1/2) = (gamma B)/2.

So the energies are E_+ and E_-.

The initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So when we apply the time evolution operator, each component evolves with its own phase.

So |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t) |+z> = (exp(-i E_+ t) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t) |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Because H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, so the time evolution is exp(-i E_+ t) |+y>, same for |-y>.

So |psi(t)> = [ exp(-i E_+ t) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we want to compute the expectation value of Sz, which is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.

Wait, mu = gamma S, so mu_z = gamma S_z.

So <mu_z> is gamma < S_z >. Therefore, to find the oscillation frequency, we'll compute <S_z> and see how it varies with time.

The expectation value <S_z> is ( <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) > ).

But let's compute this. Since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of Sy, not Sz. So S_z can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> by expanding |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

Wait, another approach is to note that the time evolution under H will cause transitions between the |+y> and |-y> states, but since our initial state was |+z>, which is a combination of these, the expectation value of Sz might oscillate.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value of S_z as a function of time.

We can write |psi(t)> as ( e^{-i E_+ t} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

But to find <S_z>, we can write S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Alternatively, since |+y> and |-y> are combinations of |+z> and |-z>, perhaps express S_z in the Sy basis.

Wait, another approach is to expand |psi(t)> in the Sz basis.

Wait, let me think. |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting into |psi(t)>:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{-i E_+ t} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i E_- t} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).

Multiply the denominators:  sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.

So |psi(t)> = [ e^{-i E_+ t} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i E_- t} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / (2).

Factor out |+z> and |-z>:

= [ (e^{-i E_+ t} + e^{-i E_- t}) |+z> + (e^{-i E_+ t} - e^{-i E_- t}) |-z> ] / 2.

Hmm. Now, the coefficients for |+z> and |-z> are:

For |+z>: [ e^{-i E_+ t} + e^{-i E_- t} ] / 2.

For |-z>: [ e^{-i E_+ t} - e^{-i E_- t} ] / 2.

Now, to compute <S_z>, we need to find <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t)>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>.

But wait, in the problem statement, the particle is spin 1/2, so S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But perhaps, as I'm getting confused with the units, maybe it's better to set ħ=1 for simplicity, so S_z |+z> = (1/2)|+z>, and similarly S_z |-z> = (-1/2)|-z>.

So the expectation value <S_z> is:

= [ ( [e^{i E_+ t} + e^{i E_- t} ] / 2 ) * (1/2) ) * (e^{-i E_+ t} + e^{-i E_- t}) / 2 ) 
  + ( [e^{i E_+ t} - e^{i E_- t} ] / 2 ) * (-1/2) ) * (e^{-i E_+ t} - e^{-i E_- t}) / 2 ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, considering that the system is in a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, which are eigenstates of H, and the time evolution is just a phase factor for each.

So the state |psi(t)> is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, each with their own phase.

To find <S_z>, perhaps it's easier to calculate <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

We can write this as (1/2) [ < +y | + < -y | ) exp(i (E_+ - E_-) t) e^{-i E_- t} exp( i (E_+ - E_-) t) e^{-i E_+ t} ) ].

Wait, perhaps that's not the best approach. Alternatively, since |+y> and |-y> are orthogonal, the cross terms will vanish when calculating expectation values. Let me see.

Wait, |psi(t)> = [a |+y> + b |-y> ], where a = exp(-i E_+ t) and b= exp(-i E_- t), divided by sqrt(2).

Then, <S_z> = [ (a* < +y | + b* < -y | ) S_z (a |+y> + b |-y> ) ] / 2.

Expanding this, we get:

= [ a* a < +y | S_z | +y > + a* b < +y | S_z | -y > + b* a < -y | S_z | +y > + b* b < -y | S_z | -y > ] / 2.

Now, since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of Sy, not Sz, so < +y | S_z | -y > might not be zero.

Wait, what's S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis?

Alternatively, perhaps express S_z in terms of S+ and S-.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the matrix elements.

Since |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So S_z |+y> = (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2) = ( (1/2) |+z> + (-1/2) |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2) = (1/2)(|+z> - |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2) = (|+z> - |-z> )/(2 sqrt(2)) ) = (1/2) (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (1/2) | -y >.

Similarly, S_z |-y> = (S_z |+z> - S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2) = ( (1/2)|+z> - (-1/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2) = ( [ (|+z> ) + |-z> ] ) / (2 sqrt(2)) ) = (1/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (1/2) |+y> .

So < +y | S_z | +y > = < +y | (1/2) | -y > = (1/2) < +y | -y > = 0, because |+y> and |-y> are orthogonal.

Similarly, < +y | S_z | -y > = (1/2) < +y | +y > = (1/2)(1) = 1/2.

Similarly, < -y | S_z | +y > = (1/2) < -y | +y > = 0.

And < -y | S_z | -y > = (1/2) < -y | -y > = 1/2.

So putting this back into the expression for <S_z>:

= [ |a|^2 (0) + a* b (1/2) + b* a (0) + |b|^2 (1/2) ] / 2.

Since a and b are complex exponentials, their magnitudes squared are 1. So this becomes:

= [ 0 + (1/2) a* b + 0 + (1/2) |b|^2 ] / 2.

Wait, no, wait. The expansion is:

[ a* a (0) ) + a* b (1/2) + b* a (0) + b* b (1/2) ] / 2.

So that's [ (1/2) a* b + (1/2) b* b ] / 2.

Wait, but a* b is exp( i (E_+ - E_-) t ), and b* b is 1.

Wait, no: a = exp( -i E_+ t ), b = exp( -i E_- t ), so a* = exp( i E_+ t ), b* = exp( i E_- t ), and a* b = exp( i (E_+ - E_- ) t ), and b* a = exp( i (E_- - E_+ ) t ) = exp( -i (E_+ - E_- ) t ).

So, putting it all together:

<S_z> = [ (1/2) a* b + (1/2) b* a ] / 2.

Wait, no, looking back:

Wait, the expression is [ (1/2) a* b + (1/2) b* a ] / 2.

So that's [ (1/2)( a* b + b* a ) ] / 2.

Which is ( a* b + b* a ) / 4.

But a* b = exp( i (E_+ - E_- ) t ), and b* a = exp( -i (E_+ - E_- ) t ), which are complex conjugates of each other.

So their sum is 2 Re( a* b ) = 2 cos( (E_+ - E_-) t ).

So, <S_z> = (2 cos( (E_+ - E_- ) t )) /4 = (1/2) cos( (E_+ - E_- ) t ).

Wait, but wait, let me compute (E_+ - E_-).

E_+ is -gamma B/2.

E_- is gamma B / 2.

So E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B/2) - (gamma B/2) ) = -gamma B.

The cosine is even, so cos( (E_+ - E_- ) t ) = cos( - gamma B t ) = cos( gamma B t ).

So <S_z> = (1/2) cos( gamma B t ).

So the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is gamma B.

But wait, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>, so <mu_z> = gamma * (1/2) cos( gamma B t ), which oscillates at frequency gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when the magnetic field is along y, the Larmor frequency is determined by the energy splitting between the eigenstates, which is E_- - E_+ = gamma B.

But the oscillation frequency in the expectation value would be proportional to the energy difference divided by hbar, but I think in the way the Hamiltonian is written, the energy is in units where hbar=1, so the frequency is (E_- - E_+)/ (2 pi), but wait, no, the time dependence comes from exp(-i E t / ħ), but if ħ is set to 1, then the frequency is E.

Wait, in the expression for <S_z>, the argument was (E_+ - E_-) t. E_+ - E_- is (-gamma B/2 ) - (gamma B/2 ) ) = -gamma B.

So the cosine term is cos( - gamma B t ) = cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B, which matches.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then suddenly turned off and reactivated along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, either $|+z\rangle$ or $|-z\rangle$. Assuming the initial state is $|+z\rangle$, it is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $S_y$, $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

2. **Hamiltonian After Field Switch**: When the magnetic field is along $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y.
   \]
   The eigenstates of $H$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues:
   \[
   E_+ = -\frac{\gamma B}{2}, \quad E_- = \frac{\gamma B}{2}.
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\rangle$ evolves under $H$ as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{e^{-iE_+t}|+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t}|-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**: The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is computed as:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and using the relations for $S_z$ in the $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ basis, the result simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ arises from the cosine term, with angular frequency equal to the energy difference between the eigenstates divided by $\hbar$. Since $\hbar$ is set to 1 in the problem, the frequency is:
   \[
   f = \gamma B.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **option B**.
