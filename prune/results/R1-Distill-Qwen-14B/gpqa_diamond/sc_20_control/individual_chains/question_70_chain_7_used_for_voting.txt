Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand all the information given.

The problem states:

- Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
- C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
- C also reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid.
- D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

The question asks about the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E.

I remember that point groups are determined based on the symmetry elements present in the molecule. So I'll need to figure out what E is to determine its structure.

Let me start by deducing the possible identities of the compounds involved.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red).
Bright red product makes me think of something like sulfur, maybe? Or perhaps a metal oxide? Wait, another thought: when metals react with oxygen, especially in certain stoichiometries, they form colored compounds. For example, sulfur trioxide (which is a gas?) or maybe something else.

Wait, 8 equivalents of gas B. So, if B is a diatomic gas, like O2, then 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles (since each mole of O2 gives two atoms, but wait, in reactions, the stoichiometry is in moles, not atoms). Alternatively, if B is O2, 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of O2. But that's a lot.

So, solid A reacting with 8 moles of gas B forms C. Let's think of a metal reacting with oxygen. For example, lead (Pb) reacts with oxygen to form lead oxide. The formula for lead oxide is PbO. But wait, that's a 1:1 ratio. But if A is a metal with a higher oxidation state, perhaps.

Wait another angle: solid A is something that when oxidized forms a red product. Another possibility is a metal like vanadium. Vanadium(V) oxide is bright yellow, but maybe another compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is a sulfide, and B is oxygen. For example, if A is FeS, but reacting with O2. Hmm, but that's not leading me anywhere.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps something like phosgene (but I'm not sure) or maybe something like sarin gas? Wait, no, sarin isn't formed from these reactions. Alternatively, E could be a highly toxic gas like chlorine dioxide (ClO2), but I'm not certain.

Wait, what about the reaction of C with water? It produces A, and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is hydrated, it breaks down into a metal (A) and two acids. So, maybe C is a sulfate ester or something else that can hydrolyze into acids.

Wait, let's think about sulfur trioxide (SO3) as C. SO3 is a gas, but when it reacts with water, it forms H2SO4 (a strong acid) and perhaps some other acid? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is a metal sulfate, but that wouldn't produce two different acids upon hydrolysis. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, if A is a metal sulfite, but upon hydrolysis, it forms the metal hydroxide and sulfuric and another acid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the first reaction: 8 equivalents of B. If B is O2, then 8 moles would be involved. So, for example, if A is Fe, then Fe reacting with O2 forms FeO (but that's 1 mole O2 per mole Fe). Wait, no, FeO is not so stable. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the second reaction gives E as a highly toxic gas. Let's think about D. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, etc., but H is a solvent, maybe something like H2O? Wait, no, because B is a gas, and D is another gas. If B is O2, D could be something else. For example, if D is H2, and B is O2, then H could be H2O. But H is a solvent, so H2O makes sense.

So D is H2, B is O2. So when D (H2) reacts with B (O2) in 1:1 ratio, it forms H2O (H). That makes sense. So D is H2, B is O2.

So, B is O2 gas, D is H2 gas. H is H2O, which is a solvent.

Now, let's think again about the first reaction: A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So 8 moles of O2. Let's think of a metal that when oxidized with O2 in a ratio of 1:8 would form a compound C.

Wait, 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are consumed. Let's calculate the moles. The formula would be A O_{8}. Wait, but that's a lot of oxygen. Let's think of metals that form such high oxidation states.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal with a +8 oxidation state. But most metals don't have +8. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is A O_8. Wait, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the formula is A O_4. Like, for example, if A is Pb, which can form PbO2 (but that's +4 oxidation state). Let me see:

If the reaction is A + 8 B (O2) → C.

Assuming A is a metal M, then the formula of C would be M O_x. The number of O2 molecules would be (x/2) per M. So 8 equivalents of O2 would mean x/2 = 8 → x=16. So M O_16. That's a lot of oxygen. Hmm, which metal forms MO_16? That seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption about B is wrong. Could B be another diatomic gas, like Cl2? Let me think. If B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of Cl2. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of Cl2 are consumed. Then, the formula would be A Cl_16. That's also a lot, but perhaps A is a metal like Fe, but FeCl16 is not a known compound. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the first reaction. Let's think about the second reaction. If C reacts with D (H2) to form E, and E is extremely hazardous. Also, considering that H is H2O.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with H2, it forms a metal and water. But in the problem, C reacts with D (H2) to form E. So perhaps E is a metal hydride or another compound.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfate (like SO3), reacting with H2 could form H2SO4 and possibly another product. Wait, but E is a product of C and D (H2), so maybe SO3 + H2 → something. Alternatively, maybe E is H2S, but that's not formed from SO3 + H2. Alternatively, maybe C is CO2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: what if C is a nitride or something else that reacts with H2 to form something toxic. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, going back to the first reaction. Maybe A is a metal that forms a dioxide. Let's say A is Pb, which forms PbO2 (which is dark brown, not bright red). Alternatively, maybe it's a different metal.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(VI) compounds are often colored. For example, K2Cr2O7 is orange-red. But is that a solid? Alternatively, perhaps C is lead dioxide, but its color is dark brown.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, if C is an anhydride of a strong acid and a weak acid, then when it reacts with water, it would produce those acids.

For example, sulfur trioxide (SO3) reacts with water to form H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2SO3 (but H2SO3 is a weak acid? Wait, actually, H2SO3 is a moderately weak acid. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a mixed anhydride, like an acid anhydride. For instance, if C is the anhydride of H2SO4 and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite (SO2) derivative. But sulfites upon hydrolysis would form H2SO3 and another acid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about nitric anhydride, which is dinitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sulfuric anhydride is SO3.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of C with water produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). So, if F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is, say, H2CO3 (weak), but I'm not sure what C would be.

Wait, when SO3 is reacted with water, it forms H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But where does the other acid come from? Unless C is a mixed anhydride. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that upon hydrolysis yields two different acids.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfite, like ZnSO3. When it reacts with water, it would form Zn(OH)2 (which is a weak base, but maybe decomposes further) and SO2 gas. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate? No, because carbonate would produce bicarbonate and CO2 upon hydrolysis. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about C as a compound that can hydrolyze into a strong and a weak acid. For instance, if C is a sulfonate ester or something, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate ester. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the first reaction produces a bright red product C. One common bright red solid is mercury(II) oxide, HgO, but I'm not sure about its reaction with other gases. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. 8 equivalents of gas B: if B is O2, then 8 moles of O2 are used per mole of A. So for a metal M, the formula would be MO_8. That's a high oxidation state. Let me consider possible metals.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a +8 oxidation state. But most metals don't go that high. Alternatively, maybe it's a +6 oxidation state, which is common for chromium, molybdenum, etc.

Wait, for example, if A is Mo, then it could form MoO3, but that's a +5 oxidation state. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula isn't MO_8 but something else. Maybe the reaction is A + 8 O2 → C. So, maybe C is A O8. That would require A to have an 8+ oxidation state, which is unlikely for most metals. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reactions in terms of other gases. What if B is Cl2? Then 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So the formula would be A Cl_16. Which seems unlikely. So maybe B isn't Cl2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound. CrO3 is a strong oxidizing agent and is orange in color. But I'm not sure if it's bright red.

Wait, another possibility: the bright red product could be lead(II,IV) oxide, Pb3O4, which has a reddish color. Let me think about that. Pb3O4 is also called lead oxide, and it's a mixture of PbO and Pb2O3. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Wait, but sulfides are typically solids, but the reaction is with O2, which is a gas. So perhaps C is a metal oxide.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus on the reaction of C with D to form E. Since D is H2 (as per earlier reasoning that H is H2O, formed from H2 and O2), then C reacts with H2 to form E.

E is extremely hazardous. What compounds are formed when an oxide reacts with hydrogen? Maybe a metal hydride? Or perhaps a reaction that forms a highly toxic gas.

Wait, another angle: if C is a dichromate or chromate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, so maybe it's something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), phosgene (COCl2), or chlorine gas (but that's B). Alternatively, maybe E is a metal carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a hydride. For example, if C is CO (carbon monoxide), and D is H2, then CO + H2 → CH3OH (methanol), but that's not extremely hazardous. Or maybe CO + H2 → C + H2O, but that's the reverse of the reaction.

Alternatively, if C is Ozone (O3), but that doesn't fit the first reaction.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to think about the possible structures of E.

Wait, the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

These are point groups. So I need to find what E's structure is and then determine its point group.

D∞h is the point group for a molecule with a linear structure and symmetry elements including an infinite vertical mirror plane (σ∞), a principal axis (C∞), and others. For example, O2, HCN, CO2 (but CO2 is D∞h? Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry? Wait, no, I think CO2 has D∞h symmetry because it's linear with O in the center. Wait, no, CO2 is linear with two identical O atoms. So its point group would be D∞h.

Wait, D∞h is the point group for molecules with a linear structure with the central atom having two different types of substituents. Wait, no, for CO2, which is O=C=O, it's linear and has a center of symmetry, so perhaps its point group is D∞h. Similarly, H2O is V-shaped with C2v symmetry.

So, if E is a linear molecule, perhaps its point group would be D∞h or D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a center of symmetry, it might have a different point group.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Another example: Ozone (O3) has a C2v point group because it's a bent molecule with a central atom and two identical substituents. So, that's option D.

Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is bent, also has C2v symmetry.

If E is a linear molecule like CO2 or O2, it'd be D∞h. But if E is something else, like HCN, which is linear, also has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Let me think about some extremely hazardous gases.

Phosgene (COCl2) is a toxic gas, but its structure is planar with Cl-O-Cl. Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is a planar molecule. So its point group is D∞h because it has a center of symmetry and mirror planes.

Alternatively, sarin gas is highly toxic, but I'm not sure about its structure. Sarin is an organophosphate, but I think it's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, another thought: what if E is ozone (O3)? Ozone is a toxic gas, but it's a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Let me see: O3 has a central O atom with two O atoms bonded to it. It's a bent structure, so its point group is C2v.

Wait, but in the reaction where C reacts with H2 to form E, if C is O2, that wouldn't make sense because O2 + H2 would form H2O. But in this case, C is reacting with D (H2) to form E. So if C is O3, then O3 + H2 → H2O + O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide, like HOOH (but that's not a solid). Alternatively, maybe C is SO3, which is a gas. When SO3 reacts with H2, perhaps it forms H2S and other products, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the possible reactions. So, solid A reacts with O2 (B) to form C. C is bright red. Then C reacts with H2 (D) to form E, which is very dangerous.

What if A is lead? Lead can form lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), which is orange. But I'm not sure about the color.

Another possibility: maybe A is a sulfide. For example, if A is FeS, and B is O2. FeS reacting with O2 in a high ratio could form FeO and SO2 or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is SO3. SO3 is a gas and is colorless, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bright red product is lead chromate (PbCrO4), which is bright yellow, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's mercury(II) oxide (HgO), which is red, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, mercury(II) oxide, HgO, is a red solid. But how does it form? It would require Hg reacting with O2. The reaction is 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. So, 1 equivalent of O2 per 2 Hg. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of O2 are used. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the initial reaction produces a compound that when reacted with H2 gives a highly toxic gas.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. But when nitrides react with water, they produce NH3 and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But in this case, F and G are acids, so that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. When it reacts with water, it forms a sulfonic acid (strong acid) and another acid. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: since the options for E's point group include D∞h, which is linear, perhaps E is a linear molecule like O2 (but O2 is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry). Alternatively, if E is CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product E is formed when C reacts with D (H2). So, suppose C is CO2. Then CO2 + H2 would require some reaction. Maybe it's a reduction. CO2 + H2 → CH3OH? But that's in the presence of a catalyst. I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, if C is SO3, reacting with H2 could produce H2SO4 and H2O, but that's not forming a gas.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or another gas. But O2 is B, which is a reactant, so perhaps E is something else.

Wait, another possibility: E is a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide (HCN). HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. But how would HCN be formed in this reaction?

If C is a cyanide-related compound. Let me think. If C is (CN)2, then reacting with H2 might produce HCN. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a metal cyanide, like KCN, reacting with H2 would not produce HCN. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is nitrobenzene, but that's not a gas.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrosyl compound. For example, NOCl, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the possible point groups again.

The options are:

A) C2: This is a point group with a single twofold axis. Examples include H2O2 (but O-O single bond, which is not common), or molecules like ethylene (but that's D2h), so perhaps more like a bent structure with a C2 axis but no mirror planes.

B) D4h: A higher symmetry point group, which includes a fourfold axis and horizontal mirror planes. This is typical for molecules like octahedral complexes or certain inorganic compounds.

C) D∞h: Linear molecules with a center of symmetry, like CO2, O2, HCN.

D) C2v: A bent molecule with a vertical mirror plane and a twofold axis perpendicular to the mirror plane. For example, O3, SO2, etc.

So, if E is a linear molecule, it's either C∞v or D∞h. But for a linear molecule, the point group is usually D∞h if there's a center of symmetry, or C∞v if not.

Wait, for example, O2 is D∞h because it's diatomic with a center of inversion. CO2 is also D∞h because it's a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes.

So, if E is a linear molecule, its point group would be D∞h (option C). But wait, the option is D∞h as option C.

Alternatively, if E is O3, which is bent, then its point group is C2v (option D).

But which one is it?

Let me recap the possible reactions again.

If B is O2, D is H2.

Then, A reacts with 8 O2 to form C. C is bright red. Then, C reacts with 2 H2 to form E.

E is extremely hazardous. Let's think about the possible products.

What if C is a metal oxide that, when reduced with H2, forms a metal and water, but E is a byproduct. Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it gives back A and two acids. So, A is a metal, let's say, and when C (a metal oxide) reacts with water, it produces the metal hydroxide and possibly some acid. But in the problem, F and G are acids, so perhaps the oxide is a mixed oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate ester. For example, if C is ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), but that's a solid. When it reacts with water, it would dissolve into NH4+ and SO4^2- ions, but that doesn't produce two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, like PbSO3. When PbSO3 reacts with water, it would produce Pb(OH)2 and H2SO3 (sulfurous acid). But Pb(OH)2 is a base, not a metal. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitrate, like Pb(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would dissolve into Pb^2+ and NO3^- ions. But that doesn't produce acids F and G.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, if C is an anhydride of H2SO4 and another acid. Let's say, the anhydride would react with water to form both H2SO4 and another acid.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about E's structure.

If E is a linear molecule, its point group would be D∞h. If E is a bent molecule, like O3, it would be C2v.

So, which option fits? The options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Another approach: think of E as phosgene (COCl2), which is a planar molecule with D∞h symmetry. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, but the reaction between C and H2 producing E. If C is something like SOCl2, and it reacts with H2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a chlorate or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures for E based on the options.

If the point group is D∞h, E could be O2, CO2, HCN, etc.

If it's C2v, E could be O3, SO2, etc.

But the question is what E is.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

Assume that C is an anhydride of F and G. For example, if F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak), then C could be the anhydride, which is SO3·CO3 or something, but that's not a known compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, like RSO3-O-R', which upon hydrolysis produces H2SO4 and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a mixed anhydride of H2SO4 and HNO3, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is an acid anhydride like (HOOC)2O (oxalic anhydride), which upon hydrolysis produces HOOC-COOH (oxalic acid) and possibly another acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a peracid like H2O2, but that doesn't fit the reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the initial reaction again. A solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 (B) to form C.

If A is a metal with a high oxidation state, for example, if A is FeO, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the formula of C. If 8 equivalents of O2 are used, the formula of C would be A O8. So, one mole of A reacts with 8 moles of O2.

So, 2 A + 16 O2 → 2 A O_8.

Wait, but that would imply that A has an oxidation state of +8, which is extremely rare. Most metals don't go that high. So, maybe this line of thinking is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is AO4, which would require 4 moles of O2 per mole of A. But the problem states 8 equivalents, so perhaps that's not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible point group of E without knowing its exact structure.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

The most common extremely hazardous gas with a known point group is phosgene (COCl2), which has D∞h symmetry because it's a planar molecule with a center of inversion.

Alternatively, sarin gas is a chiral molecule, but I'm not sure about its point group.

Another possibility: if E is ozone (O3), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

But let's think about how E is formed. C reacts with 2 equivalents of H2 to form E.

If C is a compound that upon reaction with H2 forms O3, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe C is O2, and the reaction with H2 forms H2O and O3. But that's speculative.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let's make an educated guess based on the point group options.

If E is a linear molecule, it's D∞h (option C). If it's a bent molecule, it's C2v (option D).

Given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's O3 (ozone), which is a toxic gas and has C2v symmetry. So the answer would be option D.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (COCl2), which is planar and has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: What if E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, but Cl2 is B, the initial gas. So that's not possible.

Wait, another possibility: E is HCN. HCN is a linear molecule (D∞h symmetry) and is highly toxic. So, how would HCN be formed?

If C is (CN)2, and it reacts with H2 to form 2 HCN. Then, E would be HCN, which has D∞h symmetry. So the point group would be D∞h, option C.

But how would (CN)2 form from A and O2? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a cyanide salt, but that seems less likely.

Perhaps I should conclude that E has D∞h symmetry, making the answer option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group (point group) of product E based on the given reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - Bright red solids often include compounds like lead dioxide (PbO₂) or vanadium(V) oxide (V₂O₅). However, the exact identity of A and C remains unclear.  
   - The stoichiometry suggests a high oxidation state for A, but common metals like lead or vanadium do not match the description perfectly.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous.  
   - Gas D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂ (a common diatomic gas), D could be H₂, and H would be H₂O.  
   - E is a highly toxic gas. Possible candidates include ozone (O₃), phosgene (COCl₂), or hydrogen cyanide (HCN). These gases are linear or bent and have distinct symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - This suggests C is likely an anhydride or a compound that hydrolyzes into acids. For example, sulfur trioxide (SO₃) reacts with water to form H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and possibly another acid. However, the exact identity of C remains uncertain.

4. **Symmetry Analysis**:  
   - The options for the point group of E are **C₂**, **D₄h**, **D∞h**, and **C₂v**.  
   - **D∞h** corresponds to linear molecules with a center of symmetry, such as CO₂, HCN, or O₂.  
   - **C₂v** corresponds to bent molecules like O₃ or SO₂.  
   - Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, HCN (linear, D∞h) or ozone (bent, C₂v) are plausible candidates.  

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the reasoning, E is most likely a linear molecule with **D∞h** symmetry, as this aligns with the description of a highly hazardous gas like HCN or phosgene.  

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand all the information given.

The problem states:

- Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
- C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
- C also reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid.
- D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

The question asks about the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E.

I remember that point groups are determined based on the symmetry elements present in the molecule. So I'll need to figure out what E is to determine its structure.

Let me start by deducing the possible identities of the compounds involved.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red).
Bright red product makes me think of something like sulfur, maybe? Or perhaps a metal oxide? Wait, another thought: when metals react with oxygen, especially in certain stoichiometries, they form colored compounds. For example, sulfur trioxide (which is a gas?) or maybe something else.

Wait, 8 equivalents of gas B. So, if B is a diatomic gas, like O2, then 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles (since each mole of O2 gives two atoms, but wait, in reactions, the stoichiometry is in moles, not atoms). Alternatively, if B is O2, 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of O2. But that's a lot.

So, solid A reacting with 8 moles of gas B forms C. Let's think of a metal reacting with oxygen. For example, lead (Pb) reacts with oxygen to form lead oxide. The formula for lead oxide is PbO. But wait, that's a 1:1 ratio. But if A is a metal with a higher oxidation state, perhaps.

Wait another angle: solid A is something that when oxidized forms a red product. Another possibility is a metal like vanadium. Vanadium(V) oxide is bright yellow, but maybe another compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is a sulfide, and B is oxygen. For example, if A is FeS, but reacting with O2. Hmm, but that's not leading me anywhere.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps something like phosgene (but I'm not sure) or maybe something like sarin gas? Wait, no, sarin isn't formed from these reactions. Alternatively, E could be a highly toxic gas like chlorine dioxide (ClO2), but I'm not certain.

Wait, what about the reaction of C with water? It produces A, and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is hydrated, it breaks down into a metal (A) and two acids. So, maybe C is a sulfate ester or something else that can hydrolyze into acids.

Wait, let's think about sulfur trioxide (SO3) as C. SO3 is a gas, but when it reacts with water, it forms H2SO4 (a strong acid) and perhaps some other acid? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is a metal sulfate, but that wouldn't produce two different acids upon hydrolysis. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, if A is a metal sulfite, but upon hydrolysis, it forms the metal hydroxide and sulfuric and another acid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the first reaction: 8 equivalents of B. If B is O2, then 8 moles would be involved. So, for example, if A is Fe, then Fe reacting with O2 forms FeO (but that's 1 mole O2 per mole Fe). Wait, no, FeO is not so stable. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the second reaction gives E as a highly toxic gas. Let's think about D. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, etc., but H is a solvent, maybe something like H2O? Wait, no, because B is a gas, and D is another gas. If B is O2, D could be something else. For example, if D is H2, and B is O2, then H could be H2O. But H is a solvent, so H2O makes sense.

So D is H2, B is O2. So when D (H2) reacts with B (O2) in 1:1 ratio, it forms H2O (H). That makes sense. So D is H2, B is O2.

So, B is O2 gas, D is H2 gas. H is H2O, which is a solvent.

Now, let's think again about the first reaction: A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So 8 moles of O2. Let's think of a metal that when oxidized with O2 in a ratio of 1:8 would form a compound C.

Wait, 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are consumed. Let's calculate the moles. The formula would be A O_{8}. Wait, but that's a lot of oxygen. Let's think of metals that form such high oxidation states.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal with a +8 oxidation state. But most metals don't have +8. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is A O_8. Wait, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the formula is A O_4. Like, for example, if A is Pb, which can form PbO2 (but that's +4 oxidation state). Let me see:

If the reaction is A + 8 B (O2) → C.

Assuming A is a metal M, then the formula of C would be M O_x. The number of O2 molecules would be (x/2) per M. So 8 equivalents of O2 would mean x/2 = 8 → x=16. So M O_16. That's a lot of oxygen. Hmm, which metal forms MO_16? That seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption about B is wrong. Could B be another diatomic gas, like Cl2? Let me think. If B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of Cl2. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of Cl2 are consumed. Then, the formula would be A Cl_16. That's also a lot, but perhaps A is a metal like Fe, but FeCl16 is not a known compound. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the first reaction. Let's think about the second reaction. If C reacts with D (H2) to form E, and E is extremely hazardous. Also, considering that H is H2O.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with H2, it forms a metal and water. But in the problem, C reacts with D (H2) to form E. So perhaps E is a metal hydride or another compound.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfate (like SO3), reacting with H2 could form H2SO4 and possibly another product. Wait, but E is a product of C and D (H2), so maybe SO3 + H2 → something. Alternatively, maybe E is H2S, but that's not formed from SO3 + H2. Alternatively, maybe C is CO2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: what if C is a nitride or something else that reacts with H2 to form something toxic. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, going back to the first reaction. Maybe A is a metal that forms a dioxide. Let's say A is Pb, which forms PbO2 (which is dark brown, not bright red). Alternatively, maybe it's a different metal.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(VI) compounds are often colored. For example, K2Cr2O7 is orange-red. But is that a solid? Alternatively, perhaps C is lead dioxide, but its color is dark brown.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, if C is an anhydride of a strong acid and a weak acid, then when it reacts with water, it would produce those acids.

For example, sulfur trioxide (SO3) reacts with water to form H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2SO3 (but H2SO3 is a weak acid? Wait, actually, H2SO3 is a moderately weak acid. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a mixed anhydride, like an acid anhydride. For instance, if C is the anhydride of H2SO4 and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite (SO2) derivative. But sulfites upon hydrolysis would form H2SO3 and another acid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about nitric anhydride, which is dinitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sulfuric anhydride is SO3.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of C with water produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). So, if F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is, say, H2CO3 (weak), but I'm not sure what C would be.

Wait, when SO3 is reacted with water, it forms H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But where does the other acid come from? Unless C is a mixed anhydride. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that upon hydrolysis yields two different acids.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfite, like ZnSO3. When it reacts with water, it would form Zn(OH)2 (which is a weak base, but maybe decomposes further) and SO2 gas. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate? No, because carbonate would produce bicarbonate and CO2 upon hydrolysis. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about C as a compound that can hydrolyze into a strong and a weak acid. For instance, if C is a sulfonate ester or something, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate ester. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the first reaction produces a bright red product C. One common bright red solid is mercury(II) oxide, HgO, but I'm not sure about its reaction with other gases. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. 8 equivalents of gas B: if B is O2, then 8 moles of O2 are used per mole of A. So for a metal M, the formula would be MO_8. That's a high oxidation state. Let me consider possible metals.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a +8 oxidation state. But most metals don't go that high. Alternatively, maybe it's a +6 oxidation state, which is common for chromium, molybdenum, etc.

Wait, for example, if A is Mo, then it could form MoO3, but that's a +5 oxidation state. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula isn't MO_8 but something else. Maybe the reaction is A + 8 O2 → C. So, maybe C is A O8. That would require A to have an 8+ oxidation state, which is unlikely for most metals. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reactions in terms of other gases. What if B is Cl2? Then 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So the formula would be A Cl_16. Which seems unlikely. So maybe B isn't Cl2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound. CrO3 is a strong oxidizing agent and is orange in color. But I'm not sure if it's bright red.

Wait, another possibility: the bright red product could be lead(II,IV) oxide, Pb3O4, which has a reddish color. Let me think about that. Pb3O4 is also called lead oxide, and it's a mixture of PbO and Pb2O3. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Wait, but sulfides are typically solids, but the reaction is with O2, which is a gas. So perhaps C is a metal oxide.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus on the reaction of C with D to form E. Since D is H2 (as per earlier reasoning that H is H2O, formed from H2 and O2), then C reacts with H2 to form E.

E is extremely hazardous. What compounds are formed when an oxide reacts with hydrogen? Maybe a metal hydride? Or perhaps a reaction that forms a highly toxic gas.

Wait, another angle: if C is a dichromate or chromate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, so maybe it's something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), phosgene (COCl2), or chlorine gas (but that's B). Alternatively, maybe E is a metal carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a hydride. For example, if C is CO (carbon monoxide), and D is H2, then CO + H2 → CH3OH (methanol), but that's not extremely hazardous. Or maybe CO + H2 → C + H2O, but that's the reverse of the reaction.

Alternatively, if C is Ozone (O3), but that doesn't fit the first reaction.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to think about the possible structures of E.

Wait, the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

These are point groups. So I need to find what E's structure is and then determine its point group.

D∞h is the point group for a molecule with a linear structure and symmetry elements including an infinite vertical mirror plane (σ∞), a principal axis (C∞), and others. For example, O2, HCN, CO2 (but CO2 is D∞h? Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry? Wait, no, I think CO2 has D∞h symmetry because it's linear with O in the center. Wait, no, CO2 is linear with two identical O atoms. So its point group would be D∞h.

Wait, D∞h is the point group for molecules with a linear structure with the central atom having two different types of substituents. Wait, no, for CO2, which is O=C=O, it's linear and has a center of symmetry, so perhaps its point group is D∞h. Similarly, H2O is V-shaped with C2v symmetry.

So, if E is a linear molecule, perhaps its point group would be D∞h or D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a center of symmetry, it might have a different point group.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Another example: Ozone (O3) has a C2v point group because it's a bent molecule with a central atom and two identical substituents. So, that's option D.

Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is bent, also has C2v symmetry.

If E is a linear molecule like CO2 or O2, it'd be D∞h. But if E is something else, like HCN, which is linear, also has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Let me think about some extremely hazardous gases.

Phosgene (COCl2) is a toxic gas, but its structure is planar with Cl-O-Cl. Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is a planar molecule. So its point group is D∞h because it has a center of symmetry and mirror planes.

Alternatively, sarin gas is highly toxic, but I'm not sure about its structure. Sarin is an organophosphate, but I think it's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, another thought: what if E is ozone (O3)? Ozone is a toxic gas, but it's a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Let me see: O3 has a central O atom with two O atoms bonded to it. It's a bent structure, so its point group is C2v.

Wait, but in the reaction where C reacts with H2 to form E, if C is O2, that wouldn't make sense because O2 + H2 would form H2O. But in this case, C is reacting with D (H2) to form E. So if C is O3, then O3 + H2 → H2O + O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide, like HOOH (but that's not a solid). Alternatively, maybe C is SO3, which is a gas. When SO3 reacts with H2, perhaps it forms H2S and other products, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the possible reactions. So, solid A reacts with O2 (B) to form C. C is bright red. Then C reacts with H2 (D) to form E, which is very dangerous.

What if A is lead? Lead can form lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), which is orange. But I'm not sure about the color.

Another possibility: maybe A is a sulfide. For example, if A is FeS, and B is O2. FeS reacting with O2 in a high ratio could form FeO and SO2 or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is SO3. SO3 is a gas and is colorless, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bright red product is lead chromate (PbCrO4), which is bright yellow, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's mercury(II) oxide (HgO), which is red, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, mercury(II) oxide, HgO, is a red solid. But how does it form? It would require Hg reacting with O2. The reaction is 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. So, 1 equivalent of O2 per 2 Hg. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of O2 are used. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the initial reaction produces a compound that when reacted with H2 gives a highly toxic gas.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. But when nitrides react with water, they produce NH3 and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But in this case, F and G are acids, so that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. When it reacts with water, it forms a sulfonic acid (strong acid) and another acid. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: since the options for E's point group include D∞h, which is linear, perhaps E is a linear molecule like O2 (but O2 is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry). Alternatively, if E is CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product E is formed when C reacts with D (H2). So, suppose C is CO2. Then CO2 + H2 would require some reaction. Maybe it's a reduction. CO2 + H2 → CH3OH? But that's in the presence of a catalyst. I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, if C is SO3, reacting with H2 could produce H2SO4 and H2O, but that's not forming a gas.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or another gas. But O2 is B, which is a reactant, so perhaps E is something else.

Wait, another possibility: E is a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide (HCN). HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. But how would HCN be formed in this reaction?

If C is a cyanide-related compound. Let me think. If C is (CN)2, then reacting with H2 might produce HCN. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a metal cyanide, like KCN, reacting with H2 would not produce HCN. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is nitrobenzene, but that's not a gas.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrosyl compound. For example, NOCl, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the possible point groups again.

The options are:

A) C2: This is a point group with a single twofold axis. Examples include H2O2 (but O-O single bond, which is not common), or molecules like ethylene (but that's D2h), so perhaps more like a bent structure with a C2 axis but no mirror planes.

B) D4h: A higher symmetry point group, which includes a fourfold axis and horizontal mirror planes. This is typical for molecules like octahedral complexes or certain inorganic compounds.

C) D∞h: Linear molecules with a center of symmetry, like CO2, O2, HCN.

D) C2v: A bent molecule with a vertical mirror plane and a twofold axis perpendicular to the mirror plane. For example, O3, SO2, etc.

So, if E is a linear molecule, it's either C∞v or D∞h. But for a linear molecule, the point group is usually D∞h if there's a center of symmetry, or C∞v if not.

Wait, for example, O2 is D∞h because it's diatomic with a center of inversion. CO2 is also D∞h because it's a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes.

So, if E is a linear molecule, its point group would be D∞h (option C). But wait, the option is D∞h as option C.

Alternatively, if E is O3, which is bent, then its point group is C2v (option D).

But which one is it?

Let me recap the possible reactions again.

If B is O2, D is H2.

Then, A reacts with 8 O2 to form C. C is bright red. Then, C reacts with 2 H2 to form E.

E is extremely hazardous. Let's think about the possible products.

What if C is a metal oxide that, when reduced with H2, forms a metal and water, but E is a byproduct. Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it gives back A and two acids. So, A is a metal, let's say, and when C (a metal oxide) reacts with water, it produces the metal hydroxide and possibly some acid. But in the problem, F and G are acids, so perhaps the oxide is a mixed oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate ester. For example, if C is ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), but that's a solid. When it reacts with water, it would dissolve into NH4+ and SO4^2- ions, but that doesn't produce two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, like PbSO3. When PbSO3 reacts with water, it would produce Pb(OH)2 and H2SO3 (sulfurous acid). But Pb(OH)2 is a base, not a metal. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitrate, like Pb(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would dissolve into Pb^2+ and NO3^- ions. But that doesn't produce acids F and G.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, if C is an anhydride of H2SO4 and another acid. Let's say, the anhydride would react with water to form both H2SO4 and another acid.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about E's structure.

If E is a linear molecule, its point group would be D∞h. If E is a bent molecule, like O3, it would be C2v.

So, which option fits? The options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Another approach: think of E as phosgene (COCl2), which is a planar molecule with D∞h symmetry. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, but the reaction between C and H2 producing E. If C is something like SOCl2, and it reacts with H2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a chlorate or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures for E based on the options.

If the point group is D∞h, E could be O2, CO2, HCN, etc.

If it's C2v, E could be O3, SO2, etc.

But the question is what E is.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

Assume that C is an anhydride of F and G. For example, if F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak), then C could be the anhydride, which is SO3·CO3 or something, but that's not a known compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, like RSO3-O-R', which upon hydrolysis produces H2SO4 and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a mixed anhydride of H2SO4 and HNO3, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is an acid anhydride like (HOOC)2O (oxalic anhydride), which upon hydrolysis produces HOOC-COOH (oxalic acid) and possibly another acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a peracid like H2O2, but that doesn't fit the reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the initial reaction again. A solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 (B) to form C.

If A is a metal with a high oxidation state, for example, if A is FeO, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the formula of C. If 8 equivalents of O2 are used, the formula of C would be A O8. So, one mole of A reacts with 8 moles of O2.

So, 2 A + 16 O2 → 2 A O_8.

Wait, but that would imply that A has an oxidation state of +8, which is extremely rare. Most metals don't go that high. So, maybe this line of thinking is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is AO4, which would require 4 moles of O2 per mole of A. But the problem states 8 equivalents, so perhaps that's not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible point group of E without knowing its exact structure.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

The most common extremely hazardous gas with a known point group is phosgene (COCl2), which has D∞h symmetry because it's a planar molecule with a center of inversion.

Alternatively, sarin gas is a chiral molecule, but I'm not sure about its point group.

Another possibility: if E is ozone (O3), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

But let's think about how E is formed. C reacts with 2 equivalents of H2 to form E.

If C is a compound that upon reaction with H2 forms O3, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe C is O2, and the reaction with H2 forms H2O and O3. But that's speculative.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let's make an educated guess based on the point group options.

If E is a linear molecule, it's D∞h (option C). If it's a bent molecule, it's C2v (option D).

Given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's O3 (ozone), which is a toxic gas and has C2v symmetry. So the answer would be option D.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (COCl2), which is planar and has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: What if E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, but Cl2 is B, the initial gas. So that's not possible.

Wait, another possibility: E is HCN. HCN is a linear molecule (D∞h symmetry) and is highly toxic. So, how would HCN be formed?

If C is (CN)2, and it reacts with H2 to form 2 HCN. Then, E would be HCN, which has D∞h symmetry. So the point group would be D∞h, option C.

But how would (CN)2 form from A and O2? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a cyanide salt, but that seems less likely.

Perhaps I should conclude that E has D∞h symmetry, making the answer option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group (point group) of product E based on the given reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - Bright red solids often include compounds like lead dioxide (PbO₂) or vanadium(V) oxide (V₂O₅). However, the exact identity of A and C remains unclear.  
   - The stoichiometry suggests a high oxidation state for A, but common metals like lead or vanadium do not match the description perfectly.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous.  
   - Gas D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂ (a common diatomic gas), D could be H₂, and H would be H₂O.  
   - E is a highly toxic gas. Possible candidates include ozone (O₃), phosgene (COCl₂), or hydrogen cyanide (HCN). These gases are linear or bent and have distinct symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - This suggests C is likely an anhydride or a compound that hydrolyzes into acids. For example, sulfur trioxide (SO₃) reacts with water to form H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and possibly another acid. However, the exact identity of C remains uncertain.

4. **Symmetry Analysis**:  
   - The options for the point group of E are **C₂**, **D₄h**, **D∞h**, and **C₂v**.  
   - **D∞h** corresponds to linear molecules with a center of symmetry, such as CO₂, HCN, or O₂.  
   - **C₂v** corresponds to bent molecules like O₃ or SO₂.  
   - Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, HCN (linear, D∞h) or ozone (bent, C₂v) are plausible candidates.  

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the reasoning, E is most likely a linear molecule with **D∞h** symmetry, as this aligns with the description of a highly hazardous gas like HCN or phosgene.  

ANSWER: C
