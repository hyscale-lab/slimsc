Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used for accelerating charged particles, right? But wait, synchrocyclotrons are a bit different because they have a varying magnetic field, I think. Or was it the electric field that's varying? Maybe I should clarify that.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, what's the formula for the number of revolutions in such a setup? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I recall that in cyclotrons, the time for each revolution is determined by the magnetic field and the particle's momentum. But since this is a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field isn't constant. Oh right, in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field increases as the particles gain energy. That must be important because the frequency of the applied voltage has to match the changing orbital frequency of the particle.

So, the key here is probably the phase matching between the particle's motion and the electric field. The voltage is oscillating at a certain frequency, which the proton needs to be in sync with to keep accelerating each time it passes through the electric field region.

The problem gives the voltage as U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. I wonder what ν(α) stands for. Oh, maybe it's the frequency as a function of some parameter α, perhaps the radius of the proton's orbit or the magnetic field strength. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe α is the angle or something else. Hmm, perhaps ν(α) is the angular frequency, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about the general approach.

In a synchrocyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap between the dees, and the voltage is applied in such a way that it's synchronous with the particle's motion. The phase Φ0 might be the initial phase shift of the voltage.

The kinetic energy gained by the proton is 950 MeV. Since the proton starts with negligible kinetic energy, the total energy comes from the acceleration. The voltage U0 is 190 kV. Each time the proton passes through the voltage, it gains some energy. But wait, isn't the energy gain per revolution related to the voltage? Like, each time the proton completes a cycle and the voltage is in the right phase, it gets a kick of energy.

Wait, but wait. The energy per revolution is approximately eU0, where e is the charge of the proton. Because when the voltage is applied, the potential difference across the gap is U0, so the energy gain per cycle is eU0. But wait, the exact energy gained depends on the phase as well. Oh, but if the phase is correct, each time the proton passes through, it gets a full eU0. So, if the phase is such that the voltage is maximum when the proton is in the gap, then each revolution gives a full energy boost.

So, the total number of revolutions N would be the total energy divided by the energy per revolution. So N = T1/(eU0). Wait, but let me check the units.

T1 is 950 MeV. e is the elementary charge, which is 1.6e-19 coulombs. U0 is 190 kV, so 190,000 volts.

Calculating eU0: 1.6e-19 C * 190e3 V = 1.6e-19 * 1.9e5 = (1.6 * 1.9) * 1e-14 = 3.04e-14 J. But wait, 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 3.04e-14 J is (3.04e-14 J) / (1.6e-19 J/eV) = approximately 1.9e5 eV, which is 190 keV. Oh, so eU0 is 190 keV per revolution.

So the total energy is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV. Dividing that by 190 keV per revolution gives 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000 revolutions. Wait, but let me compute that: 190 × 5000 = 950,000. Exactly, so 5000 revolutions. But that's not one of the options. The options are A) 1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in the problem statement, the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. So each acceleration is per something else. Or maybe I'm missing something about the voltage.

Wait, maybe the voltage is applied in such a way that it's not a full eU0 each time because of the phase. The phase is given as Φ0= π/4. So the initial phase is 45 degrees. How does that affect the energy gain?

The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2πν t + Φ0). So the time when the proton enters the gap is when the voltage is at a certain phase. The energy gain each time depends on the integral of the electric field over the distance, but perhaps for a sinusoidal voltage, the effective energy gain per revolution depends on the phase.

Alternatively, maybe the energy per revolution is e U0 sin(Φ0). Because the voltage is at phase Φ0 when the proton arrives. Wait, perhaps the maximum energy transfer occurs when the voltage is at its peak, but if the phase is π/4, the initial voltage is U0 cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2. So the maximum energy gain would be e U0 * sqrt(2)/2 each time.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the effective energy gained per revolution is e U0, regardless of the phase, if the system is designed to always apply the same phase each time the proton arrives. Or perhaps the phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions because the system synchronizes. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the number of revolutions is determined by the time it takes to reach the desired energy, multiplied by the frequency of the voltage.

Because the proton is accelerated each time it goes through the gap. The number of times it goes through is the number of revolutions.

Alternatively, the time taken to reach 950 MeV can be found, and the number of revolutions is the time multiplied by the frequency.

But wait, how do I find the time? The energy is given, but how is the energy gained over time?

In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time, so the cyclotron frequency also changes. The cyclotron frequency ω is given by (e B)/(γ m), where γ is the Lorentz factor. Since B increases, ω increases as the proton gains energy.

But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the energy per revolution is e U0 (if phase is correct). So the number of revolutions N is T1 / (e U0), which is 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV) = 950000 / 190 = 5000. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So maybe each revolution gives two accelerations? Or perhaps each acceleration happens per half-cycle? Or maybe the voltage is applied twice per revolution?

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage has a frequency that's twice the rotation frequency. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(...). The argument is 2π ν(α) t + Φ0. So the frequency is ν(α). But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage must match the cyclotron frequency of the particle. But since the magnetic field is increasing, the cyclotron frequency increases as the particle gains energy.

Wait, but how is the time spent in the synchrocyclotron calculated? Maybe the time is determined by the velocity and the radius, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is not exactly T1/(e U0), but adjusted by some factor. Maybe the initial phase affects the effective energy per revolution.

Wait, when the voltage is applied, the particle is accelerated each time it passes through the gap. The energy gained each time depends on the phase of the voltage when the particle arrives.

If the voltage is at its peak when the particle arrives, maximum energy is transferred each time. But in this case, the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So the first time the particle arrives, the voltage is U0 cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2. So the energy gained first time is e U0 * sqrt(2)/2. Then, as the particle gains energy, the time per revolution changes, and the phase of the voltage at each arrival may change. But in a synchrocyclotron, the system is designed to keep the phase matched so that the particle always arrives when the voltage is at the correct phase for maximum acceleration. So perhaps the phase adjustment is done automatically, and each time, the particle gets e U0 of energy.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the initial phase only affects the first acceleration, but once the system is synchronized, the phase doesn't matter anymore.

Wait, but the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, that's confusing. If each acceleration is a single push, then perhaps each acceleration corresponds to a certain number of revolutions.

Wait, perhaps the proton starts with T ≈0, and after first acceleration, it gains some energy, and after the second acceleration, it gets to 950 MeV. So two accelerations in total, implying two revolutions? That can't be right because the answer options are much larger.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton goes through a gap, it's accelerated once. So, the number of gaps it passes through is N, and each gives e U0 energy. So N = T1/(e U0) = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. The closest is B)5300. Hmm, but why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the initial phase affects the effective energy per revolution. Since the phase is π/4, maybe each revolution doesn't give a full e U0, but a fraction.

Wait, the energy per revolution would be e * U0 * cos(Φ0) if the phase is matched each time. Or maybe e * U0 sin(Φ0), depending on how the phase is applied. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible energy per revolution is when the phase is zero, and for other phases, it's less. But if the system is designed to always have the correct phase, then perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the total number, because it's adjusted as the particle moves.

Alternatively, since the initial phase is π/4, the first time the proton arrives, it doesn't get maximum energy. So perhaps the effective energy per revolution is less, requiring more revolutions to reach the same total energy.

Wait, let's think in terms of the first passage. The proton comes into the gap the first time at t=0. The voltage at t=0 is U(0) = U0 cos(Φ0) = U0 cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 134.35 kV. So the energy gained is e * 134.35 kV ≈ 134.35 MeV? No, wait, no. Wait, e U0 is 190 keV, so 190 * 0.707 ≈ 134 keV. So the first acceleration gives 134 keV.

Then, each subsequent acceleration gives 190 keV. Hmm, but that complicates the calculation because the energy per revolution isn't the same each time.

Wait, but that can't be right because in a synchrocyclotron, the system is designed to have the correct phase each time. So the phase shift is adjusted as the particle's orbit changes. So, the initial phase might not matter in the long run because the system is phase-locked.

So perhaps the average energy per revolution is e U0, and the initial phase only affects the first step. So the total number of revolutions would still be approximately 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the units. Let me double-check:

T1 is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV.

Each revolution gives approximately e U0 = 190 keV.

So 950,000 / 190 = approx 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. The closest is B)5300 and C)3536. So maybe I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is applied in such a way that each gap provides e U0, but the number of gaps is twice the number of revolutions. Because in a cyclotron, each revolution includes two gaps (each dee has a gap). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case for a synchrocyclotron. Maybe in each revolution, the proton passes through one gap, receives an acceleration, and then another gap in the same revolution, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is half the number of times the voltage is applied. So if the number of applications is N, the number of revolutions would be N/2.

Wait, but the voltage is applied at a certain frequency, so perhaps the number of times the voltage completes a cycle is the number of revolutions multiplied by the frequency ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the frequency of the voltage ν is such that ν is the number of cycles per second, and the number of revolutions per second is determined by the cyclotron frequency, which is changing as the proton accelerates.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy gained is equal to the total energy provided by the voltage. Since each revolution allows the proton to gain e U0, the number of revolutions N is T1/(e U0).

But let's compute this precisely.

T1 = 950 MeV = 950,000,000 eV.

e U0 = 190,000 eV (since U0 is 190 kV).

So N = 950,000,000 / 190,000 ≈ 5000.

But looking at the options, the closest is B)5300 and D)2500. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 950,000,000 / 190,000.

Calculating:

950,000,000 ÷ 190,000.

We can simplify this: 950e6 / 190e3 = (950 / 190) * (1e6 / 1e3) )= 5 * 1000 = 5000. So yeah, 5000.

But options don't have that. The options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, perhaps the U0 given is the peak-to-peak voltage? No, because the formula uses U0 as the amplitude. Wait the formula is U(t) = U0 cos(...), so the maximum is U0. So the max voltage is 190 kV, so each revolution gives e * 190 kV, which is 190 keV per revolution.

Wait, but maybe the acceleration is not exactly e U0 each time because of the phase. Let me think about the average energy transfer.

The energy transfer per revolution is e U0 times the average value of cos^2(Φ), perhaps? Or something like that. Because when you have the electric field doing work over a distance, the effective energy gain depends on the integral of E · dx, which for a sinusoidal voltage would involve the square of the voltage.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps each acceleration corresponds to a certain number of revolutions. But that doesn't make much sense. Or maybe the voltage is applied in two different regions, each giving 950 MeV. No, the problem says the proton is accelerated twice to reach 950 MeV. Wait, that would imply that each acceleration gives 475 MeV, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps each acceleration step consists of multiple revolutions. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the formula for the number of revolutions involves the phase. Since the initial phase is π/4, maybe the effective energy per revolution is e U0 sin(Φ0), or something like that.

Wait, let me think. The energy gain per revolution is e multiplied by the integral of the electric field over the distance. Since the electric field is E = -dU/dx, but in this case, the voltage is applied across the gap in the synchrocyclotron. So each time the proton moves through the gap, it gains energy based on the voltage.

Wait, but the voltage is oscillating, so the energy added each time depends on the phase when the proton passes through.

So the average energy per revolution would be e U0 times the average of cos^2(θ) over a cycle, perhaps? Or something else.

Wait, the energy gained each time is e * integral of E · dl, and E is related to the voltage. For a sinusoidal voltage, the energy per revolution would be e U0 (something).

Alternatively, the effective voltage is the root mean square (RMS) value. The RMS of U(t) is U0 / sqrt(2), so the energy per revolution would be e * (U0 / sqrt(2)).

So then N = T1 / (e (U0 / sqrt(2))) ) = T1 * sqrt(2) / (e U0).

So plugging in the numbers:

N = (950e6 eV) * sqrt(2) / (190e3 eV) )

Compute that:

950e6 / 190e3 = 5000.

Multiply by sqrt(2) ≈1.4142: 5000 * 1.4142 ≈7071.

That's way higher than the options given. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the initial phase affects the first few steps, but the rest are at maximum efficiency.

Alternatively, maybe the number of revolutions is (T1/(e U0)) plus some function of the initial phase.

But I'm not really getting anywhere with this approach.

Another thought: the cyclotron frequency is related to the magnetic field and the particle's momentum. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases to keep the cyclotron frequency matched to the applied voltage frequency.

The cyclotron frequency is ω = (e B)/(γ m), where γ is the Lorentz factor. Since B is increasing, ω is increasing as the particle gains energy.

The frequency of the applied voltage ν must match ω/(2π) for each orbit.

But how does that help with the number of revolutions?

Alternatively, perhaps the time taken to reach the desired energy can be calculated, and the number of revolutions is the product of the time and the frequency.

But to find the time, I need to know how the energy increases with time. Hmm, but integrating that might be complicated.

Wait, let's consider the energy as a function of time. The energy gained is e U0 times the number of times the particle passes through the gap. Each passage is a revolution, I think.

So number of revolutions N = T1/(e U0) = 950e6 / 190e3 ≈5000.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the correct approach is different. Let me look for another way.

Wait, maybe the energy per revolution is not e U0, but e U0 multiplied by something else, like the fraction of the cycle where the voltage is in the correct phase.

Wait, the voltage is applied as a sinusoid. The particle is accelerated each time it passes through the gap during the correct phase. So the effective energy per revolution is e U0 times the duty cycle.

But in a typical setup, the voltage is applied for a certain fraction of the time. For maximum efficiency, the system is designed so that the particle arrives each time the voltage is at its peak. So the duty cycle is 100%, and the energy per revolution is e U0.

But in this problem, the initial phase is π/4. So the first time the particle arrives, the voltage is at U0 cos(π/4) = U0 sqrt(2)/2. So the first energy gain is e U0 sqrt(2)/2. Then, as the system adjusts, maybe the phase is corrected so that subsequent gains are e U0 each time.

But in that case, the number of revolutions would be (T1 - e U0 sqrt(2)/2 ) / (e U0) ) + 1.

So T1 = 950e6 eV.

e U0 = 190e3 eV.

So 190e3 eV * 0.7071 ≈134e3 eV.

So the remaining energy is 950e6 -134e3 = 949,866,000 eV.

Number of revolutions after the first one: 949,866,000 /190,000 ≈ 5000.

Wait, 949,866,000 /190,000 = (949,866,000 / 190,000) = 5000 - (134,000 /190,000) ≈5000 -0.705≈4999.3.

So total revolutions would be 4999.3 +1 ≈4999.3≈5000.

Still doesn't match the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the number of revolutions is determined by how many times the voltage completes a half-cycle, because the cyclotron accelerates the particle once per half-cycle. Wait, in a typical cyclotron, the voltage is applied once per revolution, but perhaps in a synchrocyclotron, each half-cycle corresponds to a potential acceleration.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is about half of the initial calculation. So 5000 /2 =2500, which is option D. But why would that be?

Wait, but the voltage is applied as a sinusoid. The electric field is maximum at the extremes of the voltage. In a synchrocyclotron, the acceleration occurs each time the proton passes through the gap. The voltage is applied at a certain phase, and each time, the proton experiences the electric field in the gap. So perhaps each revolution corresponds to one application of the voltage, resulting in one acceleration.

Wait, but then the number of revolutions would be 5000, but that's not an option. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Another angle: the cyclotron frequency depends on the magnetic field and the energy. The time for each revolution is T_rev = (2π m)/(e B γ). Since B is increasing, T_rev decreases as the proton gains energy.

The number of revolutions N is the integral of dN/dt dt from t=0 to t=total time.

But dN/dt is 1/T_rev, so N is the integral of T_rev^{-1} dt.

But integrating this would require knowing how B changes with time, which depends on the energy gained.

Alternatively, maybe the total number of revolutions can be approximated by the ratio of the total energy to the energy per revolution, considering the varying magnetic field.

But I'm not sure. This is getting too complicated.

Wait, another thought. The problem gives the voltage as U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν(α) t + Φ0). The frequency ν(α) is probably the angular frequency divided by 2π. So ν(α) is the frequency of the voltage.

In a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the voltage must match the cyclotron frequency of the proton, which is given by ν_cyclotron = (e B)/(2 π γ m). But since B is changing, ν_cyclotron is changing as the proton gains energy. However, in a synchrocyclotron, the voltage frequency is adjusted to match this varying cyclotron frequency. So the system is phase-locked, allowing the proton to always be accelerated when it passes through the gap.

So, the number of revolutions N is equal to the total time spent divided by the time per revolution.

But to find the total time, I need to know how the energy increases with time, which might require integrating the acceleration. Hmm.

The kinetic energy T is related to the momentum p by T = p²/(2m) - mc². But since T is much less than the rest mass energy (which is about 938 MeV), perhaps we can approximate T ≈ p²/(2m), so p = sqrt(2 m T).

The momentum p increases with each acceleration. The velocity v is p/m ≈ sqrt(2 T/m).

The time per revolution is the circumference divided by the velocity. The circumference is 2 π r, where r is the radius of the orbit.

r is given by r = (p)/(e B), where B is the magnetic field. But in a synchrocyclotron, B increases to keep the cyclotron frequency matched to the voltage frequency.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe the total time can be found by integrating dt = (2 π r)/v over the energy gain.

But this seems too involved. Let me think of another way.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions is approximately the total energy divided by the energy per revolution, but considering relativistic effects. Wait, but the problem states that T is approximately 950 MeV, which is about 10 times the rest mass energy (since 938 MeV is the rest mass). So relativistic effects would be significant. Hmm, but maybe the problem ignores relativistic effects, as it's a basic question.

Wait, but the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the proton starts non-relativistically, but as it gains energy, it becomes relativistic. So the time per revolution would change, but the exact calculation would be complicated.

Is there a formula that relates the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron to the energy gained?

I think I'm stuck. Let me try another approach. Since the options are given, perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the calculation of N ≈5000, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach involves an average energy per revolution less than e U0.

Wait, another idea: The potential energy change per revolution is e U0 * cos(Φ0). So the energy per revolution is e U0 cos(Φ0). So N = T1/(e U0 cos Φ0).

Phi0 is π/4, so cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2. So,

N = 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV * 0.7071) = 950e6/(190e3 * 0.7071) ≈ 950e6/(134e3) ≈ 7085.

But this is not an option either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Phi0 = π/4, so cos(Phi0) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071.

So, 190e3 * 0.7071 ≈134,350 eV.

So 950e6 / 134,350 ≈ 7071.

No, still not matching the options.

Wait, maybe the initial phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions because the system adjusts the phase so that each acceleration gives e U0, making the initial phase negligible. So N would be 5000.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Another angle: the number of revolutions is related to the frequency and the energy. The voltage frequency ν is given by the cyclotron frequency, which is (e B)/(2 π m). But since B varies, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found via integrating something.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions N is given by the integral from 0 to T of ν(t) dt, where ν(t) is the cyclotron frequency at time t.

But I'm not sure how to find ν(t) without knowing B(t), which depends on the energy.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: each revolution, the proton gains a certain amount of energy. If the initial phase is π/4, the first revolution gives (e U0) * cos(pi/4) = e U0 * sqrt(2)/2. Each subsequent revolution gives e U0.

So, let's compute that.

First, compute the energy after the first revolution: E1 = e U0 * sqrt(2)/2 = 190,000 * 0.7071 ≈134,350 eV.

Then, the remaining energy is 950,000,000 - 134,350 ≈949,865,650 eV.

Each subsequent revolution gives 190,000 eV.

Number of revolutions after the first: 949,865,650 / 190,000 ≈5000.

So total revolutions N = 1 + 5000 =5001. Still not matching the options.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the total count because the system adjusts. So the answer should be around 5000, but since it's not an option, perhaps option B)5300 is the intended answer, being close to 5000.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula N = (T1) / (e U0) * (something). Or maybe the voltage is 190 kV peak-to-peak, not peak. But the question states U(t) has amplitude U0, so it's peak.

Wait, another possibility: the voltage is applied twice per revolution, meaning the effective energy per revolution is 2 * e U0. So N = T1/(2 e U0) = 950e6/(380e3) = 2500, which is option D.

That's one of the options. So why would the voltage be applied twice per revolution?

In a cyclotron, each dee has a gap, and the voltage alternates between the dees. So for each full revolution, the proton crosses two gaps, each time being accelerated. So maybe each revolution provides two accelerations, each giving e U0, for a total of 2e U0 per revolution.

But wait, in that case, the energy per revolution would be 2e U0. So N = T1/(2 e U0) = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) )= 950e6/(380e3)= 2500. That would be option D.

But the problem statement says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps each acceleration corresponds to a gap, and two accelerations happen per revolution. So each revolution gives two accelerations, each providing e U0. So total energy per revolution is 2 e U0.

So in that case, the number of revolutions is T1/(2 e U0) = 950e6/(2 * 190e3) = 950e6 /380e3=2500, which is option D.

But wait, the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. So maybe the two accelerations are per revolution. So each revolution gives two accelerations, each providing e U0. So the energy per revolution is 2 e U0.

So number of revolutions N = T1/(2 e U0) = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) = 950e6 / 380e3 = (950 / 380) * 1e3 = 2.5 * 1e3=2500. That's option D.

But wait, the original calculation I did without considering two accelerations per revolution gave 5000, but that wasn't an option. Now, considering two accelerations per revolution, I get 2500, which is option D.

But the problem statement says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Does that mean two in total to reach the energy? Then, that would imply only two revolutions, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is that the voltage is applied twice per revolution, leading to two accelerations per revolution.

Therefore, the correct number of revolutions would be 2500, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the given data and the energy transfer process. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated to \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The voltage applied in the accelerator is given by:

\[
U(t) = U_0 \cos\left[2\pi \nu(\alpha) t + \Phi_0\right],
\]

where \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\). The key is to calculate the number of revolutions \(N\) based on the energy gained per revolution.

1. **Energy Gain Per Revolution**:  
   Each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains energy. The energy gained per revolution depends on the voltage \(U_0\) and the phase \(\Phi_0\). For a synchrocyclotron, the system is designed to synchronize the proton's motion with the voltage, ensuring maximum energy transfer per revolution. Thus, the energy gained per revolution is approximately \(e U_0\), where \(e\) is the elementary charge.

2. **Total Energy and Revolutions**:  
   The total kinetic energy gained by the proton is \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). Converting this to consistent units:
   \[
   T_1 = 950 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}.
   \]
   The energy per revolution is:
   \[
   e U_0 = 190 \times 10^3 \, \text{eV}.
   \]
   The number of revolutions \(N\) is then:
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{e U_0} = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{190 \times 10^3} = 5000.
   \]

3. **Adjustment for Two Accelerations Per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton undergoes two accelerations per revolution (one in each gap of the dees). This means the energy gained per revolution is effectively doubled:
   \[
   \text{Energy per revolution} = 2 \cdot e U_0 = 2 \cdot 190 \, \text{kV} = 380 \, \text{kV}.
   \]
   Adjusting the calculation for this:
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{2 \cdot e U_0} = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{2 \cdot 190 \times 10^3} = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{380 \times 10^3} = 2500.
   \]

4. **Matching the Options**:  
   The calculated value of \(N = 2500\) matches one of the provided options. The initial phase \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\) does not significantly affect the total number of revolutions because the synchrocyclotron system is designed to synchronize the proton's motion with the voltage, ensuring consistent energy transfer.

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron. This corresponds to option **D**.
