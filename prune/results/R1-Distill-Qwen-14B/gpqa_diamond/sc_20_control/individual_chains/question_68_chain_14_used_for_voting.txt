Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a spin-1/2 particle. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have intrinsic angular momentum, and their magnetic moments are related to that. The particle's magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and Sz is the z-component of the spin. 

The setup is that the magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the change.

Hmm, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. Its spin would be aligned with this field, right? The magnetic moment mu is aligned with B, so the spin is in the +Z direction. So the initial state is probably an eigenstate of Sz, which for spin-1/2 would be either up or down. Since the field is along +Z, the spin would be in the up state, so |+z> or something like that.

Then the magnetic field is switched off, so the field along Z is zero, and a new field along Y is turned on. Wait, but the field along Y is the same magnitude, B. So the new Hamiltonian must be different. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B, but wait, no, the interaction energy is H = -mu · B. But since mu is gamma Sz, then H would be proportional to Sz·B in the initial case. But when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment will interact with H = -gamma S_y B, because mu is in the direction of the field? Or wait, wait. Wait, no, mu is gamma S, so actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the interaction energy is H = -mu · B, which is -gamma (S · B). 

Wait, S is a vector operator, so when the field is along Y, B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y. So the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. 

But wait, I think the standard expression for the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. So μ is the magnetic moment vector, which is given as γ S. So H = -γ S · B. 

In the initial state, the field is along Z, so H_initial = -γ B S_z. But when the field is turned off and Y is turned on, H_final = -γ B S_y. Wait, but in the problem statement, after switching, the field is along Y, so B is same magnitude but direction is Y. So H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but when they turn off the magnetic field, then the system's state is no longer influenced by the previous H, right? So initially, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz because the field was along Z. Then when the field is turned off, the particle's state doesn't change instantaneously. Wait, no, wait. The problem says that the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along Y. So the change is abrupt, so the state of the system doesn't change immediately. So the initial state is the eigenstate of Sz, and then the Hamiltonian changes to H = gamma B S_y (or perhaps -gamma B S_y, depending on the sign convention, but I'll check that later).

Wait, actually, the relationship between mu and Sz is mu = gamma S. So the magnetic moment is a vector, so mu_x = gamma S_x, etc. The energy is H = -mu · B. So when B is along Z, H = -gamma B S_z. When B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but in terms of the time evolution, when the Hamiltonian changes, the state remains the same, but the time evolution after that is governed by the new Hamiltonian.

So the system starts in an eigenstate of Sz, which is |+z> or |−z>. Let's assume it's |+z>, since the field is along +Z direction. So the initial state is |+z>.

After the field is changed, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, but I think the problem states that mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is along Y, mu will have components along Y, so S_y? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. Wait, that's confusing because mu is a vector, but the way it's written suggests that mu is along the z-direction. Alternatively, perhaps mu is proportional to the spin vector. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is that mu is equal to gamma times the spin component in the direction of the magnetic field. But in the initial case, the field is along Z, so mu is gamma S_z. Then when the field is along Y, I think mu would be gamma S_y, so the magnetic moment is along Y. So perhaps the magnetic moment is in the direction of the field. But maybe the problem states that mu is simply gamma times S, so mu = gamma S. Then, the magnetic moment vector is mu = gamma (S_x, S_y, S_z).

Wait, the problem says mu = gamma * S_z. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Or perhaps it's that the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin component along the direction of the magnetic field. So when the field is along Z, mu is gamma S_z. When the field is along Y, mu is gamma S_y. So the magnetic moment is along the field direction.

Wait, but regardless, the Hamiltonian will be H = - mu · B. So if mu is along the field direction, then when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

But wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z, which suggests that mu is in the z-direction. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction." Oh, so mu is aligned with B, which is along +Z. So mu is along +Z. So when B is turned off, then another field is turned on along +Y. So the new B is along Y, so the new mu would be along Y? Or does mu stay as gamma S_z, regardless of the direction of B? That's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The mu is given as gamma * Sz, so mu is a vector component in the z-direction. But when the magnetic field is turned along Y, how does mu relate? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about how the Hamiltonian changes based on the direction of B.

In any case, the Hamiltonian after the change is H = -gamma B S_y, because the field is along Y. Because B is same magnitude, same direction? So let's proceed with H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y because the energy is proportional to the dot product of mu and B. Wait, no, the energy is U = -mu · B. So if mu = gamma S_z, then for B along Z, H = -gamma B S_z. For B along Y, mu would be gamma S_y, so H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait: mu is given as gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, what's the mu? Because mu is a vector, it's just the spin in z-direction. Hmm, that would make the interaction energy zero when the field is along Y. But that can't be right because the problem says that the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the mu.

Alternatively, perhaps mu is the magnitude, and the direction is along the spin. Wait, no, that's not standard. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps mu is a vector that is the spin multiplied by gamma, so mu = gamma * S, where S is the vector (Sx, Sy, Sz). So then, the Hamiltonian when B is along Y is H = - mu · B = -gamma B Sy.

But wait, if mu = gamma S, then mu · B = gamma (Sx Bx + Sy By + Sz Bz). When B is along Y, Bx and Bz are zero, so H = -gamma B Sy.

So the Hamiltonian after the change is H = -gamma B Sy. But wait, the problem states that mu equals gamma*Sz, so perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the mu is a vector that points along the field direction. So when B is in Z, mu is gamma Sz. When B is in Y, mu is gamma Sy.

Wait, but that would imply that the mu changes direction when the magnetic field changes. But in the problem statement, mu is given as equal to gamma Sz regardless of B's direction. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense because the mu would then always be along Z, even when the field is along Y.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's think again. The problem says mu equals gamma * Sz. So mu is a vector with components (0, 0, gamma S_z), because S_z is the z-component of spin, which is either +ħ/2 or -ħ/2 for spin-1/2. But when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction energy would be U = - mu · B. Since mu is along Z and B is along Y, the dot product is zero. So the energy doesn't change. But the problem says the average z-component starts oscillating, which suggests that the system is evolving under some Hamiltonian.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and mu is actually given as mu = gamma S, where S is the vector operator. So mu is (gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz). Then, when the field is along Z, H = -mu · B = -gamma B Sz. When the field is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy.

So in this case, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz (since the field was along Z), and the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. So the state would evolve under H = -gamma B Sy. 

Wait, but the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. So perhaps I'm not supposed to think of mu as a vector. Or perhaps the problem is that the magnetic moment is proportional to Sz, so mu_z = gamma Sz, and the other components are zero. So when the field is along Y, the interaction energy would be zero, but that can't be right because the problem states that the average of the z-component oscillates. Therefore, maybe I'm wrong in how I'm interpreting mu.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. So mu is a vector, and when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed without getting stuck on this, assuming that mu is a vector and that the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy.

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. But after the field change, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. The time evolution of the state is governed by this Hamiltonian.

The oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z. Since mu_z is gamma times Sz, the average mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of Sz.

So I need to find how <Sz> evolves over time and then find the frequency of its oscillation.

The time evolution is governed by the Schrodinger equation. The state at time t will be |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>, where |ψ(0)> is the initial state.

But since H = -gamma B Sy, I can write H as proportional to Sy. Let's write H as H = ω Sy, where omega is some frequency. Wait, let me compute H in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, H = -gamma B Sy. The energy levels for spin-1/2 in a field along Y would have energies proportional to Sy. The eigenvalues would be ± (gamma B / 2), because Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H has eigenvalues E_+ = (gamma B / 2), E_- = -(gamma B / 2) [Wait, because H = -gamma B Sy, so Sy |+y> = (ħ/2)|+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> = (-gamma B ħ/2) |+y>, so E_+ = -gamma B ħ/2. Wait, perhaps I should be careful here.

Wait, perhaps I should express H in terms of angular frequency. Let me think: the energy levels for spin in a magnetic field are E = -mu · B. So for a spin-1/2 particle, mu = gamma S, so E = -gamma B (S · n), where n is the direction of B. So when B is along Y, E = -gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2, so E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

But in terms of time evolution, the time dependence of the state depends on the energy differences. The system will undergo precession around the Y-axis, causing transitions between |+y> and |−y> states, which would cause oscillations in observables.

But the initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |−y> states. So let me write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>.

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |−y>, which can be expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z> as follows:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/sqrt(2)

So the initial state |+z> can be written as:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no. Let me think again. The basis states for Sy are |+y> and |−y>, which are combinations of |+z> and |−z>.

So, |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2

So, solving for |+z> and |−z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/√2
|−z> = (|+y> − |−y>)/√2

So our initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/√2.

Now, under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B Sy, each energy eigenstate |+y> and |−y> will pick up a phase factor over time.

The time evolution of |+y> is exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y>
Similarly, |−y> evolves as exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |−y>

Since |+z> is a combination of these, the time-evolved state |ψ(t)> is:

|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-i E_+ t/ħ) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/ħ) |−y> ]

Substituting E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2) (Wait, earlier I thought E_+ was -gamma B (ħ/2), but let's double-check that. H = -gamma B Sy. Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2). Similarly, E_- = -gamma B (-ħ/2) = gamma B (ħ/2).

So the exponents become:

exp( -i E_+ t/ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )
exp( -i E_- t/ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

So substituting back:

|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y> ]

Now, we can express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2

Substituting these in:

|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + |−z>)/√2 + exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> - |−z>)/√2 ]

Simplify this:

= (1/√2) [ [exp(i gamma B t/2) + exp(-i gamma B t/2)] |+z> / √2 
+ [exp(i gamma B t/2) - exp(-i gamma B t/2)] |−z> / √2 ]

The terms in the brackets can be expressed using Euler's formula. 

Note that exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ
And exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ

So:

= (1/√2) [ [2 cos( gamma B t/2 ) ] |+z> / √2 
+ [2i sin( gamma B t/2 ) ] |−z> / √2 ]

Simplify the constants:

= (1/√2) * (2 / √2) [ cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z> ]

Since 2/(√2 * √2) = 2/(2) = 1, so:

|ψ(t)> = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z>

Wait, but cos and sin have arguments (gamma B t / 2). Hmm.

Now, the expectation value of Sz is <Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>

Sz is (ħ/2) for |+z> and (-ħ/2) for |−z>.

So compute <Sz(t)>:

= [ cos(θ) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [i sin(theta)]^2 (-ħ/2)
Where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Wait, let's compute each term:

<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [i sin(theta)]^2 ( - ħ/2 )

Wait, because |+z> contributes (ħ/2) and |−z> contributes (-ħ/2).

Alternatively, compute each term:

The state is |ψ(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z>
The conjugate is <ψ(t)| = cos(theta) <+z| - i sin(theta) <−z|

So:

<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = [cos(theta) < +z | + (-i sin(theta) < -z | ) ] * Sz [ cos(theta) | +z> + i sin(theta) | -z> ]

Expanding this:

= cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | Sz | +z > 
+ cos(theta) (-i sin(theta)) < +z | Sz | -z > 
+ (-i sin(theta)) cos(theta) < -z | Sz | +z > 
+ (-i sin(theta)) (i sin(theta)) < -z | Sz | -z >

Compute each term:

< +z | Sz | +z > = ħ/2
< +z | Sz | -z > = 0 (since Sz is diagonal in the z basis)
< -z | Sz | +z > = 0
< -z | Sz | -z > = -ħ/2

So the terms become:

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2)
+ 0
+ 0
+ ( (-i)(i) ) sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2)
But (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1, so:

= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ( -ħ/2 * (-1) )
= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + (ħ/2) sin^2(theta)
= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ]
= (ħ/2) * 1
= ħ/2

Wait, that can't be right because the expectation value of Sz isn't changing with time. But the problem states that the average z-component starts oscillating. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the expectation value more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let me recompute:

<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [ i sin(theta) ]^2 ( - ħ/2 )

Because when you expand it, the cross terms (involving < +z | Sz | -z >) are zero because Sz is diagonal.

So cross terms would be cos(theta) * i sin(theta) [ < +z | Sz | -z > ] which is zero.

So:

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + (i^2) sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

i^2 is -1, so:

= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + (-1) * sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )
= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + (ħ/2) sin^2(theta)
= ħ/2 [ cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ]
= ħ/2 * 1
= ħ/2.

Hmm, that's a problem. It's a constant, implying that the average Sz doesn't change. But the problem says it starts oscillating. So clearly, I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time evolution. Let me double-check the time evolution of the state. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the time evolution of the expectation value differently.

Wait, perhaps I should find the time dependence of the expectation value of Sz more carefully.

Wait, another approach: The time evolution is given by H = -gamma B Sy. The system starts in the state |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. The time evolution under H will cause transitions between |+z> and |−z> states.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

So the state at time t is |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z>

Now, H = -gamma B Sy. Sy has eigenstates |+y> and |−y> with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

But perhaps it's easier to write H in terms of Pauli matrices. For a spin-1/2 particle, Sy can be written as (ħ/2) sigma_y, where sigma_y is the Pauli Y matrix.

So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y

So H = - (gamma B ħ/2) sigma_y

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

Substituting H:

U(t) = exp( -i [ -gamma B ħ/2 sigma_y ] t / ħ )
= exp( i gamma B sigma_y t / 2 )

Because (gamma B ħ/2) * t / ħ = gamma B t / 2.

So U(t) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )

We can compute this using the expansion of the exponential. Since sigma_y is a Pauli matrix, we know that sigma_y^2 = I, sigma_y^3 = sigma_y, etc.

The expansion for exp(i theta sigma_y) is cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)

So U(t) = cos( gamma B t/2 ) I + i sigma_y sin(gamma B t/2 )

Now, the initial state |+z> is represented as a column vector (1; 0). Let's apply U(t) to |+z>:

|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] (1; 0 )

Where theta = gamma B t/2.

Computing this:

cos(theta) * [1 0; 0 1] (1; 0) = cos(theta) (1; 0)

i sigma_y sin(theta) * (1; 0) = i sigma_y (1; 0) sin(theta)

sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so sigma_y (1; 0) = [0, -i; i, 0] (1; 0) = [ -i; 0 ]

So, i sigma_y (1; 0) = i [ -i; 0 ] = [ (-i)(i), 0 ] = [ 1; 0 ]

Because i*(-i) = 1.

So, putting it together:

U(t)|+z> = cos(theta) (1; 0) + sin(theta) (1; 0 ) = [ cos(theta) + sin(theta) ; 0 ]

Wait, that can't be right because when you apply sigma_y to |+z>, you get |+x> or something else. Maybe I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication.

Wait, let me recompute the sigma_y multiplication.

sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So sigma_y multiplied by (1; 0) is [0*1 + (-i)*0; i*1 + 0*0 ] = [0; i*1] = [0; i]

Wait, that's different. So sigma_y (1;0) = [0; i]

Then, i * sigma_y (1;0) = i * [0; i] = [0; i^2 ] = [0; -1]

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

So, going back:

U(t) |+z> = [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] (1; 0)
= cos(theta) * (1; 0) + i sigma_y sin(theta) * (1;0)
= [cos(theta); 0] + [ 0; i sin(theta) ] * sigma_y (1;0) ?

Wait, perhaps I should represent the matrices more carefully.

Wait, U(t) is a 2x2 matrix:

U(t) = [[ cos(theta) , i sin(theta) ],
         [ i sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]

Wait, because sigma_y has eigenvalues, and when expanded, the exponential for sigma_y is:

exp( i theta sigma_y ) = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)

Which, in matrix form, is:

[ [cos(theta), i sin(theta)], 
  [i sin(theta), cos(theta)] ]

So applying this to |+z> = (1; 0):

U(t)|+z> = [ cos(theta)*1 + i sin(theta)*0 ; i sin(theta)*1 + cos(theta)*0 ]
= [ cos(theta); i sin(theta) ]

So the state at time t is |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ]^T, where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Now, the expectation value of Sz is <+z| Sz |psi(t)>

Sz is represented by the Pauli Z matrix: diag(1, -1) multiplied by ħ/2.

So, compute <Sz>:

<Sz> = (1/2) [ <+z| Z |psi(t) > ]

Because Sz = (ħ/2) Z, so the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation of Z.

Compute <+z| Z |psi(t) >.

Z is diagonal: [1, 0; 0, -1]

So Z |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta)*1 ; i sin(theta)*(-1) ]

Then, <+z| Z |psi(t) > = cos(theta) * 1 + (0)(i sin(theta) (-1)) ) = cos(theta)

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) * cos(theta) = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t/2 )

Wait, but the problem states that mu = gamma S_z, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma * <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(theta)

Wait, but the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z. So mu_z = gamma <S_z> = gamma (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t/2 )

But wait, the average is oscillating as cos( gamma B t/2 ), so the frequency is gamma B / (2 * 2π) ?

Wait, no. The oscillation's angular frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine function. So in cos( (gamma B / 2 ) t ), the angular frequency omega is (gamma B / 2 )

So the frequency f is omega/(2 pi) = (gamma B)/(4 pi )

But looking at the options, I don't see any with 4 pi. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the earlier steps.

Wait, in the time evolution, we found that <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(theta), where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

So the average mu_z is gamma * (ħ/2) cos(theta) = (gamma ħ/2) cos( gamma B t/2 )

But the oscillation frequency comes from the argument of the cosine. The argument is (gamma B/2) * t, so the angular frequency is (gamma B/2), and the ordinary frequency is (gamma B)/(2 * 2 pi) )= gamma B / (4 pi )

But none of the options have 4 pi in the denominator. The options are:

A) gamma B/2
B) gamma B
C) sqrt(2) gamma B
D) gamma B/sqrt(2)

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Hamiltonian. Let's re-express the Hamiltonian correctly.

The problem says mu = gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, the interaction energy is H = -mu · B = -gamma S_z B_y. Since B_y is B (as the field is along Y), H = -gamma B S_z.

Wait, that's a different approach. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_z.

Wait, that's a crucial point. I think I mixed up the direction of the magnetic moment.

Wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z, so the magnetic moment is along Z, regardless of the B field direction. Because mu is defined as gamma S_z. So when the magnetic field is turned along Y, the interaction energy is H = - mu · B = -gamma S_z B_y.

Since B is along Y, B_y = B, and others are zero. So H = -gamma B S_z.

So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_z.

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So under this Hamiltonian, the state doesn't change, because it's an eigenstate. That would mean no oscillation, but the problem says the average z-component starts oscillating. So that can't be right.

Hmm, so this suggests that I must have made a mistake in interpreting mu.

Alternatively, perhaps mu is a vector that is proportional to the spin vector. So mu = gamma S, with S being the vector operator.

So the magnetic moment would be mu = gamma (S_x, S_y, S_z), and the interaction energy is H = - mu · B.

So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

So this brings us back to the earlier scenario where the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.

So let's proceed with that.

In that case, the time evolution of the state leads to oscillations in the expectation value of S_z.

Earlier, I found that <Sz> oscillates as (ħ/2) cos( (gamma B/2) t )

So the angular frequency is gamma B / 2.

But wait, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The average mu_z is gamma * <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2) cos( (gamma B/2) t )

The oscillation frequency is (gamma B/2) divided by 2 pi, giving f = gamma B/(4 pi). But none of the options match this.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing angular frequency with regular frequency. The question asks for oscillation frequency, which is typically the number of cycles per second, i.e., f = omega/(2 pi).

But looking at the options, option A is gamma B / 2, which is the angular frequency. So perhaps the correct answer is A) gamma B/2.

Wait, but the problem says the average starts oscillating. So the oscillation's frequency is the coefficient in the cosine function, which is gamma B/2. But wait, no: the argument is (gamma B/2) t, which is 2 pi times (gamma B/(4 pi)) t. So the angular frequency is gamma B/2, and the regular frequency is gamma B/(4 pi), but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-express the time evolution.

Earlier, H = -gamma B Sy. Let me write H in terms of angular frequency.

The energy levels for spin in H are E = +/- (gamma B ħ/2 )

The energy difference between the two levels is E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillations between the states is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar. So the angular frequency omega is (E_+ - E_-)/ ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but this can't be right because earlier calculation suggested the oscillation frequency is gamma B/2.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion arises because the system is in a superposition of the two energy eigenstates. The time evolution leads to interference between these states, causing oscillations in expectation values.

The time evolution of the state |+z> under H = -gamma B Sy is such that the state precesses around the Y-axis. The frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy splitting.

The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2)

The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = -gamma B ħ - gamma B ħ = -gamma B ħ - (gamma B ħ/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2 )) ?

Wait, wait, no: E_+ is the energy for |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2), which under H gives E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2).

Similarly, E_- is for |−y>, which is gamma B (ħ/2).

So the energy difference between the two levels is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2 ) )= gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillations in expectation values is given by omega = (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier calculation where the argument was gamma B t/2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the time evolution of a state in a two-level system.

The state |+z> can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |−y>, which are eigenstates of H. The phases acquired by each component will lead to oscillations in expectation values.

The time-dependent state is:

|psi(t)> = ( |+y> e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} + |−y> e^{-i E_- t/ħ} ) / sqrt(2)

Because |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2)

The energies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 )

So the phases are:

e^{-i E_+ t/ħ } = e^{i gamma B t/2 }
e^{-i E_- t/ħ } = e^{ -i gamma B t/2 }

So,

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |−y> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

So,

|psi(t)> = [ (|+z> + |−z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> − |−z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ] / (2 )

Expanding:

= [ |+z> (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} ) + |−z> (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ) ] / 2

Where theta = gamma B t/2.

Using Euler's formula:

e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta
e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta

So,

= [ |+z> (2 cos theta) + |−z> (2i sin theta) ] / 2

= cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |−z>

Thus, the state is |psi(t)> = cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |−z>

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <Sz> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>

S_z is (ħ/2) |+z><+z| - (ħ/2) |−z><−z|

So,

<Sz> = (ħ/2) [ |cos theta|^2 - |sin theta|^2 ] 
= (ħ/2) [ cos^2 theta - sin^2 theta ]
= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Because cos(2 theta) = cos^2 theta - sin^2 theta.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Because theta = gamma B t/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

Thus, the expectation value oscillates as cos( gamma B t )

The frequency of this oscillation is gamma B / (2 pi), but the angular frequency (omega) is gamma B.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.

So,

mu_z = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation angular frequency is gamma B, and the frequency (cycles per second) is gamma B / (2 pi )

But the options don't have this. The options have gamma B as option B, gamma B/2 as option A, etc.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the oscillation frequency, which is the number of oscillations per unit time. But in physics, when we refer to frequency without specifying, it's often the angular frequency omega, which is 2 pi times the frequency f.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the oscillation frequency as omega, the angular frequency.

In this case, the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is gamma B.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is gamma B.

So the correct answer should be option A: gamma B/2? Or option B: gamma B?

Wait, because in the expression mu_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t ), the angular frequency is gamma B.

But earlier, when I expanded the state, I found that <Sz> oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the angular frequency is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated <Sz>, I had a different expression. Let me check.

Wait, no. Let me re-express everything again.

Earlier, when I considered the state |psi(t)>, I found that <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta ), where theta = gamma B t/2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

So mu_z = gamma * <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer is option B) gamma B.

But wait, earlier when I thought the answer was option A, I was thinking that the argument was gamma B t/2, leading to a frequency of gamma B/2.

But that was when I thought that the time evolution led to theta = gamma B t/2, but then I realized that the correct expectation value is cos(gamma B t ), leading to omega = gamma B.

So the correct answer is option B) gamma B.

But looking back, the options are:

A) gamma*B/2
B) gamma*B
C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B
D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

So the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, why did the earlier calculation with the Pauli matrices give a different result? Let's double-check.

When I wrote U(t) = exp( i gamma B sigma_y t / 2 ), and applied it to |+z>, I found |psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, where theta = gamma B t/2.

Then, <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta ), which is (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So the argument is gamma B t, so angular frequency is gamma B.

So the correct oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ = γS** (where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator vector). Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field **B** along the +Z direction, aligning its magnetic moment with the field. The system is then abruptly switched to a magnetic field along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude **B**. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, **μ_z**.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:  
   The particle starts in the eigenstate of **S_z**, specifically **|+z>**, since the initial magnetic field is along +Z.

2. **New Hamiltonian**:  
   After the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:  
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y
   \]  
   Here, **S_y** is the y-component of the spin operator.

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state **|+z>** can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of **S_y** (i.e., **|+y>** and **|−y>**):  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |−y\rangle \right)
   \]  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the eigenstates **|+y>** and **|−y>** acquire time-dependent phase factors:  
   \[
   |+y\rangle \to e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle, \quad |−y\rangle \to e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |−y\rangle
   \]  
   where the eigenvalues are \(E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\) and \(E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\). The time-evolved state is:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |−y\rangle \right)
   \]  
   Substituting \(E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\) and \(E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\), the phase factors simplify to:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |+z\rangle + i \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |−z\rangle
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of \(S_z\)**:  
   The expectation value of \(S_z\) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle
   \]  
   Substituting \(S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_z\), the calculation yields:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]  
   Thus, the z-component of the magnetic moment, \(\mu_z = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle\), oscillates as:  
   \[
   \mu_z = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation frequency is determined by the coefficient of \(t\) in the cosine argument, which is \(\gamma B\). This is the **angular frequency** (denoted as \(\omega\)). If the problem had asked for the ordinary frequency \(f\) (in cycles per second), it would be \(\omega / (2\pi)\). However, the problem explicitly asks for the oscillation frequency, which corresponds to the angular frequency \(\omega = \gamma B\).

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is \(\gamma B\). This corresponds to **Option B**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a spin-1/2 particle. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have intrinsic angular momentum, and their magnetic moments are related to that. The particle's magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and Sz is the z-component of the spin. 

The setup is that the magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the change.

Hmm, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. Its spin would be aligned with this field, right? The magnetic moment mu is aligned with B, so the spin is in the +Z direction. So the initial state is probably an eigenstate of Sz, which for spin-1/2 would be either up or down. Since the field is along +Z, the spin would be in the up state, so |+z> or something like that.

Then the magnetic field is switched off, so the field along Z is zero, and a new field along Y is turned on. Wait, but the field along Y is the same magnitude, B. So the new Hamiltonian must be different. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B, but wait, no, the interaction energy is H = -mu · B. But since mu is gamma Sz, then H would be proportional to Sz·B in the initial case. But when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment will interact with H = -gamma S_y B, because mu is in the direction of the field? Or wait, wait. Wait, no, mu is gamma S, so actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the interaction energy is H = -mu · B, which is -gamma (S · B). 

Wait, S is a vector operator, so when the field is along Y, B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y. So the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. 

But wait, I think the standard expression for the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. So μ is the magnetic moment vector, which is given as γ S. So H = -γ S · B. 

In the initial state, the field is along Z, so H_initial = -γ B S_z. But when the field is turned off and Y is turned on, H_final = -γ B S_y. Wait, but in the problem statement, after switching, the field is along Y, so B is same magnitude but direction is Y. So H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but when they turn off the magnetic field, then the system's state is no longer influenced by the previous H, right? So initially, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz because the field was along Z. Then when the field is turned off, the particle's state doesn't change instantaneously. Wait, no, wait. The problem says that the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along Y. So the change is abrupt, so the state of the system doesn't change immediately. So the initial state is the eigenstate of Sz, and then the Hamiltonian changes to H = gamma B S_y (or perhaps -gamma B S_y, depending on the sign convention, but I'll check that later).

Wait, actually, the relationship between mu and Sz is mu = gamma S. So the magnetic moment is a vector, so mu_x = gamma S_x, etc. The energy is H = -mu · B. So when B is along Z, H = -gamma B S_z. When B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but in terms of the time evolution, when the Hamiltonian changes, the state remains the same, but the time evolution after that is governed by the new Hamiltonian.

So the system starts in an eigenstate of Sz, which is |+z> or |−z>. Let's assume it's |+z>, since the field is along +Z direction. So the initial state is |+z>.

After the field is changed, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, but I think the problem states that mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is along Y, mu will have components along Y, so S_y? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. Wait, that's confusing because mu is a vector, but the way it's written suggests that mu is along the z-direction. Alternatively, perhaps mu is proportional to the spin vector. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is that mu is equal to gamma times the spin component in the direction of the magnetic field. But in the initial case, the field is along Z, so mu is gamma S_z. Then when the field is along Y, I think mu would be gamma S_y, so the magnetic moment is along Y. So perhaps the magnetic moment is in the direction of the field. But maybe the problem states that mu is simply gamma times S, so mu = gamma S. Then, the magnetic moment vector is mu = gamma (S_x, S_y, S_z).

Wait, the problem says mu = gamma * S_z. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Or perhaps it's that the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin component along the direction of the magnetic field. So when the field is along Z, mu is gamma S_z. When the field is along Y, mu is gamma S_y. So the magnetic moment is along the field direction.

Wait, but regardless, the Hamiltonian will be H = - mu · B. So if mu is along the field direction, then when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

But wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z, which suggests that mu is in the z-direction. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction." Oh, so mu is aligned with B, which is along +Z. So mu is along +Z. So when B is turned off, then another field is turned on along +Y. So the new B is along Y, so the new mu would be along Y? Or does mu stay as gamma S_z, regardless of the direction of B? That's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The mu is given as gamma * Sz, so mu is a vector component in the z-direction. But when the magnetic field is turned along Y, how does mu relate? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about how the Hamiltonian changes based on the direction of B.

In any case, the Hamiltonian after the change is H = -gamma B S_y, because the field is along Y. Because B is same magnitude, same direction? So let's proceed with H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y because the energy is proportional to the dot product of mu and B. Wait, no, the energy is U = -mu · B. So if mu = gamma S_z, then for B along Z, H = -gamma B S_z. For B along Y, mu would be gamma S_y, so H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait: mu is given as gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, what's the mu? Because mu is a vector, it's just the spin in z-direction. Hmm, that would make the interaction energy zero when the field is along Y. But that can't be right because the problem says that the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the mu.

Alternatively, perhaps mu is the magnitude, and the direction is along the spin. Wait, no, that's not standard. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps mu is a vector that is the spin multiplied by gamma, so mu = gamma * S, where S is the vector (Sx, Sy, Sz). So then, the Hamiltonian when B is along Y is H = - mu · B = -gamma B Sy.

But wait, if mu = gamma S, then mu · B = gamma (Sx Bx + Sy By + Sz Bz). When B is along Y, Bx and Bz are zero, so H = -gamma B Sy.

So the Hamiltonian after the change is H = -gamma B Sy. But wait, the problem states that mu equals gamma*Sz, so perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the mu is a vector that points along the field direction. So when B is in Z, mu is gamma Sz. When B is in Y, mu is gamma Sy.

Wait, but that would imply that the mu changes direction when the magnetic field changes. But in the problem statement, mu is given as equal to gamma Sz regardless of B's direction. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense because the mu would then always be along Z, even when the field is along Y.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's think again. The problem says mu equals gamma * Sz. So mu is a vector with components (0, 0, gamma S_z), because S_z is the z-component of spin, which is either +ħ/2 or -ħ/2 for spin-1/2. But when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction energy would be U = - mu · B. Since mu is along Z and B is along Y, the dot product is zero. So the energy doesn't change. But the problem says the average z-component starts oscillating, which suggests that the system is evolving under some Hamiltonian.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and mu is actually given as mu = gamma S, where S is the vector operator. So mu is (gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz). Then, when the field is along Z, H = -mu · B = -gamma B Sz. When the field is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy.

So in this case, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz (since the field was along Z), and the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. So the state would evolve under H = -gamma B Sy. 

Wait, but the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. So perhaps I'm not supposed to think of mu as a vector. Or perhaps the problem is that the magnetic moment is proportional to Sz, so mu_z = gamma Sz, and the other components are zero. So when the field is along Y, the interaction energy would be zero, but that can't be right because the problem states that the average of the z-component oscillates. Therefore, maybe I'm wrong in how I'm interpreting mu.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. So mu is a vector, and when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed without getting stuck on this, assuming that mu is a vector and that the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy.

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. But after the field change, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. The time evolution of the state is governed by this Hamiltonian.

The oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z. Since mu_z is gamma times Sz, the average mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of Sz.

So I need to find how <Sz> evolves over time and then find the frequency of its oscillation.

The time evolution is governed by the Schrodinger equation. The state at time t will be |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>, where |ψ(0)> is the initial state.

But since H = -gamma B Sy, I can write H as proportional to Sy. Let's write H as H = ω Sy, where omega is some frequency. Wait, let me compute H in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, H = -gamma B Sy. The energy levels for spin-1/2 in a field along Y would have energies proportional to Sy. The eigenvalues would be ± (gamma B / 2), because Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H has eigenvalues E_+ = (gamma B / 2), E_- = -(gamma B / 2) [Wait, because H = -gamma B Sy, so Sy |+y> = (ħ/2)|+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> = (-gamma B ħ/2) |+y>, so E_+ = -gamma B ħ/2. Wait, perhaps I should be careful here.

Wait, perhaps I should express H in terms of angular frequency. Let me think: the energy levels for spin in a magnetic field are E = -mu · B. So for a spin-1/2 particle, mu = gamma S, so E = -gamma B (S · n), where n is the direction of B. So when B is along Y, E = -gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2, so E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

But in terms of time evolution, the time dependence of the state depends on the energy differences. The system will undergo precession around the Y-axis, causing transitions between |+y> and |−y> states, which would cause oscillations in observables.

But the initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |−y> states. So let me write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>.

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |−y>, which can be expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z> as follows:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/sqrt(2)

So the initial state |+z> can be written as:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no. Let me think again. The basis states for Sy are |+y> and |−y>, which are combinations of |+z> and |−z>.

So, |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2

So, solving for |+z> and |−z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/√2
|−z> = (|+y> − |−y>)/√2

So our initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/√2.

Now, under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B Sy, each energy eigenstate |+y> and |−y> will pick up a phase factor over time.

The time evolution of |+y> is exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y>
Similarly, |−y> evolves as exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |−y>

Since |+z> is a combination of these, the time-evolved state |ψ(t)> is:

|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-i E_+ t/ħ) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/ħ) |−y> ]

Substituting E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2) (Wait, earlier I thought E_+ was -gamma B (ħ/2), but let's double-check that. H = -gamma B Sy. Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2). Similarly, E_- = -gamma B (-ħ/2) = gamma B (ħ/2).

So the exponents become:

exp( -i E_+ t/ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )
exp( -i E_- t/ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

So substituting back:

|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y> ]

Now, we can express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2

Substituting these in:

|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + |−z>)/√2 + exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> - |−z>)/√2 ]

Simplify this:

= (1/√2) [ [exp(i gamma B t/2) + exp(-i gamma B t/2)] |+z> / √2 
+ [exp(i gamma B t/2) - exp(-i gamma B t/2)] |−z> / √2 ]

The terms in the brackets can be expressed using Euler's formula. 

Note that exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ
And exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ

So:

= (1/√2) [ [2 cos( gamma B t/2 ) ] |+z> / √2 
+ [2i sin( gamma B t/2 ) ] |−z> / √2 ]

Simplify the constants:

= (1/√2) * (2 / √2) [ cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z> ]

Since 2/(√2 * √2) = 2/(2) = 1, so:

|ψ(t)> = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z>

Wait, but cos and sin have arguments (gamma B t / 2). Hmm.

Now, the expectation value of Sz is <Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>

Sz is (ħ/2) for |+z> and (-ħ/2) for |−z>.

So compute <Sz(t)>:

= [ cos(θ) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [i sin(theta)]^2 (-ħ/2)
Where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Wait, let's compute each term:

<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [i sin(theta)]^2 ( - ħ/2 )

Wait, because |+z> contributes (ħ/2) and |−z> contributes (-ħ/2).

Alternatively, compute each term:

The state is |ψ(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z>
The conjugate is <ψ(t)| = cos(theta) <+z| - i sin(theta) <−z|

So:

<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = [cos(theta) < +z | + (-i sin(theta) < -z | ) ] * Sz [ cos(theta) | +z> + i sin(theta) | -z> ]

Expanding this:

= cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | Sz | +z > 
+ cos(theta) (-i sin(theta)) < +z | Sz | -z > 
+ (-i sin(theta)) cos(theta) < -z | Sz | +z > 
+ (-i sin(theta)) (i sin(theta)) < -z | Sz | -z >

Compute each term:

< +z | Sz | +z > = ħ/2
< +z | Sz | -z > = 0 (since Sz is diagonal in the z basis)
< -z | Sz | +z > = 0
< -z | Sz | -z > = -ħ/2

So the terms become:

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2)
+ 0
+ 0
+ ( (-i)(i) ) sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2)
But (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1, so:

= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ( -ħ/2 * (-1) )
= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + (ħ/2) sin^2(theta)
= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ]
= (ħ/2) * 1
= ħ/2

Wait, that can't be right because the expectation value of Sz isn't changing with time. But the problem states that the average z-component starts oscillating. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the expectation value more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let me recompute:

<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [ i sin(theta) ]^2 ( - ħ/2 )

Because when you expand it, the cross terms (involving < +z | Sz | -z >) are zero because Sz is diagonal.

So cross terms would be cos(theta) * i sin(theta) [ < +z | Sz | -z > ] which is zero.

So:

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + (i^2) sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

i^2 is -1, so:

= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + (-1) * sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )
= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + (ħ/2) sin^2(theta)
= ħ/2 [ cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ]
= ħ/2 * 1
= ħ/2.

Hmm, that's a problem. It's a constant, implying that the average Sz doesn't change. But the problem says it starts oscillating. So clearly, I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time evolution. Let me double-check the time evolution of the state. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the time evolution of the expectation value differently.

Wait, perhaps I should find the time dependence of the expectation value of Sz more carefully.

Wait, another approach: The time evolution is given by H = -gamma B Sy. The system starts in the state |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. The time evolution under H will cause transitions between |+z> and |−z> states.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

So the state at time t is |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z>

Now, H = -gamma B Sy. Sy has eigenstates |+y> and |−y> with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

But perhaps it's easier to write H in terms of Pauli matrices. For a spin-1/2 particle, Sy can be written as (ħ/2) sigma_y, where sigma_y is the Pauli Y matrix.

So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y

So H = - (gamma B ħ/2) sigma_y

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

Substituting H:

U(t) = exp( -i [ -gamma B ħ/2 sigma_y ] t / ħ )
= exp( i gamma B sigma_y t / 2 )

Because (gamma B ħ/2) * t / ħ = gamma B t / 2.

So U(t) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )

We can compute this using the expansion of the exponential. Since sigma_y is a Pauli matrix, we know that sigma_y^2 = I, sigma_y^3 = sigma_y, etc.

The expansion for exp(i theta sigma_y) is cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)

So U(t) = cos( gamma B t/2 ) I + i sigma_y sin(gamma B t/2 )

Now, the initial state |+z> is represented as a column vector (1; 0). Let's apply U(t) to |+z>:

|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] (1; 0 )

Where theta = gamma B t/2.

Computing this:

cos(theta) * [1 0; 0 1] (1; 0) = cos(theta) (1; 0)

i sigma_y sin(theta) * (1; 0) = i sigma_y (1; 0) sin(theta)

sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so sigma_y (1; 0) = [0, -i; i, 0] (1; 0) = [ -i; 0 ]

So, i sigma_y (1; 0) = i [ -i; 0 ] = [ (-i)(i), 0 ] = [ 1; 0 ]

Because i*(-i) = 1.

So, putting it together:

U(t)|+z> = cos(theta) (1; 0) + sin(theta) (1; 0 ) = [ cos(theta) + sin(theta) ; 0 ]

Wait, that can't be right because when you apply sigma_y to |+z>, you get |+x> or something else. Maybe I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication.

Wait, let me recompute the sigma_y multiplication.

sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So sigma_y multiplied by (1; 0) is [0*1 + (-i)*0; i*1 + 0*0 ] = [0; i*1] = [0; i]

Wait, that's different. So sigma_y (1;0) = [0; i]

Then, i * sigma_y (1;0) = i * [0; i] = [0; i^2 ] = [0; -1]

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

So, going back:

U(t) |+z> = [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] (1; 0)
= cos(theta) * (1; 0) + i sigma_y sin(theta) * (1;0)
= [cos(theta); 0] + [ 0; i sin(theta) ] * sigma_y (1;0) ?

Wait, perhaps I should represent the matrices more carefully.

Wait, U(t) is a 2x2 matrix:

U(t) = [[ cos(theta) , i sin(theta) ],
         [ i sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]

Wait, because sigma_y has eigenvalues, and when expanded, the exponential for sigma_y is:

exp( i theta sigma_y ) = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)

Which, in matrix form, is:

[ [cos(theta), i sin(theta)], 
  [i sin(theta), cos(theta)] ]

So applying this to |+z> = (1; 0):

U(t)|+z> = [ cos(theta)*1 + i sin(theta)*0 ; i sin(theta)*1 + cos(theta)*0 ]
= [ cos(theta); i sin(theta) ]

So the state at time t is |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ]^T, where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Now, the expectation value of Sz is <+z| Sz |psi(t)>

Sz is represented by the Pauli Z matrix: diag(1, -1) multiplied by ħ/2.

So, compute <Sz>:

<Sz> = (1/2) [ <+z| Z |psi(t) > ]

Because Sz = (ħ/2) Z, so the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation of Z.

Compute <+z| Z |psi(t) >.

Z is diagonal: [1, 0; 0, -1]

So Z |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta)*1 ; i sin(theta)*(-1) ]

Then, <+z| Z |psi(t) > = cos(theta) * 1 + (0)(i sin(theta) (-1)) ) = cos(theta)

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) * cos(theta) = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t/2 )

Wait, but the problem states that mu = gamma S_z, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma * <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(theta)

Wait, but the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z. So mu_z = gamma <S_z> = gamma (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t/2 )

But wait, the average is oscillating as cos( gamma B t/2 ), so the frequency is gamma B / (2 * 2π) ?

Wait, no. The oscillation's angular frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine function. So in cos( (gamma B / 2 ) t ), the angular frequency omega is (gamma B / 2 )

So the frequency f is omega/(2 pi) = (gamma B)/(4 pi )

But looking at the options, I don't see any with 4 pi. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the earlier steps.

Wait, in the time evolution, we found that <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(theta), where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

So the average mu_z is gamma * (ħ/2) cos(theta) = (gamma ħ/2) cos( gamma B t/2 )

But the oscillation frequency comes from the argument of the cosine. The argument is (gamma B/2) * t, so the angular frequency is (gamma B/2), and the ordinary frequency is (gamma B)/(2 * 2 pi) )= gamma B / (4 pi )

But none of the options have 4 pi in the denominator. The options are:

A) gamma B/2
B) gamma B
C) sqrt(2) gamma B
D) gamma B/sqrt(2)

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Hamiltonian. Let's re-express the Hamiltonian correctly.

The problem says mu = gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, the interaction energy is H = -mu · B = -gamma S_z B_y. Since B_y is B (as the field is along Y), H = -gamma B S_z.

Wait, that's a different approach. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_z.

Wait, that's a crucial point. I think I mixed up the direction of the magnetic moment.

Wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z, so the magnetic moment is along Z, regardless of the B field direction. Because mu is defined as gamma S_z. So when the magnetic field is turned along Y, the interaction energy is H = - mu · B = -gamma S_z B_y.

Since B is along Y, B_y = B, and others are zero. So H = -gamma B S_z.

So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_z.

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So under this Hamiltonian, the state doesn't change, because it's an eigenstate. That would mean no oscillation, but the problem says the average z-component starts oscillating. So that can't be right.

Hmm, so this suggests that I must have made a mistake in interpreting mu.

Alternatively, perhaps mu is a vector that is proportional to the spin vector. So mu = gamma S, with S being the vector operator.

So the magnetic moment would be mu = gamma (S_x, S_y, S_z), and the interaction energy is H = - mu · B.

So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

So this brings us back to the earlier scenario where the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.

So let's proceed with that.

In that case, the time evolution of the state leads to oscillations in the expectation value of S_z.

Earlier, I found that <Sz> oscillates as (ħ/2) cos( (gamma B/2) t )

So the angular frequency is gamma B / 2.

But wait, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The average mu_z is gamma * <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2) cos( (gamma B/2) t )

The oscillation frequency is (gamma B/2) divided by 2 pi, giving f = gamma B/(4 pi). But none of the options match this.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing angular frequency with regular frequency. The question asks for oscillation frequency, which is typically the number of cycles per second, i.e., f = omega/(2 pi).

But looking at the options, option A is gamma B / 2, which is the angular frequency. So perhaps the correct answer is A) gamma B/2.

Wait, but the problem says the average starts oscillating. So the oscillation's frequency is the coefficient in the cosine function, which is gamma B/2. But wait, no: the argument is (gamma B/2) t, which is 2 pi times (gamma B/(4 pi)) t. So the angular frequency is gamma B/2, and the regular frequency is gamma B/(4 pi), but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-express the time evolution.

Earlier, H = -gamma B Sy. Let me write H in terms of angular frequency.

The energy levels for spin in H are E = +/- (gamma B ħ/2 )

The energy difference between the two levels is E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillations between the states is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar. So the angular frequency omega is (E_+ - E_-)/ ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but this can't be right because earlier calculation suggested the oscillation frequency is gamma B/2.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion arises because the system is in a superposition of the two energy eigenstates. The time evolution leads to interference between these states, causing oscillations in expectation values.

The time evolution of the state |+z> under H = -gamma B Sy is such that the state precesses around the Y-axis. The frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy splitting.

The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2)

The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = -gamma B ħ - gamma B ħ = -gamma B ħ - (gamma B ħ/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2 )) ?

Wait, wait, no: E_+ is the energy for |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2), which under H gives E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2).

Similarly, E_- is for |−y>, which is gamma B (ħ/2).

So the energy difference between the two levels is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2 ) )= gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillations in expectation values is given by omega = (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier calculation where the argument was gamma B t/2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the time evolution of a state in a two-level system.

The state |+z> can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |−y>, which are eigenstates of H. The phases acquired by each component will lead to oscillations in expectation values.

The time-dependent state is:

|psi(t)> = ( |+y> e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} + |−y> e^{-i E_- t/ħ} ) / sqrt(2)

Because |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2)

The energies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 )

So the phases are:

e^{-i E_+ t/ħ } = e^{i gamma B t/2 }
e^{-i E_- t/ħ } = e^{ -i gamma B t/2 }

So,

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |−y> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

So,

|psi(t)> = [ (|+z> + |−z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> − |−z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ] / (2 )

Expanding:

= [ |+z> (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} ) + |−z> (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ) ] / 2

Where theta = gamma B t/2.

Using Euler's formula:

e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta
e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta

So,

= [ |+z> (2 cos theta) + |−z> (2i sin theta) ] / 2

= cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |−z>

Thus, the state is |psi(t)> = cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |−z>

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <Sz> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>

S_z is (ħ/2) |+z><+z| - (ħ/2) |−z><−z|

So,

<Sz> = (ħ/2) [ |cos theta|^2 - |sin theta|^2 ] 
= (ħ/2) [ cos^2 theta - sin^2 theta ]
= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Because cos(2 theta) = cos^2 theta - sin^2 theta.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Because theta = gamma B t/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

Thus, the expectation value oscillates as cos( gamma B t )

The frequency of this oscillation is gamma B / (2 pi), but the angular frequency (omega) is gamma B.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.

So,

mu_z = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation angular frequency is gamma B, and the frequency (cycles per second) is gamma B / (2 pi )

But the options don't have this. The options have gamma B as option B, gamma B/2 as option A, etc.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the oscillation frequency, which is the number of oscillations per unit time. But in physics, when we refer to frequency without specifying, it's often the angular frequency omega, which is 2 pi times the frequency f.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the oscillation frequency as omega, the angular frequency.

In this case, the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is gamma B.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is gamma B.

So the correct answer should be option A: gamma B/2? Or option B: gamma B?

Wait, because in the expression mu_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t ), the angular frequency is gamma B.

But earlier, when I expanded the state, I found that <Sz> oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the angular frequency is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated <Sz>, I had a different expression. Let me check.

Wait, no. Let me re-express everything again.

Earlier, when I considered the state |psi(t)>, I found that <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta ), where theta = gamma B t/2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

So mu_z = gamma * <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer is option B) gamma B.

But wait, earlier when I thought the answer was option A, I was thinking that the argument was gamma B t/2, leading to a frequency of gamma B/2.

But that was when I thought that the time evolution led to theta = gamma B t/2, but then I realized that the correct expectation value is cos(gamma B t ), leading to omega = gamma B.

So the correct answer is option B) gamma B.

But looking back, the options are:

A) gamma*B/2
B) gamma*B
C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B
D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

So the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, why did the earlier calculation with the Pauli matrices give a different result? Let's double-check.

When I wrote U(t) = exp( i gamma B sigma_y t / 2 ), and applied it to |+z>, I found |psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, where theta = gamma B t/2.

Then, <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta ), which is (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So the argument is gamma B t, so angular frequency is gamma B.

So the correct oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ = γS** (where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator vector). Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field **B** along the +Z direction, aligning its magnetic moment with the field. The system is then abruptly switched to a magnetic field along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude **B**. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, **μ_z**.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:  
   The particle starts in the eigenstate of **S_z**, specifically **|+z>**, since the initial magnetic field is along +Z.

2. **New Hamiltonian**:  
   After the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:  
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y
   \]  
   Here, **S_y** is the y-component of the spin operator.

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state **|+z>** can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of **S_y** (i.e., **|+y>** and **|−y>**):  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |−y\rangle \right)
   \]  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the eigenstates **|+y>** and **|−y>** acquire time-dependent phase factors:  
   \[
   |+y\rangle \to e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle, \quad |−y\rangle \to e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |−y\rangle
   \]  
   where the eigenvalues are \(E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\) and \(E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\). The time-evolved state is:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |−y\rangle \right)
   \]  
   Substituting \(E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\) and \(E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\), the phase factors simplify to:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |+z\rangle + i \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |−z\rangle
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of \(S_z\)**:  
   The expectation value of \(S_z\) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle
   \]  
   Substituting \(S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_z\), the calculation yields:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]  
   Thus, the z-component of the magnetic moment, \(\mu_z = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle\), oscillates as:  
   \[
   \mu_z = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation frequency is determined by the coefficient of \(t\) in the cosine argument, which is \(\gamma B\). This is the **angular frequency** (denoted as \(\omega\)). If the problem had asked for the ordinary frequency \(f\) (in cycles per second), it would be \(\omega / (2\pi)\). However, the problem explicitly asks for the oscillation frequency, which corresponds to the angular frequency \(\omega = \gamma B\).

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is \(\gamma B\). This corresponds to **Option B**.

ANSWER: B
