Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step.

The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. Right, dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules. Let me remember what those are.

In the hydrogen atom, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, but wait, no, actually, the main selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, n can change by ±1 or more, but in practice, usually, it's steps of ±1 or ±2. Wait, does the transition have to be in steps of one? Or can it jump two in n? I think it can, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. For hydrogen, the dipole transitions require that the electron changes by Δl = ±1. So, for example, if it's in an s-orbital (l=0), like n=3 and l=0, it can transition to an l=1 state because 0 → 1 is a Δl of +1. But then in the next step, it goes from l=1 to l=0, because 1→0 is Δl=-1. So that might be a way the two-step transition occurs.

Wait, but the problem says it's a two-dipole transition. So the decay is from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 via two steps, each being a dipole transition.

So for each step, the selection rules apply. Let's break it down.

First transition: from |3,0,0> to some intermediate state. Since l starts at 0, the only allowed l for the next state is l=1, because Δl = ±1. So the first state after transition must have l=1. So the intermediate state is |n,1,m>, where n is 3-1=2 or 3+1=4? Wait, wait, n doesn't change due to Δl, but the possible Δn is any as long as the other conditions are met. Wait, no. Wait, the selection rules for hydrogen also include Δn = 0, ±1, but only when Δl = ±1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Actually, the selection rules for hydrogen are a bit tricky. The electric dipole selection rules are:

Δl = ±1 (but l can't be 0 → 0, must change by ±1)
Δm = 0, ±1
Δn can be anything except 0 (since n must change), but in practice, transitions happen where the orbitals are filled. But wait, for hydrogen, each n can have l from 0 to n-1. So from n=3, l=0, the next possible l is 1. So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. So the first step is |3,0,0> → |something with l=1>.

What about the n? So for the first step, from n=3, l=0, the possible l for next state is 1. Then, the possible n for the next state can be 2 or 4? Because l=1 requires n ≥ l+1, so n can be 2 (since 3-1=2, which is ≥ 2) or 4 (3+1=4, which is also fine). Wait, but in hydrogen, the energy levels are given by n. So the energy level transitions would be from n=3 to either n=2 or n=4 (but wait, for dipole transitions, the photon emitted has energy that can cause a change in n.

But wait, in the case of 3,0,0 → 1,0,0, via two steps. The first step must go from l=0 to l=1. So the first transition is |3,0,0> → |n,1,m>, where n could be 2 or 4.

Wait, but 3 → 2, so that's a Δn=-1, which is allowed because from l=0 to l=1, so Δl=+1. Or 3→4 (Δn=+1), which is allowed as well. But n=4 would require higher energy, but the system is decaying, so probably emits a photon, going to lower energy. So perhaps the first transition is from 3→2.

Wait, but m must change by 0 or ±1. So from m=0, the first transition can go to m=0, +1, or -1. But since we're going to l=1, the m can be -1, 0, +1.

So, the first transition from |3,0,0> would go to |2,1,m>, where m is -1, 0, +1.

Then, the second transition must go from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. Let's see, from l=1 to l=0. So Δl=-1. So that's allowed. Now, the m must change by 0 or ±1. So from m, the next m' can be m±0,1. So for example, if the first transition ends with m=0, then the next m can be 0, ±1. But the target state is m=0, so that's allowed. Alternatively, if the first step's m is 1, then the second transition can go to m=0 or 1±1=2 (but l=0, so m can't be 2). So m must go to m=0.

Wait, let me think about the first transition. Suppose the first step is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>. Then in the second step, from l=1, m=0, to l=0, m=0. That's allowed because Δm=0.

Alternatively, the first step could be |3,0,0> → |2,1,1>, then in the second step, from m=1 to m=0 (Δm=-1). Or, from m=1 to m=0, which is allowed.

Similarly, if the first step goes to |2,1,-1>, the second step can go to m=0 (Δm=+1).

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>.

Wait, but in the options, the first option is A: 3→2,1,0→1,0,0, and probability 1/3.

Option B is 3→2,1,1 → 1,0,0. But then, can it go from 2,1,1 to 1,0,0? Let's see:

In the second transition, l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl=-1), allowed. m goes from 1 → 0, which is Δm=-1, allowed.

So that's possible. Similarly for m=-1.

So, the possible transition paths are:

3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0

3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0

3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0

So each of these is a possible route.

Now, the question is about the probability of each of these routes. So the possible options are A, B, C, D. Let's look at the options.

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0, same probability 1/4.

Option D: Hmm, the option D in the question is written a bit weirdly. Let me check:

Option D: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3.

Wait, that's same as option A, but with a different probability. So it's either same route but different probability.

So, I think the question is about which transition paths are possible and what their probabilities are.

Now, the problem is to compute the probability for each possible path. Because the question is which transition route and probability is correct.

So, the total number of possible first transitions is three: m= -1, 0, +1. Each of these is a possible dipole transition.

Then, for each of these, the second transition must go to m=0. So, the second transition would have a certain probability based on the possible m changes.

Wait, but in each step, the transition probabilities depend on the matrix elements. The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element. The matrix element depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or Wigner 3-j symbols, involving the m values.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

In the first step, from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>. The possible m values are -1, 0, +1. Each of these transitions is allowed, but what are their probabilities?

The probability for each transition is given by |<2,1,m| r |3,0,0>|². The matrix element <2,1,m | r |3,0,0> is non-zero only if certain conditions are met.

The position operator r can be expressed in spherical harmonics: r has components proportional to Y_{1, m'}, so when you take the matrix element <2,1,m | r |3,0,0>, it's non-zero only if the angular momentum addition rules are satisfied. So, when you have |3,0,0>, which is Y_{0,0}, and you multiply by r (which is Y_{1, m'}), the product should have angular momentum components that can be projected into |2,1,m>.

So, the integral would involve Y_{1,m'} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{2,1,m}^*. Which is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. The integral is non-zero when the angular momenta add up correctly. So, the spherical harmonics product must have a component with l=2, m=m.

So, using the selection rules for the product of Y_{l,m} and r (Y_{1,m'}), the possible transitions are where l_initial=0, r contributes l=1. So in the first step, l goes from 0 → 1. The selection of m is m = m' + 0, since Y_{0,0} is spherically symmetric.

So, for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>, m can be -1, 0, +1.

But what are the probabilities for each m? The transition probability is proportional to |<2,1,m | r |3,0,0>|².

The radial parts would contribute, but since the question is about the hydrogen atom and the radial wavefunctions, perhaps the radial parts are the same for each m, so the probabilities are determined by the angular parts.

The angular part matrix elements are given by integrals of Y_{1,m} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{2,1,m}^*, which relates to the Gaunt coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the possible transitions and their relative probabilities.

The number of possible ways to go from m=0 in the initial state to each possible m in the intermediate state. Since the dipole operator can cause m to change by -1, 0, +1.

Wait, the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, so the possible m changes are Δm = -1, 0, +1.

So, the first transition from m=0 can go to m=0, +1, or -1. Each of these has a certain probability.

The probability for each possible m in the first transition (from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m) would relate to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the product of the spherical harmonic overlaps.

But perhaps for the sake of this problem, the probabilities for each possible m are the same. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the matrix elements <2,1,m | r |3,0,0> would be proportional to Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The selection would depend on how the angular momenta combine.

Wait, perhaps the possible m's have the same probability, which would mean each of the three possible m's ( -1, 0, +1) have equal transition probabilities. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, some m's have higher probabilities.

Wait, another approach: the transition amplitude is non-zero only when the sum of the angular momenta allows it. So, when adding l=1 (from r) and l=0 (from the initial state), the resulting l must be 2 (since the intermediate state is l=1 in the first step). Wait, no, the intermediate state is l=1, so the matrix element is between l=0 and l=1, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the possible m's are equally probable. So each of the m=-1, 0, +1 transitions has the same probability. If so, the first step has 3 possible paths, each with equal probability. So each has a probability of 1/3.

Then, in the second step, from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, the transition is again subject to selection rules. So the second transition must have Δl = -1 (from 1 to 0), and Δm = m → 0.

So, from |2,1,m>, the allowed m's in the next step are m' = m ± 0 or ±1. But in this case, the target m is 0, so m must be -1, 0, or +1, and m' must be 0. So, the transition from m=1 can only go to m=0 (Δm=-1), from m=0 can stay at 0 (Δm=0), and from m=-1 can go to 0 (Δm=+1).

So, for each intermediate state |2,1,m>, the probability of transitioning to |1,0,0> depends on the allowed m changes.

Assuming similar logic as before, perhaps each of these has equal probability, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the matrix elements may vary.

But if the first step has three possibilities, each with probability 1/3, and then each of these has a certain probability to transition to the final state.

Wait, perhaps the entire process has two steps, each with their own selection rules and probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition (3→2) has a certain probability, and the second transition (2→1) has another. The total probability is the product of the individual probabilities.

But without knowing the exact probabilities, maybe the options can help. Let's think about the given options.

Option A: The path is 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, with probability 1/3.

If the first transition (3→2,1,0) has a probability of 1/3, perhaps because each of the three possible m's has equal probability.

Then the second transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 would also have a certain probability.

Wait, but the question is about the overall probability for the entire two-step decay.

Assuming that the first transition has a probability of 1/3 (for the m=0 case) and the second transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 has a probability of 1 (assuming that this step is certain), then the total would be 1/3 * 1 = 1/3.

But that's probably not accurate because the second transition's probability might not be 100%.

Alternatively, each step's probability may not be the same.

Wait, but perhaps each possible m in the first step has an equal chance, and for the second step, only one of them can transition to the desired m=0.

Wait, no. For the second step, from m=1, you can go to m=0. From m=0, you can stay at m=0. From m=-1, you can go to m=0.

Assuming that each of these transitions has equal probability, then the second step would have a 1/3 chance for each m.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the second transition's probability depends on the initial m.

Wait, perhaps the first transition has three possible m's, each with probability 1/3, and for each, the second transition to the final state has a certain probability.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, the probabilities given are 1/3, 1/4, and 2/3.

Option A says the probability is 1/3. Option D says 2/3.

If the first transition has three possibilities, each with probability 1/3, but only one of them (m=0) can transition directly to the target state in the next step, then the path would have probability (1/3) * (1) = 1/3.

But if the second step also has some probability, like 1/3, then the total would be 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition is to m=0 with some probability, and then the second step is certain. So the total is the probability of first going to m=0.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible m changes. The first transition can have m=-1, 0, +1. Each of these would have a certain probability.

The second transition must go to m=0. So the transition from m=1 would require Δm=-1, from m=0, Δm=0, from m=-1, Δm=+1.

Now, for each of these, the transition probability depends on the matrix elements, which could vary.

In hydrogen, the transition probabilities are proportional to the square of the matrix elements, which in turn depend on the m values.

But without exact calculations, perhaps the probabilities for each m in the first step are the same. So each of the three m's ( -1, 0, +1) have equal probability, each 1/3.

Then, for the second step, from each of these m's, the transition to m=0 could have different probabilities.

Wait, suppose that for each intermediate m, the transition to m=0 has a certain probability. For example, from m=1, the probability is 1/2, from m=0, the probability is 1, and from m=-1, the probability is 1/2. Then, the total probability would be:

(1/3) * [ (1/2) + (1) + (1/2) ) ]? No, that's not right. Because each path is a separate possibility.

Wait, no. Each path is a separate possibility. So the total probability is the sum of probabilities of each possible path.

So, the three possible paths are:

1. 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0

2. 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0

3. 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0

Each path has a probability equal to the product of the transition probabilities from 3 to 2,1,m and from 2,1,m to 1,0,0.

Assuming that each first transition (for m=-1,0,+1) has the same probability, which is 1/3.

Then, for each of these, the second transition's probability would vary.

But without knowing exact values, perhaps the correct option is that the probability is 1/3, as in option A.

Alternatively, another approach: the possible transitions from |3,0,0> are to |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>, each with equal probability, 1/3. Then, from each of these, the transition to |1,0,0> has a certain probability.

But the problem is that for each of these intermediate states, the transition to the final state may not all have the same probability.

So perhaps the transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has a higher probability than the others.

Wait, because for the second step, the transition is from l=1, m=0 to l=0, m=0.

The matrix element for this transition would be non-zero. But for the other paths, such as from m=1 to m=0, perhaps the probability is lower because the required Δm is -1.

But I'm not certain about the relative probabilities.

Wait, another angle: the possible transitions from |3,0,0> are to states with l=1, and n=2 or 4. But since the system is decaying, it's more likely to transition to lower energy states, so n=2.

So the first transition is to n=2, l=1.

Now, the second transition must take it from n=2 to n=1, which requires Δn= -1. Wait, but n=2 to n=1 is a Δn of -1, which is allowed because l changes from 1 to 0. So that's acceptable.

Wait, but the two-step transition is |3,0,0> → |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>.

The probabilities for each step would depend on the matrix elements, but perhaps the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths.

If each of the three possible m's in the first step has a probability of 1/3, and each of the second steps has a probability of 1/3, then the total would be 3 * (1/3 * 1/3) )= 1/3.

But that doesn't directly match any options. Alternatively, perhaps only one of the m's leads to the correct final state, which would make the probability 1/3.

Wait, going back to the options, option A is the path 3→2,1,0→1,0,0 with probability 1/3. So perhaps that's the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition's probabilities aren't all equal. Maybe the transition to m=0 is more probable.

But how to determine that. Another approach: the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{2,1,0}^*. Hmm, that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is higher for transitions where m=0, because the integrals are easier.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator has components in all m directions, but the initial state is spherically symmetric (m=0), so the transition probabilities for m=0 would be higher? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, the matrix element for the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> is larger than the others because it involves the same m, so the probability is higher.

If that's the case, then the path 3→2,1,0→1,0,0 would have a higher probability.

But I'm not certain about that.

Another approach: for the first transition, when going from l=0 to l=1, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1, each with a certain probability. The probability for each is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=2 (since the intermediate state is l=1, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the angular momenta here).

Wait, the initial state is l=0, the dipole operator has l=1, and the resulting state is l=1. So the addition is 0 +1 →1. So, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is 1 for m=0. Because when you add m=0 and m=1, you get m=1. Similarly, adding m=0 and m=0 gives m=0, and m=0 and m=-1 gives m=-1.

Wait, but that's for the total angular momentum. Wait, perhaps the transition is for the dipole operator to cause a change in the state's angular momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability is determined by the product of the initial state, the dipole operator, and the intermediate state.

In any case, perhaps the transitions for m= -1, 0, +1 have probabilities in the ratio 1:2:1. Because of the way the spherical harmonics combine.

Wait, I remember that the transition probabilities for dipole transitions in hydrogen depend on the square of the integral involving the spherical harmonics. For example, for the transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1, and their probabilities are in the ratio 1:2:1. So the probability for m=0 is twice that of m= ±1.

Wait, so perhaps the first transition probabilities are as follows:

P(m=0) = 2/3 * (1/3) ? No, wait. Wait, actually, the probabilities would be proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the integrals.

Wait, if the possible m-values are -1,0,+1, and their probabilities are in the ratio 1:2:1, then the probabilities would be 1, 2, 1. So the total is 4 parts, so each is 1/4, 2/4=1/2, 1/4. But that doesn't add up to 1.

Wait, no. If the ratios are 1:2:1, the total is 1+2+1=4 parts. So the probabilities would be (1/4, 2/4, 1/4). So 25%, 50%, 25% for m=-1, 0, +1.

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum is 4 parts, so each is 1/4, 2/4, etc.

Wait, perhaps for the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, the probability for each m is:

P(m=0) = 2 * something,

P(m=±1) = something,

so that the total is 1.

In that case, perhaps the probabilities are 1/3 for each possible m, since the sum is 3*(1/3)=1.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think that the correct answer, based on the options, is option A, which says the probability is 1/3.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option D has a higher probability. But why?

Wait, another angle: the first transition from n=3 to n=2, l=1, and the second from n=2 to n=1, l=0. The probability of each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element.

The matrix element for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,0) would be non-zero, and perhaps higher than for the other m's. So the overall probability for this path is higher.

Wait, but without knowing the exact values, perhaps I need to think about the selection rules and which options are possible.

Wait, the problem states that the decay is via two dipole transitions. So each transition must obey the dipole selection rules.

Looking back at the options, options B and C involve transitions from |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> and → |2,1,-1>, respectively. Then, each would have to transition to |1,0,0>.

If these transitions are allowed, then all four options are possible except D, which seems incomplete in the problem statement.

Wait, in option D, the initial transition is written as |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle, which is the same as option A, but the probability given is 2/3. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but how is that possible? If the first transition has a higher probability, perhaps 2/3, and the second transition has a probability of 1, then the total would be 2/3.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> has the highest probability, and the second transition is certain. So the total probability is the probability of the first transition.

If the first transition to m=0 has a probability of 1/3, the total probability would be 1/3, as in option A.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the possible probabilities.

Another thought: the dipole transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0 has a higher probability than the other m options because m=0 corresponds to the same orientation in space as the initial state (since initial m=0), so the overlap is better.

Thus, the first transition to m=0 would have a higher probability, say 1/3. Then the second transition from m=0 to m=0 would be certain, giving a total probability of 1/3.

Which matches option A.

Alternatively, if the first transition to m=0 has a probability of 2/3, but I don't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition has probabilities: m=0 → 2/3, m=1 → 1/6, m=-1 → 1/6. So the sum would be 1.

Then, the second transition's probabilities would vary. Let's say for m=0, the transition to m=0 is certain (probability 1). For m=1, the transition to m=0 has probability 1/2, and for m=-1, the transition to m=0 has probability 1/2.

Then, the total probability would be:

(2/3 * 1) + (1/6 * 1/2) + (1/6 * 1/2) = 2/3 + (1/12 + 1/12 ) = 2/3 + 1/6 = 5/6. Which isn't any of the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition's probabilities are 1/3 each, and the second transitions' are 1/3 each. So the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. Since there are three such paths, the total is 3 * 1/9 = 1/3. Which matches option A.

Wait, yes! Because each path contributes 1/9, and there are three paths, the total is 3 * 1/9 = 1/3. So option A, which states the probability is 1/3, is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis focuses on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require:

1. **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number changes by ±1.
2. **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number changes by 0, ±1.
3. **Δn ≠ 0**: The principal quantum number changes, but transitions are most likely to occur between adjacent energy levels.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition**:  
   Starting from |3,0,0⟩, the first transition must go to a state with **l = 1** (Δl = +1). The possible intermediate states are |2,1,m⟩, where **m = -1, 0, +1**. These correspond to the three possible values of m, and each transition is allowed by the selection rules.

2. **Second Transition**:  
   From the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the second transition must go to |1,0,0⟩. This requires **Δl = -1** (from l = 1 to l = 0) and **Δm = m → 0**. The allowed transitions are:
   - From |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = 0).
   - From |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = -1).
   - From |2,1,-1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = +1).

3. **Probabilities of Transitions**:  
   The probabilities of the first transition to |2,1,m⟩ depend on the overlap of the spherical harmonics and the matrix elements of the dipole operator. For simplicity, it is assumed that the first transition probabilities for m = -1, 0, +1 are equal, each with a probability of **1/3**. The second transition probabilities are also assumed to be equal for simplicity, with each having a probability of **1**.

4. **Total Probability**:  
   Since there are three possible paths (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩), and each path has a probability of **1/3**, the total probability for the decay is the sum of the probabilities of all three paths. This results in a total probability of **1/3**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability **1/3**. This matches the calculated total probability and is consistent with the assumption of equal probabilities for the three paths.
- **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability **1/4**. This does not match the calculated total probability.
- **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability **1/4**. This also does not match the calculated total probability.
- **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability **2/3**. This overestimates the probability and is inconsistent with the assumed equal probabilities for the three paths.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it aligns with the calculated total probability of **1/3** and the assumed equal probabilities for the three possible paths.

Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step.

The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. Right, dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules. Let me remember what those are.

In the hydrogen atom, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, but wait, no, actually, the main selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, n can change by ±1 or more, but in practice, usually, it's steps of ±1 or ±2. Wait, does the transition have to be in steps of one? Or can it jump two in n? I think it can, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. For hydrogen, the dipole transitions require that the electron changes by Δl = ±1. So, for example, if it's in an s-orbital (l=0), like n=3 and l=0, it can transition to an l=1 state because 0 → 1 is a Δl of +1. But then in the next step, it goes from l=1 to l=0, because 1→0 is Δl=-1. So that might be a way the two-step transition occurs.

Wait, but the problem says it's a two-dipole transition. So the decay is from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 via two steps, each being a dipole transition.

So for each step, the selection rules apply. Let's break it down.

First transition: from |3,0,0> to some intermediate state. Since l starts at 0, the only allowed l for the next state is l=1, because Δl = ±1. So the first state after transition must have l=1. So the intermediate state is |n,1,m>, where n is 3-1=2 or 3+1=4? Wait, wait, n doesn't change due to Δl, but the possible Δn is any as long as the other conditions are met. Wait, no. Wait, the selection rules for hydrogen also include Δn = 0, ±1, but only when Δl = ±1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Actually, the selection rules for hydrogen are a bit tricky. The electric dipole selection rules are:

Δl = ±1 (but l can't be 0 → 0, must change by ±1)
Δm = 0, ±1
Δn can be anything except 0 (since n must change), but in practice, transitions happen where the orbitals are filled. But wait, for hydrogen, each n can have l from 0 to n-1. So from n=3, l=0, the next possible l is 1. So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. So the first step is |3,0,0> → |something with l=1>.

What about the n? So for the first step, from n=3, l=0, the possible l for next state is 1. Then, the possible n for the next state can be 2 or 4? Because l=1 requires n ≥ l+1, so n can be 2 (since 3-1=2, which is ≥ 2) or 4 (3+1=4, which is also fine). Wait, but in hydrogen, the energy levels are given by n. So the energy level transitions would be from n=3 to either n=2 or n=4 (but wait, for dipole transitions, the photon emitted has energy that can cause a change in n.

But wait, in the case of 3,0,0 → 1,0,0, via two steps. The first step must go from l=0 to l=1. So the first transition is |3,0,0> → |n,1,m>, where n could be 2 or 4.

Wait, but 3 → 2, so that's a Δn=-1, which is allowed because from l=0 to l=1, so Δl=+1. Or 3→4 (Δn=+1), which is allowed as well. But n=4 would require higher energy, but the system is decaying, so probably emits a photon, going to lower energy. So perhaps the first transition is from 3→2.

Wait, but m must change by 0 or ±1. So from m=0, the first transition can go to m=0, +1, or -1. But since we're going to l=1, the m can be -1, 0, +1.

So, the first transition from |3,0,0> would go to |2,1,m>, where m is -1, 0, +1.

Then, the second transition must go from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. Let's see, from l=1 to l=0. So Δl=-1. So that's allowed. Now, the m must change by 0 or ±1. So from m, the next m' can be m±0,1. So for example, if the first transition ends with m=0, then the next m can be 0, ±1. But the target state is m=0, so that's allowed. Alternatively, if the first step's m is 1, then the second transition can go to m=0 or 1±1=2 (but l=0, so m can't be 2). So m must go to m=0.

Wait, let me think about the first transition. Suppose the first step is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>. Then in the second step, from l=1, m=0, to l=0, m=0. That's allowed because Δm=0.

Alternatively, the first step could be |3,0,0> → |2,1,1>, then in the second step, from m=1 to m=0 (Δm=-1). Or, from m=1 to m=0, which is allowed.

Similarly, if the first step goes to |2,1,-1>, the second step can go to m=0 (Δm=+1).

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>.

Wait, but in the options, the first option is A: 3→2,1,0→1,0,0, and probability 1/3.

Option B is 3→2,1,1 → 1,0,0. But then, can it go from 2,1,1 to 1,0,0? Let's see:

In the second transition, l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl=-1), allowed. m goes from 1 → 0, which is Δm=-1, allowed.

So that's possible. Similarly for m=-1.

So, the possible transition paths are:

3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0

3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0

3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0

So each of these is a possible route.

Now, the question is about the probability of each of these routes. So the possible options are A, B, C, D. Let's look at the options.

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0, same probability 1/4.

Option D: Hmm, the option D in the question is written a bit weirdly. Let me check:

Option D: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3.

Wait, that's same as option A, but with a different probability. So it's either same route but different probability.

So, I think the question is about which transition paths are possible and what their probabilities are.

Now, the problem is to compute the probability for each possible path. Because the question is which transition route and probability is correct.

So, the total number of possible first transitions is three: m= -1, 0, +1. Each of these is a possible dipole transition.

Then, for each of these, the second transition must go to m=0. So, the second transition would have a certain probability based on the possible m changes.

Wait, but in each step, the transition probabilities depend on the matrix elements. The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element. The matrix element depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or Wigner 3-j symbols, involving the m values.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

In the first step, from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>. The possible m values are -1, 0, +1. Each of these transitions is allowed, but what are their probabilities?

The probability for each transition is given by |<2,1,m| r |3,0,0>|². The matrix element <2,1,m | r |3,0,0> is non-zero only if certain conditions are met.

The position operator r can be expressed in spherical harmonics: r has components proportional to Y_{1, m'}, so when you take the matrix element <2,1,m | r |3,0,0>, it's non-zero only if the angular momentum addition rules are satisfied. So, when you have |3,0,0>, which is Y_{0,0}, and you multiply by r (which is Y_{1, m'}), the product should have angular momentum components that can be projected into |2,1,m>.

So, the integral would involve Y_{1,m'} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{2,1,m}^*. Which is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. The integral is non-zero when the angular momenta add up correctly. So, the spherical harmonics product must have a component with l=2, m=m.

So, using the selection rules for the product of Y_{l,m} and r (Y_{1,m'}), the possible transitions are where l_initial=0, r contributes l=1. So in the first step, l goes from 0 → 1. The selection of m is m = m' + 0, since Y_{0,0} is spherically symmetric.

So, for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>, m can be -1, 0, +1.

But what are the probabilities for each m? The transition probability is proportional to |<2,1,m | r |3,0,0>|².

The radial parts would contribute, but since the question is about the hydrogen atom and the radial wavefunctions, perhaps the radial parts are the same for each m, so the probabilities are determined by the angular parts.

The angular part matrix elements are given by integrals of Y_{1,m} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{2,1,m}^*, which relates to the Gaunt coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the possible transitions and their relative probabilities.

The number of possible ways to go from m=0 in the initial state to each possible m in the intermediate state. Since the dipole operator can cause m to change by -1, 0, +1.

Wait, the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, so the possible m changes are Δm = -1, 0, +1.

So, the first transition from m=0 can go to m=0, +1, or -1. Each of these has a certain probability.

The probability for each possible m in the first transition (from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m) would relate to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the product of the spherical harmonic overlaps.

But perhaps for the sake of this problem, the probabilities for each possible m are the same. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the matrix elements <2,1,m | r |3,0,0> would be proportional to Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The selection would depend on how the angular momenta combine.

Wait, perhaps the possible m's have the same probability, which would mean each of the three possible m's ( -1, 0, +1) have equal transition probabilities. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, some m's have higher probabilities.

Wait, another approach: the transition amplitude is non-zero only when the sum of the angular momenta allows it. So, when adding l=1 (from r) and l=0 (from the initial state), the resulting l must be 2 (since the intermediate state is l=1 in the first step). Wait, no, the intermediate state is l=1, so the matrix element is between l=0 and l=1, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the possible m's are equally probable. So each of the m=-1, 0, +1 transitions has the same probability. If so, the first step has 3 possible paths, each with equal probability. So each has a probability of 1/3.

Then, in the second step, from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, the transition is again subject to selection rules. So the second transition must have Δl = -1 (from 1 to 0), and Δm = m → 0.

So, from |2,1,m>, the allowed m's in the next step are m' = m ± 0 or ±1. But in this case, the target m is 0, so m must be -1, 0, or +1, and m' must be 0. So, the transition from m=1 can only go to m=0 (Δm=-1), from m=0 can stay at 0 (Δm=0), and from m=-1 can go to 0 (Δm=+1).

So, for each intermediate state |2,1,m>, the probability of transitioning to |1,0,0> depends on the allowed m changes.

Assuming similar logic as before, perhaps each of these has equal probability, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the matrix elements may vary.

But if the first step has three possibilities, each with probability 1/3, and then each of these has a certain probability to transition to the final state.

Wait, perhaps the entire process has two steps, each with their own selection rules and probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition (3→2) has a certain probability, and the second transition (2→1) has another. The total probability is the product of the individual probabilities.

But without knowing the exact probabilities, maybe the options can help. Let's think about the given options.

Option A: The path is 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, with probability 1/3.

If the first transition (3→2,1,0) has a probability of 1/3, perhaps because each of the three possible m's has equal probability.

Then the second transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 would also have a certain probability.

Wait, but the question is about the overall probability for the entire two-step decay.

Assuming that the first transition has a probability of 1/3 (for the m=0 case) and the second transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 has a probability of 1 (assuming that this step is certain), then the total would be 1/3 * 1 = 1/3.

But that's probably not accurate because the second transition's probability might not be 100%.

Alternatively, each step's probability may not be the same.

Wait, but perhaps each possible m in the first step has an equal chance, and for the second step, only one of them can transition to the desired m=0.

Wait, no. For the second step, from m=1, you can go to m=0. From m=0, you can stay at m=0. From m=-1, you can go to m=0.

Assuming that each of these transitions has equal probability, then the second step would have a 1/3 chance for each m.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the second transition's probability depends on the initial m.

Wait, perhaps the first transition has three possible m's, each with probability 1/3, and for each, the second transition to the final state has a certain probability.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, the probabilities given are 1/3, 1/4, and 2/3.

Option A says the probability is 1/3. Option D says 2/3.

If the first transition has three possibilities, each with probability 1/3, but only one of them (m=0) can transition directly to the target state in the next step, then the path would have probability (1/3) * (1) = 1/3.

But if the second step also has some probability, like 1/3, then the total would be 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition is to m=0 with some probability, and then the second step is certain. So the total is the probability of first going to m=0.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible m changes. The first transition can have m=-1, 0, +1. Each of these would have a certain probability.

The second transition must go to m=0. So the transition from m=1 would require Δm=-1, from m=0, Δm=0, from m=-1, Δm=+1.

Now, for each of these, the transition probability depends on the matrix elements, which could vary.

In hydrogen, the transition probabilities are proportional to the square of the matrix elements, which in turn depend on the m values.

But without exact calculations, perhaps the probabilities for each m in the first step are the same. So each of the three m's ( -1, 0, +1) have equal probability, each 1/3.

Then, for the second step, from each of these m's, the transition to m=0 could have different probabilities.

Wait, suppose that for each intermediate m, the transition to m=0 has a certain probability. For example, from m=1, the probability is 1/2, from m=0, the probability is 1, and from m=-1, the probability is 1/2. Then, the total probability would be:

(1/3) * [ (1/2) + (1) + (1/2) ) ]? No, that's not right. Because each path is a separate possibility.

Wait, no. Each path is a separate possibility. So the total probability is the sum of probabilities of each possible path.

So, the three possible paths are:

1. 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0

2. 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0

3. 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0

Each path has a probability equal to the product of the transition probabilities from 3 to 2,1,m and from 2,1,m to 1,0,0.

Assuming that each first transition (for m=-1,0,+1) has the same probability, which is 1/3.

Then, for each of these, the second transition's probability would vary.

But without knowing exact values, perhaps the correct option is that the probability is 1/3, as in option A.

Alternatively, another approach: the possible transitions from |3,0,0> are to |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>, each with equal probability, 1/3. Then, from each of these, the transition to |1,0,0> has a certain probability.

But the problem is that for each of these intermediate states, the transition to the final state may not all have the same probability.

So perhaps the transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has a higher probability than the others.

Wait, because for the second step, the transition is from l=1, m=0 to l=0, m=0.

The matrix element for this transition would be non-zero. But for the other paths, such as from m=1 to m=0, perhaps the probability is lower because the required Δm is -1.

But I'm not certain about the relative probabilities.

Wait, another angle: the possible transitions from |3,0,0> are to states with l=1, and n=2 or 4. But since the system is decaying, it's more likely to transition to lower energy states, so n=2.

So the first transition is to n=2, l=1.

Now, the second transition must take it from n=2 to n=1, which requires Δn= -1. Wait, but n=2 to n=1 is a Δn of -1, which is allowed because l changes from 1 to 0. So that's acceptable.

Wait, but the two-step transition is |3,0,0> → |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>.

The probabilities for each step would depend on the matrix elements, but perhaps the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths.

If each of the three possible m's in the first step has a probability of 1/3, and each of the second steps has a probability of 1/3, then the total would be 3 * (1/3 * 1/3) )= 1/3.

But that doesn't directly match any options. Alternatively, perhaps only one of the m's leads to the correct final state, which would make the probability 1/3.

Wait, going back to the options, option A is the path 3→2,1,0→1,0,0 with probability 1/3. So perhaps that's the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition's probabilities aren't all equal. Maybe the transition to m=0 is more probable.

But how to determine that. Another approach: the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{2,1,0}^*. Hmm, that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is higher for transitions where m=0, because the integrals are easier.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator has components in all m directions, but the initial state is spherically symmetric (m=0), so the transition probabilities for m=0 would be higher? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, the matrix element for the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> is larger than the others because it involves the same m, so the probability is higher.

If that's the case, then the path 3→2,1,0→1,0,0 would have a higher probability.

But I'm not certain about that.

Another approach: for the first transition, when going from l=0 to l=1, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1, each with a certain probability. The probability for each is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=2 (since the intermediate state is l=1, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the angular momenta here).

Wait, the initial state is l=0, the dipole operator has l=1, and the resulting state is l=1. So the addition is 0 +1 →1. So, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is 1 for m=0. Because when you add m=0 and m=1, you get m=1. Similarly, adding m=0 and m=0 gives m=0, and m=0 and m=-1 gives m=-1.

Wait, but that's for the total angular momentum. Wait, perhaps the transition is for the dipole operator to cause a change in the state's angular momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability is determined by the product of the initial state, the dipole operator, and the intermediate state.

In any case, perhaps the transitions for m= -1, 0, +1 have probabilities in the ratio 1:2:1. Because of the way the spherical harmonics combine.

Wait, I remember that the transition probabilities for dipole transitions in hydrogen depend on the square of the integral involving the spherical harmonics. For example, for the transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1, and their probabilities are in the ratio 1:2:1. So the probability for m=0 is twice that of m= ±1.

Wait, so perhaps the first transition probabilities are as follows:

P(m=0) = 2/3 * (1/3) ? No, wait. Wait, actually, the probabilities would be proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the integrals.

Wait, if the possible m-values are -1,0,+1, and their probabilities are in the ratio 1:2:1, then the probabilities would be 1, 2, 1. So the total is 4 parts, so each is 1/4, 2/4=1/2, 1/4. But that doesn't add up to 1.

Wait, no. If the ratios are 1:2:1, the total is 1+2+1=4 parts. So the probabilities would be (1/4, 2/4, 1/4). So 25%, 50%, 25% for m=-1, 0, +1.

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum is 4 parts, so each is 1/4, 2/4, etc.

Wait, perhaps for the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, the probability for each m is:

P(m=0) = 2 * something,

P(m=±1) = something,

so that the total is 1.

In that case, perhaps the probabilities are 1/3 for each possible m, since the sum is 3*(1/3)=1.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think that the correct answer, based on the options, is option A, which says the probability is 1/3.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option D has a higher probability. But why?

Wait, another angle: the first transition from n=3 to n=2, l=1, and the second from n=2 to n=1, l=0. The probability of each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element.

The matrix element for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,0) would be non-zero, and perhaps higher than for the other m's. So the overall probability for this path is higher.

Wait, but without knowing the exact values, perhaps I need to think about the selection rules and which options are possible.

Wait, the problem states that the decay is via two dipole transitions. So each transition must obey the dipole selection rules.

Looking back at the options, options B and C involve transitions from |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> and → |2,1,-1>, respectively. Then, each would have to transition to |1,0,0>.

If these transitions are allowed, then all four options are possible except D, which seems incomplete in the problem statement.

Wait, in option D, the initial transition is written as |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle, which is the same as option A, but the probability given is 2/3. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but how is that possible? If the first transition has a higher probability, perhaps 2/3, and the second transition has a probability of 1, then the total would be 2/3.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> has the highest probability, and the second transition is certain. So the total probability is the probability of the first transition.

If the first transition to m=0 has a probability of 1/3, the total probability would be 1/3, as in option A.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the possible probabilities.

Another thought: the dipole transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0 has a higher probability than the other m options because m=0 corresponds to the same orientation in space as the initial state (since initial m=0), so the overlap is better.

Thus, the first transition to m=0 would have a higher probability, say 1/3. Then the second transition from m=0 to m=0 would be certain, giving a total probability of 1/3.

Which matches option A.

Alternatively, if the first transition to m=0 has a probability of 2/3, but I don't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition has probabilities: m=0 → 2/3, m=1 → 1/6, m=-1 → 1/6. So the sum would be 1.

Then, the second transition's probabilities would vary. Let's say for m=0, the transition to m=0 is certain (probability 1). For m=1, the transition to m=0 has probability 1/2, and for m=-1, the transition to m=0 has probability 1/2.

Then, the total probability would be:

(2/3 * 1) + (1/6 * 1/2) + (1/6 * 1/2) = 2/3 + (1/12 + 1/12 ) = 2/3 + 1/6 = 5/6. Which isn't any of the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition's probabilities are 1/3 each, and the second transitions' are 1/3 each. So the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. Since there are three such paths, the total is 3 * 1/9 = 1/3. Which matches option A.

Wait, yes! Because each path contributes 1/9, and there are three paths, the total is 3 * 1/9 = 1/3. So option A, which states the probability is 1/3, is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis focuses on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require:

1. **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number changes by ±1.
2. **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number changes by 0, ±1.
3. **Δn ≠ 0**: The principal quantum number changes, but transitions are most likely to occur between adjacent energy levels.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition**:  
   Starting from |3,0,0⟩, the first transition must go to a state with **l = 1** (Δl = +1). The possible intermediate states are |2,1,m⟩, where **m = -1, 0, +1**. These correspond to the three possible values of m, and each transition is allowed by the selection rules.

2. **Second Transition**:  
   From the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the second transition must go to |1,0,0⟩. This requires **Δl = -1** (from l = 1 to l = 0) and **Δm = m → 0**. The allowed transitions are:
   - From |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = 0).
   - From |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = -1).
   - From |2,1,-1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = +1).

3. **Probabilities of Transitions**:  
   The probabilities of the first transition to |2,1,m⟩ depend on the overlap of the spherical harmonics and the matrix elements of the dipole operator. For simplicity, it is assumed that the first transition probabilities for m = -1, 0, +1 are equal, each with a probability of **1/3**. The second transition probabilities are also assumed to be equal for simplicity, with each having a probability of **1**.

4. **Total Probability**:  
   Since there are three possible paths (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩), and each path has a probability of **1/3**, the total probability for the decay is the sum of the probabilities of all three paths. This results in a total probability of **1/3**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability **1/3**. This matches the calculated total probability and is consistent with the assumption of equal probabilities for the three paths.
- **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability **1/4**. This does not match the calculated total probability.
- **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability **1/4**. This also does not match the calculated total probability.
- **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability **2/3**. This overestimates the probability and is inconsistent with the assumed equal probabilities for the three paths.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it aligns with the calculated total probability of **1/3** and the assumed equal probabilities for the three possible paths.
