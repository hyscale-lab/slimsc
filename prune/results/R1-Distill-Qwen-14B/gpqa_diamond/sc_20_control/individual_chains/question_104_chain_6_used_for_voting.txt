Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The idea is that as the planet orbits the star, the star moves a bit in the opposite direction, causing the spectral lines to shift slightly back and forth.

The question says that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the only variables here are the Doppler shifts detected.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom (that's 0.005 angstroms) shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity. The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is the maximum speed the star moves toward or away from us.

The formula I remember is something like K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part goes away.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ]

But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the same for both planets here because the stars have the same mass as the Sun. So M_p is similar to Neptune, but the stars are same, so M_p is same? Wait, no, wait the question says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, but it's not stated that they are same. Hmm, perhaps they are same? Or not? Wait, the question says both have masses similar to Neptune, but perhaps their actual masses could be different. But the RV method gives us K, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbit.

Wait, but in the problem, the RV shift (K) is given for each planet. So the K for Planet #1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for Planet #2 it's 7 milliangstrom. But wait, no, the question says the shift was up to 5 milliangstrom for Planet #1, and 7 milliangstrom for Planet #2. So K is proportional to the shift?

Wait, I think K is the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, so the maximum shift. So K for each planet is 5 and 7 miliangstroms.

Wait, but how does K relate to the orbital period? Let's think.

The formula for K is:

K = (v * sin i) 

Where v is the star's velocity. Since the orbits are circular, sin i is 1 (assuming edge-on, which is the case for maximum shift).

But how does K relate to the orbital parameters? I think the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period and distance.

Alternatively, the formula for K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / ( sqrt( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) ) ] 

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to look for a relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, I remember that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_*) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the formula in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) a³

Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_*)) a³

So a³ = (G M_* P²)/(4 π²)

But the RV method also relates K to the velocity, which is another Keplerian relation. The star's velocity v is given by v = (2π a_*) / P, where a_* is the star's orbit radius. For a planet of mass M_p orbiting a star of mass M_*, the star's orbit radius a_* is given by a_* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) a. Since M_p << M_*, a_* ≈ (M_p / M_*) a.

So v = (2 π a_* ) / P = (2 π (M_p / M_*) a ) / P

But from Kepler's law, a³ = (G M_* P²)/(4 π²), so a = [ G M_* P²/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a into v:

v = (2 π (M_p / M_*) [ (G M_* P²/(4 π²) )^(1/3) ]) / P

Simplify:

v = (2 π M_p / M_*) * [ (G M_* P² )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) / P

Let me compute the exponents:

Let me write it as:

v = (2 π M_p / M_*) * [ (G M_* P² )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/P )

Simplify the terms:

Let me separate the terms inside the cube root:

= [ G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ] / [ (4 π²)^(1/3) ) ] 

So,

v = (2 π M_p / M_*) * [ G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ] / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) / P

Simplify each part:

The denominator (4 π²)^(1/3) is 4^(1/3) π^(2/3)

So,

v = (2 π M_p / M_*) * G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) P )

Simplify the exponents of π:

In numerator: 2 π → 2 π^1

Denominator: 4^(1/3) π^(2/3 )

So,

Combine π terms: (2 π^1 ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) = 2 / 4^(1/3) * π^(1 - 2/3) = 2/(4^(1/3)) ) * π^(1/3)

Wait, let me compute 4^(1/3) as (2²)^(1/3) = 2^(2/3)

So 2 / 4^(1/3) = 2 / (2^(2/3)) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) )= 2^(1/3)

So the π terms become 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) = (2 π)^(1/3)

Now, the M_* terms:

M_p / M_* multiplied by M_*^(1/3) → M_p * M_*^(-1 + 1/3 ) = M_p * M_*^(-2/3)

But since M_* is same for both planets, we can treat this as a constant factor, which will cancel out when taking the ratio of K2 to K1.

Putting it all together:

v = [ (2 π M_p) / M_* ] * [ G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) P ) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write the formula for K (the semi-amplitude):

K = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (sin i) ] / ( (1) / ( (P/(2 π))^(1/3) ) )

But since sin i is 1 (edge-on), and M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) * (2 π )^(1/3) / P^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

K = ( (G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2 π / P )^(1/3) )  * (1 / ( (1) ) )

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look for a more straightforward formula that relates K, P, and M_p.

Another approach is to note that for the same star mass, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Wait, no, let me think again. From the formula I've seen before, K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_* ) )^{1/3} * (1 / (P^{1/3}) )

But if the planet masses are the same, and the star masses are same, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K means shorter period.

Wait, but in this question, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, but the problem doesn't state they're the same. Wait, the question says "both with masses similar to that of Neptune." So perhaps their masses are approximately the same, so M_p is same for both planets.

If that's the case, then since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), the ratio of their periods can be found from the inverse cube of the ratio of their K values.

Wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so:

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)) → P ∝ 1/(K^(3))

But wait, if K1 is for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then:

P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3

Wait, let me see. If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant involving other factors (like mass and star stuff, which are same for both planets). So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Take the ratio K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3) )/( P1^(1/3) )

→ K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

Therefore, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, that would mean the period of planet 2 is ( (K1/K2) )^3 times that of planet 1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate.

If K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

and K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Then, K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3) )/( P1^(1/3) )

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

So the period of planet 2 is (K1/K2)^3 times that of planet 1.

Wait, but in our case, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 → (5/7)^3 is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1 → which means P2 is shorter than P1. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then planet #2's period is shorter. So it's 0.364 times as long as planet #1's period.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me make sure I have the ratio correct. Because in the question, the shift is larger for planet #2. So K2 is larger than K1.

So K2 = 7, K1=5. So K2/K1 =7/5=1.4.

Wait, in our earlier analysis, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 → P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = approx 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.

But the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? So if planet #2's period is 0.364 times planet #1's, then it's 0.364 times as long. So the answer would be about 0.36 times. Looking at options, option A is ~0.36.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Because I assumed that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so a higher K would mean a shorter period. So if planet #2 has a larger K, it has a shorter period. So P2 < P1.

But the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So the calculation would be (P2/P1) = 0.364, so about 0.36 times as long.

So the correct answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), given the same star mass and planet mass. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

From this proportionality, we can derive:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet #2 (\( P_2 \)) and Planet #1 (\( P_1 \)) is therefore:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is **approximately 0.36 times**.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **Option A (~0.36):** Matches the calculated ratio.
- **Option B (~1.40):** Incorrect, as it represents the ratio of \( K_2 \) to \( K_1 \), not the period ratio.
- **Option C (~1.96):** Incorrect, as it does not align with the derived relationship.
- **Option D (~0.85):** Incorrect, as it is not consistent with the calculated ratio.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to look for a relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, I remember that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_*) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the formula in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) a³

Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_*)) a³

So a³ = (G M_* P²)/(4 π²)

But the RV method also relates K to the velocity, which is another Keplerian relation. The star's velocity v is given by v = (2π a_*) / P, where a_* is the star's orbit radius. For a planet of mass M_p orbiting a star of mass M_*, the star's orbit radius a_* is given by a_* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) a. Since M_p << M_*, a_* ≈ (M_p / M_*) a.

So v = (2 π a_* ) / P = (2 π (M_p / M_*) a ) / P

But from Kepler's law, a³ = (G M_* P²)/(4 π²), so a = [ G M_* P²/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a into v:

v = (2 π (M_p / M_*) [ (G M_* P²/(4 π²) )^(1/3) ]) / P

Simplify:

v = (2 π M_p / M_*) * [ (G M_* P² )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) / P

Let me compute the exponents:

Let me write it as:

v = (2 π M_p / M_*) * [ (G M_* P² )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/P )

Simplify the terms:

Let me separate the terms inside the cube root:

= [ G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ] / [ (4 π²)^(1/3) ) ] 

So,

v = (2 π M_p / M_*) * [ G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ] / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) / P

Simplify each part:

The denominator (4 π²)^(1/3) is 4^(1/3) π^(2/3)

So,

v = (2 π M_p / M_*) * G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) P )

Simplify the exponents of π:

In numerator: 2 π → 2 π^1

Denominator: 4^(1/3) π^(2/3 )

So,

Combine π terms: (2 π^1 ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) = 2 / 4^(1/3) * π^(1 - 2/3) = 2/(4^(1/3)) ) * π^(1/3)

Wait, let me compute 4^(1/3) as (2²)^(1/3) = 2^(2/3)

So 2 / 4^(1/3) = 2 / (2^(2/3)) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) )= 2^(1/3)

So the π terms become 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) = (2 π)^(1/3)

Now, the M_* terms:

M_p / M_* multiplied by M_*^(1/3) → M_p * M_*^(-1 + 1/3 ) = M_p * M_*^(-2/3)

But since M_* is same for both planets, we can treat this as a constant factor, which will cancel out when taking the ratio of K2 to K1.

Putting it all together:

v = [ (2 π M_p) / M_* ] * [ G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) P ) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write the formula for K (the semi-amplitude):

K = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (sin i) ] / ( (1) / ( (P/(2 π))^(1/3) ) )

But since sin i is 1 (edge-on), and M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) * (2 π )^(1/3) / P^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

K = ( (G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2 π / P )^(1/3) )  * (1 / ( (1) ) )

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look for a more straightforward formula that relates K, P, and M_p.

Another approach is to note that for the same star mass, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Wait, no, let me think again. From the formula I've seen before, K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_* ) )^{1/3} * (1 / (P^{1/3}) )

But if the planet masses are the same, and the star masses are same, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K means shorter period.

Wait, but in this question, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, but the problem doesn't state they're the same. Wait, the question says "both with masses similar to that of Neptune." So perhaps their masses are approximately the same, so M_p is same for both planets.

If that's the case, then since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), the ratio of their periods can be found from the inverse cube of the ratio of their K values.

Wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so:

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)) → P ∝ 1/(K^(3))

But wait, if K1 is for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then:

P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3

Wait, let me see. If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant involving other factors (like mass and star stuff, which are same for both planets). So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Take the ratio K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3) )/( P1^(1/3) )

→ K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

Therefore, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, that would mean the period of planet 2 is ( (K1/K2) )^3 times that of planet 1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate.

If K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

and K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Then, K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3) )/( P1^(1/3) )

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

So the period of planet 2 is (K1/K2)^3 times that of planet 1.

Wait, but in our case, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 → (5/7)^3 is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1 → which means P2 is shorter than P1. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then planet #2's period is shorter. So it's 0.364 times as long as planet #1's period.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me make sure I have the ratio correct. Because in the question, the shift is larger for planet #2. So K2 is larger than K1.

So K2 = 7, K1=5. So K2/K1 =7/5=1.4.

Wait, in our earlier analysis, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 → P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = approx 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.

But the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? So if planet #2's period is 0.364 times planet #1's, then it's 0.364 times as long. So the answer would be about 0.36 times. Looking at options, option A is ~0.36.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Because I assumed that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so a higher K would mean a shorter period. So if planet #2 has a larger K, it has a shorter period. So P2 < P1.

But the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So the calculation would be (P2/P1) = 0.364, so about 0.36 times as long.

So the correct answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), given the same star mass and planet mass. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

From this proportionality, we can derive:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet #2 (\( P_2 \)) and Planet #1 (\( P_1 \)) is therefore:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is **approximately 0.36 times**.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **Option A (~0.36):** Matches the calculated ratio.
- **Option B (~1.40):** Incorrect, as it represents the ratio of \( K_2 \) to \( K_1 \), not the period ratio.
- **Option C (~1.96):** Incorrect, as it does not align with the derived relationship.
- **Option D (~0.85):** Incorrect, as it is not consistent with the calculated ratio.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
