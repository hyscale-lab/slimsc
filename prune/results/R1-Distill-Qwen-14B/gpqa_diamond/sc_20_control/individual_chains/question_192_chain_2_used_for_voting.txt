Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside it, not at the center. The center of the cavity is a distance 's' away from the conductor's center. The cavity has radius r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity.

The question is asking for the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions involving these variables. I think I need to figure out which one correctly gives the electric field at point P.

So, I remember that when dealing with conductors, the charges redistribute in certain ways. Since the conductor is uncharged, any charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the conductor's surfaces.

Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. When you put a charge inside the cavity, it's like the cavity's charge induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Oh right, in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So the charges rearrange themselves to cancel any internal fields.

The charge inside the cavity (+q) would cause an induction effect. The inner surface of the conductor (which is the surface of the cavity) would have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is initially neutral. If the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q induced, right? Because the cavity's charge attracts opposite charges. So the inner surface is -q, and since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So total charge is 0 = (-q) + (+q).

So the outer surface ends up with +q. Now, the electric field outside the conductor is due to the charges on the outer surface, because the inner charges are screened by the conductor.

So, point P is outside the conductor, so the field there is just due to the +q on the outer surface. But wait, how is the charge distributed on the outer surface? Because the conductor is spherical, but the cavity isn't at the center, so is the outer surface symmetric? Or does the presence of the cavity's off-center position affect the outer charge distribution?

Wait a minute, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface will distribute themselves uniformly, regardless of the cavity's position, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, and in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the outer surface will arrange to make the electric field inside the conductor zero. So the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform.

Wait, but the cavity isn't at the center. Oh, but the conductor being a sphere, the charges on the outer surface adjust to make the field zero inside. So even if the cavity is off-center, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform because of the spherical symmetry of the conductor. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the field inside the conductor is zero, but the charges on the outer surface arrange themselves such that their distribution depends on the cavity's charge. But for a spherical conductor, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform regardless of the internal cavity's charges as long as the conductor is neutral. No, wait, I think that the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, because the conductor is spherical. So any induced charge on the outer surface would arrange uniformly because the conductor's symmetry requires it.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor was initially neutral, and the inner surface has -q. So the outer surface must have +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q, distributed uniformly over the sphere.

So, when calculating the electric field at a point outside the conductor, like point P, the field is due to the +q on the outer surface. But wait, point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta, where s is the distance between the two centers.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize this. The conductor has its center at O. The cavity is inside, with its center at O', which is a distance s from O. So O' is s away from O. Point P is outside the conductor, at a distance L from O, and its distance from O' is l. The angle between OO' (vector s) and O'P (vector l) is theta.

So, perhaps we can model the arrangement as the conductor's center O, the cavity's center O' at a distance s from O, point P at a distance L from O, and l is the distance from O' to P.

But how does this affect the electric field at P? Since the outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, the field at P due to the +q on the outer surface should be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center O. So the field would be (1/(4pi epsilon_0)) * (q)/(L^2), radially outward.

Wait, but is that the case? Because the charge is on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius R. So for any point outside, the field is as if the charge were at the center. So the direction would be along the line from the center to point P, but in this problem, the point P is located relative to the cavity's center, which is offset.

Wait, no. The conductor is a sphere, so regardless of where O' is, the outer surface is a sphere of radius R centered at O. So any external point P is at a distance L from O. The electric field at P due to the outer charge would be directed radially outward from O, right? So the magnitude would be (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q)/(L^2).

Looking at the options, option B is 1/(4 pi epsilon) * q / L^2. That would make sense if the field is as if the charge were at the center.

But wait, what about the original charge inside the cavity? Since the conductor is uncharged, the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q. But since the cavity is not at the center, does that affect the field outside?

Wait, no. Because the conductor shields the interior from the exterior. So the external field is only due to the outer surface charge. The inner charges and the cavity's charge do not affect the external field. So the external field is the same as if the outer charge were a point charge at the center.

So the electric field at P is (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q)/(L^2) in magnitude. Looking at the options, option B matches this.

But wait, let's think about the setup again. The charge is inside the cavity, which is not at the center. So does the field outside depend on the position of the cavity's charge relative to the point P?

Hmm. Wait, the field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge. Since the outer surface is uniformly charged, the field at any external point is as if all the charge were at the center. So the position of the cavity's charge inside doesn't affect the external field. So the answer is B.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let's imagine that the outer charge is uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius R. So when you have a point P outside, the distance from P to O is L, and the distance from P to O' is l. But the outer charge is located on O's sphere, so the field from the outer charge would be as if it's at O, regardless of O'.

Wait, but what if the point P is not along the line connecting O and O'? Like, in the problem, the angle theta is between l and s. So the position of O' relative to O might influence the field at P in some way. Oh, but no, because the outer surface's charge is uniform, so the electric field outside is (1/(4 pi epsilon)) q/(L^2) in the radial direction from O. So the angle theta might not matter for the magnitude because the field is radial from O, and the distance is L.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about it more carefully. The conductor's outer surface has a uniform charge +q. The field at point P is due to this charge. Since the charge distribution is uniform, the electric field at P is as if all the charge is concentrated at the center O. So the magnitude is E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q)/(L^2).

That's exactly option B. So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius \( R \) with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance \( s \) from the conductor's center, and the cavity has a radius \( r \) where \( r < R \). A small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the magnitude of the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, which is at a distance \( L \) from the conductor's center. The distance from \( P \) to the cavity's center is \( l \), and the angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

To solve this, we analyze the charge distribution and the resulting electric field:

1. **Charge Induction**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the charge \( +q \) inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge \( -q \) on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of \( +q \), distributed uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field at a point outside the conductor is determined by the charges on the outer surface. For a uniformly charged spherical surface, the electric field outside the sphere is equivalent to that of a point charge located at the center of the sphere. Thus, the electric field at point \( P \) is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where \( L \) is the distance from the center of the conductor to point \( P \).

3. **Relevance of \( l \), \( s \), and \( \theta \)**: The distance \( l \) (distance from \( P \) to the cavity's center) and the angle \( \theta \) between \( l \) and \( s \) (distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity) are not directly relevant to the electric field at \( P \). This is because the outer surface charge distribution is uniform, and the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge \( +q \) and the distance \( L \) from the conductor's center.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2} \) does not describe the electric field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on \( L \), not \( l \) or \( \theta \).
   - **Option B**: Correct. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2} \) correctly represents the electric field at \( P \) due to the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface of the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2} \) is not relevant to the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2} \) incorrectly suggests that the field depends on \( l \), which is not the case.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
