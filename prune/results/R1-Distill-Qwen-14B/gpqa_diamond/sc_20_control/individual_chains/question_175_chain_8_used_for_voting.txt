Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm. Let me try to think this through step by step. 

Alright, the question says we have an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, along with a possible form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a dependency on λ. Let me recall what I know about dipole radiation and antenna patterns.

So, I remember that for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) depends on the angle θ. The power radiated per unit solid angle, which is the radiation intensity, for a dipole varies with θ. The formula, if I'm not mistaken, is something like I = (p²/(4πc)) * (something with sin²θ) ) / something else with λ. Wait, maybe I should get the exact expression.

Wait, the radiated power per unit solid angle (intensity) for an oscillating dipole is given by the formula: 

I(θ) = ( (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴ sin²θ) ) / (12π c) )

But wait, p is the dipole moment, which might be oscillating. And since it's oscillating, the frequency comes into play. But in terms of wavelength λ, since λ = c/f, and ω is 2πf, so λ = 2πc/(ω), so ω = 2π c / λ.

Wait, let's think about the expression for I(θ). Oh, right, the dipole radiation formula is I(θ) = ( (p₀² ω⁴ sin²θ) ) / (12π ε₀ c³) )

Wait, but in terms of λ, because ω is 2π c / λ, so ω⁴ would be (2π c / λ)^4 = (2π)^4 c^4 / λ^4.

So substituting ω⁴ in terms of λ:

I(θ) = [ p₀² (2π c / λ)^4 sin²θ ] / (12π ε₀ c³ )

Simplify that:

= [ p₀² (16 π^4 c^4 / λ^4 ) sin²θ ] / (12 π ε₀ c³ )

The c^4 in numerator and c^3 in denominator gives c in numerator.

So,

= [ p₀² * 16 π^4 c / λ^4 * sin²θ ] / (12 π ε₀ )

Simplify the constants: 16 π^4 / (12 π ) = (16/12) π^3 = (4/3) π^3.

So,

I(θ) = [ p₀² * 4 π^3 c ] / (3 λ^4 ε₀ ) * sin²θ

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the constants, but maybe I don't need them because the question is about the dependence on θ and λ, and the ratio.

The maximum power occurs when sin²θ is maximum. When is that? Oh, right, when θ is 90 degrees because sin(90) is 1. So the maximum intensity A is when θ=90, so sinθ=1. Thus,

A = I_max = (p₀² 4 π^3 c )/(3 λ^4 ε₀ )

But wait, perhaps more correctly, the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, which is the equator of the dipole, because the dipole's radiation is maximum perpendicular to its axis.

So, the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. So, for any angle θ, the intensity is (sinθ)^2 times the maximum intensity.

Wait, so the intensity I(θ) is proportional to sin²θ. So the ratio of I(θ) to A would be (sinθ)^2 / (sin90)^2) = sin²θ.

So, for θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so sin²θ is 0.25. Therefore, the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 is 0.25, which is 1/4.

But wait, wait. The question says the maximum power is A. So the total power is the integral of I(θ) over all solid angles, right? Because the intensity is power per unit solid angle, so the total power is ∫ I(θ) sinθ dθ dφ.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the maximum power is A. So perhaps A is the maximum value of I(θ). Or maybe A is the total power, and the maximum intensity is part of that.

Wait, no, because the question says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So I think A is the maximum value of the intensity I(θ), which occurs at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the total power radiated is the integral of I(θ) over all solid angles. So A would be the maximum intensity, not the total power. But the question says "the maximum power thus radiated is A." Hmm. So perhaps A is the total power, but that seems unlikely because the intensity is per unit solid angle.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle (intensity) is given by f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A. So A would be the maximum value of f(λ, θ). So, if f(λ, θ) is proportional to sin^2θ, then the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, and f_max = f(λ, 90°) = some function of λ.

But the question is about the fraction of A radiated at θ=30°. So if the maximum intensity is A, then the intensity at θ=30 is (sin30)^2 = 1/4 of A. So the fraction is 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, which is option B or C.

Now, what about the functional form of f, which is the intensity. From the earlier expression, f is proportional to sin²θ and to 1/λ^4. Because in the expression for I(θ), after substitution, the dependence on λ is 1/λ^4.

So the function f would be proportional to sin²θ * (1/λ^4).

Looking at the options:

Option C says A is 1/4 and f is λ^-4. So function is λ^-4. So that's a match.

Option B has f as λ^-3. So probably not.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function is λ^-4.

So looking at the options:

Option C is 1/4 and λ^(-4). So that looks correct.

Wait, what about the other options? Option A is 1/2 and λ^-4. But 1/2 would imply sinθ= sqrt(1/2), which is 45 degrees, not 30. Option B is 1/4, but λ^-3, which doesn't fit with the 1/λ^4 dependence.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radiation pattern of an oscillating dipole. The radiated power per unit solid angle, or intensity \( I(\theta) \), for a dipole varies with the angle \( \theta \) and the wavelength \( \lambda \). The intensity is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \) and inversely proportional to \( \lambda^4 \), based on the dipole radiation formula:

\[
I(\theta) \propto \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\lambda^4}.
\]

The maximum intensity \( A \) occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \). For any other angle \( \theta \), the intensity is reduced by a factor of \( \sin^2\theta \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin\theta = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2\theta = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum intensity \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{I(30^\circ)}{A} = \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The functional form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), which describes the intensity, depends on \( \lambda \) as \( \lambda^{-4} \), consistent with the dipole radiation formula.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{1}{2}, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), not \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- **Option B**: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the functional dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction and the functional form.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{3}{4}, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the functional dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, with a fraction of \( \frac{1}{4} \) and a functional form of \( \lambda^{-4} \).
