Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable. Right, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the state of the system is a vector. The probability is calculated using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator.

Wait, the state here is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, actually, the state vector should be normalized, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. But wait, the elements given are (-1, 2, 1). Let me check the length. The magnitude would be sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the state isn't normalized. Hmm, but maybe the question gives the state as it is and I have to proceed as is, without normalizing. Or perhaps I should normalize it first. Wait, the problem says "the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)", so perhaps I should consider it as is, without normalization. But wait, in measurement probabilities, I think the state must be normalized. Because the probabilities have to sum to 1. So maybe I need to normalize the state vector first.

So the state vector |ψ> is [-1; 2; 1]. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the unit vector would be 1/sqrt(6) times this vector. So ψ = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

The observable is represented by matrix P. The matrix P's elements are given: the first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write that out:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Wait, I need to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then find the components of the state vector in those eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe P is a projection operator. Because the way it's written, P seems to have a structure that could be a projection matrix. Let me think: the trace of P is 0 (since the diagonal elements are 0,0,0), and the sum of the squares of the elements in each row would be (0^2 + (1/√2)^2 + 0^2) = 1/2 for the first row; similarly for the second row, (1/√2)^2 + 0^2 + (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 as well. The third row is the same as the first. So each row sums to 1/2, which is characteristic of a projection matrix, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: since P is the observable, when we measure it, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. So the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me compute the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

But wait, P is a 3x3 matrix. The equation might be a bit tedious, but let me try.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ      1/√2        0      |
|1/√2    -λ        1/√2   |
|0       1/√2      -λ     |

Calculating this determinant:

Let me expand along the first row.

-λ * det [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] 
- (1/√2) * det [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] 
+ 0 * det (...) 

So first term is -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term is - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] 
= - (1/√2) * [ -λ / √2 ]
= - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2 )
= ( λ ) / 2

Third term is zero.

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Let me expand this:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + λ/2 = 0

Wait, wait:

Wait, expanding the first term:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2)

The second term is + (λ/2)

So total: (-λ^3 + λ/2 ) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

So the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor this: λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0, and then compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me see.

Wait, another approach. Since P is the observable, when we measure it, the probability of outcome λ is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes of the eigenvectors of P (with eigenvalue λ) in the state vector.

So first, let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So for λ=0, the matrix P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0 ]

Which is the same as the original matrix, since λ was zero. So we have to solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system is:

1) (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

2) (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

3) (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

So from equation 1 and 3, v2=0. From equation 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, v3]^T, where v1 = -v3. Let me write this as v3*(-1, 0, 1) + v1*(1,0,-1). Wait, no, because v1 = -v3. Let me set v3 = a, then v1 = -a. So the eigenvector is a*(-1, 0, 1) → [ -a, 0, a ] → a*( -1, 0, 1 ). So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector ( -1, 0, 1 )^T.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Plugging vector ( -1, 0, 1 ) into P:

P * [ -1; 0; 1 ] =

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1 = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 + 1)/√2 = 0.

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 +0*1 = 0.

So yes, the vector ( -1, 0, 1 ) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Therefore, the projection onto this eigenspace is the outer product of this eigenvector with itself, normalized.

Wait, but to compute the probability, I can compute the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector, then square the absolute value.

Wait, no, because the eigenvector might not be normalized. So let me normalize it first.

The eigenvector is (-1, 0, 1). Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is 1/sqrt(2) * (-1, 0, 1).

So the projection amplitude is the inner product of the state vector and this unit eigenvector.

But wait, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6), because earlier I thought it's not normalized. So let me correct that.

Wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T. The norm squared is 1 +4 +1=6, so the norm is sqrt(6), so the state vector is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6).

So the unit state vector is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6).

The unit eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is ( -1, 0, 1 ) / sqrt(2).

So the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector is:

( (-1) * (-1) + 2 * 0 + 1 * 1 ) / ( sqrt(6) * sqrt(2) )

Wait, let's compute numerator:

(-1)(-1) = 1

2 *0=0

1 *1=1

Sum: 1 +0 +1 =2.

Denominator: sqrt(6)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3).

So inner product = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3, which is option C.

To calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The state vector is given as \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After calculations, the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
\]

### Step 3: Find the eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), solve \( P | v \rangle = 0 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
| v \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Normalize this eigenvector:

\[
| v \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the projection amplitude
The projection amplitude of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( | v \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Compute the numerator:

\[
(-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.
\]

The denominator is:

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6} = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{2}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the probability
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the projection amplitude:

\[
P(0) = \left| \langle v | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
