Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me. It's about matrices and some properties related to them. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question presents four matrices: W, X, Y, and Z. Each matrix is 3x3. The options are statements about these matrices, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me first recall some concepts from quantum mechanics. So, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because they have real eigenvalues, which correspond to measurable quantities. The evolution operator, also known as the time evolution operator, is unitary. Unitary matrices have the property that their conjugate transpose is their inverse. So, for a matrix U to be unitary, U† U = I, where U† is the conjugate transpose and I is the identity matrix.

Another thing I remember is that the exponential of a matrix, e^M, is unitary if M is anti-Hermitian. Anti-Hermitian matrices satisfy M† = -M. So, if X is anti-Hermitian, e^X would be unitary, which is needed for the evolution operator.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says that W and X are evolution operators. So, I'll need to check if they're unitary. But I also need to think about other properties, like whether they're Hermitian or not.

Let me look at each matrix one by one.

Starting with matrix W:
W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Is W Hermitian? A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. W is real, so its conjugate transpose is the same as its transpose. The transpose of W would swap elements across the diagonal. W's transpose is the same as W because it's symmetric. So W is Hermitian. So W could represent an observable, like option C says Z and X are observables. But wait, option C says Z and X are observables. Are they Hermitian? I need to check.

Next, matrix X:
X is:
i   -1  2i
1    0   1
2i  -1  -i

To check if X is Hermitian, I'll compute X† and see if it equals X.

The conjugate transpose of X would be:
Row 1: i* (-1), 1*, (2i)* → which is -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: (-1)*, 0*, 1* → which is -1, 0, 1
Row 3: (2i)*, (-1)*, (-i)* → which is -2i, -1, i

So X† is:
(-i, -1, -2i)
(1, 0, 1)
(-2i, -1, i)

Comparing to X:
X is:
i   -1  2i
1    0   1
2i  -1  -i

So, X† is not equal to X. So X isn't Hermitian. That would mean option C, which says Z and X are observables, is probably incorrect because X isn't Hermitian.

What about matrix Y? It's given as:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

This looks symmetric, so Y is equal to its transpose. Since Y is real and symmetric, it's Hermitian. So Y is an observable. But option C doesn't mention Y, so that's not relevant for the options given.

Matrix Z is:
3    2i   5
-2i  -2  -4i
5    4i   4

Again, let's check if Z is Hermitian by computing Z†.

Z† would be the conjugate transpose. So, the first row becomes the first column, etc., with each element conjugated.

Z's elements without conjugation:
Row 1: 3, 2i,5
Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i
Row3:5,4i,4

Conjugate each element:
Row1 becomes 3, -2i,5
Row2 becomes 2i, -2,4i
Row3 becomes5, -4i,4

Then, transpose:

First column of Z† is 3, 2i,5 → becomes row1: 3, 2i,5
Second column is -2i, -2, -4i → becomes row2: -2i, -2, -4i
Third column is 5,4i,4 → becomes row3:5,4i,4

Wait, no, when you take the conjugate transpose, you first take the transpose and then conjugate each element. Wait no, more accurately: the conjugate transpose is formed by taking the transpose of the matrix and then taking the complex conjugate of each element.

Wait, no, actually, the conjugate transpose (also called adjoint) is formed by transposing the matrix and then taking the complex conjugate of each element.

So for Z, transpose would swap elements like Z[1,2] becomes Z[2,1], etc.

Original Z:
Row1: 3, 2i,5
Row2: -2i, -2, -4i
Row3: 5, 4i,4

Transposed Z:
Column 1 becomes row1: 3, -2i,5
Column2 becomes row2: 2i, -2,4i
Column3 becomes row3:5, -4i,4

Now, take the conjugate of each element in each row:

Row1: 3, 2i,5 → wait no, the transposed matrix is:
Row1 after transpose: 3, -2i,5 → conjugate → 3, 2i,5
Row2 after transpose: 2i, -2,4i → conjugate → -2i, -2, -4i
Row3 after transpose:5, -4i,4 → conjugate →5,4i,4

So Z† is:
[ [3, 2i,5],
  [-2i, -2, -4i],
  [5,4i,4] ]

Compare this to the original Z:

Original Z:
[ [3, 2i,5],
  [-2i, -2, -4i],
  [5,4i,4] ]

Wait, that's exactly the same as Z†. So Z is equal to its conjugate transpose. Therefore, Z is Hermitian. So Z is an observable, but X isn't. So option C says Z and X are observables. That's incorrect because X isn't Hermitian.

So option C is wrong.

Now, moving on to the options.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, the exponential of a matrix. If e^X is not unitary, then multiplying by it would change the norm. But if e^X were unitary, the norm would stay the same.

Earlier, I thought about whether X is anti-Hermitian. Because if X is anti-Hermitian (X† = -X), then e^X would be unitary.

So let's check if X is anti-Hermitian. X† is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i

Wait no, earlier, I found X† as:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i

Row2: -1, 0, 1

Row3: -2i, -1, i

Wait, wait, no, let me re-calculate X† properly.

X is:
Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2:1, 0, 1
Row3:2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate of each element is:

Row1: -i, -1, -2i

Row2: 1, 0, 1

Row3: -2i, -1, i

Then, transpose these rows into columns.

Original X:

Row1: i, -1, 2i → conjugate → -i, -1, -2i → becomes column1.

Row2: 1,0,1 → conjugate → 1,0,1 → becomes column2.

Row3: 2i, -1, -i → conjugate → -2i, -1, i → becomes column3.

So the conjugate transpose (X†) is:

Column1 becomes row1: -i, 1, -2i

Column2 becomes row2: -1, 0, -1

Column3 becomes row3: -2i,1, i

So X† is:

[-i, -1, -2i]
[ 1, 0, 1]
[-2i, -1, i ]

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the conjugate of X's elements:

Original X:

Row1: i → -i, -1 → -1, 2i → -2i

Row2: 1 →1, 0→0,1→1

Row3: 2i →-2i, -1 →-1, -i→i

Then, the conjugate matrix is:

Row1: -i, -1, -2i

Row2:1,0,1

Row3:-2i, -1, i

But when we transpose, the columns become rows. So the first row of X† is the first column of X's conjugate, which is i,1,2i. Wait, no, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The conjugate transpose of a matrix is formed by taking each element's complex conjugate and then transposing the matrix. So, for each element X[j,k], the conjugate transpose will have X†[i,j] = X[k,j]†, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps an easier way is to write out the matrix.

Let me write X and X† again.

X:
Row 1: i,  -1, 2i
Row 2:1,  0, 1
Row3:2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate of X is:

Row1: -i, -1, -2i
Row2: 1, 0, 1
Row3: -2i, -1, i

Then, the transpose is making rows into columns. So the first column of X† is the first row of the conjugate, which is [-i, 1, -2i]?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to construct X†:

X's elements:

X[1,1] = i → X†[1,1] = i* = -i

X[1,2] = -1 → X†[2,1] = (-1)* = -1

X[1,3] = 2i → X†[3,1] = (2i)* = -2i

X[2,1] =1 → X†[1,2]=1*

X[2,2]=0 → X†[2,2]=0

X[2,3]=1 → X†[3,2] =1

X[3,1]=2i → X†[1,3]= (2i)*= -2i

X[3,2]=-1 → X†[2,3]= (-1)*= -1

X[3,3]=-i → X†[3,3]= (-i)*=i

So X† is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i

Row2: -1, 0, -1

Row3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, let me write it properly:

X†:
[ [ -i , 1 , -2i ],
  [ -1 , 0 , -1 ],
  [ -2i, 1, i ] ]

Now, let's see if X† equals -X. Because for anti-Hermitian, X† = -X.

Compute -X:

-X is the negative of each element of X.

X is:
Row1: i, -1, 2i → -X row1: -i, 1, -2i
Row2:1, 0, 1 → -X row2: -1, 0, -1
Row3:2i,-1,-i → -X row3: -2i,1,i

Comparing to X†:

X† row1 is [ -i, 1, -2i ] which matches -X row1.

X† row2 is [ -1, 0, -1 ] which matches -X row2.

X† row3 is [ -2i, 1, i ] which matches -X row3.

So X† is equal to -X. Therefore, X is anti-Hermitian. So e^X would be unitary because for anti-Hermitian matrices, e^M is unitary.

Wait, because if M is anti-Hermitian, M = -M†, then e^M is unitary. Because (e^M)† = e^{M†} = e^{-M} = (e^M)^{-1}.

So e^X is unitary. So when you multiply a vector by e^X, the norm remains the same. Unless, wait, no. Unitary transformations preserve the norm. So if you have a vector v, then ||e^X v|| = ||v||.

So option A says that there exists a vector where multiplying by e^X changes the norm. But if e^X is unitary, it can't change the norm. So that would mean option A is incorrect because there's no such vector — all vectors have their norm preserved.

Wait, but wait — that depends on the matrix being unitary, which e^X is in this case. So option A is saying that there exists a vector where the norm changes. So if e^X is unitary, then this is impossible. So option A is false.

So option A is incorrect.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Wait, what's a quantum state? A quantum state is a unit vector in a Hilbert space, but in matrix terms, it's a density matrix which is positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and trace 1. Alternatively, in some contexts, a pure state is a projector matrix.

But (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) — what is this? Let me see. Since X is anti-Hermitian, e^X is unitary. So e^{-X} is (e^X)^dagger. So e^X e^{-X} is identity.

So (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is similar to Y via a unitary transformation. Y is Hermitian, so this transformation would produce another Hermitian matrix. So the product (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is Hermitian, because the product of unitaries and Y (Hermitian) would result in a Hermitian matrix. But does it correspond to a quantum state?

A quantum state's density matrix must be positive semi-definite and have trace 1. But the expression (e^X)† Y e^{-X} is just a similarity transform of Y, so it's unitarily equivalent. Since Y is positive definite (all eigenvalues positive?), maybe this transformed version is as well. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a density matrix because it's a 3x3 matrix, but the question doesn't state so. Alternatively, maybe the question is about a pure state which is a vector, but I'm not sure.

Wait, (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is a matrix. A density matrix is a valid quantum state. So the statement could be correct if the product is a valid density matrix.

But wait, Y is given as:

0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Check if Y is positive semi-definite. Let's compute its eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if Y is a density matrix.

Density matrices must have trace 1. Let's compute Y's trace: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So the trace is 1. Also, Y is Hermitian because it's real and symmetric. Now, to be a density matrix, it must be positive semi-definite. So all its eigenvalues should be >=0.

But I'm not sure if Y is positive definite. Let me try to see. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a valid density matrix, so the transformed version would also be a valid density matrix, making option B correct. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is a valid density matrix because Y is, and the transformation is unitary. So option B could be correct.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator is unitary. So I need to check if W and X are unitary.

Check if W is unitary. W is:

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Compute W† W and see if it's identity.

W† is W's conjugate transpose. Since W is real and symmetric, W† = W.

So W† W = W^2.

Compute W^2:

W * W:

First row:
(0*0 +0*0 +1*1), (0*0 +0*1 +1*0), (0*1 +0*0 +1*0)
→ 1, 0, 0

Second row:
(0*0 +1*0 +0*1), (0*0 +1*1 +0*0), (0*1 +1*0 +0*0)
→ 0, 1, 0

Third row:
(1*0 +0*0 +0*1), (1*0 +0*1 +0*0), (1*1 +0*0 +0*0)
→0,0,1

So W^2 is identity matrix. So W is unitary because W† W = I. So W is a valid evolution operator.

What about X? Earlier, I found that X is anti-Hermitian, so e^X is unitary. But X itself isn't unitary. Because, for X to be unitary, X† X should equal I.

Wait, let me compute X† X. X is the matrix we have, and X† is the conjugate transpose which we found earlier.

X† is:

Row1: -i, -1, -2i
Row2: 1, 0,1
Row3: -2i, -1, i

Multiply X† (3x3) by X (3x3):

The product will be a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute each element.

Compute element (1,1):

Sum over k=1 to 3 of X†[1,k] * X[k,1]

X†[1,1] = -i, X[1,1]=i → (-i)(i)= -i² =1
X†[1,2]=-1, X[2,1]=1 → (-1)(1) = -1
X†[1,3]=-2i, X[3,1]=2i → (-2i)(2i) = -4i² =4 (since i²=-1)
Sum: 1 -1 +4=4

Element (1,1) is 4.

Wait, but we're computing X† X, which is (3x3) * (3x3) = 3x3.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entire product, but this might take some time. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, since X is anti-Hermitian, X† = -X. So X† X = (-X) X = -X².

So if X is anti-Hermitian, X† = -X. So X† X = (-X) X = -X². For X to be unitary, X† X should be I. So, -X² must equal I.

Let me compute X².

X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2:1, 0,1
Row3:2i,-1,-i

Compute X squared:

X * X:

Element (1,1):

i*i + (-1)*1 + 2i*(2i)
= i² -1 +4i²
= (-1) -1 +4*(-1) → (-1 -1 -4) = -6.

Element (1,2):

i*(-1) + (-1)*0 + 2i*( -1 )
= -i + 0 -2i
= -3i.

Element (1,3):

i*(2i) + (-1)*1 + 2i*(-i)
= 2i² -1 + (-2i²)
= 2*(-1) -1 -2*(-1)
= (-2) -1 +2 = -1.

Element (2,1):

1*i + 0*1 +1*(2i)
= i +0 + 2i =3i.

Element (2,2):

1*(-1) +0*0 +1*(-1)
= -1 +0 -1 =-2.

Element (2,3):

1*(2i) +0*1 +1*(-i)
= 2i +0 -i =i.

Element (3,1):

2i*i + (-1)*1 + (-i)*2i
= 2i² -1 + (-2i²)
= 2*(-1) -1 + 2*(1) → (-2 -1 +2) =-1.

Element (3,2):

2i*(-1) + (-1)*0 + (-i)*(-1)
= -2i +0 +i =-i.

Element (3,3):

2i*(2i) + (-1)*1 + (-i)*(-i)
=4i² -1 + i²
=4*(-1) -1 + (-1)
= -4 -1 -1 =-6.

So X squared is:

[ [-6, -3i, -1],
  [3i, -2, i],
  [-1, -i, -6] ]

Now, X† X = (-X²) because X is anti-Hermitian.

So X† X = -X² =:

[ [6, 3i, 1],
  [-3i, 2, -i],
  [1, i, 6] ]

Which is definitely not the identity matrix. So X is not unitary. Therefore, X cannot be an evolution operator because the evolution operator has to be unitary. So option D is incorrect because X isn't unitary, even though W is. So since D says both W and X represent the evolution operator, which is not the case, D is wrong.

Wait, so option D is incorrect because X isn't unitary.

Now, back to the options.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Earlier, I thought that since Y is a density matrix (trace 1, Hermitian, positive definite), and the transformation is via a unitary matrix (e^X), then the transformed matrix would also be a density matrix. So the result would be a valid quantum state.

But I'm not 100% sure if Y is positive definite. Let me check.

Y's elements are all real and symmetric. The diagonal entries are 0.5, 0.25, 0.25. Let me compute the determinants of the leading minors to check positive definiteness.

First minor: 0.5 >0.

Second leading minor: determinant of top-left 2x2 matrix:

|0.5 0.1|
|0.1 0.25|

= (0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)^2 = 0.125 - 0.01=0.115>0.

Third leading minor is the determinant of Y itself.

Compute Y's determinant:

Using the rule for 3x3 matrices:

0.5*(0.25*0.25 - (0.1)(0.1)) - 0.1*(0.1*0.25 - 0.2*0.1) + 0.2*(0.1*0.1 - 0.25*0.2)

Let me compute each part.

First term: 0.5*(0.0625 - 0.01) =0.5*(0.0525)=0.02625.

Second term: -0.1*(0.025 - 0.02) = -0.1*(0.005)= -0.0005.

Third term: 0.2*(0.01 - 0.05)=0.2*(-0.04)= -0.008.

Total determinant: 0.02625 -0.0005 -0.008= 0.01775>0.

Since all leading minors are positive, Y is positive definite. So Y is a valid density matrix. Now, the product (e^X)† Y e^{-X} is a similarity transformation. Since e^X is unitary, the transformed matrix is unitarily similar to Y, which is positive definite. So the transformed matrix is also positive definite and Hermitian, and since Y has trace 1, the transformed matrix also has trace 1. So it's a valid density matrix, which represents a quantum state.

Therefore, option B is correct.

Wait, but wait — (e^X)† is e^{X†}, which is e^{-X} because X is anti-Hermitian. So e^{X†} = e^{-X}.

So (e^X)† Y e^{-X} is e^{-X} Y e^{X}? Or is that (e^X)† Y (e^{-X})?

Wait, (e^X)† is e^{X†} = e^{-X}.

So (e^X)† Y e^{-X} = e^{-X} Y e^{X}.

Wait, but actually, (e^X)† is e^{X†} = e^{-X} because X is anti-Hermitian.

So the expression is (e^X)† Y e^{-X} = e^{-X} Y e^{X}.

But regardless, since it's a unitary transformation, the product will have the same eigenvalues as Y, hence positive definite, and trace 1. So it's a valid density matrix.

Therefore, option B is correct.

So, summing up:

Option A: Incorrect because e^X is unitary, so the norm doesn't change.

Option B: Correct.

Option C: Incorrect because X isn't Hermitian.

Option D: Incorrect because X isn't unitary.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct statement about the given matrices, we analyze each option based on the properties of quantum mechanics and matrix operations.

---

### **Option A**  
The statement claims that there exists a vector for which the norm changes when multiplied by \( e^X \). For this to be true, \( e^X \) must not be unitary. However, \( X \) is anti-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), and the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary (\( e^X \) is unitary). Unitary matrices preserve the norm of any vector they act on. Therefore, no such vector exists, and this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### **Option B**  
The statement claims that \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) represents a quantum state. A quantum state is represented by a density matrix, which must be positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have trace 1.  

- \( Y \) is a \( 3 \times 3 \) symmetric matrix with real entries, making it Hermitian.  
- The trace of \( Y \) is \( 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1 \), satisfying the trace condition.  
- \( Y \) is positive definite, as verified by checking its leading principal minors: all are positive.  

Since \( Y \) is a valid density matrix, and \( e^X \) is unitary (\( X \) is anti-Hermitian), the similarity transformation \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) preserves the properties of \( Y \). The transformed matrix is also positive definite, Hermitian, and has trace 1, making it a valid quantum state. Therefore, this statement is **correct**.

---

### **Option C**  
The statement claims that \( Z \) and \( X \) are observables. Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices (\( M^\dagger = M \)).  

- \( Z \) is Hermitian, as \( Z^\dagger = Z \).  
- \( X \) is not Hermitian, as \( X^\dagger \neq X \).  

Since \( X \) is not Hermitian, it cannot represent an observable. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### **Option D**  
The statement claims that \( W \) and \( X \) represent the evolution operator of a quantum system. The evolution operator must be unitary (\( U^\dagger U = I \)).  

- \( W \) is unitary because \( W^\dagger W = I \).  
- \( X \) is not unitary, as \( X^\dagger X \neq I \).  

Since \( X \) is not unitary, it cannot represent the evolution operator. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### **Conclusion**  
The only correct statement is **Option B**, as \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) is a valid quantum state.  

**Answer: B**
