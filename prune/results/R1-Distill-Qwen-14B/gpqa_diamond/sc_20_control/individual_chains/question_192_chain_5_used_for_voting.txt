Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially charged ones, the charges tend to redistribute themselves in certain ways. 

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, which is also uncharged. The cavity has radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the conductor is bigger than the cavity, right? Because r is less than R.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l is greater than R, just like L. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so let me visualize this. The conductor is a sphere. Inside it, off-center, there's a smaller spherical cavity. The charge +q is inside this cavity. So the setup is a bit like a hollow sphere but with a cavity that's not centered. 

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a conducting shell, the charges inside the conductor will rearrange. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. Oh, right, when a charge is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have an induced charge equal in magnitude to the original charge. Wait, no, let me get that right. 

In the case of a conducting shell, if you put a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the shell will have an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have the same charge as the original. Because the conductor as a whole was neutral. Oh wait, no, the conductor as a whole was neutral. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, so that the total is zero again.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a solid sphere, not a shell. Oh wait, but wait, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity inside. So, the conductor itself would have free charges. Wait, but initially, the conductor is uncharged. When we place a charge +q inside the cavity, how does that affect things?

Ah, I think that the charge +q induces a charge on the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the charges inside would redistribute. The cavity is inside the conductor, but the conductor is a solid sphere. So, the conductor is a conductor, meaning that charges can move freely. So the +q inside the cavity would cause the conductor's inner surface to have an induced charge. But wait, in a conductor, charges reside on the surface. But the cavity is inside the conductor, so the charges would go to the inner surface of the conductor, right? Or is it the outer surface?

Wait, no, the conductor's outer surface would have to balance any external fields, but in this case, the only charge is inside the cavity. So the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge. Since the conductor was neutral, the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q. Because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral? Wait, no, wait. If the conductor is initially neutral, and you place +q inside the cavity, then the conductor's total charge must remain zero. So the inner surface must have -q (to cancel the +q inside the cavity, so that the field inside the conductor is zero), and the outer surface must have +q, so that the conductor's total charge is zero (since the inner is -q and the outer is +q, net zero). Or wait, no. Wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So when you put +q in the cavity, the conductor's total charge remains zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, so that the conductor's total is (-q) + (+q) = 0, but that can't be right because the +q is inside the conductor. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. The charge +q is inside the cavity. The cavity is inside the conductor. So the charge +q will induce a charge on the conductor's inner surface. Since the conductor is a conductor, all charges will move to the surfaces. So the inner surface (the surface of the cavity) must have a charge of -q, because it's induced by the +q inside. Then, the conductor as a whole must remain neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q, so that the total is (-q) + (+q) = 0. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral, so the total charge after induction is zero. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is the sphere, and the cavity is inside. So the inner surface of the conductor (which is the outer surface of the cavity) must have -q. Then, the conductor itself, which was neutral, must have the same total charge as before, which is zero. So the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

So, when we place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface (of the conductor) has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So now, when we consider a point P outside the conductor, the electric field at that point is due to the charges on the conductor's outer surface. Because the charge inside the conductor (the inner -q and outer +q) doesn't contribute to the field outside.

Wait, but wait. The field outside a conductor is determined by the total charge on the conductor, as if it were a point charge at the center. So the conductor as a whole has a charge of +q on its outer surface. So the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) would be as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait again. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so the field outside is due to that +q. So, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), since L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but in the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) (q/L²). Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) (q / l²). Hmm. L and l are different. L is the distance from the conductor's center to P, and l is the distance from the cavity's center to P.

Wait, so what's the situation? If the conductor is neutral except for the induced charges, then the outer surface has +q. So point P is outside the conductor, so the field is due to the +q on the conductor's outer surface. Since the conductor is a sphere, the field outside is as if the charge were a point charge at the center. So regardless of where P is, the electric field depends only on L, the distance from P to the center of the conductor.

But wait, wait, in the problem, the point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity. Hmm, but the conductor's center is separated from the cavity's center by s. So the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l from the cavity's center. So when P is outside the conductor, the distance from P to the conductor's center is L, but the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, which is L related to s and theta via the law of cosines, perhaps.

Wait, but regardless, when you're outside a conductor, the field is determined by the total charge of the conductor, regardless of where the external point is located relative to the internal cavity. So the field at P would be as if the +q were at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor's charge is distributed on the outer surface, and the electric field outside a spherical shell is the same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), right? Because L is the distance from P to the center.

So looking at the options, option B is that. So maybe the answer is B.

Wait, but another thought: if the point P is outside the conductor but close to the cavity's direction, maybe the field would be affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity. But no, because the conductor's outer surface charge shields the inside. The field outside only depends on the outer charge.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, so the field at P is as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so any external point would see the field as due to the total charge of the conductor. So yes, option B seems correct.

Hmm, but wait the options have more options. Let me look back.

Option A: 1/(4πε₀) * q/(l - s cosθ)^2.

Option B: 1/(4πε₀) * q/(L^2).

Option C: same as A but with l + s cosθ.

Option D: 1/(4πε₀) * q/(l^2).

So according to my reasoning, the electric field at P is due to the +q on the outer surface of the conductor, which is at the center of the conductor. So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L^2), which is option B.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not missing any effects. For example, does the placement of the charge inside the cavity affect the external field? Well, the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, regardless of where the internal charge is placed. Because the inner surface will adjust to -q regardless of the position of the +q inside the cavity. So when the +q is off-center, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's outer surface) will have a charge distribution that's not uniform, but the outer surface will still have a uniform charge distribution, because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. So the outer surface is a spherical shell, so the field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

So yes, the external field is only due to the outer surface's +q, and it's calculated as if it's a point charge at the conductor's center. So the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (L²), which is option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) and a charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. The conductor as a whole remains neutral. The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$, and is distributed uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

The electric field at a point outside a spherical conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point $P$ depends only on the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$, and not on the position of $P$ relative to the cavity or the angle $\theta$. The magnitude of the electric field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression does not correctly account for the uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface of the conductor.
- **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Similar to Option A, this does not correctly represent the field due to the outer surface charge.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. This expression incorrectly uses $l$ (the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center) instead of $L$ (the distance from $P$ to the conductor's center).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
