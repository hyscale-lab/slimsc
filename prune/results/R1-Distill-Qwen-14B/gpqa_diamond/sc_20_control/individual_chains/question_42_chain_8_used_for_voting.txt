Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. The setup mentions three planets discovered via the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not too sure about that, but maybe it's not super important for the problem.

The problem states that the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are in a ratio of 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. The albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature (T) is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * π * σ * D^2 )) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the inverse square law and Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 ), where a is albedo. Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is T = (L/(16πσD²(1 - a)) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, D is the distance, a is albedo.

But since the problem gives the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets, perhaps I can relate their distances.

Let's think about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. For two planets, say Planet1 and Planet2:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Wait, because T is proportional to (L/(D²(1 - a)) )^(1/4). So T1 = (L/(D1² (1 - a)))^(1/4), T2 similarly.

So T1/T2 = ( (D2² (1 - a2)) / (D1² (1 - a1)) )^(1/4 )

But in this problem, the albedos are all the same (0.3), so (1 - a) is the same for all. So the ratio simplifies to (D2/D1)^(1/2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, let me double-check that. Let's denote T1 as the temperature of Planet1, T2 as Planet2.

T1 = (L/(D1² (1 - a)))^0.25

T2 = (L/(D2² (1 - a)))^0.25

Dividing T1 by T2: T1/T2 = ( (D2²) / (D1²) )^0.25 = (D2/D1)^(0.5) = sqrt(D2/D1)

So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) → sqrt(D2/D1) = T1/T2

Wait, wait, but the problem says the ratio of T1 to T2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 / T2 = 1.4.

So according to the formula, 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1) → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Hmm, so Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1. Because D2 is larger than D1.

Similarly, the ratio between T2 and T3 is 2.3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3.

So using the same formula, T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

Wait, but wait, is the ratio T2/T3 or T3/T2? The question says the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So I think it's T2 over T3 is 2.3. So yes, T2 is larger than T3. That would mean that Planet3 is farther than Planet2, because the temperature is lower.

So putting it all together, Planet3 is much farther than Planet2, which is farther than Planet1.

So D3 = 5.29 * D2, and D2 = 1.96 * D1 → D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1.

Calculating that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let me compute that.

5 * 1.96 = 9.8. 0.29*1.96 ≈ 0.5684. So total is approximately 9.8 + 0.5684 ≈ 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.3684 * D1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period. So we need to relate the period of each planet to their distance.

Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = 4π²/(G M), but since the central body (the star) has mass M, and for a planet, the period P depends on the semi-major axis a (which is the same as D in this case, since the orbits are circular).

But the exact form is P² = (4π²/G M) * a³. However, since all three planets are orbiting the same star, the mass M is the same for each, so the ratio of periods can be found based on the cube root of the ratio of the distances cubed.

Wait, the formula is P² ∝ a³ / M. So for each planet, P² is proportional to a³.

So the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star).

So P1² / P3² = (D1³) / (D3³) → (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 )

We have D3/D1 ≈ 10.3684.

So (D3/D1)^3 = (10.3684)^3 → Let's compute that.

10^3 is 1000. 0.3684^3 is about 0.05 (because 0.3^3=0.027, 0.3684 is a bit larger, maybe around 0.05). But exact calculation:

Let me compute 10.3684^3 step by step.

10.3684 * 10.3684 = ?

10^2 = 100. 0.3684^2 ≈ 0.1356.

Cross terms: 2 * 10 * 0.3684 = 7.368.

So (10 + 0.3684)^2 = 100 + 7.368 + 0.1356 ≈ 107.5036.

Now multiply by 10.3684 again:

107.5036 * 10.3684 ≈ Let's approximate.

107.5 * 10 is 1075.

107.5 * 0.3684 ≈ 107.5 * 0.36 = 38.7, and 107.5 * 0.0084 ≈ ~0.903. So total about 38.7 +0.903 = ~39.6. So total is 1075 +39.6 ≈ 1114.6.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 10^3 is 1000, and 10.3684^3 is a bit more than 10^3. Let me use a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 10.3684 is approximately 10 + 0.3684.

So (10 + 0.3684)^3 = 10^3 + 3*(10^2)*0.3684 + 3*(10)*(0.3684)^2 + (0.3684)^3.

Compute each term:

1. 10^3 = 1000.

2. 3 * (10^2) * 0.3684 = 3 * 100 * 0.3684 = 300 * 0.3684 = 110.52.

3. 3 * 10 * (0.3684)^2 = 30 * (0.1356) = 4.068.

4. (0.3684)^3 ≈ 0.0503.

Adding these up: 1000 + 110.52 = 1110.52; +4.068 = 1114.588; +0.0503 = ~1114.6383.

So cube is approximately 1114.638.

So (D3/D1)^3 is about 1114.638.

So (P3/P1)^2 = 1114.638 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.638).

What's sqrt(1114.638)?

Well, 33^2 is 1089, 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1114) is between 33 and 34.

33^2 = 1089 → 1114 -1089 =25.

So 33 + 25/(2*33) approximately.

33 + 25/(66) = 33 + ~0.379 ≈ 33.379.

Wait, 33.379^2 = (33 + 0.379)^2 = 33² + 2*33*0.379 + 0.379².

33²=1089. 2*33*0.379 = 66 * 0.379 ≈ 24.954. 0.379²≈0.1436.

So total is 1089 + 24.954 = 1113.954 + 0.1436 ≈ 1114.0976. Close to our target of 1114.638, but a bit less.

Wait, 33.4^2 = ?

33.4^2 = (33 + 0.4)^2 = 33² + 2*33*0.4 + 0.4² = 1089 + 26.4 + 0.16 = 1115.56.

But our value is 1114.638, so 33.4^2 is 1115.56 which is a bit higher. So the actual sqrt is between 33.379 and 33.4.

Let me compute 33.38^2: 33.38^2 = (33 + 0.38)^2.

= 33² + 2*33*0.38 + 0.38².

= 1089 + 25.08 + 0.1444 = 1089 +25.08=1114.08 +0.1444=1114.2244.

Still less than 1114.638. What about 33.39^2?

= 33.38^2 + (0.01)*(2*33.38 + 0.01)

Wait, alternatively, 33.39^2 = (33.38 +0.01)^2 = 33.38^2 + 2*33.38*0.01 + 0.01^2.

= 1114.2244 + 0.6676 + 0.0001 = 1114.2244 + 0.6677 ≈ 1114.8921.

Our target is 1114.638, which is between 33.38^2 (1114.2244) and 33.39^2 (1114.8921).

So let's find how much between. The difference to reach 1114.638 from 1114.2244 is 1114.638 - 1114.2244 = 0.4136.

The difference between 33.38 and 33.39 is 0.01, which corresponds to an increase of about 0.6677 in the square.

So 0.4136 / 0.6677 ≈ 0.619.

So approximately, 33.38 + 0.619 * 0.01 → 33.38 + 0.00619 ≈ 33.386.

So sqrt(1114.638) ≈ 33.386.

So P3/P1 = ~33.386.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options don't have anything that high except option D, which is ~33.4. But looking back at the options: Option D is ~33.4, which is what this calculation gives. But wait, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup.

Wait, but the problem gives the temperature ratios as T1/T2 =1.4 and T2/T3=2.3. So I used T1/T2 =1.4, which gave D2 =1.96 D1.

Then T2/T3=2.3 → D3 = (2.3^2) * D2 → 5.29 D2. Since D2 is 1.96 D1, D3 =5.29 *1.96 D1 = approx 10.368 D1.

Wait, but Kepler's third law says P^2 is proportional to D^3. So P = sqrt( (D^3) / ... ), but since the mass is the same for all, the ratio holds.

So P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3^3) / (D1^3) )^(1/2) → Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, actually, the correct approach is:

Kepler's third law in astronomical units and years is P² = a³ / M, where M is the mass of the star in solar masses, and a in AU, P in years. But in general, for the same star, P² ∝ a³ / M, but since M is same for all, P² ∝ a³.

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

Wait, because P² ∝ D^3 → P ∝ D^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) → which is (10.368)^(3/2).

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Oh no, did I mess this up?

Wait, earlier I thought (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ) → which is (D3/D1)^(3/2). So that's correct.

So if D3 =10.368 D1, then (D3/D1) =10.368.

So (10.368) raised to the 3/2 power.

Wait, 10.368^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(10.368^3).

Which is what I computed earlier as approximately 33.38.

So my earlier calculation is correct. So P3/P1 is about 33.38, which would match option D, ~33.4.

But wait, the options also have option C as ~4.4, which is 10.368^(3/2) is about 33.38. So why is that not matching any other option?

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) ~ 10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So yes, option D is the one.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1's mass is 1.15 times Planet2's, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3's.

So M1 = 1.15 * M2.

M2 =1.35 * M3 → M3 = M2 / 1.35.

But in Kepler's law, the period also depends on the mass of the planet? Wait, no, in the formula, it's the mass of the star that matters, not the planet. Because Kepler's law is about the orbit around the star. The planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, so the period depends on the star's mass and the semi-major axis.

Wait, so the mass ratios given in the problem are between the planets. Hmm, but in Kepler's law, the planet's mass is negligible, so the period doesn't depend on the planet's mass. So the mass ratios given in the problem (Planet1:Planet2 is 1.15, Planet2:Planet3 is 1.35) probably don't affect the periods. So I can ignore them for the purpose of calculating the period ratios.

So I think my initial approach is correct. The period is determined by the distance, so the answer is option D, ~33.4.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant astronomical principles.

### Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperatures to Distances
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T \propto \left(\frac{1}{D^2 (1 - a)}\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(D\) is the distance from the star and \(a\) is the albedo. Since the albedo (\(a = 0.3\)) is the same for all planets, the temperature ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}
\]

From the problem:
- \(T_1 / T_2 = 1.4\), so:
  \[
  \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1
  \]

- \(T_2 / T_3 = 2.3\), so:
  \[
  \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2
  \]

Substituting \(D_2 = 1.96 D_1\) into \(D_3 = 5.29 D_2\):
\[
D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 \approx 10.368 D_1
\]

Thus, Planet3 is approximately \(10.368\) times farther from the star than Planet1.

### Step 2: Relating Orbital Periods to Distances
Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star):

\[
P^2 \propto D^3
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \(D_3 / D_1 = 10.368\):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.368)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \(10.368^{1/2}\):
\[
\sqrt{10.368} \approx 3.22
\]

Then, calculate \(10.368^{3/2} = 10.368 \times \sqrt{10.368}\):
\[
10.368 \times 3.22 \approx 33.38
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \(33.38\) times larger than that of Planet1.

### Step 3: Final Answer
From the options provided:
- **A)** ~10.4
- **B)** ~3.2
- **C)** ~4.4
- **D)** ~33.4

The closest match is **D) ~33.4**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods.

But I'm not too sure about that, but maybe it's not super important for the problem.

The problem states that the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are in a ratio of 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. The albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature (T) is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * π * σ * D^2 )) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the inverse square law and Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 ), where a is albedo. Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is T = (L/(16πσD²(1 - a)) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, D is the distance, a is albedo.

But since the problem gives the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets, perhaps I can relate their distances.

Let's think about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. For two planets, say Planet1 and Planet2:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Wait, because T is proportional to (L/(D²(1 - a)) )^(1/4). So T1 = (L/(D1² (1 - a)))^(1/4), T2 similarly.

So T1/T2 = ( (D2² (1 - a2)) / (D1² (1 - a1)) )^(1/4 )

But in this problem, the albedos are all the same (0.3), so (1 - a) is the same for all. So the ratio simplifies to (D2/D1)^(1/2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, let me double-check that. Let's denote T1 as the temperature of Planet1, T2 as Planet2.

T1 = (L/(D1² (1 - a)))^0.25

T2 = (L/(D2² (1 - a)))^0.25

Dividing T1 by T2: T1/T2 = ( (D2²) / (D1²) )^0.25 = (D2/D1)^(0.5) = sqrt(D2/D1)

So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) → sqrt(D2/D1) = T1/T2

Wait, wait, but the problem says the ratio of T1 to T2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 / T2 = 1.4.

So according to the formula, 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1) → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Hmm, so Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1. Because D2 is larger than D1.

Similarly, the ratio between T2 and T3 is 2.3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3.

So using the same formula, T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

Wait, but wait, is the ratio T2/T3 or T3/T2? The question says the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So I think it's T2 over T3 is 2.3. So yes, T2 is larger than T3. That would mean that Planet3 is farther than Planet2, because the temperature is lower.

So putting it all together, Planet3 is much farther than Planet2, which is farther than Planet1.

So D3 = 5.29 * D2, and D2 = 1.96 * D1 → D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1.

Calculating that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let me compute that.

5 * 1.96 = 9.8. 0.29*1.96 ≈ 0.5684. So total is approximately 9.8 + 0.5684 ≈ 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.3684 * D1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period. So we need to relate the period of each planet to their distance.

Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = 4π²/(G M), but since the central body (the star) has mass M, and for a planet, the period P depends on the semi-major axis a (which is the same as D in this case, since the orbits are circular).

But the exact form is P² = (4π²/G M) * a³. However, since all three planets are orbiting the same star, the mass M is the same for each, so the ratio of periods can be found based on the cube root of the ratio of the distances cubed.

Wait, the formula is P² ∝ a³ / M. So for each planet, P² is proportional to a³.

So the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star).

So P1² / P3² = (D1³) / (D3³) → (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 )

We have D3/D1 ≈ 10.3684.

So (D3/D1)^3 = (10.3684)^3 → Let's compute that.

10^3 is 1000. 0.3684^3 is about 0.05 (because 0.3^3=0.027, 0.3684 is a bit larger, maybe around 0.05). But exact calculation:

Let me compute 10.3684^3 step by step.

10.3684 * 10.3684 = ?

10^2 = 100. 0.3684^2 ≈ 0.1356.

Cross terms: 2 * 10 * 0.3684 = 7.368.

So (10 + 0.3684)^2 = 100 + 7.368 + 0.1356 ≈ 107.5036.

Now multiply by 10.3684 again:

107.5036 * 10.3684 ≈ Let's approximate.

107.5 * 10 is 1075.

107.5 * 0.3684 ≈ 107.5 * 0.36 = 38.7, and 107.5 * 0.0084 ≈ ~0.903. So total about 38.7 +0.903 = ~39.6. So total is 1075 +39.6 ≈ 1114.6.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 10^3 is 1000, and 10.3684^3 is a bit more than 10^3. Let me use a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 10.3684 is approximately 10 + 0.3684.

So (10 + 0.3684)^3 = 10^3 + 3*(10^2)*0.3684 + 3*(10)*(0.3684)^2 + (0.3684)^3.

Compute each term:

1. 10^3 = 1000.

2. 3 * (10^2) * 0.3684 = 3 * 100 * 0.3684 = 300 * 0.3684 = 110.52.

3. 3 * 10 * (0.3684)^2 = 30 * (0.1356) = 4.068.

4. (0.3684)^3 ≈ 0.0503.

Adding these up: 1000 + 110.52 = 1110.52; +4.068 = 1114.588; +0.0503 = ~1114.6383.

So cube is approximately 1114.638.

So (D3/D1)^3 is about 1114.638.

So (P3/P1)^2 = 1114.638 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.638).

What's sqrt(1114.638)?

Well, 33^2 is 1089, 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1114) is between 33 and 34.

33^2 = 1089 → 1114 -1089 =25.

So 33 + 25/(2*33) approximately.

33 + 25/(66) = 33 + ~0.379 ≈ 33.379.

Wait, 33.379^2 = (33 + 0.379)^2 = 33² + 2*33*0.379 + 0.379².

33²=1089. 2*33*0.379 = 66 * 0.379 ≈ 24.954. 0.379²≈0.1436.

So total is 1089 + 24.954 = 1113.954 + 0.1436 ≈ 1114.0976. Close to our target of 1114.638, but a bit less.

Wait, 33.4^2 = ?

33.4^2 = (33 + 0.4)^2 = 33² + 2*33*0.4 + 0.4² = 1089 + 26.4 + 0.16 = 1115.56.

But our value is 1114.638, so 33.4^2 is 1115.56 which is a bit higher. So the actual sqrt is between 33.379 and 33.4.

Let me compute 33.38^2: 33.38^2 = (33 + 0.38)^2.

= 33² + 2*33*0.38 + 0.38².

= 1089 + 25.08 + 0.1444 = 1089 +25.08=1114.08 +0.1444=1114.2244.

Still less than 1114.638. What about 33.39^2?

= 33.38^2 + (0.01)*(2*33.38 + 0.01)

Wait, alternatively, 33.39^2 = (33.38 +0.01)^2 = 33.38^2 + 2*33.38*0.01 + 0.01^2.

= 1114.2244 + 0.6676 + 0.0001 = 1114.2244 + 0.6677 ≈ 1114.8921.

Our target is 1114.638, which is between 33.38^2 (1114.2244) and 33.39^2 (1114.8921).

So let's find how much between. The difference to reach 1114.638 from 1114.2244 is 1114.638 - 1114.2244 = 0.4136.

The difference between 33.38 and 33.39 is 0.01, which corresponds to an increase of about 0.6677 in the square.

So 0.4136 / 0.6677 ≈ 0.619.

So approximately, 33.38 + 0.619 * 0.01 → 33.38 + 0.00619 ≈ 33.386.

So sqrt(1114.638) ≈ 33.386.

So P3/P1 = ~33.386.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options don't have anything that high except option D, which is ~33.4. But looking back at the options: Option D is ~33.4, which is what this calculation gives. But wait, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup.

Wait, but the problem gives the temperature ratios as T1/T2 =1.4 and T2/T3=2.3. So I used T1/T2 =1.4, which gave D2 =1.96 D1.

Then T2/T3=2.3 → D3 = (2.3^2) * D2 → 5.29 D2. Since D2 is 1.96 D1, D3 =5.29 *1.96 D1 = approx 10.368 D1.

Wait, but Kepler's third law says P^2 is proportional to D^3. So P = sqrt( (D^3) / ... ), but since the mass is the same for all, the ratio holds.

So P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3^3) / (D1^3) )^(1/2) → Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, actually, the correct approach is:

Kepler's third law in astronomical units and years is P² = a³ / M, where M is the mass of the star in solar masses, and a in AU, P in years. But in general, for the same star, P² ∝ a³ / M, but since M is same for all, P² ∝ a³.

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

Wait, because P² ∝ D^3 → P ∝ D^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) → which is (10.368)^(3/2).

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Oh no, did I mess this up?

Wait, earlier I thought (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ) → which is (D3/D1)^(3/2). So that's correct.

So if D3 =10.368 D1, then (D3/D1) =10.368.

So (10.368) raised to the 3/2 power.

Wait, 10.368^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(10.368^3).

Which is what I computed earlier as approximately 33.38.

So my earlier calculation is correct. So P3/P1 is about 33.38, which would match option D, ~33.4.

But wait, the options also have option C as ~4.4, which is 10.368^(3/2) is about 33.38. So why is that not matching any other option?

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) ~ 10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So yes, option D is the one.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1's mass is 1.15 times Planet2's, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3's.

So M1 = 1.15 * M2.

M2 =1.35 * M3 → M3 = M2 / 1.35.

But in Kepler's law, the period also depends on the mass of the planet? Wait, no, in the formula, it's the mass of the star that matters, not the planet. Because Kepler's law is about the orbit around the star. The planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, so the period depends on the star's mass and the semi-major axis.

Wait, so the mass ratios given in the problem are between the planets. Hmm, but in Kepler's law, the planet's mass is negligible, so the period doesn't depend on the planet's mass. So the mass ratios given in the problem (Planet1:Planet2 is 1.15, Planet2:Planet3 is 1.35) probably don't affect the periods. So I can ignore them for the purpose of calculating the period ratios.

So I think my initial approach is correct. The period is determined by the distance, so the answer is option D, ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant astronomical principles.

### Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperatures to Distances
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T \propto \left(\frac{1}{D^2 (1 - a)}\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(D\) is the distance from the star and \(a\) is the albedo. Since the albedo (\(a = 0.3\)) is the same for all planets, the temperature ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}
\]

From the problem:
- \(T_1 / T_2 = 1.4\), so:
  \[
  \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1
  \]

- \(T_2 / T_3 = 2.3\), so:
  \[
  \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2
  \]

Substituting \(D_2 = 1.96 D_1\) into \(D_3 = 5.29 D_2\):
\[
D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 \approx 10.368 D_1
\]

Thus, Planet3 is approximately \(10.368\) times farther from the star than Planet1.

### Step 2: Relating Orbital Periods to Distances
Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star):

\[
P^2 \propto D^3
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \(D_3 / D_1 = 10.368\):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.368)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \(10.368^{1/2}\):
\[
\sqrt{10.368} \approx 3.22
\]

Then, calculate \(10.368^{3/2} = 10.368 \times \sqrt{10.368}\):
\[
10.368 \times 3.22 \approx 33.38
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \(33.38\) times larger than that of Planet1.
