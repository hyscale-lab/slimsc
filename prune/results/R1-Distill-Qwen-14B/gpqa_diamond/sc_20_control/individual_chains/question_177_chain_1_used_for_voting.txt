Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, interesting. Wait, but the question is about their luminosities. Oh right, luminosity relates to how much light they emit.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, right, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, that's the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted.

But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, but their actual emitted wavelengths might be different because of their velocities.

Wait, no. The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both. But the actual emitted λ_max could be different because of the Doppler shift. So we have to account for that.

So, the observed λ_max is the same. But the actual emission λ_max (which relates to their temperatures) might be different because of their velocities.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Wien's Law says that λ_max is proportional to the temperature. So without any redshift or blueshift, the λ_max would be based on T. But if the star is moving towards us, the observed λ_max would be shorter (blueshifted) than the emitted λ_max. Conversely, if moving away, longer (redshifted).

But in our case, both stars have the same observed λ_max. So, their emitted λ_max, considering their velocities, must adjust to make the observed λ_max same.

So, Star_1 has radial velocity 0. So its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max. Because there's no Doppler shift. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but which direction? Because the question says radial velocity of 0 and 700. Wait, Star_1 is 0, Star_2's is 700. But the problem doesn't specify if it's moving towards or away. Hmm, but the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So, Star_1 is stationary relative to us, and Star_2 is moving away (or towards) us at 700 km/s?

Wait, but the formula for Doppler shift for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But wait, v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving towards us, v_r is positive (or negative, depending on convention). Let me make sure about the formula.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure about the signs. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r/c). So if the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so the observed λ is longer than emitted.

Wait, but in our case, Star_1's observed λ_max is same as Star_2's. So, their emitted λ_max must be different. Because of their velocities.

So, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1_emit = λ1_obs.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so v_r is positive. So λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c). Wait, because if moving away, the wavelength is stretched, so observed is longer than emitted. So, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c). Since the observed λ_max is same for both, λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c). Wait, but wait, no. Because for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_emit, and for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + (v_r)/c) (assuming v_r is positive when moving away). But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, then λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c).

So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / c ), where c is speed of light.

But I'm not sure if the speed is so high that a relativistic correction is needed. 700 km/s is 0.00233c (since c ≈ 3e5 km/s). So, the non-relativistic approximation should work here.

So, λ1_emit ≈ λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5e3 )

Wait, let's compute that.

700,000 m/s divided by 3e8 m/s.

700e3 / 3e5e3 = 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333...

So, 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So, λ1_emit ≈ λ2_emit * 1.002333.

But from Wien's Law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So, T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So,

T1_emit = T2_emit * (λ2_emit / λ1_emit )

Because λ1_emit = λ2_emit * 1.002333,

λ2_emit / λ1_emit = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So,

T1_emit ≈ T2_emit * 0.99767.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then the observed λ is longer than emitted for Star_2. So, the emitted λ is shorter (since observed is longer). So, Star_2's emitted λ is smaller, which implies higher temperature. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

So, Star_2's emitted temperature is higher than Star_1's, because its emitted λ is shorter.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to structure it.

Given that both observed λ_max are same: λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But Star_1 is at rest, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c) ≈ λ2_emit * 1.002333.

So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * 1.002333.

Which implies that λ2_emit = λ1_emit / 1.002333 ≈ λ1_emit * 0.99767.

Since λ is inversely proportional to T, T is proportional to 1/λ.

So, T2_emit = T1_emit * (λ1_emit / λ2_emit ) ) = T1_emit * (λ1_emit / (λ1_emit * 0.99767)) ) = T1_emit / 0.99767 ≈ T1_emit * 1.00231.

So, T2_emit is approximately 0.23% higher than T1_emit.

So, Star_2's temperature is a bit higher than Star_1's.

Now, the next part is computing the luminosities. Luminosity for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4.

Since both stars are black bodies, we can use this formula.

Given that Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, R1 = 1.5 R2. So, R2 = R1 / 1.5.

So, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So, ratio L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Simplify: (1.5)^2 * (R2^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Which is 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

But wait, T2 is higher than T1 by about 0.23%.

Wait, earlier we found that T2_emit ≈ 1.00231 * T1_emit.

So, T1 = T1, T2 = 1.00231 T1.

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.00231 ≈ 0.99769.

So, (T1 / T2 )^4 ≈ (0.99769)^4.

Compute that:

0.99769 ≈ 1 - 0.00231.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4, where x is small.

x=0.00231.

So,

(0.99769)^4 ≈ 1 -4*(0.00231) + 6*(0.00231)^2 - 4*(0.00231)^3 + (0.00231)^4.

Compute each term:

4x= ~0.00924,

6x² = 6*(0.000005336) = ~0.000032,

4x³=4*(0.0000000123) ~ 4.9e-8,

x^4 ~ (0.00231)^4 ≈ 2.8e-8.

So, ignoring the higher-order terms beyond x²:

≈ 1 - 0.00924 + 0.000032 = 0.9908.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is close.

But wait, the approximation for (T1/T2)^4 as 0.9908 is an approximation, perhaps the actual value is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps we shouldn't approximate and compute it more accurately.

Because with T2 = T1 * 1.00231, the ratio is (1 / 1.00231)^4.

Let me compute 1.00231^4.

Wait, 1.00231^4: compute (1.00231)^2 first.

1.00231^2 = 1 + 2*0.00231 + (0.00231)^2 ≈ 1.00462 + 0.0000053 ≈ 1.004625.

Then, square that: (1.004625)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.004625) + (0.004625)^2 ≈ 1.00925 + 0.0000214 ≈ 1.00927.

So, 1.00231^4 is approximately 1.00927.

Thus, (1/1.00231)^4 = 1/(1.00927) ≈ 0.9908.

Wait, same as before.

So, 2.25 * 0.9908 = 2.227.

Hmm, so the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.227, which is about 2.23. So the answer would be option D) ~2.23.

But wait, the question also gives that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. Since 2.227 is approximately 2.23, option D is correct.

But wait, let me double-check. There's another way to think about it. Is the Doppler shift correctly accounted for?

Wait, another approach: Since the observed λ_max is same for both, and the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength.

For Star_1, λ1 = λ1_emit.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c ), as it's moving away.

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c )

Which implies λ2_emit = λ1_emit / (1 + v/c )

As before.

Since λ_max is inversely proportional to T, T2_emit = T1_emit * (1 + v/c )

Wait, no. Because λ_max = b / T. So, T = b / λ_max.

So, T2_emit = b / λ2_emit.

T1_emit = b / λ1_emit.

So, T2_emit = T1_emit * (λ1_emit / λ2_emit )

But from above, λ1_emit = λ2_emit (1 + v/c )

So, λ1_emit / λ2_emit = 1 + v/c.

So,

T2_emit = T1_emit * (1 + v/c )

Ah, so I made a mistake earlier. Because:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c )

=> λ2_emit = λ1_emit / (1 + v/c )

=> T2_emit = (b / λ2_emit ) = (b * (1 + v/c )) / λ1_emit = T1_emit * (1 + v/c )

So, T2_emit = T1_emit * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5e3 )

Which is (1 + 0.002333) = 1.002333.

So,

T2_emit = 1.002333 * T1_emit.

So, T2 is higher than T1 by (0.2333% ), not lower.

So, when we compute the luminosity ratio, L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (2.25 R2^2 ) * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

But T2 = 1.002333 T1,

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997673.

So, (0.997673)^4 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

0.997673 is approximately 0.997673.

Compute (0.997673)^4.

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute (0.997673)^2: 0.997673 * 0.997673.

0.997673 * 0.997673:

(1 - 0.002327)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.002327) + (0.002327)^2 ≈ 0.9953425 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953479.

Wait, actually, 0.997673^2:

= (1 - 0.002327)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002327 + (0.002327)^2.

= 1 - 0.004654 + 0.000005414.

= 0.995346 + 0.000005414 ≈ 0.9953514.

Now, square that result to get (0.997673)^4.

(0.9953514)^2:

= (1 - 0.0046486)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0046486 + (0.0046486)^2.

= 1 - 0.0092972 + 0.0000216.

= 0.9907028 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907244.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = ~0.9907244.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907244 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Compute 2.25 * 0.9907.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

Wait, 0.9907 is 0.99 + 0.0007.

So,

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So, total is 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So, approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

So, the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical laws.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)): Same for both stars.
   - Radial velocities: \( v_{r,1} = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_{r,2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Wien's Law**:
   The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is inversely proportional to its temperature:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]
   Since the observed \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \) is the same for both stars, their emitted wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max, emit}} \)) differ due to the Doppler effect.

3. **Doppler Shift**:
   For Star_2, moving away at \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the observed wavelength is stretched:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \left( 1 + \frac{v_r}{c} \right)
   \]
   Using the non-relativistic approximation (\( v_r \ll c \)):
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \left( 1 + \frac{700}{300,000} \right) = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot 1.002333
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), it follows that:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot 1.002333
   \]
   From Wien's law, the temperature ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit,1}}} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997673
   \]

4. **Luminosity**:
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   The ratio of luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1)^2 T_1^4}{(R_2)^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 = 0.997673 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{1.5 R_2}{R_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.997673)^4
   \]
   Compute \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \) and \( (0.997673)^4 \approx 0.9907 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229
   \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.

Answer: D
