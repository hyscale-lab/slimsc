Okay, so I have to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelength of maximum brightness is the same for both stars. I remember from blackbody radiation that this relates to the star's temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law says that the wavelength of maximum emission is inversely proportional to the temperature (λ_max * T = constant). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think. Wait, no, if λ_max is the same, then their temperatures would be the same. Because according to Wien's displacement law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if λ_max is same, T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but the problem says that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a factor. So even though their temperatures are the same, their luminosities are different because of other factors. Because luminosity depends on radius and temperature.

The formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities will be (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But T1 and T2 are same, so T ratio is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is 2.25.

Wait, but wait. The problem also mentions something about radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm. What does that mean? Oh, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. So Star_2 is moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. But I'm not sure how this affects the luminosity calculation.

Wait a second, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body assumption. But when stars are moving, there's a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength would be different than the emitted wavelength. Oh, right! So the wavelengths they measured being the same might be affected by Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed wavelengths for each star are the same. But according to blackbody radiation, the wavelength of maximum emission is determined by the star's temperature. If Star_2 is moving, its emitted wavelengths would be Doppler shifted.

So, let me think. Let's denote the emitted wavelength as λ_emitted, and the observed wavelength as λ_observed. For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, λ_observed1 = λ_emitted1. For Star_2, which has a radial velocity v (700 km/s), the observed wavelength would be λ_observed2 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) approximately. Wait, no, wait. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards us (v positive if moving away, or negative if towards). Wait, the formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me get it straight.

If the source is moving away, then the observed wavelength is longer (redshift). So if v_r is positive (moving away), then λ_obs > λ_emitted. If moving towards us (v_r negative), λ_obs < λ_emitted.

Wait, but in the problem, the observed wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So regardless of the emitted wavelengths (which depend on their temperatures), the observed maximum emission wavelengths are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is same. But the emitted λ_max for each would be different if their temperatures are same, but if they have different velocities, their observed λ_max would change.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Suppose Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature. Then their emitted λ_max would be the same. But if Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max would be shifted. So if the observed λ_max for both are same, that would mean that any Doppler shift must adjust the emitted λ_max to make the observed same.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the stars have same T, because their λ_max (emitted) would be same. But perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I got this wrong. The problem says that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, observed λ_max for both stars is same. So, λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.

But for Star_1, since it's not moving, λ_obs_1 = λ_emit_1. For Star_2, λ_obs_2 = λ_emit_2 * Doppler factor. So λ_emit_2 is the emitted wavelength for Star_2.

But according to Wien's law, λ_emit is b / T. So, λ_emit_1 = b / T1 and λ_emit_2 = b / T2. Therefore, λ_obs_1 = b / T1, and λ_obs_2 = (b / T2) * Doppler_shift_factor.

But in the problem, λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2. So:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * Doppler_shift_factor.

So, (1/T1) = (1/T2) * Doppler_shift_factor.

But Doppler_shift_factor depends on the velocity of Star_2. So, the temperatures can't be the same unless the Doppler_shift_factor is 1. But in this case, Star_2 has a non-zero velocity. So, this would mean that T1 and T2 are different. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption that T1 = T2 is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should not assume that. Let me re-express this.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: no velocity, so λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: moving with velocity v (700 km/s), so λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ), assuming non-relativistic speeds, the approximation: λ_obs2 ≈ λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c) ) .

Wait, but depending on the direction of the velocity, v_r could be positive (moving away) or negative (moving toward). The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700, but it doesn't specify direction. Hmm. Let me assume that Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, which would mean moving away from us.

So, for Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c) / sqrt(1 - (v_r/c)^2) )? Wait, no. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) )

But at non-relativistic speeds, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c).

Since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), the approximation should be okay.

So, for Star_2, moving away at +700 km/s, so v_r is positive.

So λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c) )

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

b / T1 = [ (b / T2) * (1 + v_r / c) ) ]

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r / c )

So, 1/T1 = (1 + v_r/c ) / T2

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

So, T1 is less than T2 because denominator is greater than 1.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, v_r is 700 km/s. Let's compute v_r / c.

c is 3e5 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.02333.

So, 1 + v_r/c ≈ 1.02333.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.02333 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

Wait, so T1 is about 97.7% of T2. So T2 is hotter than T1.

But wait, let's think about this. If Star_2 is moving away, its emitted light is redshifted. So the observed λ_max would be longer than its emitted λ_max. But the problem says that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same (since they're the same). So, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer than its emitted λ_max. So to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1 (which isn't moving), Star_1 must have a shorter emitted λ_max than Star_2's observed λ_max. Which would imply that T1 is higher than T2, because λ_max = b / T. Wait, but according to the equation earlier, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c), which makes T1 lower than T2.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Doppler shift. Let me recheck.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c). So, if a star emits at a certain wavelength and is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer.

In our case, Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c )

We set λ_obs1 = λ_obs2:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c )

But λ_emit is proportional to 1/T. So,

1/T1 = (1 + v_r/c) * (1/T2 )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

So, T1 is lower than T2 by a factor of (1 + v_r/c )^{-1}.

Wait, so T1 is 1/1.02333 times T2, about 0.977 T2.

But then, how does that affect their luminosities?

Luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴.

So for each star:

L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4

L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / (R2² T2^4 )

But R1 = 1.5 R2.

And T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c ) ≈ T2 / 1.02333.

So let's compute T1^4 / T2^4 = (1 / 1.02333 )^4.

Calculate 1.02333: about 1.02333.

So 1.02333^4. Let me compute that.

1.02333^2 = approx (1.02333)^2 = 1.0474

Then square that: (1.0474)^2 ≈ 1.0965.

So 1.02333^4 ≈ 1.0965.

Thus, (1/1.02333)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.0965 ≈ 0.912.

So L1/L2 = (1.5^2 ) * 0.912 = (2.25) * 0.912 ≈ 2.052.

Wait, but that's not matching the options given. The options are around 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

Wait, perhaps my approximation is too rough. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute (1.02333)^4 accurately.

Compute 1.02333 step by step:

1.02333^1 = 1.02333

^2: 1.02333 * 1.02333.

Let me compute 1.02333 * 1.02333.

Compute 1.02333 * 1.02333:

= (1 + 0.02333) * (1 + 0.02333) 

= 1 + 2*0.02333 + (0.02333)^2

= 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544

≈ 1.0472

So 1.02333^2 ≈ 1.0472

Now, 1.0472^2 = ?

Compute 1.0472 * 1.0472:

= (1 + 0.0472)^2 

= 1 + 2*0.0472 + 0.0472^2

= 1 + 0.0944 + 0.002228

= 1.096628

So 1.02333^4 ≈ 1.096628.

So 1/(1.02333)^4 ≈ 1/1.096628 ≈ 0.9119.

So back to L1/L2:

(1.5)^2 = 2.25

Multiply by 0.9119: 2.25 * 0.9119 ≈ 2.052.

Hmm, but the options don't have 2.05. The closest is option A) ~2.25, or D) ~2.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the observed wavelengths being the same would require that the Doppler shift affects the temperature. But maybe the problem doesn't consider Doppler shift, because it says that "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, assuming that the wavelengths given are the emitted wavelengths, not the observed.

Wait, the question says: "through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the wavelengths they measured (observed) are same.

So, considering that, the temperatures would be different due to Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the Doppler shift is not affecting the calculation, just the luminosity, and the same emitted wavelength is given.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the problem says that the stars are radiating as black bodies, and computed the luminosity. So perhaps the measured wavelengths being the same are the emitted wavelengths, not the observed ones. That is, the stars' own λ_max (emitted) are same. So then, T1 = T2.

In that case, the luminosity would only depend on the radius squared, since L = 4π R^2 σ T^4, and T is same. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer would be option A.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are same. So it's unclear whether the λ_max given is the emitted or the observed.

Wait, the problem says: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed λ_max is same for both.

Which implies that either their emitted λ_max are same (so T same), but Doppler shift makes them same observed wavelength, or the emitted λ_max are different, but Doppler shifted to same observed.

I think the correct approach is to account for Doppler shift because the problem mentions radial velocities. So the observed λ_max is same, which implies that the emitted λ_max are different because of their velocities.

Thus, the temperatures are different. So, T1 and T2 are different.

So, going back, we have the following:

Observed λ_max1 = λ_max2.

For Star_1, not moving: λ1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s: λ2_observed = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c).

But λ1_observed = λ2_observed.

So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c).

But λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So, (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r/c )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1 + v_r/c) / T2

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

So, T1 = T2 / 1.02333 ≈ 0.977 T2.

So, T1 is about 0.977 times T2.

Now, compute L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 ( (0.977 T2 )^4 ) ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (0.977^4 )

Compute 0.977^4:

0.977^2 ≈ 0.9545.

0.9545^2 ≈ 0.9109.

So 0.977^4 ≈ 0.9109.

Then, 2.25 * 0.9109 ≈ 2.050.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, none of these are 2.05. So perhaps this approach is incorrect, or perhaps the problem doesn't consider Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest wavelength, without considering velocity—i.e., the λ_max given is the emitted, not observed.

Wait, but the problem says the observed wavelengths are same. So that approach must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the blackbody calculation takes into account the Doppler shift. So the observed flux is F = F0 * (1 + v_r / c ), where F0 is the emitted flux. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the luminosity calculation doesn't take into account the Doppler shift because the observed flux is used. Wait, no, because the problem says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." and the question is about their intrinsic luminosities, not the observed flux.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look back at the problem.

The problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are determined to be same. So, the observed λ_max is same. So, their emitted λ_max would be different because of their velocities.

But for a blackbody, the peak wavelength is given by λ_max = b / T.

But when the star is moving, the observed λ_max is Doppler shifted.

So, let me denote:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c )

We have λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, so:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c )

But λ_emit1 = b / T1, λ_emit2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1 + v_r/c ) / T2

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

So T1 is lower than T2.

Now, compute L1 and L2.

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

= 2.25 * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

But T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c ) → T1/T2 = 1/(1+ v_r/c )

So,

L1/L2 =2.25 * (1/(1 + v_r/c ))^4.

Now, compute (1 + v_r/c )^4.

v_r is 700 km/s.

c is 3e5 km/s.

v_r/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.0023333.

So, 1 + v_r/c = 1.0023333.

Compute (1.0023333)^4.

Approximate using binomial expansion for small x:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x² + (n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)/24) x^3 )

x=0.0023333, n=4.

Compute:

1 + 4 * 0.0023333 = 1 + 0.0093333 = 1.0093333.

Next term: (4*3/2) x² = 6 * (0.0023333)^2.

(0.0023333)^2 ≈ 5.444e-6.

6 *5.444e-6 ≈ 3.266e-5.

So, 1.0093333 + 0.00003266 ≈ 1.00936596.

Next term: (4*3*2*1 /24 ) x^3 → (24/24) x^3 → x^3.

x^3 = (0.0023333)^3 ≈ 1.286e-8.

So adding that: 1.00936596 + 1.286e-8 ≈ 1.00936625.

So, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.009366.

So, (1/(1.0023333))^4 ≈ 1 / 1.009366 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2278.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Ah, so the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and the relationships between luminosity, radius, temperature, and Doppler shift.

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, i.e., \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Mass**: Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2, but mass is not directly relevant to luminosity in this context.
3. **Observed Wavelengths**: The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (observed \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\)) are the same for both stars. This implies that the emitted wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{emit}}\)) are affected by Doppler shift due to Star_2's radial velocity.
4. **Radial Velocity**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula, the observed wavelength for Star_2 is related to its emitted wavelength by:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
   \]
   For non-relativistic speeds, this can be approximated as:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
   \]
5. **Luminosity**: The luminosity of a star radiating as a blackbody is given by:
   \[
   L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   where \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio of luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]

### Analysis:
1. **Temperature Relationship**:
   - The observed \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) for both stars is the same. Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\)), the emitted wavelengths are inversely proportional to temperature:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1}, \quad \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \frac{b}{T_2}
     \]
   - Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the observed wavelengths:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
     \]
     Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}\), we get:
     \[
     \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
     \]
     Rearranging:
     \[
     T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
     \]

2. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}\) into the luminosity formula:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 \left(\frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}\right)^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}\right)^4
     \]
     Compute \((1.5)^2 = 2.25\). For \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), calculate:
     \[
     \frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
     \]
     \[
     1 + \frac{v_r}{c} \approx 1.002333
     \]
     Raise this to the fourth power:
     \[
     \left(1.002333\right)^4 \approx 1.009366
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}\right)^4 \approx \frac{1}{1.009366} \approx 0.9907
     \]
     Finally:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.2278
     \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. The closest option is:

**Answer: D**
