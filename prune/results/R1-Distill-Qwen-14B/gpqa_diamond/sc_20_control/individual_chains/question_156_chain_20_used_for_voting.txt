Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and analyzed using HPLC columns. The options are about the number of peaks observed in standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC.

Hmm. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So reacting an alkene with mCPBA would form an epoxide.

Wait, but wait—epoxidation with mCPBA typically proceeds via an electrocyclic opening. Oh wait, no, that's when the epoxide ring is opened. Oh right, when you have an alkene reacting with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. So each of these alkenes would form their respective epoxides.

But wait, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers. So when each is reacted with mCPBA, what happens?

Let me think. The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA to form an epoxide is a pericyclic reaction. Specifically, it's an electrocyclic opening of the peracid's O-O bond. The alkene attacks the peracid, leading to the formation of an epoxide.

But wait, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene would influence the configuration of the epoxide. So for each isomer of oct-4-ene, the epoxide product would have a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. Similarly, (Z) has the same substituents on the same side.

So when each reacts with mCPBA, which is a peracid, the epoxidation occurs. The reaction typically results in the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So (E) would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are across from each other (trans), and (Z) would form a cis epoxide.

Wait, no, not exactly. Let me think again. The mechanism for epoxidation with mCPBA involves a cyclic transition state where the peracid attacks the alkene, leading to the formation of the epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide will have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides (trans), and if the alkene is Z, the oxygens will be on the same side (cis).

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The starting alkenes are oct-4-ene, which is a four-carbon double bond in the middle of an eight-carbon chain. The substituents on either end of the double bond are the same—so for E and Z, it's about the arrangement of the substituents on each carbon of the double bond.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in middle. So the structure is CH2CH2 with substituents on each end. For (E) configuration, the higher priority groups on each carbon are opposite. But wait, for oct-4-ene, each of the two carbons in the double bond (C4 and C5) would have substituents.

Wait, let's clarify. The structure of (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with groups on either side. So the structure is CH2CH2 with the substituents on C4 and C5. The (E) isomer would have the two CH2CH2 groups opposite each other, and the (Z) would have them on the same side.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Let's say oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in positions 4 and 5, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, that's not right. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5, so the structure is CH2CH2 at position 4 and 5. So for (E), the substituents (groups) on each end of the double bond are opposite, and for (Z) same side.

But when mCPBA reacts with it, the epoxide forms. The method of reaction would transfer the double bond's geometry into the epoxide's structure. So the configuration of the double bond (E or Z) would determine whether the epoxide is trans or cis.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. When you epoxidize an alkene, the two new oxygen atoms are added with the same stereochemistry as the double bond. So if the alkene is E, the oxygen atoms in the epoxide are on opposite sides (trans), leading to a trans epoxide. Similarly, a Z-alkene would give a cis epoxide.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the example of cyclohexene. If you have (E)-cyclohexene, which is actually not possible because cyclohexene is a ring and can't be E or Z. Maybe a better example is something like 2-pentene. Let's say (E)-2-pentene. When epoxidized, the oxygen atoms would add in a way that reflects the E geometry. So the substituents on either side of the epoxide would be on opposite sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide's configuration depends on the alkene's geometry. So, for each starting material, we get a specific epoxide.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide with trans configuration.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide with cis configuration.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Another point: when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the oxygen adds from the same face. So the reaction is stereospecific, leading to the epoxide's stereochemistry reflecting the starting alkene's.

So, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene would each form their own epoxides, with the stereochemistry determined by their starting configuration.

But wait, after forming the epoxide, the reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh, right, that's an acid workup. So what happens when you treat an epoxide with acid?

Epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a water molecule (or another nucleophile) attacks the more substituted carbon (in a process called acid-catalyzed ring opening).

Wait, in this case, the workup is aqueous acid, so the nucleophile is water. So each epoxide would undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening.

Let's think about the structure of the epoxide. Oct-4-ene is CH2-CH2 in the middle. So after epoxidation, the molecule becomes an epoxide between C4 and C5. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 (but that's not precise). Wait, the actual structure would be:

(CH2)3-CH-O-CH-CH2-(CH2)3?

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as (CH2)3CH-O-CH(CH2)3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. So the molecule is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me structure it properly.

Oct-4-ene is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no, the correct structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. So it's:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that can't be. Wait, the structure is actually CH2CH2 in the middle, so the molecule is CH2CH2 with substituents on either end. Oh wait, perhaps it's:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's 1-octene. No, I'm getting confused.

Let me correct this. The structure for oct-4-ene is:

CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5, so:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's not correct because the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2 in the middle, so:

(CH2)3-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2)3? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should write it as:

CH2CH2 in the middle, so the full structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's the same as 1-octene. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions.

Wait, oct-4-ene is 4-octene. So the structure is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → no, that's 1-octene. Wait, no, 4-octene is CH2CH2 in the middle of the chain. Let me write it properly.

The structure of 4-octene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5. Wait, that can't be right. So, the correct structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with the double bond starting at C4. So, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's 4-pentene. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should think of the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reaction rather than the specific structure. The key point is that when the epoxide is treated with acid, it undergoes ring-opening.

So, let's focus on the epoxide structure. The epoxide is formed between C4 and C5 of oct-4-ene. So the structure would be something like O connecting C4 and C5, with substituents on each.

When the epoxide is treated with acid, it protonates and then the ring opens. The ring opening in acid is a two-step process: protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group, followed by nucleophilic attack, typically at the more substituted carbon (since it's more stable).

Wait, the more substituted carbon in the epoxide would be the one with more substituents—so in oct-4-ene, each end of the epoxide is connected to two CH2 groups. So each epoxide carbon is connected to two CH2 groups. So, in this case, both carbons are equally substituted, so the nucleophile could attack either carbon with equal preference. Hmm, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the attack is from the less hindered side.

Wait, but in an epoxide derived from a symmetric alkene, such as oct-4-ene (since both ends are the same), the epoxide would be symmetric. So the ring-opening with acid would lead to the same product regardless of which carbon is attacked, perhaps.

Wait, but the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene might have different stereochemistry, making the epoxides different.

Wait no, because in both cases, the starting alkenes are symmetric. Let me think: (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. For oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same—each end is a CH2 group. So the (E) and (Z) configurations are possible because the double bond has two identical groups on each carbon.

So, (E)-oct-4-ene would have the two CH2 groups opposite each other, and (Z) would have them on the same side.

When these alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. The (E) epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides, and the (Z) would have them on the same side.

Wait, but wait. The epoxidation of an E-alkene would lead to a trans epoxide, and a Z-alkene to a cis epoxide.

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-4,5-epoxyoctane.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-4,5-epoxyoctane.

Then, each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, which causes ring-opening.

So, when trans-4,5-epoxyoctane is treated with acid, what happens? The epoxide oxygen is protonated, and then water attacks one of the carbons. But since the epoxide is symmetric (each carbon has two CH2 groups), the attack can happen on either carbon, but perhaps the stereochemistry of the attack leads to different products.

Wait, but when the epoxide is symmetric, the products of acid-catalyzed ring-opening are the same regardless of which carbon is attacked. So in this case, the trans epoxide would upon ring-opening give a diol, but perhaps in a certain configuration.

Wait, but the trans epoxide has the oxygen atoms on opposite sides. When acid is added, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. But in this case, both carbons are equally substituted, so maybe the attack can happen from either side.

Alternatively, perhaps the result is a diol with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, let's imagine the trans epoxide. The two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide is protonated, one oxygen becomes a good leaving group. Then, water attacks a carbon. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the attack can happen from either face, but the configuration of the resulting diol depends on the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the ring-opening in terms of stereoselectivity. In acidic conditions, the ring opening of an epoxide typically leads to the formation of a trans diol. Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I remember that the ring opening of epoxides under acid conditions leads to the nucleophile attacking the more substituted carbon. But in symmetric epoxides like this, both carbons are equally substituted, so the attack could be on either carbon.

But in terms of stereochemistry, the attack occurs with anti addition. Because when the epoxide is opened, the nucleophile approaches from the opposite side of the leaving group.

So for the trans epoxide: when the epoxide is trans, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. When one oxygen leaves (after protonation), the water attacks the adjacent carbon from the opposite side.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this out. But since I can't, I'll try to imagine it.

In the trans epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. So when one leaves, the water attacks the neighboring carbon from the opposite face. Let's say the epoxide is:

       O
       / \
      C   C
     /     \
    CH2CH2-CH2CH2...

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is:

CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2, but with the O connecting C4 and C5.

In the trans configuration, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So, when the epoxide is protonated, one oxygen leaves, and the other becomes a lone pair. The water attacks the adjacent carbon from the opposite side of where the leaving oxygen was.

In the trans epoxide, this would result in the formation of a diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on the same side because the attack occurs in a way that leads to syn addition. Wait, no, because in acid-catalyzed ring opening, the attack is anti.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. In the acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide:

1. Protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group.

2. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon (in this case, both are equally substituted).

3. The attack occurs on the less hindered side, which in a symmetric epoxide would be either side.

In the case of a trans epoxide, the attack would lead to the formation of a diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on the same face. Or perhaps the opposite.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the transition state. The epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The water approaches from the opposite side of the leaving group, leading to an anti addition.

So for a trans-epoxide, when the epoxide oxygen is on opposite faces, the nucleophilic attack would result in the diol's hydroxyl groups being on the same face.

Wait, let me think of a model. Imagine the epoxide as O in the center, with two CH2 groups attached. For trans, the O is between two CH2 groups, but the two O's are on opposite sides. So when one O leaves, the water attacks from the opposite side of the leaving O. So after the attack, the two new hydroxyl groups would be on the same side.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides because the attack is anti.

Wait, maybe I should look for a general rule. Acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening leads to trans diol? Or cis?

Wait, no, wait. The ring opening under acid conditions is a two-step process: first, protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The epoxide becomes positively polarized, with the adjacent carbons being electrophilic. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group. This is an SN2-like mechanism, leading to inversion of configuration.

So, for a trans-epoxide, the attack would happen on each carbon from opposite sides, leading to a diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on the same face.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Take cis-2,3-epoxybutane. When treated with acid, it would open to form a diol. The attack by water would happen on each carbon from the opposite side of the leaving oxygen. So if the epoxide is cis, the oxygens are on the same side, and the attack leads to the formation of a trans-diol.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol's configuration depends on the starting epoxide's configuration.

I think I need to approach this differently. Let's consider each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-4,5-epoxyoctane.

When treated with aqueous acid, this epoxide opens to form a diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would have both hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans) depending on the attack.

Wait, but wait. For a symmetric epoxide like this, the ring-opening would produce the same product regardless of which carbon is attacked. So the diol would be a single compound.

Wait, but then what about the stereochemistry? Let me think again. For the trans epoxide, when the water attacks, it would do so from the side opposite to the leaving oxygen. Since the epoxide is symmetric, attacking from either end would lead to the same product.

Wait, perhaps the diol formed from the trans-epoxide would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis), because the attack occurs on opposite faces, leading to the same configuration. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol's configuration would be trans because the attack occurs from opposite sides.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the product. Let's say the epoxide is trans, and the ring opening leads to a diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on the same face (cis), leading to a vicinal diol with a certain stereochemistry.

Similarly, the cis epoxide would open to form a diol with a different stereochemistry.

Wait, but in this case, the starting epoxides are trans and cis, and each will form a diol upon acid treatment. So Reaction 1 produces a diol from the trans epoxide, and Reaction 2 produces a diol from the cis epoxide.

Wait, but since both starting epoxides are symmetric, maybe each forms a single diol product.

So, Reaction 1 gives a diol from the trans epoxide, which would have a certain stereochemistry. Reaction 2 gives a diol from the cis epoxide, which would have a different stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the actual diol structures.

For Reaction 1: trans-epoxide → upon acid treatment, becomes a diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would have hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans). But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the trans-epoxide leads to a trans-diol and the cis-epoxide leads to a cis-diol.

Wait, but that's possible only if the opening leads to diastereomers.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think that each reaction produces a single diol, but with different stereochemistry.

So, Reaction 1 (E-ene → trans epoxide) forms a diol with a certain configuration.

Reaction 2 (Z-ene → cis epoxide) forms a diol with a different configuration.

But wait, when the epoxide is symmetric and opens, perhaps the diol formed from the trans epoxide is a single stereoisomer, and same for the cis.

But wait, let me consider that.

If the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol formed would have two identical stereogenic centers. So, perhaps in the case of the trans-epoxide, the diol would be meso, meaning it has two stereogenic centers but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.

Similarly, the cis-epoxide upon ring-opening would form a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material is symmetric, perhaps it would form a single product.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the actual products.

Assuming each reaction produces a diol. Let's name the diol as 4,5-diol-octane.

If the diol from Reaction 1 (trans-epoxide) is meso, then it would be a single compound (achiral).

If the diol from Reaction 2 (cis-epoxide) is also a single compound, perhaps also meso, but that doesn't make sense because the starting epoxide would have different stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to a different diol.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

For Reaction 1: (E)-ene → trans epoxide. Acid treatment → diol.

Assuming the diol has two adjacent hydroxyl groups. Depending on the attack, the diol could be a vicinal diol with either cis or trans configuration.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-ene → cis epoxide. Acid treatment → another diol.

Wait, perhaps the diol from the trans epoxide is a trans-diol, and the diol from the cis epoxide is a cis-diol.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the ring-opening of the trans-epoxide would lead to a cis-diol.

Wait, no. Let me think: the epoxide is trans, meaning the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. When the epoxide opens, the water attacks each carbon from opposite sides, leading to the hydroxyl groups being on the same face, making a cis diol.

Wait, but if the attack is from opposite sides, perhaps the diol's hydroxyl groups are on opposite faces, leading to a trans-diol.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a resource or a memory. Wait, I remember that acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides leads to the formation of trans diols. Because the attack occurs anti, leading to trans addition.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of a specific example. Consider cis-2,3-epoxybutane. When treated with acid, what is the product?

The epoxide oxygen is protonated, and the water attacks the more substituted carbon (in this case, both are same). The attack is from the opposite side of the leaving group, leading to the formation of a trans diol.

Wait, no. If the epoxide is cis, the two oxygens are on the same side. When one leaves, the water attacks from the opposite side, leading to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps in the case of a cis epoxide, the diol formed is trans.

Wait, but in a symmetric epoxide like this, maybe both diastereomers are formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol formed from a cis epoxide is a meso compound, and the diol from a trans epoxide is a different compound.

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think of the products.

Reaction 1: (E)-ene → trans-epoxide → acid → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-ene → cis-epoxide → acid → diol B.

If each diol is a different compound, then when the chemist combines them, they would have two different diols.

Wait, but perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, making them chiral.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetric diol, the diol may be meso, making it achiral.

So, let's imagine:

For Reaction 1: trans-epoxide → diol A is a meso compound (so it's achiral).

For Reaction 2: cis-epoxide → diol B is also a meso compound.

Wait, but then both diols would be achiral, and when combined, the mixture would have two achiral compounds. But that can't be because the HPLC would show certain peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, making them chiral.

Wait, but if the diol has two stereogenic centers, it could be a pair of enantiomers or a meso compound.

So, for diol A (from trans-epoxide), if it's a meso compound, then it's a single achiral product.

For diol B (from cis-epoxide), if it's also a meso compound, then it's another single achiral product.

But that would mean both products are achiral, leading to two peaks in the standard HPLC (since it can't separate enantiomers) and two peaks in the chiral HPLC (since each is achiral, no separation needed? Wait, no—chiral HPLC separates enantiomers, but if the compound is achiral, it would elute as a single peak.)

Wait, no. If a compound is achiral, it will not have enantiomers, so in a chiral HPLC column, it will still show as a single peak, just like in a standard column.

So, if both diols are achiral (meso compounds), then the mixture would have two achiral diols. When run on standard HPLC, each would be a single peak. So total of two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each is a single peak, so again two peaks.

But wait, looking at the options, option C says 2 peaks in both. But the problem says that the chemist combines the products. So are there two diols, each a single compound, leading to two peaks in both HPLC columns?

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, making them chiral. So Reaction 1 produces two enantiomers, and Reaction 2 produces two enantiomers.

Wait, but if the starting epoxide is symmetric, would the diol form enantiomers or a meso compound?

Let me consider Reaction 1: trans-epoxide. If the diol formed has two stereogenic centers but is a meso compound, then it's achiral. So, one product.

Reaction 2: cis-epoxide. If the diol is also a meso compound, another single achiral product.

So, combined, we have two achiral diols. So on standard HPLC, which is achiral, each would give a single peak. So two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but since these are achiral compounds, they each give a single peak. So again two peaks.

So the chromatograms would each show two peaks, leading to option C: 2 peaks in both.

But wait, that's not one of the options. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) 4 peaks in both

B) 2 and 3

C) 2 and 2

D) 3 and 4.

So option C is 2 peaks in both.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to multiple peaks.

Wait, maybe each reaction produces two products each. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, each epoxide could open in two different ways, leading to different diols. So perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers.

But wait, given the symmetry of the starting epoxide, the ring-opening should lead to only one product, not multiple.

Wait, for a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening would give a single product because the molecule is symmetric. So regardless of which face the water attacks, the product would be the same.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So Reaction 1 gives a single diol, and Reaction 2 gives another single diol.

So when the two diols are combined, there are two compounds in total.

So, in standard HPLC (achiral), both diols would be separated if they are different. So each would be a single peak, resulting in two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, if the diols are chiral, each would split into two peaks (enantiomers), but if they are achiral, just a single peak.

Wait, but if each diol is a meso compound (achiral), then on a chiral HPLC, each would still be a single peak, leading to two peaks in total.

But if each diol is chiral, they would each split into two peaks, leading to four peaks in total on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but let me think about the diols.

Diol from Reaction 1: from trans-epoxide. Let's say it's a meso compound (so not chiral). Thus, in chiral HPLC, it would appear as a single peak.

Diol from Reaction 2: from cis-epoxide. Let's say it's another meso compound, also not chiral. So on chiral HPLC, each would be a single peak. Thus, two peaks in total on each HPLC.

But wait, that can't be correct because the starting materials are different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the diols are not meso compounds. Let me model it differently.

Suppose the diol from Reaction 1 is a trans-diol (so, two stereogenic centers, enantiomeric), and the diol from Reaction 2 is a cis-diol (another enantiomeric pair).

Wait, but no, because the starting epoxides are symmetric. So each diol would be a meso compound.

Wait, for example, consider 2,3-trans-diol: if the two hydroxyls are on opposite sides, the molecule could be meso.

Similarly, 2,3-cis-diol would also be a meso compound if the molecule has symmetry.

Wait, no. Wait, 2,3-diol in a four-carbon chain (like butane) would be a meso compound if the hydroxyls are on the same side (cis), because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Similarly, if they're on opposite sides (trans), the molecule would be a meso compound as well.

Wait, no. Let me think: for 2,3-butanediol.

- If the diol is cis (both hydroxyls on same side), the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, making it meso.

- If the diol is trans (hydroxyls on opposite sides), the molecule is also meso because it has a center of inversion.

Wait, no. Wait, 2,3-butanediol:

- Cis: the two OH groups are on the same side. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (mirror plane) between C2 and C3, making it meso.

- Trans: the OH groups are on opposite sides. The molecule has a center of symmetry (each OH is a mirror image of the other), making it meso as well.

So, in both cases, the diol is a meso compound, meaning it's achiral.

Thus, in Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, each produces a single achiral diol.

When the chemist combines them, the mixture has two different achiral diols.

So, when run on standard HPLC (achiral), each would elute as a single peak. So two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each achiral diol would also elute as a single peak, so two peaks.

But wait, the options don't include two peaks in both. Let me check the options again.

Option C says 2 peaks in both. So that would fit.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each reaction produces two enantiomeric diols, but that would require the diols to be chiral, which they are not if they're meso.

So, given that, the chemist would see two peaks on both HPLC columns.

Looking at the options, option C) 2 peaks in both.

But wait, I think I'm missing something. Because in Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, each produces a different diastereomer. Wait, no, because the starting materials are different.

Wait, let me think again. Reaction 1's product is an achiral diol (meso), and Reaction 2's product is another achiral diol (meso), but different from the first.

So when mixed, they are two different compounds, each achiral.

So, on standard HPLC (achiral), each would elute as a single peak → two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each would also elute as a single peak → two peaks.

Thus, the answer would be option C.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is '2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC'.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer is C.

The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the products are combined. The task is to determine the number of peaks observed in standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC chromatograms.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the stereochemistry of the epoxide:
     - (E)-oct-4-ene forms a **trans-epoxide**.
     - (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a **cis-epoxide**.
   - Acid treatment of the epoxides leads to ring-opening via nucleophilic attack by water. The stereochemistry of the epoxide determines the stereochemistry of the resulting diol.

2. **Epoxide Ring-Opening**:
   - For symmetric epoxides like those derived from oct-4-ene:
     - The trans-epoxide opens to form a **meso diol** (4,5-diol-octane), which is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.
     - The cis-epoxide also opens to form a **meso diol**, which is similarly achiral.
   - Both reactions yield single achiral products.

3. **Combination of Products**:
   - The chemist combines the products of both reactions. Since the two epoxides lead to two different meso diols, the mixture contains two distinct achiral compounds.

4. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (achiral) HPLC**: This column cannot distinguish enantiomers but can separate different compounds. Since there are two distinct achiral diols, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: This column separates enantiomers but cannot separate achiral compounds. Since both diols are achiral, each will elute as a single peak, resulting in **2 peaks**.

### Conclusion:
Both the standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms will show **2 peaks**. This corresponds to option **C**.
