Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

From what I remember, luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the effective temperature. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, the mass might not directly affect the luminosity unless it's about something else, like maybe the method they're using to find the temperature. Hmmm.

The question also says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

Wait, but then if both stars have the same temperature, how do their luminosities compare? Well, luminosity depends on R squared times T to the fourth. Since T is the same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. That would suggest that Star_1 is 2.25 times as luminous as Star_2. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. So why are there other options? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh right, but radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, in the problem, they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest through spectroscopy. So does that mean the observed wavelength is the same for both stars? Or is the intrinsic peak the same?

Wait a second. If a star is moving towards or away from us, its spectrum is Doppler shifted. The peak emission wavelength would shift. But in the problem, they found that the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So that implies that their observed λ_max are the same. But if their intrinsic λ_max are different, then due to Doppler effect, they would shift to the same observed λ_max. So that would mean that their actual temperatures are different, but their observed λ_max are same because of their velocities.

Oh! So maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe I should account for the Doppler shift. Because the stars might have different intrinsic temperatures, but due to their velocities, their observed λ_max are the same. 

Wait, how does that work? Suppose a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted. So the observed λ_max would be shorter than the intrinsic λ_max. Conversely, if moving away, redshifted. So if both stars have the same observed λ_max, but their actual velocities are different, their actual temperatures would be different.

Wait, so the observed λ_max is same. So observed λ_max = intrinsic λ_max * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, the formula for Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_intrinsic * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when v is small compared to c (non-relativistic case), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_intrinsic (1 + v_r / c), but that's for small velocities. Or wait, maybe it's λ_obs = λ_intrinsic * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And z is approximately v_r / c for small velocities. So if the star is moving away (positive v_r), z is positive, and λ_obs is longer. If moving towards, z is negative, λ_obs is shorter.

So if Star_1 has v_r = 0, then its observed λ_max is the same as its intrinsic λ_max. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s, which is positive (assuming it's moving away), so its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + 700/(3e5)) because c is approximately 3e5 km/s. Let's compute that factor: 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333. So 1 + 0.02333 ≈ 1.02333. So λ2_obs ≈ λ2_intrinsic * 1.02333.

But according to the problem, the observed λ_max of both stars are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ1_obs is λ1_intrinsic (since Star_1 has v_r=0). So λ1_intrinsic = λ2_intrinsic * 1.02333.

Which implies λ1 = 1.02333 * λ2.

But since λ is inversely proportional to T (from Wien's law), λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2.

Wait, no. Actually, Wien's law is λ_max * T = constant. So λ1 * T1 = λ2 * T2.

We have λ1 = 1.02333 * λ2. So substituting, (1.02333 * λ2) * T1 = λ2 * T2.

The λ2 terms cancel out, so 1.02333 * T1 = T2.

So T2 = 1.02333 * T1.

Wait, but that would mean T2 is larger than T1. Because 1.02333 is greater than 1. So T2 = 1.02333 T1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me re-clarify. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its observed λ is longer. Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, but λ1_intrinsic is λ1, while λ2_obs is λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v_r2 / c). So λ1 = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v_r2 / c). But λ2_intrinsic = (b / T2), and λ1_intrinsic = (b / T1). So (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2 → T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) ) → 700e3 is 7e5, wait no, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s? Wait, no. Wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. And c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333, as before.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.02333) ≈ 1.02333 T1.

So T2 is about 2.33% hotter than T1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that λ1 = λ2_obs. So λ1 = λ2_obs = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v_r2/c). So λ1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c), but λ1 is also b/T1. So:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c) → 1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2.

Rearranged, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c) → yes, same as before.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) = T1 * (1 + 0.02333) ≈ 1.02333 T1.

So T2 is about 2.33% larger than T1.

Now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

We can calculate the ratio L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4)

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

T2 = T1 * 1.02333 → T1 = T2 / 1.02333 → T1^4 = (T2^4) / (1.02333)^4.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, let's express T1 in terms of T2.

Wait, from earlier, T2 = T1 * 1.02333 → T1 = T2 / 1.02333.

So, substituting into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = [ (1.5 R2)^2 * ( (T2/(1.02333) )^4 ) ] / [ (R2)^2 * (T2)^4 ) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1.5 R2)^2 = (2.25 R2^2)

Denominator is R2^2.

So the R terms become 2.25 R2^2 / R2^2 = 2.25.

Now, the T terms: (T2/(1.02333))^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1.02333^4).

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ 1 / (1.02333)^4 ]

Compute (1.02333)^4.

Hmm, 1.02333 is approximately 1.02333.

Let me compute 1.02333^4.

First, compute ln(1.02333) ≈ 0.02305 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + ... for small x. x=0.02333, so ln≈0.02333 - (0.02333)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.02333 - 0.00027 ≈ 0.02306.

Then, 4 * ln(1.02333) ≈ 4 * 0.02306 ≈ 0.09224.

Exponentiate: e^0.09224 ≈ 1 + 0.09224 + (0.09224)^2/2 + (0.09224)^3/6.

0.09224 squared is about 0.0085, so 0.0085 /2 = 0.00425. 

0.09224^3 ≈ 0.00078, divided by 6 is ~0.00013.

Adding up: 1 + 0.09224 + 0.00425 + 0.00013 ≈ 1.0966.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach, 1.02333^4.

Let me compute step by step:

1.02333^2 = approx 1.02333 * 1.02333.

Calculate 1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.02333 = 0.02333.

0.02333 * 1 = 0.02333.

0.02333 * 0.02333 ≈ 0.000544.

Adding them up: 1 + 0.02333 + 0.02333 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.047174.

So 1.02333 squared is approximately 1.0472.

Now, square that again to get the 4th power.

1.0472 squared is approximately:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.0472 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 1 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 0.0472 ≈ 0.002228.

Adding them: 1 + 0.0472 + 0.0472 + 0.002228 ≈ 1.096628.

So 1.02333^4 ≈ approximately 1.0966.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 divided by 1.0966.

Let me compute:

1.0966 * 2 = 2.1932.

2.1932 is less than 2.25.

The difference is 2.25 - 2.1932 = 0.0568.

So, 2 * 1.0966 = 2.1932. So 2.25 is 2.1932 + 0.0568.

So 0.0568 / 1.0966 ≈ 0.0518.

So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2 + 0.0518 ≈ 2.0518.

Wait, but that can't be right because 1.0966 is about 10% more than 1, so dividing by it gives about 1.826 (since 1/1.0966 ≈ 0.9119), so 2.25 * 0.9119 ≈ 2.052.

Wait a second, but earlier I thought that the ratio was 2.25, but now with the Doppler shift, it's less. So the initial calculation without considering Doppler gives 2.25, but when considering that Star_2 is moving away, making its T higher, the luminosity ratio is lower.

Wait, because T2 is higher, even though R1 is 1.5 R2, the higher temperature of Star_2 might make its luminosity higher, but wait, let me think.

Wait, L1/L2 = (2.25) * [ (1.02333^{-4}) ]

So 1.02333^{-4} = 1/(1.0966) ≈ 0.9119.

So 2.25 * 0.9119 ≈ 2.052.

Wait, 2.052 is approximately 2.05. So the luminosity ratio is about 2.05. But looking at the options, option A is 2.25, option D is 2.23, but others are ~2.32, ~2.35. Hmm, none of the options match 2.05.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate 1.02333^4 more accurately.

Wait, 1.02333 is approximately 1.023333...

Compute 1.02333^4 step by step.

First, 1.02333^2:

1.02333 * 1.02333.

Break it down:

= (1 + 0.02 + 0.00333) * (1 + 0.02 + 0.00333)

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute it directly.

1.02333 * 1.02333:

Multiply 1.02333 by 1.02333.

1.02333 * 1 = 1.02333

1.02333 * 0.02 = 0.0204666

1.02333 * 0.00333 ≈ 0.003406

Add them together:

1.02333 + 0.0204666 ≈ 1.0437966

1.0437966 + 0.003406 ≈ 1.0472026.

So approximately 1.0472.

Then, 1.0472 squared.

Compute 1.0472 * 1.0472.

1.0472 * 1.0472 = ?

Well, 1 * 1 =1.

1 * 0.0472 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 1 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 0.0472 = 0.00222784.

Adding all together:

1 + 0.0472 + 0.0472 + 0.00222784 = 1.09662784.

So 1.02333^4 ≈ 1.0966, as before.

So 1.0966 is correct.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.052.

But wait, the options don't have that. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm. So 2.05 is not among the options. That suggests I might have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the Doppler effect wrong. Because when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the observed peak λ is higher. So in that case, the observed λ_max is higher for Star_2 than Star_1, but according to the problem, they have the same observed λ_max.

Wait, no, the problem says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ_obs = λ_intrinsic * (1 + v_r / c) for Star_2. For Star_1, v_r is 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_intrinsic.

So λ1_intrinsic = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v_r2 / c).

Because λ1_obs = λ2_obs → λ1_intrinsic = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v_r2/c).

But λ1_intrinsic = b / T1, λ2_intrinsic = b / T2.

So, b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c).

Cancel b: 1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2 → T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, which is the same conclusion as before. So T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3/3e5) = T1 * 1.02333.

So T2 is 2.33% higher than T1.

So in that case, luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5. So (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T ratio: T2 = 1.02333 T1 → T1 = T2 / 1.02333 → (T1 / T2) = 1 / 1.02333 ≈ 0.97715.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.97715)^4.

Compute 0.97715^2:

0.97715 * 0.97715.

Approximate: 0.977^2 ≈ (1 - 0.023)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.046 + (0.023)^2 ≈ 0.954 + 0.000529 ≈ 0.954529.

So 0.97715^2 ≈ 0.9545.

Then, (0.9545)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.0455)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.091 + (0.0455)^2 ≈ 0.909 + 0.00207 ≈ 0.91107.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.91107.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.052.

Again, about 2.05.

But the options don't have that. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe the Doppler formula is different. Because when considering the Doppler effect for wavelength, it's more accurate to use the relativistic formula, but for small velocities, the approximation λ_obs = λ_intrinsic (1 + v/c) is sufficient. Alternatively, another formula is (λ_obs/λ_emit) = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ). Wait, but that's for frequency. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of frequency.

The Doppler shift formula can be approximated for small velocities as:

f_obs = f_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) )

But since λ = c / f, so λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) when moving away (v is positive, recession velocity).

Wait wait, I might have this inverted. Let me clarify.

The standard Doppler effect formula for light when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z),

where z is the redshift. And for small z, z ≈ v/c.

Wait, I think the correct approximation for λ_obs is λ_emit * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive when moving away).

So when a star moves away at velocity v, its λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c).

So for Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s, positive (moving away), λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5).

Which is 700e3 / 3e5 = 7e5 /3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333.

So λ2_obs = λ2_emit * 1.02333.

But Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

Given that λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so λ1_emit = λ2_emit *1.02333.

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b/T2) * 1.02333 → 1/T1 = 1.02333 / T2 → T2 = 1.02333 T1.

So same conclusion as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I assumed the same observed λ_max, but actually, the peak of the spectrum is at the same observed wavelength, which implies that their intrinsic temperatures are different.

So, to recap:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4)

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T2 = 1.02333 T1 → T1 = T2 /1.02333 → (T1/T2) = 1/1.02333 ≈ 0.97715.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.97715)^4 ≈ 0.911.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

But none of the options match this. The closest option is D) ~2.23, which is higher than 2.05.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler effect. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity affects the luminosity because of Doppler boosting. Wait, no, radial velocity affects the observed flux. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted and more flux is received, but that's a Doppler boosting effect which is part of the observed flux, not the intrinsic luminosity. Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity, assuming they radiate as black bodies. So perhaps the observed flux is F = L / (4 pi d^2), but if the star is moving, the flux is affected by the Doppler effect.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Luminosity is an intrinsic property. The observed flux is F = L * (1 - v_r / c) / (4 pi d^2) when moving away. Because when a star is moving away, the flux is reduced.

Wait, but in this problem, the astronomers calculated the luminosity based on their observed radiation. So perhaps they used the observed flux and distance to calculate L. But the problem states that they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I think the Doppler effect would have been accounted for in their calculations, but perhaps not in the way I considered.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the observed flux is F = (L / (4 pi d^2)) * (1 - v_r / c) when the star is moving away. Because the Doppler effect reduces the observed flux due to the light being stretched out, so each photon has less energy, and the rate of photons is also reduced.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the flux observed from a source moving away is F = F0 * (1 + v_r / c), where F0 is the flux if it were stationary. No, wait, I think it's F = F0 * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) ), but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the observed flux is F = (L / (4 pi d^2)) * (1 - v_r / c), but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux is F = F0 (1 + v_r / c), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the observed flux is F = F0 (1 + v_r / c), where F0 is the flux without any motion. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux is F_obs = F_emit * (1 - v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity away. So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its flux is lower than it would be if it were stationary. But then, when calculating luminosity, astronomers would use F = L/(4 pi d^2) → L = 4 pi d^2 F. So if F is lower due to Doppler, then L would be calculated as lower than it actually is. But the problem states that they computed the luminosity based on their observed radiation, so perhaps their calculated L includes the Doppler effect.

Wait, but the problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So perhaps the astronomers didn't account for the Doppler effect when calculating luminosities. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

Assuming that the stars' intrinsic properties (R and T) are known and that the observed wavelength maxima are same, but considering the Doppler effect, how do R and T affect L?

Wait, perhaps the problem is only about the fact that the observed λ_max are the same. So they use that to find T for each star, considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, if they observed λ_max for both stars is the same, then the intrinsic λ_max for each star is different. For Star_1, which is not moving, λ1_max_obs = λ1_emit = b / T1.

For Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3/3e5) = λ2_emit * 1.02333.

But since λ1_emit = λ2_obs = same value.

So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * 1.02333 → T2 = (b/λ2_emit) = T1 * (1.02333), because T is inversely proportional to λ.

So T2 = T1 * 1.02333.

With that, and R1 = 1.5 R2, let's compute L1 and L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 (1.02333 T1)^4 )

Simplify:

( (2.25 R2^2) T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (1.02333^4 T1^4) )

= 2.25 / (1.02333^4) ≈ 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.052.

So L1 is approximately 2.05 times L2.

But the options don't have 2.05. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Doppler effect isn't just about the observed wavelength, but also the observed flux. Because if a star is moving, the flux is affected. So when calculating luminosity from observed flux, you have to correct for the Doppler shift.

Wait, the flux F is related to luminosity by F = L / (4π d²). But if the star is moving, the observed flux also depends on the Doppler factor.

The observed flux F_obs = F * (1 + v_r / c), but I'm not confident about the exact formula. Alternatively, the flux from a moving source is F = F0 (1 - v_r / c), where F0 is the flux at rest.

Wait, another approach: The observed flux from a star moving away with velocity v is F = F0 (1 - v/c), where F0 is the flux if the star were stationary.

So if Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s, then F_obs2 = F2 * (1 - 700e3 / 3e5) = F2 * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ F2 * 0.997667.

But F = L / (4π d^2). So F_obs = L / (4π d^2) * (1 - v_r/c).

So for each star, F_obs = F_emit * (1 - v_r/c).

But wait, F_emit would be the flux without any Doppler effect. So when calculating L from F_obs, you would have to account for the Doppler effect.

So, if the astronomers compute L using F_obs, but without correcting for Doppler, then their calculation would include the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem says, "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So perhaps the astronomers used F_obs and the Doppler shift to calculate the correct L. Hmm, this is getting a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler effect is irrelevant because the question is about the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed flux.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So they must have accounted for the Doppler effect in determining the star's temperature. Because the observed wavelength is longer, so the intrinsic temperature would be higher.

So in their calculations, they would have used the intrinsic temperature, which is higher for Star_2.

So in that case, when calculating L, they factored in the Doppler effect correctly.

So, using the earlier calculation, L1/L2 is approximately 2.05. But none of the options match.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the T ratio.

Wait, let me double-check T2 = T1 * (1.02333). So (T1/T2)^4 = (1/1.02333)^4 ≈ (0.97715)^4 ≈ 0.911.

So L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.911) → 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.052.

Hmm, but the options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, which is higher than 2.05.

Wait, so perhaps the Doppler effect doesn't influence the luminosity ratio as much as I thought, or perhaps I should have considered the Doppler effect on the observed luminosity, not the intrinsic.

Wait, another approach: The astronomers compute the luminosity based on the observed flux, which includes the Doppler effect.

So, if a star is moving away, the observed flux is lower, so when calculating L from F_obs, it would be underestimated if not corrected for Doppler.

So, for Star_2, F_obs = F * (1 - v_r / c) → F = F_obs / (1 - v_r/c).

So, the luminosity L = 4π d² F.

So for Star_2, L2 = 4π d2² F_obs2 / (1 - v_r2/c).

Similarly, for Star_1, L1 = 4π d1² F_obs1.

But the problem doesn't mention distance, so perhaps the distance is the same, but that's not stated.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of luminosities, so d1 and d2 would cancel if the distances are the same. But since it's not stated, perhaps the distances are different. Hmm, but the problem doesn't provide information about distances, so I'm probably overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler effect is negligible for the luminosity ratio because it's about the same as the previous calculation.

Wait, maybe the question is intended to not consider the Doppler effect, and the initial approach where L1/L2 is 2.25 is the answer. But that's option A.

But why would the question include the radial velocity then? Because the options are all around 2.2, which suggests that the Doppler effect is being considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I inverted the T ratio. Let me think.

Wait, when a star moves away, its observed λ_max increases, implying a lower temperature. But the problem says both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. So their observed λ_max are the same, but their intrinsic λ_max are different because one is moving.

Wait, in that case, Star_2's intrinsic λ_max is shorter than Star_1's.

Because Star_2 is moving away, so λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c) → λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v_r2/c) = λ_obs1 / (1 + v_r2/c) → since Star_1 isn't moving, λ_emit1 = λ_obs1.

So λ_emit2 = λ_obs1 / (1.02333) < λ_obs1 → T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b * (1.02333)/ λ_obs1 → T2 = (b / λ_obs1) * 1.02333 = T1 * 1.02333.

So same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed under the initial assumption that the Doppler shift is negligible and the luminosity ratio is 2.25, which is option A. But given that the options are all around 2.2 or higher, perhaps the correct answer is D) 2.23.

Wait, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering the Doppler effect and the initial approach holds, giving a ratio of 2.25, which is option A. But that seems to ignore the Doppler effect given in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. The stars have the same observed λ_max, so same T_obs, but their intrinsic T is different due to Doppler. But when the astronomers compute luminosity, they compute using the observed T, assuming no Doppler. So their computed luminosity would be based on the observed T, which is lower than the intrinsic T for Star_2.

Wait, that might change things. Let me think.

If the astronomers use the observed λ_max to compute T, without correcting for Doppler, then they would think that both stars have the same T.

In that case, L1/L2 would be (R1^2 T^4) / (R2^2 T^4) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So option A.

But the problem states that they computed luminosity as black bodies, so they would presumably have accounted for any Doppler shifts in determining T. So that brings us back to the earlier calculation of L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.02333)^4.

Let me compute 1.02333^4 more accurately.

Compute 1.02333^2:

1.02333 * 1.02333 = ?

Let me compute it step by step:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.02333 = 0.02333.

0.02333 * 1 = 0.02333.

0.02333 * 0.02333 ≈ 0.000544.

Adding these up: 1 + 0.02333 + 0.02333 + 0.000544 = 1.047204.

So (1.02333)^2 = 1.047204.

Now, (1.047204)^2:

1.047204 * 1.047204.

Compute:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.047204 = 0.047204.

0.047204 * 1 = 0.047204.

0.047204 * 0.047204 ≈ 0.002228.

Adding them up: 1 + 0.047204 + 0.047204 + 0.002228 ≈ 1.096636.

So 1.02333^4 ≈ 1.096636.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.096636 ≈ 2.052.

Hmm, same as before.

Looking at the options, none are close to 2.05. So perhaps the problem intended us to ignore the Doppler effect and compute L1/L2 as 2.25, which would be option A.

But the problem gives the radial velocities, which suggests that the Doppler effect should be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the Doppler shift applies to the observed wavelength. Maybe the observed wavelength maximum is the same, which includes both the intrinsic temperature and the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the luminosity ratio as 2.25 without considering Doppler, which would be option A. But that contradicts the presence of radial velocity data.

Alternatively, perhaps the luminosity is not affected by the Doppler shift because luminosity is an intrinsic property. So the observed flux is affected, but the actual luminosity is based on the intrinsic R and T.

In that case, the calculation would be the same as the initial approach, giving L1/L2 as 2.25, option A.

But earlier, considering the Doppler effect, we get a lower ratio, 2.05.

But since the problem includes radial velocities, perhaps the correct approach is to include the Doppler effect, leading to a lower ratio, but none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to not consider the Doppler effect, so the answer is 2.25, option A.

But the presence of the radial velocity in the problem makes me think that it's supposed to be considered. Maybe the options have a typo, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the Doppler effect does to the observed flux and thus to the calculated luminosity.

Assume that the astronomers use the observed flux to calculate L, without correcting for Doppler. So for Star_2, since it's moving away, its observed flux is lower than it actually is.

So when computing L, they would compute L2 = 4π d^2 F_obs2.

But since F_obs2 = F2 (1 - v_r2/c ), their computed L2 would be less than the actual L2.

So, the actual L2 is higher than what they compute.

Wait, but the problem says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of". So, perhaps in their computation, without considering Doppler, Star_1's L is 2.25 times Star_2's L.

But this is getting too speculative.

Perhaps the intended answer is 2.25, option A. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Assume that Doppler shift doesn't affect the intrinsic luminosity. The intrinsic luminosity is based on R and T.

But in the problem, the observed λ_max are same, which would imply same T_observed, but with Doppler, which would adjust the intrinsic T.

But I'm getting stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to outline the correct calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:  

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius and \(T\) is the effective temperature of the star. The problem provides the following information:  

1. **Radius**: \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\).  
2. **Mass**: \(M_1 = 1.5 M_2\) (not directly relevant to luminosity).  
3. **Observed Wavelengths**: Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)), implying the same observed temperature (\(T_{\text{obs}}\)) due to Wien's law:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \frac{b}{T_{\text{obs}}}
   \]
4. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has \(v_r = 0\), and Star_2 has \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\).  

### Step 1: Relating Intrinsic Temperatures
The observed wavelength is related to the intrinsic wavelength by the Doppler effect. For Star_2, moving away at \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\):  
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit, 2}} \cdot (1 + v_r / c)
\]
where \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\). Substituting \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\):  
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit, 2}} \cdot 1.02333
\]
Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs, 2}}\), we equate:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit, 2}} \cdot 1.02333
\]
From Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = b / T\), so:  
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.02333
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]
Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_2 = 1.02333 T_1\):  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1.02333)^4}
\]
First, calculate \((1.5)^2 = 2.25\). Next, calculate \((1.02333)^4\):  
\[
(1.02333)^4 \approx 1.0966
\]
Thus:  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.0966} \approx 2.052
\]

### Step 3: Comparing with Options
The calculated ratio \(L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.05\) does not match any of the provided options (\(A: 2.25, B: 2.32, C: 2.35, D: 2.23\)). This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem's setup or the interpretation of the Doppler effect. If the Doppler effect is ignored, the luminosity ratio simplifies to:  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]
which matches option \(A\). Given the radial velocity data, the intended answer likely assumes the Doppler effect is negligible, leading to the ratio \(2.25\).

### Final Answer
The problem's options and context suggest the intended answer is based on the assumption that the Doppler effect is not considered. Therefore, the ratio of the luminosities is:  

**Answer: A**
