Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable P is given by a 3x3 matrix. I need to calculate the probability that measuring P will yield 0.

Hmm, right, so in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable, and the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is related to the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait a second, but wait. The observable P here is given. I need to find the probability of measuring 0. So first, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, specifically looking for the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability can be calculated using the expectation value formula. Or wait, maybe using the operator P acting on the state. Wait no, maybe another approach: the probability is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P. But perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value if I can diagonalize P.

Wait, but perhaps I can approach it another way. The observable P is a matrix, and I can compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The probability of measuring 0 is the sum over the squares of the amplitudes of the state in each eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

But maybe there's a simpler way. Let me write down the matrix P first. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). Third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0).

Wait, so P looks like this:

[ 0      1/sqrt(2)     0      ]
[1/sqrt(2)  0      1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0      1/sqrt(2)     0      ]

Hmm, is this matrix symmetric? Let me check. The element (1,2) is 1/sqrt(2) and (2,1) is also 1/sqrt(2). Similarly, (1,3) is 0 and (3,1) is 0. (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2). So yes, it's symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

Wait, but for a Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are real. So, the eigenvalues could include 0, as we're looking for.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[-λ      1/sqrt(2)      0    ]
[1/sqrt(2)   -λ        1/sqrt(2) ]
[0       1/sqrt(2)     -λ    ]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
    - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] 
    + 0 * something.

Which simplifies to:

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] 
    - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ)/sqrt(2) - 0 ] 
    + 0.

So expanding this:

-λ³ + (λ)(1/2) 
    + (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ)/sqrt(2) 
= -λ³ + (λ/2) ) + (λ * (1/2) )

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

The first term is -λ multiplied by ( (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) ) which is λ² - (1/2) * (1/2) is 1/2. So λ² - (1/2).

So first term is -λ ( λ² - 1/2 ) = -λ³ + (λ)(1/2).

The second term is minus (1/sqrt(2)) multiplied by the determinant of the minor. The minor is the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. So that's the elements at (2,1)=1/sqrt(2), (2,3)=1/sqrt(2), (3,1)=0, (3,3)=-λ.

So the minor matrix is:

[1/sqrt(2)  1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0        -λ        ]

The determinant of that is (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = (-λ)/(sqrt(2)).

So the second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-λ)/(sqrt(2)) ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ) / (2).

Putting it all together:

Determinant = (-λ³ + (1/2)λ) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + ( (1/2) + (1/2) ) λ = -λ³ + λ.

Set determinant to zero: -λ³ + λ = 0 ⇒ λ ( -λ² + 1 )= 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Wait, because: -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0 → solutions λ =0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the observable P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, -1.

The question is what is the probability of getting 0.

So, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0, then express the state as a linear combination of these eigenvectors (and any others, but since they correspond to different eigenvalues, the probabilities are squared moduli).

Wait, but in this case, for λ=0, perhaps the eigenvector is orthogonal to the state, or not. But let's proceed.

First, find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

[0    1/sqrt(2)   0     ]
[1/sqrt(2)  0    1/sqrt(2)]
[0    1/sqrt(2)   0     ]

So the equations are:

1. 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

2. (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

3. 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2=0.

So from equation 1 and 3, v2=0.

Equation 2 becomes v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as (v1, 0, -v1) = v1 (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1).

So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Now, the state vector is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1).

Wait, but wait a second. In quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, right? Because the probabilities must sum to 1. Let's check the given state.

The state is (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, so perhaps this is a problem. But maybe in this problem, we can proceed without normalizing, because the probabilities would just be scaled accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as a vector and we can proceed regardless.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given as a column matrix (-1,2,1), so perhaps it's a non-normalized state. But for calculating probabilities, perhaps we can just proceed as if the state is given, and the probabilities are the squared components in the eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to normalize the state first. Hmm, because otherwise, the probabilities might not add up to 1. But the question is about the probability of getting zero, so perhaps it's just the projection onto the eigenvector (1,0,-1) divided by the norm squared of the state.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think again.

The state is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. The eigenvector for λ=0 is |v> = [1; 0; -1].

The probability is |<v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>.

Wait, because the state |ψ> must be normalized for probabilities to sum to 1. So the probability would be the square of the amplitude divided by the norm squared of the state.

Alternatively, if the state isn't normalized, the probabilities are given by [ |<v|ψ>|² ] / [ <ψ|ψ> ].

Because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities are calculated as |a_i|^2 / <ψ|ψ>, where a_i is the inner product of the state with the ith eigenvector.

So let's compute that.

First, compute the inner product <v|ψ>.

v is [1, 0, -1], and ψ is [-1, 2, 1].

So <v|ψ> = 1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.

The norm squared of ψ is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =1+4+1=6.

So the probability is |(-2)|^2 / 6 = 4/6 = 2/3.

Wait, that would be option A) 2/3.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another approach: the probability is |<v|ψ>|^2 divided by the norm of ψ squared.

Because ψ is not normalized, the probability is |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

So that's (4) / 6 → 2/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 is 2/3.

Looking back at the options, option A is 2/3. So the answer should be A.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps the state is a unit vector already. But earlier calculation showed that it's norm sqrt(6), which is not 1. So no, it's not normalized.

Another approach: perhaps the observable's eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, so the probabilities are the sum of |<e_i | ψ>|^2, where e_i are the orthonormal eigenvectors. But in this case, we have an eigenvector for 0, and others for 1 and -1. So our state can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. But since we have only one eigenvector for 0, and others for 1 and -1, the probability would be the sum of the squared amplitudes for each eigenvector.

Wait, but wait, in our problem, the eigenvector for 0 is (1,0,-1), which we found. Let's normalize it. The norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So to compute the probability, we take the inner product of the state with this unit eigenvector, square its magnitude.

So <v_unit|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, that can't be right because the inner product's magnitude would then be sqrt(2), but let me compute it again.

Wait, v_unit is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

So:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2) * (2/2) )= -sqrt(2).

Wait, the inner product is -sqrt(2), so |<v_unit|ψ>|^2 is (sqrt(2))^2= 2.

But the state ψ has a norm squared of 6. So the probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3. Wait, this gives a different answer. So now I'm confused.

Wait, that's a contradiction. Earlier calculation yielded 2/3, and now 1/3. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Let me think again.

When you have a state vector |ψ> and an observable P with eigenvectors |v_i> which are orthonormal, then the probability of measuring eigenvalue λ_i is |<v_i|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>.

Because the state |ψ> is not normalized, the probabilities are the squared projections divided by the norm squared.

So in the first approach, without normalizing the eigenvectors, I got <v|ψ> = -2, then |<v|ψ>|² is 4, and the norm of ψ is 6, so 4/6=2/3.

In the second approach, when I normalized the eigenvector, I got <v_unit|ψ> = -sqrt(2), so |...|^2 is 2, and the same denominator 6, so 2/6=1/3.

Wait, but that's inconsistent. Why the difference?

Ah, I see. Because the eigenvector isn't normalized in the first approach, so when I compute the inner product, I have to account for that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it correctly.

The probability is the squared amplitude of the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector |v>, divided by the norm squared of |ψ>.

But the eigenvector |v> is (1,0,-1), which has norm sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the correct way is to compute <v_unit|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) )= (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So |<v_unit|ψ>|² is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Then, the probability is 2 / (6) = 1/3.

Wait, but wait, that contradicts the first approach.

Ah, but perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach by not normalizing the eigenvector.

Wait, let me think. The formula for the probability when the state is not normalized is ( |<v|ψ>|² ) / ( <ψ|ψ> ), where v is any eigenvector (not necessarily unit), because the denominator is the squared norm of the state.

Wait, because in the first approach, <v|ψ> = -2, and the norm of v is sqrt(2), so the projection is (-2), but the magnitude is 2. Then, the probability is 2² / (sqrt(2))² * <ψ|ψ>.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here. Let me re-derive it.

The correct formula for the probability of measuring λ_i is:

P(λ_i) = |<v_i | ψ>|² / <ψ | ψ>,

where |v_i> is the unit eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue λ_i.

Because |v_i> is a unit vector, the inner product <v_i | ψ> gives the amplitude, and the square of its magnitude is the probability contribution.

So in this case, <v_unit | ψ> = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2)/sqrt(2) )= -sqrt(2).

The magnitude is sqrt(2), so |<v_unit | ψ>|² = (sqrt(2))² = 2.

Denominator is <ψ | ψ> = 6.

So P(0) = 2/6 = 1/3. So the probability is 1/3, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 2/3. So now I'm getting 1/3. Which is correct?

Ah, I think I see the confusion. The first approach didn't normalize the eigenvector, which led to a different result. But the correct approach is to normalize the eigenvectors because the probability formula uses the unit eigenvectors.

So in the first approach, I computed <v | ψ> where v is (1,0,-1), which is not unit. So the inner product is -2. Then, the squared magnitude is 4. But since v is not unit, the denominator is not 1 but the squared norm of v, which is 2. So the correct probability would be 4/(2 * 6) )= 4/(12) = 1/3.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the general formula is |<v_i | ψ> |^2 / <ψ | ψ>,

where |v_i> is an eigenvector. But if |v_i> is not normalized, then |v_i> = |e_i> * ||v_i||, where |e_i> is the unit vector. So <v_i | ψ> = ||v_i|| * <e_i | ψ>.

So |<v_i | ψ>|^2 = ||v_i||² * |<e_i | ψ>|^2.

So when calculating the probability, it's |<e_i | ψ>|^2 = |<v_i | ψ>|^2 / ||v_i||^2.

Then, the probability is ( |<v_i | ψ>|^2 / ||v_i||^2 ) / <ψ | ψ>.

Which is same as ( |<v_i | ψ>|^2 ) / ( ||v_i||^2 * <ψ | ψ> ).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using the unit eigenvectors.

So in our case, <v | ψ> is -2, and ||v|| is sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The inner product with this unit vector is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) )= -sqrt(2).

So the squared magnitude is (sqrt(2))² = 2.

Probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

So the correct answer is option C) 1/3.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 2/3. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in either the eigenvector or the inner product. Let me recheck.

Wait, the state is [-1; 2;1], and the eigenvector for 0 is [1;0;-1].

So <v|ψ> is 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.

The norm of v is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -2. The norm of v is sqrt(2), so the projection is ( -2 ) / sqrt(2) → which is -sqrt(2). The magnitude squared is 2.

The norm of the state is sqrt(6), so the probability is 2/6=1/3.

So the correct answer is 1/3, which is option C.

To calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given as:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). This yields eigenvalues \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

For \( \lambda = 0 \), solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \) gives the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v} = (1, 0, -1) \). Normalizing this eigenvector, we get:
\[
\mathbf{v}_{\text{unit}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability Calculation
The state of the system is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring 0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto the unit eigenvector \( \mathbf{v}_{\text{unit}} \), divided by the norm squared of \( |\psi\rangle \).

1. Compute the inner product:
\[
\langle \mathbf{v}_{\text{unit}} | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 1 = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2}.
\]

2. The squared magnitude of the inner product is:
\[
|\langle \mathbf{v}_{\text{unit}} | \psi \rangle|^2 = (-\sqrt{2})^2 = 2.
\]

3. The norm squared of \( |\psi\rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.
\]

4. The probability of measuring 0 is:
\[
P(0) = \frac{|\langle \mathbf{v}_{\text{unit}} | \psi \rangle|^2}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Answer: C
