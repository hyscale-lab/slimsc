Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. The problem describes an unknown white solid with some spectral data, and I need to determine which structure it corresponds to among the given options. 

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then there's a peak at 158 with 32%. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I think the molecular ion is the main peak. So the molecular formula probably has a molecular weight of 156. 

Looking at the IR data, there's a broad peak between 3500 and 2700 cm^-1, which often indicates an -OH group because O-H stretches are usually in that region and can be broad. But wait, sometimes it could also be an amine or something else, but the broadness suggests it's an -OH. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's in the range for carbonyl groups. I remember that carbonyls like ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, etc., absorb around there. For example, carboxylic acids have a strong peak around 1700, maybe a bit higher. But wait, the IR could also show a peak for a carbonyl in an acid derivatize, like an ester or something else.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data: there's a peak at 11.0 ppm as a singlet integrating for 1H. That's really high, which I think is indicative of an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, maybe a bit higher? Or maybe it's an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, often as a broad peak. But in this case, it's a singlet. So maybe it's a deprotonated carboxylic acid? Or perhaps it's an aldehyde. Hmm, but wait, the IR had a broad peak, which would suggest an -OH, so that might point towards a carboxylic acid because aldehydes aren't usually broad. Unless it's an enolic proton, but maybe that's more complicated. 

Then there's a peak at 8.02 ppm as a doublet (d) integrating for 2H, and another at 7.72 ppm, also a doublet for 2H. Those are in the aromatic region. Let's think about the substitution pattern. If you have two doublets each integrating for two protons, that suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para-disubstituted ring, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets – the two protons adjacent to each substituent. For example, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, you have two sets of doublets. Alternatively, for a para-substituted benzoic acid, the ring protons would show as doublets.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have the structure where the benzaldehyde ring has hydroxy and chlorine substituents on positions 2 and 3, which are adjacent. Wait, but that's a meta substitution, not para. So the aromatic protons would be more complex, maybe as a triplet or something else. Not sure, but the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted ring.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That would be a para chlorobenzoic acid. So the structure is Cl and COOH on opposite positions. The NMR would show a para-substituted ring, which would have two sets of doublets. And the IR would show a broad peak for the -COOH (which is -OH), so that fits. The molecular weight would be Cl (35.5) + C7H5O2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but with Cl substituting a H, so molecular weight should be 12*7 + 1*(6-1) + 16*2 +35.5 = 84 +5 +32 +35.5= 156.5. Wait, that's about 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.

Let me compute the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing one H with Cl: C7H5ClO2. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 (Cl) =35.5, 2*16=32. So 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So the molecular weight is 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, so that's close. Maybe the peak is at 156, but the actual molecular weight is 156.5. Could that be a problem? Alternatively, perhaps the peak is at 156 as the molecular ion, and 158 is the M+2 peak, which often occurs due to chlorine isotopes. Chlorine has two main isotopes, about 35 and 37 Cl. So if the molecule has one Cl, the molecular ion would be at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl), which matches the given data. So that makes sense. So the molecular ion at 156 (but actual mass 156.5) and the M+2 at 158 (32% which is about the natural abundance of 37Cl, which is about 24%, so 32% could be the sum of both isotopes, but wait, the M+2 is due to the heavier isotope, so perhaps the abundance is 32%? Or perhaps the base peak is at 156, and 158 is the next, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, this seems plausible.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's Cl-CO-O-Ph. The structure would be Cl attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to an oxygen, which is attached to a benzene ring. The molecular formula would be C6H5O2ClCO. Wait, let me think. Phenyl chloroformate would be ClCOOPh. So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, that's the same as option B. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is O=C(OCl)Ph? Or Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula is C6H5O2ClCO? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Alternatively, phenyl chloroformate is ClCO-O-C6H5. So formula would be C7H5ClO2. So same as benzoic acid with Cl substituent. So molecular weight same as option B, 156.5. So the same as option B. So which one is more likely?

Looking at the IR data: if it's phenyl chloroformate, the carbonyl would be an ester or perhaps an acid chloride. The IR peak at 1720 cm^-1: acid chlorides have higher carbonyl peaks, around 1800 cm^-1, I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me recall: carboxylic acids have around 1700 cm^-1, esters around 1740, acid chlorides higher, like 1800. So the peak here is 1720, which is a bit higher than a typical ester, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl from an acyl chloride, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but if it's a phenyl chloroformate, which is Cl-CO-O-Ph, that's an ester group. So the carbonyl would be around 1740 cm^-1, perhaps. So the IR peak is at 1720, which might not fit. Unless it's a different functional group.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. That would be Cl and COOH on adjacent positions on the benzene ring. So the aromatic protons would be a triplet or something else. Because in ortho substitution, the coupling is different. So in the NMR, the aromatic protons would split into more complex patterns than just two doublets. So for 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have substituents at positions 2 and 1 (since benzoic acid is at position 1), so the ring would have a proton next to the COOH and Cl. So the NMR would show a triplet or a more complex splitting, not just two doublets. So this option might not fit the NMR data.

Back to the NMR data. The 11.0 ppm peak as a singlet suggests a single proton. If it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be broad. But here, it's a singlet, which is sharp. Wait, but in DMSO-d6, carboxylic acids can sometimes show sharp singlets if they're exchanging. Alternatively, if the solution is not very concentrated, the peak might not be as broad. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes a bit higher. But in the case of para-substituted benzaldehyde, perhaps it's split into a singlet? No, because the aldehyde proton is usually a singlet regardless. Wait, but in the case of para-substituted benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is still a singlet. So if the structure is benzaldehyde with substituents, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet. But wait, the IR would show a peak for the aldehyde C=O as well. 

Looking back, the IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720. Aldehydes have C=O around 1720 as well, right? Wait, no, wait. Aldehydes typically have carbonyl peaks around 1720, but carboxylic acids are a bit lower, around 1700. So the 1720 could fit either. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would cause a broad peak in IR, which we have. So that's conflicting a bit. 

Wait, the IR has a broad peak between 3500-2700. That's the O-H stretch. So that suggests either an -OH group (like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol). So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. If it's an aldehyde, perhaps an -OH is present elsewhere, like in an alcohol group. But the options don't mention an alcohol except option A.

Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So that would have both an -OH and an aldehyde group. The IR would show a broad peak for the -OH, which matches. The aldehyde would have a C=O peak around 1720, which also matches. Then in the NMR, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. Hmm, that's higher than typical for an aldehyde. But maybe in this case, due to substitution, it's shifted up. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is in a different environment. But wait, the aldehyde proton is usually a sharp singlet. So in the NMR, the 11.0 ppm is a sharp singlet—so maybe that's the aldehyde proton. But then, where's the -OH proton? Because in the NMR, it's showing just one singlet. Wait, but the -OH proton in an aldehyde would be a separate peak. Unless it's in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the -OH is an acidic proton and has exchanged with the solvent, so it doesn't show up in the NMR. But that's more common for alcohols and amines, not aldehydes. Or perhaps it's a phenolic -OH, which is more acidic and might exchange, not appearing as a peak.

Wait, but in option A, the structure is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have an -OH group at position 2 and an aldehyde at position 1. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Let's think about the substitution. The substituents are at positions 1 (aldehyde), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the ring would have substituents at 1, 2, and 3 positions. That's a meta arrangement. So the aromatic protons would be more complex. Let's say the ring has substituents at 1,2,3. The protons would be at positions 4,5,6, but in such a substitution pattern, the splitting could be more complicated. For example, the proton at position 4 would be adjacent to the Cl at 3, and perhaps coupled with others. So the NMR would show more than just two doublets. So the NMR in the problem has two doublets each for two protons, which suggests a para-substituted ring, like two substituents across from each other.

So that makes option A less likely because it's a tri-substituted ring, but the NMR indicates a para-substituted, perhaps di-substituted ring.

So going back to options B and C. Both have molecular weights around 156.5, so the molecular ion at 156 and M+2 at 158. 

If it's phenyl chloroformate (option C), the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The 1H NMR would have the aromatic protons in a para-substituted pattern because the substituent is OCOCl attached to the benzene. Wait, no. Wait, phenyl chloroformate would have the substituent as OCOCl attached para? Or is the substituent a single group on the ring? No, the chloroformate would be attached as a single group, so the benzene ring would have one substituent, which is the chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-). So the ring would be mono-substituted. Wait, but in that case, the aromatic protons would be a triplet? No, wait, for a mono-substituted benzene, the protons are ortho, meta, para to the substituent. The coupling would lead to more complex splitting. Alternatively, if the substituent is strong, the ring protons could be split into a complex multiplet. But in the problem, the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So that suggests a di-substituted benzene ring with substituents para to each other.

So perhaps option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, is more likely. That's di-substituted with Cl and COOH in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each with two protons. That fits the NMR data.

Let me check the NMR for benzoic acid. For para-substituted benzoic acid, the ring protons are ortho and para to the substituents. In this case, the substituents are Cl and COOH, which are both strong deactivating groups. So the ring protons adjacent to Cl and COOH would be deshielded and appear downfield.

So the NMR would show two doublets: one for the protons adjacent to Cl, and another for the protons adjacent to COOH. Wait, but since both substituents are in para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to Cl would be one doublet, and the protons ortho to COOH would be another. So each of those would be a doublet because they're adjacent to only one substituent. So the NMR would match this.

Then, the 11.0 ppm peak would be the COOH proton. COOH protons are usually broad, but in DMSO-d6, they can sometimes appear as sharp singlets if they're exchanging. Alternatively, if the compound is the sodium salt (but the IR would then show no broad peak), so probably it's the protonated acid. But the NMR shows a sharp singlet. Wait, but in the problem statement, the IR has a broad peak, which suggests the presence of an -OH group, which would be the COOH. So perhaps in the NMR, the COOH proton is a broad peak, but in the data given, it's a sharp singlet. That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the solution is a deprotonated form, but that would require a basic solution, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, the NMR shows 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a singlet, which for a carbonyl proton like COOH, would usually be a broad peak if it's exchanging. But if the solution is such that the exchange is rapid, it could appear as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a COOH but an aldehyde. But earlier analysis suggested that. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if the 11.0 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton, but the IR shows a broad peak (O-H), which would suggest a hydroxyl group. That might complicate things because the options don't have both. Except option A, which is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's think about that structure. It has both an -OH and an aldehyde group.

In that case, the IR would show a broad O-H peak, which matches. The aldehyde's C=O would be around 1720, which also matches. The NMR would have the aldehyde proton as a singlet around 9-10 ppm, but the data shows it at 11.0. That's a bit high. Also, the aromatic protons would have a more complex splitting pattern due to the proximity of the substituents.

But in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests a simpler substitution pattern, like para. So perhaps option A is less likely.

Wait, but let me think about the molecular formula for each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2.

Molecular weight: 7*12 = 84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89; 89+35.5=124.5; 124.5 +32=156.5.

So M+ peak at 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, but the molecular ion can sometimes be at an even mass if it's a molecular formula with an even number of nitrogen atoms, but here, no N. Wait, how about the isotopic peaks? Chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 (75%) and Cl-37 (25%). So the molecular ion would appear at m/z 156 (Cl-35) and m/z 158 (Cl-37). The abundance would be approximately 75% and 25%. But the given data shows a peak at 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. That would fit, because 32% is about four times 8% (since 25% would be for Cl-37, but perhaps the base peak is 156 at 100%, so 158 would be 25% of the total, but considering the relative intensity, perhaps the 158 is 32% relative to 156, which would be the case if 156 is the base peak (100%) and 158 is (37/35) * 100% * 25%. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me calculate the ratio.

The M and M+2 peaks are due to the presence of Cl. The ratio of the M+2 to M is approximately (37/35) * (25%) * 100%. Wait, no. The natural abundance of Cl-35 is about 75%, and Cl-37 is about 24.8%. So for a molecule with one Cl, the M peak (Cl-35) would be 75% of the total Cl abundance. The M+2 peak (Cl-37) would be 24.8% of the total. So the ratio of M+2 to M would be (24.8 / 75) *100% ≈ 33%. So in the given data, the M+2 is 32%, which is close to this expected 33%. So that fits with option B.

So option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which would have molecular weight 156.5, with the molecular ion at 156 (base peak) and M+2 at 158, 32% intensity. The IR shows a broad peak (the -COOH O-H) and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 (the carbonyl). The NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which would be the -COOH proton. However, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but in some cases, they can appear as sharp singlets if there's rapid exchange, or if the solution isn't very concentrated. Also, the aromatic protons being two doublets each integrating 2H suggests a para substitution. So option B seems to fit.

Looking back at the options, option C is phenyl chloroformate. Its structure is O=C(OCl)Ph. So it's like an ester group attached to the benzene ring. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Same as option B, so same molecular weight. The IR would show a carbonyl peak, but chloroformate esters have higher carbonyl absorption, around 1740-1760 cm^-1. But the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So that might not fit. 

So option B is more likely. 

Another thing to consider: the 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm. For benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but perhaps in this case, it's a sharp singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but I'm not sure. Wait, if the structure were phenyl chloroformate, would the NMR have anything near 11 ppm? I don't think so. Phenyl chloroformate would have the aromatic protons, but no aldehyde or carboxylic acid proton. Wait, wait no, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the carbonyl is between Cl and O. So the structure doesn't have a proton on the carbonyl, except perhaps an O-H in the ester, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the solvent or something else is causing the peak. No, I think option C doesn't have a proton at 11 ppm. So the 11 ppm peak must come from a COOH or an aldehyde.

So putting it all together: the spectral data match 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B). The molecular ion peaks fit, the IR shows both O-H and carbonyl, and the NMR shows the expected aromatic and COOH proton signals.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)** and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggest a molecular weight of approximately 156, with the M+2 peak indicating the presence of chlorine isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37). The **IR spectrum** shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, consistent with an -OH group, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The **¹H NMR** data includes a singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)**, likely corresponding to a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)**, indicative of a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This structure includes both an -OH and an aldehyde group. The IR would show a broad -OH peak and a carbonyl peak around 1720 cm⁻¹, which matches. However, the aromatic protons in this tri-substituted benzene ring would exhibit a more complex splitting pattern, inconsistent with the two doublets observed in the NMR. Additionally, the aldehyde proton typically appears around 9-10 ppm, not at 11.0 ppm. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. The IR spectrum aligns with the presence of both an -OH group (broad peak) and a carbonyl group (sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹). The ¹H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, consistent with the carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, corresponding to the aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring. The molecular weight of 156.5 matches the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156, and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 fits the expected chlorine isotope pattern. This option is consistent with all the spectral data.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   Phenyl chloroformate has the structure Cl-CO-O-Ph. While the molecular weight matches, the IR spectrum would typically show a carbonyl peak around 1740-1760 cm⁻¹ for an acid chloride, which is higher than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. Additionally, this structure lacks a proton at 11.0 ppm, as it does not contain a carboxylic acid or aldehyde group. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This structure features a meta-substituted benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. The aromatic protons in such a substitution pattern would exhibit a more complex splitting in the NMR, inconsistent with the two doublets observed. Therefore, this option is also unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peaks, IR absorption, and ¹H NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern explains the NMR splitting, the molecular weight aligns with the observed peaks, and the functional groups match the IR data.
