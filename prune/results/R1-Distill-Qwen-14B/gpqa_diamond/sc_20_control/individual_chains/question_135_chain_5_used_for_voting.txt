Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson particle. Hmm, let's see what I can remember from my studies. The question gives a Lagrangian term involving a bosonic field X interacting with fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to figure out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f̄(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Oh, right, I think that's a Yukawa-like interaction. The interaction term typically couples the boson X to a fermion and its Dirac adjoint. So X couples to fermions with some coupling strength λ.

The mass term for the boson is probably from the vacuum expectation value (v) of the scalar field, but maybe that's not directly relevant here. What matters is the mass of X, which is given as 6 GeV. The possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because the interaction is between X and fermions, so X can decay into pairs of fermions.

So the decay X → f f̄ is possible if the mass of X is greater than twice the mass of the fermion f. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, the mass of the parent must be at least twice the mass of each child (since energy and momentum must be conserved, each daughter must have at least rest mass energy).

So I need to list all fermions whose mass is less than or equal to half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

Let me recall the approximate masses:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV (0.002 GeV)
- Down quark (d): similar to u, maybe 3 MeV (0.003 GeV)
- Strange (s): around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV

Wait, so for each fermion, I need to check if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have m_f ≤ 3 GeV?

Looking at the list:

- e: 0.0005 → yes
- μ: 0.1 → yes
- τ: 1.78 → yes (since 1.78 <3)
- u: 0.002 → yes
- d: 0.003 → yes
- s: 0.1 → yes
- c: 1.5 → yes, because 1.5 <3
- b: 4.5 → 4.5*2=9 GeV, but X is 6 GeV. So 2m_b =9 GeV>6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because 6 <9. So b is out.

t is way too heavy, 173 GeV, so no.

So possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but the question is about the possible decay channels. So the boson X can decay into any of these fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So for each possible fermion, can X decay into that pair?

But wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian is important. The term is λf f̄ (v + X) ψf. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, the term is written as L(y) = -λf f̄(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe the actual form is more like ψf is the Dirac spinor, and the interaction term is something like X ψf ψf̄. Oh, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling, so X couples to the fermion ψf.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is X ψf ψf̄, which would mean that X can decay into ψf and ψf̄, i.e., into a pair of fermions of type f.

But wait, in the Lagrangian, the term is -λf f̄ (v + X) ψf. Wait, that's a bit confusing notation. Maybe it's L = -λ ψ_f^\dagger (v + X) ψ_f. That would make sense because in Yukawa interactions, the coupling is something like g ψ ψ X or g ψ^\dagger ψ X, but wait, no, the Yukawa term is usually something like g ψ^\dagger X ψ, which is like a mass term when X is a scalar. So perhaps the interaction is between X and ψ_f.

So in that case, the X can decay into any fermion pair ψ_f and ψ_f̄, but only if the mass allows.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the interaction is given as -λ f f̄ (v + X) ψ_f. Oh, maybe the f is a flavor index or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the term is actually ψ_f^\dagger (v + X) ψ_f. So the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f̄.

Assuming that, the X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion's mass is less than half the X mass.

So the fermions with mass less than 3 GeV are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, e+e−.

Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV; 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b is not allowed. So option A includes b, which is impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

So c is 1.5 GeV → 2*1.5=3 ≤6 → allowed. So this option includes c, which is allowed. But wait, does it include charm quarks? Because yes, 1.5 GeV is allowed.

But wait, the X is a boson. So it can decay into quark-antiquark pairs as well as charged leptons. So, for example, c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

So B includes c, which is allowed. So possible.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

But wait, t is top quark, mass about 173 GeV. So 2m_t is 346 GeV, way larger than 6 GeV. So decay into t and t̄ is impossible. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

But again, B is 4.5 GeV, so decay into b b̄ is not allowed because 2m_b =9>6. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option should include c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

Looking back, that's option B.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other considerations? Like, for example, can X decay into a pair of top quarks? No, because 2m_t is way above 6 GeV. So that's not possible.

Wait, but let's think about the decay into taus. Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is approximately 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into τ+τ−.

So option B has all the allowed fermions except for the bottom quark and top quark.

Wait, another thing: the fermions include quarks, which are colored, but the boson X is a boson which is presumably color-neutral, like a photon or Z boson. Wait, no, X is a bosonic field. So if X is a color-charged boson, like a gluon, then it could couple to quarks, but in this case, the Lagrangian is written as having X interact with ψf, which is a Dirac spinor. But in the case of a color-charged boson, the interaction would be different—it would involve the gluon field strength tensor or something, but the problem gives a simple Yukawa interaction, so maybe X is a color-neutral boson, like a photon or Z or Higgs. So in that case, the decay products would include both quarks and leptons.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the interaction is with ψf, so that would include all fermions, including quarks and leptons.

So the possible decay channels are all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV. So that includes electrons, muons, taus, up, down, strange, and charm quarks. So the allowed decays are into any of these pairs.

So the options that include all of these except the bottom and top quarks would be option B. Because option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, option B is: X→ c c̄,s s̄,u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, that matches. So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) if the mass of \( X \) is at least twice the mass of the fermion (\( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraint**: For a fermion \( f \) to be a decay product of \( X \), its mass must satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - Up quark (\( u \)): \( 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - Down quark (\( d \)): \( 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed)
   - Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed)

3. **Allowed Decay Channels**: Based on the mass constraint, \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
   - \( e^+ e^- \)
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
   - \( u \bar{u} \)
   - \( d \bar{d} \)
   - \( s \bar{s} \)
   - \( c \bar{c} \)

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
