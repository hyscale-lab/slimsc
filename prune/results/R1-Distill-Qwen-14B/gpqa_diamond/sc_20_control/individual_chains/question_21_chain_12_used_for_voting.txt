Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It mentions two compounds, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and asks which one doesn't show tautomerism. Then, among two other compounds—methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate—it asks which shows optical isomerism.

Hmm, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I'll take it slow.

First, part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different structures but without changing the molecular formula. Examples I remember are enols and keto forms, like in ketones and aldehydes, where they can tautomerize between these forms. But wait, tautomerism usually occurs in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups or something like that.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho. Let me visualize it. For example, para-benzoquinone has two keto groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Does this lead to tautomerism? Hmm, maybe not, because the keto groups are on the ring, and the structure is more rigid. Or wait, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism if there are adjacent groups that can shift, but I'm not sure.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. So, positions 1,3,5 all have ketone groups. Now, can this compound tautomerize? Well, each ketone group is on the ring, spaced apart. Wait, but a cyclohexane ring with three ketones—maybe each can tautomerize? Or perhaps the trione structure is such that each keto group is separated by a CH2 group. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, so 1,3,5 would be every other carbon, so all three carbonyls are opposite each other. Hmm, in such a case, would tautomerism be possible? Because for tautomerism, you typically need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. But if all the carbonyls are on every other carbon, maybe each one doesn't have a neighboring H to shift? Or perhaps the positions are such that tautomerism isn't possible because the necessary H's aren't present.

Wait, wait, for a compound to have tautomerism, it needs to have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl that can shift. So, for example, in a diketone like cyclohexanedione, if adjacent to the carbonyl, there's a hydrogen that can move, causing the structure to shift. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls on a benzene ring. But in the case of para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at the para positions, so maybe the adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens that can shift. Or perhaps they do? Wait, benzene is a ring with alternating double bonds. So in para-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other. The structure might have two adjacent carbonyls, but maybe not. Let me think: benzene has six carbons. If two are O's in the para positions, then between each O is a CH. So each O is on a carbon that is connected to two CH groups. So each O is at position 1 and 4, perhaps. So each of those carbons is connected to two CH groups. So each O is adjacent to CH groups. So, maybe hydrogen can shift from the CH next to the O, but wait, in this case, the adjacent carbon has a hydrogen attached. So, could that lead to tautomerism?

Wait, if a hydrogen from the adjacent CH2 (if it's a CH2) can shift to the carbonyl, but in the case of benzoquinone, the ring is fully conjugated. Oh wait, the quinone structure is typically a conjugated di-ketone. So, the structure is like O=C6H4=C=O, but in a conjugated setup. So each carbonyl is part of a conjugated system. But for tautomerism, the adjacent carbon would need to have a hydrogen. Let me think: the structure of para-benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, but that's an oversimplification. Actually, it's a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other, and the other four carbons are each connected to another carbon, maybe as single bonds. Wait, no, the ring is fully conjugated, so each position alternates between double bonds and single bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should look for whether the compounds can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Keto-enol tautomerism occurs when there's a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. So, in the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. So, the carbonyl is part of the aromatic ring. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are part of the ring, which are sp² hybridized. Thus, those adjacent carbons are each bonded to two other ring carbons and a hydrogen. So, each has a hydrogen. So, could that lead to tautomerism? Because the H is attached to an sp² carbon adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but in the case of a benzene ring, the carbonyl groups are part of the conjugated system. So, maybe the structure is rigid and doesn't allow for tautomerism because the H's are in positions that are already fixed by the aromatic system. Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not certain.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: this is a cyclohexane ring with three keto groups at positions 1,3,5. So, each of those carbons has a carbonyl group. The other three carbons (positions 2,4,6) are CH2 groups. So each of the carbonyl carbons is connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyls is at every other position, so each is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, the carbons next to the carbonyls are CH2, which have hydrogens. So, perhaps the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to carbonyl) have H's.

Wait, for keto-enol tautomerism, you need at least one H attached to the alpha carbon. So, in this case, each of the three carbonyls has two alpha carbons (from CH2 groups) adjacent to it. So, each of those has two H's. So, perhaps this compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, in a six-membered ring with three keto groups, maybe the structure is such that the ring is too strained for tautomerism to occur. Or perhaps the ring is in a chair conformation, and the necessary H's are in positions that make tautomerism possible or not.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a symmetrical molecule. All three keto groups are equivalent. So, perhaps the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the necessary H's are not present, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is flat, like a boat or something else, that might not allow for tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone is more rigid and cannot tautomerize, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, let me think about the possibility of each compound undergoing tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: In the para form, each carbonyl is across from each other. So the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. The H's are attached to sp² hybridized carbons. So, the alpha position is part of the aromatic system. So, could these H's shift? I'm not sure. I think that in aromatic systems, the conjugation makes tautomerism less likely, but maybe it's possible.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each of the carbonyl groups is adjacent to CH2 groups. So each has two H's attached to the adjacent carbons. So, in theory, each of those H's could shift to the carbonyl, but that would require breaking the ring structure. Wait, but if the ring is chair-like, perhaps the H's are axial or equatorial. But if the ring is rigid, maybe the H's are in positions that prevent tautomerism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the question from another angle. The question is about which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism.

I remember that tautomerism is common in diketones or ketones with adjacent carbonyl groups. For example, 1,3-diketones can tautomerize because the H's on the middle carbon can shift. But in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. So, each is at positions 1,3,5. So, the carbonyls are not adjacent. Wait, but each is adjacent to two CH2 groups. So, maybe each CH2 can have H's that can shift to the carbonyl. So, perhaps each of the three carbonyls can tautomerize. But wait, would that require all three to shift at the same time? Or maybe the tautomerism is possible for each individually.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is more rigid and doesn't allow for tautomerism because of the ring structure. Or perhaps the molecule is too stable in its current form to undergo tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, on the other hand, has two carbonyl groups in a conjugated system. I think that para-benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism because the structure is already conjugated and the necessary H's are in positions that don't allow for keto-enol tautomerism. Or perhaps it does. Wait, another thought: if a molecule has a conjugated di-ketone structure, like quinones, they often have enol forms. So, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the possibility of each compound having tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: If it has two carbonyl groups on the benzene ring, each adjacent to a CH group (since the ring is conjugated), so each CH has a hydrogen. The tautomer would involve moving a hydrogen from the CH to the carbonyl, but that would form an enol form. But wait, in aromatic compounds, enols are usually less stable because the ring's aromaticity is disrupted. So, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the enol form would be less stable and the keto form is more stable.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each alpha carbon (adjacent to the carbonyl) is CH2, so two H's. These can shift to the carbonyl, leading to enol forms. But wait, in a six-membered ring with three ketones, each enol would involve moving a hydrogen from a CH2 to the carbonyl, but that might not be possible because each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe each of the CH2 groups can lose a hydrogen. But wait, if you lose a hydrogen, the carbonyl would form a double bond with the adjacent carbon, but that carbon already has another substituent (like another CH2 group). Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot tautomerize because the positions are such that the necessary H's aren't available. Or maybe it can. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: which of these two compounds is more likely to undergo tautomerism?

Benzoquinone is a conjugated diketone. I think that conjugated diketones can tautomerize. For example, 1,3-diketones can form enols. So, benzoquinone may have the possibility for tautomerism. But wait, in the case of quinones, the enol form is less stable because the conjugation is lost. So, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because the enol form is not favorable.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each separated by a CH2. So, the structure is a trimethylene trione. I think that such structures can tautomerize. For example, 1,3,5-tricyanobenzenes may have certain properties, but I'm not sure about this compound.

Wait, maybe the key is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a more rigid structure, making tautomerism difficult because the necessary H's are in positions that can't shift without breaking the ring. Alternatively, if the ring is flexible, tautomerism is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't tautomerize because all the alpha positions are already occupied, but that doesn't make sense because the alpha positions are CH2, so they have H's.

I'm not making much progress on part A. Let me think about part B, maybe that'll help.

Part B: Which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism?

The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, or a plane of symmetry that allows for enantiomers.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Let's write it out: the propanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is -COOCH3, so the acid is CH2CH(OH)COOH, and the ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no: propanoate would be CH2CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? Or CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, wait.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which isn't correct. Wait, correct structure: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: position 2 is the middle carbon.

Wait, so the structure would be:

Carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the first carbon, then a CH(OH) group, then a methyl group. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. No, wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the carbon chain is three carbons, with the hydroxyl on C2.

Wait, no. Let me number the propanoic acid. The carboxylic acid is on carbon 1. Then, carbon 2 is the middle, and carbon 3 is the methyl end. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have a hydroxyl on carbon 2: so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that would make the structure: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. So, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is a CH2 group. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

When esterified with methanol, the -OH of the carboxylic acid becomes OMe. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is a CH2 group. So, the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: connected to OH and two CH2 groups. Wait, no: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 would have:

Carbon 1: methyl (from COOCH3).

Wait, maybe I should write the structure better. The molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: propanoate is CH3CH2COO- or CH2CH2COO-. No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, propanoate should be CH2CH2COO-? No, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. But if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is: the central carbon (C2) is attached to OH, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. Let's see:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is -CH2-, but wait, no: wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: -CH2-OH

Carbon 2: -CH2-

Carbon 3: -COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, maybe it's a three-carbon chain.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O

|

O=C-OCH3

|

CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the hydroxyl is on the central carbon, which is connected to a methyl group, a COOCH3 group, and another CH3? No, wait.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of whether the molecule has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon attached to four different groups.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

The central carbon (C2) has:

- One OH group,

- One CH3 group (from the neighboring carbon),

- One COOCH3 group,

- And one CH2 group connected to another CH3? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: let's draw the structure.

Structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: 

CH3-CHOH-COOH.

So, the three carbons are:

1: COOH group,

2: CH(OH),

3: CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the -COOH on carbon 1, a hydroxyl on carbon 2, and a methyl group on carbon 3.

So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH3CH(OH)COOH.

Wait, wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me number the carbons properly.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but more accurately, it's CH3CH2COOH. So, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOH,

Carbon 2: CH2,

Carbon 3: CH3.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain with hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH.

When esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is a CH2 group, but wait: attached to the C2 is a hydroxyl (OH), a CH2 group (from C1), and a COOCH3 group (from C3). So, the C2 is bonded to:

- OH,

- Two CH2 groups (since C2 is CH2, but wait, no, in the structure CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, the C2 is attached to:

- C1 (CH2-OH),

- C3 (CH2-COOCH3),

and two H's.

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2-OH),

- The third carbon (CH2-COOCH3),

and two hydrogens.

So, the second carbon is CH2, which has two H's, a CH2 group (on one side), and another CH2 connected to COOCH3 on the other. Wait, that makes it a central CH2 group attached to two CH2's and an OH and another CH2.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me think again. Maybe it's better to imagine the structure as:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, that would make the hydroxyl on the first carbon of the propanoate. But that's 1-hydroxypropanoate, not 2. So, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me write it correctly. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2? No, perhaps it's attached to three different groups. Wait, each carbon in a chain is connected to the next. So, the structure is:

CH3 - CH(OH) - COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a single bond to the adjacent carbon (C3, which is part of the COOCH3 group).

Wait, but in that case, the C2 would have four substituents:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a single bond to C1 (which is CH3).

Wait, that can't be right because C2 would have four groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon (C3). Wait, no: in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the C2 is connected to:

- C1: CH3,

- OH,

- C3: COOCH3,

- and another C, which is part of the COOCH3 group. Hmm, I'm getting myself confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just consider whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (C2) is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. So, the substituents on C2 are:

1. CH3 (from C1),

2. OH,

3. COOCH3 (from C3),

4. And the other side is a CH2 connected to COOCH3? No, perhaps not.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So:

C1: CH3,

C2: CH(OH),

C3: COOCH3.

So, the C2 (central) is connected to:

- C1: CH3,

- C3: COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

HO-CH2-CO-O-CH3.

But that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate, not 2. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (C2) is CH2, connected to:

- C1: CH2OH,

- C3: CH2COOCH3,

and two H's.

So, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- H,

- H.

Thus, C2 has two H's, so it's not a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it cannot show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the C2 has:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from C3).

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. If the central carbon has two identical groups, then it's not a chiral center.

Wait, maybe the structure is symmetric. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3, COOCH3, and two more CH's? Or perhaps the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. In this case, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3 (from C1)?

Wait, no. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the C2 has:

- CH3 (from C1),

- COOCH3 (from C3),

- OH,

- and another CH3 (from C1 again)?

No, that can't be right because C2 can't have two CH3 groups. So, perhaps the structure is:

HO-CH2-COOCH2CH3.

Wait, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate. I'm getting really confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate: Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with two double bonds. Its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, more precisely, it's O

           ||
O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O=C-OCH3 ?

No, wait, fumarate is the trans form of maleic acid. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the double bond between the two central carbons. So, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which upon esterification becomes (OCH3)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, dimethyl fumarate has the structure O

           ||
O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O=C-OCH3 ?

No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when converted to dimethyl ester, each -OH of the carboxylic acid becomes OCH3. So, the structure is:

O

||

O=C-OCH3 - CH=CH - C(O)OCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is O

           ||
O=C-OCH2-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

Wait, no, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

Wait, that's correct. So, dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond between two carbons, each attached to a carbonyl group which is esterified with OCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see: the structure is symmetrical if we look across the double bond. The two ends are mirror images. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it meso.

Wait, but in this case, the two carbonyl groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, each with OCH3. So, the structure is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral. Wait, but wait, in the case of fumarate, the ester would have the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond, making it a trans configuration.

Wait, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So, its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two -COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, when esterified, the two OCH3 groups are on opposite sides.

But wait, when you have a molecule with a double bond and substituents on each end, whether it's cis or trans can affect the possibility of optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, it can't have optical isomers. For example, if it's a meso compound.

Wait, consider this: if the two substituents on each end of the double bond are mirror images, then the molecule could be achiral. Let me imagine the structure: O=C-OCH3 on one end, and O=C-OCH3 on the other, connected by a double bond. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-O=C-OCH3? No, that's not correct because fumarate has a double bond.

Ah, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond. So, the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH=CH-CH2-O=C-OCH3. No, that's not correct. Wait, no, the correct structure is O

           ||
O=C-OCH3 - CH=CH - C(O)OCH3.

Wait, that's not possible. Let me think again. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would have the OCH3 groups on each COO. So, the structure is O

           ||
O=C-OCH3 - CH=CH - C(O)OCH3.

Wait, but that would make the two ester groups on opposite ends of the double bond. So, the structure is symmetrical across the double bond. Thus, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I thought that if a molecule has a double bond and substituents on each end that are the same, it might not be chiral. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents on each end are identical, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (O=C-OCH3 groups), so the molecule is symmetrical and therefore achiral. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

But wait, another thought: if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule can't be chiral because any chiral center would have a mirror image. So, it would be a meso compound and thus not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, and dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then neither would show optical isomerism. But the question says one of them does. Hmm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, another approach: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure again.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3 (from C1) or something else?

Wait, no. In CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from C3),

- and another CH group connected to where?

Wait, perhaps the structure is C1: CH3,

C2: CH(OH),

C3: COOCH3.

So, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from C3),

- and a single bond to C3.

Wait, that can't be. I'm getting really stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's structure is such that the central carbon (C2) has four different substituents. Let me count:

- One substituent is CH3,

- Another is OH,

- Another is COOCH3,

- And the fourth is CH2- (from C3? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (C2) is attached to four different groups, then it's a chiral center.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the C2 is connected to:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. CH2CH3? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the groups attached to C2. If the groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group, then it would have four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the C2 is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from C3, which is connected to COOCH3).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because C3 is part of the COOCH3 group. So, perhaps the C2 is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (from C1). No, that's not correct either.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because the groups on the central carbon are not all different. For example, if two substituents are the same, then it's not a chiral center.

Wait, if the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group, then all four substituents are different. So, the central carbon would be a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

But I'm not confident about this. Another approach: looking for whether the compound can have stereoisomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: If it has a chiral center, it can show optical isomerism. Let me think about the structure again.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Central carbon (C2): attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent carbon, which is part of the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. The adjacent carbon is C3, which is part of the COOCH3 group. So, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a single bond to C3. Wait, but C3 is connected to COOCH3. So, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps this is getting me nowhere. Let me try to imagine the molecule.

Imagine the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- Left: CH3,

- Top: OH,

- Right: COOCH3,

- Back: CH2?

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate.

As I thought earlier, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound because it's symmetrical across the double bond. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, it would show optical isomerism, but if not, then perhaps neither does. But since the question says one of them does, I must be missing something.

Wait, another thought: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is actually the same as methyl 2-hydroxy-2-propanoate. Wait, no, 2-propanoate would be the same as propanoate, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another H.

Wait, but a carbon can't have four substituents if one is a hydrogen.

Wait, let me reconsider. Perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the C2 is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3?

No, that would make two CH3 groups attached to C2, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Let me look for another approach. Maybe the correct answer for part B is dimethyl fumarate showing optical isomerism.

Wait, no, because earlier I thought it's a meso compound. So, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, and dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. But I thought dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

Wait, wait, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that can't be right because fumarate has a double bond.

Ah, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

So, the structure is:

O

||

O=C-OCH3 - CH=CH - C(O)OCH3

Looking at this, the two ester groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So, it's a meso compound and thus achiral. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it's a meso compound and not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Then, which of the two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism? It must be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But earlier, I thought it didn't have a chiral center. So, perhaps I was wrong about that.

Wait, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon has:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3 attached via a single bond.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon is CH2, with substituents CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. Thus, no chiral center.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another thought: for a molecule to have a chiral center, it must have four different substituents. So, let's go back to methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from C3).

Wait, but what's the fourth substituent? C3 is connected to COOCH3, so how is it attached?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that C2 is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3 group. No, that would make two CH3 groups, so not all different.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the central carbon (C2) is CH2, connected to:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

Thus, no chiral center.

Wait, but then how does part B have a compound that shows optical isomerism? The options are either methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate.

If neither has a chiral center, then the answer would be that neither shows optical isomerism, but the question says one of them does.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about which of these two compounds has a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center. Let me imagine the structure again: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group connected to C3. But C3 is part of the COOCH3 group, so perhaps that's a different substituent.

Wait, no, the substituents would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group (if C2 is connected to C3, which is CH2COOCH3).

No, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Since I'm not making progress on part B, perhaps I should go back to part A.

Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

If benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because the necessary H's are not present, then A would be benzoquinone.

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might not tautomerize if the structure is too rigid. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: tautomerism can also be known as keto-enol tautomerism. For that to occur, the compound must have at least one alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group).

Benzoquinone has two alpha hydrogens on each of the two carbonyl groups. So, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, each with two alpha hydrogens. So, it can tautomerize as well.

Wait, but if the structure is rigid, maybe tautomerism isn't possible or is not observed. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the necessary H's are not in a position that allows for enol formation.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe both compounds can tautomerize, but the question states that one doesn't. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: benzoquinone is a fully conjugated di-ketone, which may not allow for tautomerism because the enol form would disrupt the conjugation. So, it's more stable in the keto form, hence no tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, isn't conjugated, so tautomerism is possible. So, perhaps the correct answer is that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism (A = benzoquinone), and for part B, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so the correct answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, no, earlier I thought dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration. So, the molecule is not symmetrical because the substituents on each end are the same. Wait, no, because the substituents on each end are OCH3 groups. So, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

So, the options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

If A is benzoquinone (which doesn't tautomerize), and B is dimethyl fumarate (which doesn't show optical isomerism), then none of the options fit. Because in the options, if A is benzoquinone, then B must be one of the other two.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part A. Maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism because the molecule is symmetric and doesn't allow for enol formation. Or perhaps benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because the structure is too rigid.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because all the alpha positions are adjacent to other ketones, making it impossible to form enol tautomers.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think of the options again.

If I assume that the correct answer for part A is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, then A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Then, part B would have to be which option.

Looking back, the options are:

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

Option A: A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

But I thought dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so for part B, the correct answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate if it has a chiral center.

Alternatively, if I'm wrong and dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism, then option D would be correct.

But I'm not confident.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is D: A = benzoquinone (doesn't tautomerize), B = dimethyl fumarate (doesn't show optical isomerism). But that leaves me with neither part showing the required properties, which contradicts the question.

Alternatively, perhaps part A's correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't tautomerize, and part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, option A has A as cyclohexane..., B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, if both A and B are correct for option A, then that would be the answer.

But I'm not confident, but given the time I've spent, I'll proceed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options. Here's the analysis:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, resulting in different structural forms (e.g., keto-enol tautomerism). The two compounds in question are **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

1. **Benzoquinone**: This is a conjugated diketone with two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are sp² hybridized and part of the aromatic system. Tautomerism typically requires an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group) to shift, but the rigid aromatic structure of benzoquinone makes tautomerism unlikely. The enol form would disrupt the conjugation, making it less stable. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each carbonyl group is adjacent to CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens can shift to form enol tautomers, making tautomerism possible. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry that allows for enantiomers. The two compounds in question are **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is attached to:
   - CH₃,
   - OH,
   - COOCH₃,
   - and another CH group (from C3).
   This central carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism**.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is (CH₃O)₂C=CHC(=O)OCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the identical substituents (OCH₃ groups) on either side of the double bond. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer:
- **A**: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- **B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B

Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It mentions two compounds, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and asks which one doesn't show tautomerism. Then, among two other compounds—methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate—it asks which shows optical isomerism.

Hmm, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I'll take it slow.

First, part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different structures but without changing the molecular formula. Examples I remember are enols and keto forms, like in ketones and aldehydes, where they can tautomerize between these forms. But wait, tautomerism usually occurs in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups or something like that.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho. Let me visualize it. For example, para-benzoquinone has two keto groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Does this lead to tautomerism? Hmm, maybe not, because the keto groups are on the ring, and the structure is more rigid. Or wait, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism if there are adjacent groups that can shift, but I'm not sure.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. So, positions 1,3,5 all have ketone groups. Now, can this compound tautomerize? Well, each ketone group is on the ring, spaced apart. Wait, but a cyclohexane ring with three ketones—maybe each can tautomerize? Or perhaps the trione structure is such that each keto group is separated by a CH2 group. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, so 1,3,5 would be every other carbon, so all three carbonyls are opposite each other. Hmm, in such a case, would tautomerism be possible? Because for tautomerism, you typically need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. But if all the carbonyls are on every other carbon, maybe each one doesn't have a neighboring H to shift? Or perhaps the positions are such that tautomerism isn't possible because the necessary H's aren't present.

Wait, wait, for a compound to have tautomerism, it needs to have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl that can shift. So, for example, in a diketone like cyclohexanedione, if adjacent to the carbonyl, there's a hydrogen that can move, causing the structure to shift. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls on a benzene ring. But in the case of para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at the para positions, so maybe the adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens that can shift. Or perhaps they do? Wait, benzene is a ring with alternating double bonds. So in para-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other. The structure might have two adjacent carbonyls, but maybe not. Let me think: benzene has six carbons. If two are O's in the para positions, then between each O is a CH. So each O is on a carbon that is connected to two CH groups. So each O is at position 1 and 4, perhaps. So each of those carbons is connected to two CH groups. So each O is adjacent to CH groups. So, maybe hydrogen can shift from the CH next to the O, but wait, in this case, the adjacent carbon has a hydrogen attached. So, could that lead to tautomerism?

Wait, if a hydrogen from the adjacent CH2 (if it's a CH2) can shift to the carbonyl, but in the case of benzoquinone, the ring is fully conjugated. Oh wait, the quinone structure is typically a conjugated di-ketone. So, the structure is like O=C6H4=C=O, but in a conjugated setup. So each carbonyl is part of a conjugated system. But for tautomerism, the adjacent carbon would need to have a hydrogen. Let me think: the structure of para-benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, but that's an oversimplification. Actually, it's a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other, and the other four carbons are each connected to another carbon, maybe as single bonds. Wait, no, the ring is fully conjugated, so each position alternates between double bonds and single bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should look for whether the compounds can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Keto-enol tautomerism occurs when there's a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. So, in the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. So, the carbonyl is part of the aromatic ring. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are part of the ring, which are sp² hybridized. Thus, those adjacent carbons are each bonded to two other ring carbons and a hydrogen. So, each has a hydrogen. So, could that lead to tautomerism? Because the H is attached to an sp² carbon adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but in the case of a benzene ring, the carbonyl groups are part of the conjugated system. So, maybe the structure is rigid and doesn't allow for tautomerism because the H's are in positions that are already fixed by the aromatic system. Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not certain.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: this is a cyclohexane ring with three keto groups at positions 1,3,5. So, each of those carbons has a carbonyl group. The other three carbons (positions 2,4,6) are CH2 groups. So each of the carbonyl carbons is connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyls is at every other position, so each is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, the carbons next to the carbonyls are CH2, which have hydrogens. So, perhaps the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to carbonyl) have H's.

Wait, for keto-enol tautomerism, you need at least one H attached to the alpha carbon. So, in this case, each of the three carbonyls has two alpha carbons (from CH2 groups) adjacent to it. So, each of those has two H's. So, perhaps this compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, in a six-membered ring with three keto groups, maybe the structure is such that the ring is too strained for tautomerism to occur. Or perhaps the ring is in a chair conformation, and the necessary H's are in positions that make tautomerism possible or not.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a symmetrical molecule. All three keto groups are equivalent. So, perhaps the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the necessary H's are not present, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is flat, like a boat or something else, that might not allow for tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone is more rigid and cannot tautomerize, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, let me think about the possibility of each compound undergoing tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: In the para form, each carbonyl is across from each other. So the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. The H's are attached to sp² hybridized carbons. So, the alpha position is part of the aromatic system. So, could these H's shift? I'm not sure. I think that in aromatic systems, the conjugation makes tautomerism less likely, but maybe it's possible.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each of the carbonyl groups is adjacent to CH2 groups. So each has two H's attached to the adjacent carbons. So, in theory, each of those H's could shift to the carbonyl, but that would require breaking the ring structure. Wait, but if the ring is chair-like, perhaps the H's are axial or equatorial. But if the ring is rigid, maybe the H's are in positions that prevent tautomerism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the question from another angle. The question is about which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism.

I remember that tautomerism is common in diketones or ketones with adjacent carbonyl groups. For example, 1,3-diketones can tautomerize because the H's on the middle carbon can shift. But in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. So, each is at positions 1,3,5. So, the carbonyls are not adjacent. Wait, but each is adjacent to two CH2 groups. So, maybe each CH2 can have H's that can shift to the carbonyl. So, perhaps each of the three carbonyls can tautomerize. But wait, would that require all three to shift at the same time? Or maybe the tautomerism is possible for each individually.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is more rigid and doesn't allow for tautomerism because of the ring structure. Or perhaps the molecule is too stable in its current form to undergo tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, on the other hand, has two carbonyl groups in a conjugated system. I think that para-benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism because the structure is already conjugated and the necessary H's are in positions that don't allow for keto-enol tautomerism. Or perhaps it does. Wait, another thought: if a molecule has a conjugated di-ketone structure, like quinones, they often have enol forms. So, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the possibility of each compound having tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: If it has two carbonyl groups on the benzene ring, each adjacent to a CH group (since the ring is conjugated), so each CH has a hydrogen. The tautomer would involve moving a hydrogen from the CH to the carbonyl, but that would form an enol form. But wait, in aromatic compounds, enols are usually less stable because the ring's aromaticity is disrupted. So, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the enol form would be less stable and the keto form is more stable.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each alpha carbon (adjacent to the carbonyl) is CH2, so two H's. These can shift to the carbonyl, leading to enol forms. But wait, in a six-membered ring with three ketones, each enol would involve moving a hydrogen from a CH2 to the carbonyl, but that might not be possible because each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe each of the CH2 groups can lose a hydrogen. But wait, if you lose a hydrogen, the carbonyl would form a double bond with the adjacent carbon, but that carbon already has another substituent (like another CH2 group). Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot tautomerize because the positions are such that the necessary H's aren't available. Or maybe it can. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: which of these two compounds is more likely to undergo tautomerism?

Benzoquinone is a conjugated diketone. I think that conjugated diketones can tautomerize. For example, 1,3-diketones can form enols. So, benzoquinone may have the possibility for tautomerism. But wait, in the case of quinones, the enol form is less stable because the conjugation is lost. So, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because the enol form is not favorable.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each separated by a CH2. So, the structure is a trimethylene trione. I think that such structures can tautomerize. For example, 1,3,5-tricyanobenzenes may have certain properties, but I'm not sure about this compound.

Wait, maybe the key is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a more rigid structure, making tautomerism difficult because the necessary H's are in positions that can't shift without breaking the ring. Alternatively, if the ring is flexible, tautomerism is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't tautomerize because all the alpha positions are already occupied, but that doesn't make sense because the alpha positions are CH2, so they have H's.

I'm not making much progress on part A. Let me think about part B, maybe that'll help.

Part B: Which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism?

The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, or a plane of symmetry that allows for enantiomers.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Let's write it out: the propanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is -COOCH3, so the acid is CH2CH(OH)COOH, and the ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no: propanoate would be CH2CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? Or CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, wait.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which isn't correct. Wait, correct structure: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: position 2 is the middle carbon.

Wait, so the structure would be:

Carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the first carbon, then a CH(OH) group, then a methyl group. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. No, wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the carbon chain is three carbons, with the hydroxyl on C2.

Wait, no. Let me number the propanoic acid. The carboxylic acid is on carbon 1. Then, carbon 2 is the middle, and carbon 3 is the methyl end. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have a hydroxyl on carbon 2: so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that would make the structure: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. So, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is a CH2 group. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

When esterified with methanol, the -OH of the carboxylic acid becomes OMe. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is a CH2 group. So, the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: connected to OH and two CH2 groups. Wait, no: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 would have:

Carbon 1: methyl (from COOCH3).

Wait, maybe I should write the structure better. The molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: propanoate is CH3CH2COO- or CH2CH2COO-. No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, propanoate should be CH2CH2COO-? No, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. But if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is: the central carbon (C2) is attached to OH, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. Let's see:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is -CH2-, but wait, no: wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: -CH2-OH

Carbon 2: -CH2-

Carbon 3: -COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, maybe it's a three-carbon chain.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O

|

O=C-OCH3

|

CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the hydroxyl is on the central carbon, which is connected to a methyl group, a COOCH3 group, and another CH3? No, wait.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of whether the molecule has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon attached to four different groups.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

The central carbon (C2) has:

- One OH group,

- One CH3 group (from the neighboring carbon),

- One COOCH3 group,

- And one CH2 group connected to another CH3? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: let's draw the structure.

Structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: 

CH3-CHOH-COOH.

So, the three carbons are:

1: COOH group,

2: CH(OH),

3: CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the -COOH on carbon 1, a hydroxyl on carbon 2, and a methyl group on carbon 3.

So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH3CH(OH)COOH.

Wait, wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me number the carbons properly.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but more accurately, it's CH3CH2COOH. So, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOH,

Carbon 2: CH2,

Carbon 3: CH3.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain with hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH.

When esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is a CH2 group, but wait: attached to the C2 is a hydroxyl (OH), a CH2 group (from C1), and a COOCH3 group (from C3). So, the C2 is bonded to:

- OH,

- Two CH2 groups (since C2 is CH2, but wait, no, in the structure CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, the C2 is attached to:

- C1 (CH2-OH),

- C3 (CH2-COOCH3),

and two H's.

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2-OH),

- The third carbon (CH2-COOCH3),

and two hydrogens.

So, the second carbon is CH2, which has two H's, a CH2 group (on one side), and another CH2 connected to COOCH3 on the other. Wait, that makes it a central CH2 group attached to two CH2's and an OH and another CH2.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me think again. Maybe it's better to imagine the structure as:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, that would make the hydroxyl on the first carbon of the propanoate. But that's 1-hydroxypropanoate, not 2. So, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me write it correctly. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2? No, perhaps it's attached to three different groups. Wait, each carbon in a chain is connected to the next. So, the structure is:

CH3 - CH(OH) - COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a single bond to the adjacent carbon (C3, which is part of the COOCH3 group).

Wait, but in that case, the C2 would have four substituents:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a single bond to C1 (which is CH3).

Wait, that can't be right because C2 would have four groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon (C3). Wait, no: in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the C2 is connected to:

- C1: CH3,

- OH,

- C3: COOCH3,

- and another C, which is part of the COOCH3 group. Hmm, I'm getting myself confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just consider whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (C2) is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. So, the substituents on C2 are:

1. CH3 (from C1),

2. OH,

3. COOCH3 (from C3),

4. And the other side is a CH2 connected to COOCH3? No, perhaps not.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So:

C1: CH3,

C2: CH(OH),

C3: COOCH3.

So, the C2 (central) is connected to:

- C1: CH3,

- C3: COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

HO-CH2-CO-O-CH3.

But that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate, not 2. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (C2) is CH2, connected to:

- C1: CH2OH,

- C3: CH2COOCH3,

and two H's.

So, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- H,

- H.

Thus, C2 has two H's, so it's not a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it cannot show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the C2 has:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from C3).

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. If the central carbon has two identical groups, then it's not a chiral center.

Wait, maybe the structure is symmetric. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3, COOCH3, and two more CH's? Or perhaps the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. In this case, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3 (from C1)?

Wait, no. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the C2 has:

- CH3 (from C1),

- COOCH3 (from C3),

- OH,

- and another CH3 (from C1 again)?

No, that can't be right because C2 can't have two CH3 groups. So, perhaps the structure is:

HO-CH2-COOCH2CH3.

Wait, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate. I'm getting really confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate: Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with two double bonds. Its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, more precisely, it's O

           ||
O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O=C-OCH3 ?

No, wait, fumarate is the trans form of maleic acid. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the double bond between the two central carbons. So, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which upon esterification becomes (OCH3)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, dimethyl fumarate has the structure O

           ||
O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O=C-OCH3 ?

No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when converted to dimethyl ester, each -OH of the carboxylic acid becomes OCH3. So, the structure is:

O

||

O=C-OCH3 - CH=CH - C(O)OCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is O

           ||
O=C-OCH2-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

Wait, no, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

Wait, that's correct. So, dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond between two carbons, each attached to a carbonyl group which is esterified with OCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see: the structure is symmetrical if we look across the double bond. The two ends are mirror images. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it meso.

Wait, but in this case, the two carbonyl groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, each with OCH3. So, the structure is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral. Wait, but wait, in the case of fumarate, the ester would have the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond, making it a trans configuration.

Wait, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So, its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two -COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, when esterified, the two OCH3 groups are on opposite sides.

But wait, when you have a molecule with a double bond and substituents on each end, whether it's cis or trans can affect the possibility of optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, it can't have optical isomers. For example, if it's a meso compound.

Wait, consider this: if the two substituents on each end of the double bond are mirror images, then the molecule could be achiral. Let me imagine the structure: O=C-OCH3 on one end, and O=C-OCH3 on the other, connected by a double bond. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-O=C-OCH3? No, that's not correct because fumarate has a double bond.

Ah, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond. So, the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH=CH-CH2-O=C-OCH3. No, that's not correct. Wait, no, the correct structure is O

           ||
O=C-OCH3 - CH=CH - C(O)OCH3.

Wait, that's not possible. Let me think again. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would have the OCH3 groups on each COO. So, the structure is O

           ||
O=C-OCH3 - CH=CH - C(O)OCH3.

Wait, but that would make the two ester groups on opposite ends of the double bond. So, the structure is symmetrical across the double bond. Thus, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I thought that if a molecule has a double bond and substituents on each end that are the same, it might not be chiral. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents on each end are identical, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (O=C-OCH3 groups), so the molecule is symmetrical and therefore achiral. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

But wait, another thought: if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule can't be chiral because any chiral center would have a mirror image. So, it would be a meso compound and thus not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, and dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then neither would show optical isomerism. But the question says one of them does. Hmm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, another approach: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure again.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3 (from C1) or something else?

Wait, no. In CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from C3),

- and another CH group connected to where?

Wait, perhaps the structure is C1: CH3,

C2: CH(OH),

C3: COOCH3.

So, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from C3),

- and a single bond to C3.

Wait, that can't be. I'm getting really stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's structure is such that the central carbon (C2) has four different substituents. Let me count:

- One substituent is CH3,

- Another is OH,

- Another is COOCH3,

- And the fourth is CH2- (from C3? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (C2) is attached to four different groups, then it's a chiral center.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the C2 is connected to:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. CH2CH3? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the groups attached to C2. If the groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group, then it would have four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the C2 is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from C3, which is connected to COOCH3).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because C3 is part of the COOCH3 group. So, perhaps the C2 is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (from C1). No, that's not correct either.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because the groups on the central carbon are not all different. For example, if two substituents are the same, then it's not a chiral center.

Wait, if the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group, then all four substituents are different. So, the central carbon would be a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

But I'm not confident about this. Another approach: looking for whether the compound can have stereoisomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: If it has a chiral center, it can show optical isomerism. Let me think about the structure again.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Central carbon (C2): attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent carbon, which is part of the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. The adjacent carbon is C3, which is part of the COOCH3 group. So, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a single bond to C3. Wait, but C3 is connected to COOCH3. So, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps this is getting me nowhere. Let me try to imagine the molecule.

Imagine the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- Left: CH3,

- Top: OH,

- Right: COOCH3,

- Back: CH2?

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate.

As I thought earlier, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound because it's symmetrical across the double bond. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, it would show optical isomerism, but if not, then perhaps neither does. But since the question says one of them does, I must be missing something.

Wait, another thought: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is actually the same as methyl 2-hydroxy-2-propanoate. Wait, no, 2-propanoate would be the same as propanoate, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another H.

Wait, but a carbon can't have four substituents if one is a hydrogen.

Wait, let me reconsider. Perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the C2 is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3?

No, that would make two CH3 groups attached to C2, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Let me look for another approach. Maybe the correct answer for part B is dimethyl fumarate showing optical isomerism.

Wait, no, because earlier I thought it's a meso compound. So, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, and dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. But I thought dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

Wait, wait, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that can't be right because fumarate has a double bond.

Ah, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

So, the structure is:

O

||

O=C-OCH3 - CH=CH - C(O)OCH3

Looking at this, the two ester groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So, it's a meso compound and thus achiral. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it's a meso compound and not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Then, which of the two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism? It must be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But earlier, I thought it didn't have a chiral center. So, perhaps I was wrong about that.

Wait, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon has:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3 attached via a single bond.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon is CH2, with substituents CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. Thus, no chiral center.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another thought: for a molecule to have a chiral center, it must have four different substituents. So, let's go back to methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from C3).

Wait, but what's the fourth substituent? C3 is connected to COOCH3, so how is it attached?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that C2 is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3 group. No, that would make two CH3 groups, so not all different.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the central carbon (C2) is CH2, connected to:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

Thus, no chiral center.

Wait, but then how does part B have a compound that shows optical isomerism? The options are either methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate.

If neither has a chiral center, then the answer would be that neither shows optical isomerism, but the question says one of them does.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about which of these two compounds has a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center. Let me imagine the structure again: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group connected to C3. But C3 is part of the COOCH3 group, so perhaps that's a different substituent.

Wait, no, the substituents would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group (if C2 is connected to C3, which is CH2COOCH3).

No, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Since I'm not making progress on part B, perhaps I should go back to part A.

Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

If benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because the necessary H's are not present, then A would be benzoquinone.

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might not tautomerize if the structure is too rigid. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: tautomerism can also be known as keto-enol tautomerism. For that to occur, the compound must have at least one alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group).

Benzoquinone has two alpha hydrogens on each of the two carbonyl groups. So, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, each with two alpha hydrogens. So, it can tautomerize as well.

Wait, but if the structure is rigid, maybe tautomerism isn't possible or is not observed. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the necessary H's are not in a position that allows for enol formation.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe both compounds can tautomerize, but the question states that one doesn't. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: benzoquinone is a fully conjugated di-ketone, which may not allow for tautomerism because the enol form would disrupt the conjugation. So, it's more stable in the keto form, hence no tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, isn't conjugated, so tautomerism is possible. So, perhaps the correct answer is that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism (A = benzoquinone), and for part B, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so the correct answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, no, earlier I thought dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration. So, the molecule is not symmetrical because the substituents on each end are the same. Wait, no, because the substituents on each end are OCH3 groups. So, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

So, the options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

If A is benzoquinone (which doesn't tautomerize), and B is dimethyl fumarate (which doesn't show optical isomerism), then none of the options fit. Because in the options, if A is benzoquinone, then B must be one of the other two.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part A. Maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism because the molecule is symmetric and doesn't allow for enol formation. Or perhaps benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because the structure is too rigid.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because all the alpha positions are adjacent to other ketones, making it impossible to form enol tautomers.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think of the options again.

If I assume that the correct answer for part A is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, then A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Then, part B would have to be which option.

Looking back, the options are:

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

Option A: A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

But I thought dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so for part B, the correct answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate if it has a chiral center.

Alternatively, if I'm wrong and dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism, then option D would be correct.

But I'm not confident.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is D: A = benzoquinone (doesn't tautomerize), B = dimethyl fumarate (doesn't show optical isomerism). But that leaves me with neither part showing the required properties, which contradicts the question.

Alternatively, perhaps part A's correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't tautomerize, and part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, option A has A as cyclohexane..., B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, if both A and B are correct for option A, then that would be the answer.

But I'm not confident, but given the time I've spent, I'll proceed.


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options. Here's the analysis:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, resulting in different structural forms (e.g., keto-enol tautomerism). The two compounds in question are **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

1. **Benzoquinone**: This is a conjugated diketone with two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are sp² hybridized and part of the aromatic system. Tautomerism typically requires an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group) to shift, but the rigid aromatic structure of benzoquinone makes tautomerism unlikely. The enol form would disrupt the conjugation, making it less stable. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each carbonyl group is adjacent to CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens can shift to form enol tautomers, making tautomerism possible. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry that allows for enantiomers. The two compounds in question are **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is attached to:
   - CH₃,
   - OH,
   - COOCH₃,
   - and another CH group (from C3).
   This central carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism**.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is (CH₃O)₂C=CHC(=O)OCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the identical substituents (OCH₃ groups) on either side of the double bond. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer:
- **A**: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- **B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B
