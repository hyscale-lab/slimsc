Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about IR and NMR spectroscopy. But I'll give it a shot. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which typically converts a bromoalkene into an alkene or maybe for dehydrohalogenation. Wait, actually, no—the Hunsdiecker reaction is for the elimination of a halogen from a vicinal dihalide to form an alkene. Oh wait, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another reaction: when an alkyl bromide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a type of elimination reaction. Oh right! It's the formation of alkenes via the dehydrohalogenation. So, if the compound has a good leaving group like a bromide adjacent to a hydrogen, the reaction would eliminate H and Br to form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction? No, red phosphorus and HI are more about elimination, perhaps the formation of alkenes through an E2 mechanism.

So the task is to figure out what Compound X is, and then determine the product after this reaction.

The data given are IR and 1H NMR. Let me look at the IR first.

IR peaks:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: That broad region usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The broadness suggests it's not a carboxylic acid, which usually shows a very strong, broad peak around 2500-3300. Wait, but 3400-2500 is a broader region. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkyne C-H stretch? No, alkynes have higher wavenumber stretches. Or maybe an amine? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an alcohol's O-H, but that's usually around 3300-3500, and maybe a broad peak. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is very strong, wide, around 2500-3300, but sometimes it's split into two, like a broad peak from 3000 to 2500. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me note that the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches.

So, the IR suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid), and aromatic rings. The 3400-2500 might be O-H, but not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's list them:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. This is a strong indication of an aldehyde proton (RCHO), which typically appears around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the chemical shift can vary. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Hmm, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10, and carboxylic acids around higher, like 10-12. Also, a broad singlet suggests exchange with water or something, more typical of a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's an aldehyde, why is the peak broad? Maybe because it's exchanging with something else, or maybe it's just a simple aldehyde.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets in the aromatic region. The integration suggests two protons each. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring, where the two protons on one set are deshielded (8.0 ppm) and the other two are more shielded (7.2 ppm). So it's a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two different substituents in the para positions? Wait, no. Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the two protons on each ortho and para positions would be equivalent, but if the substituents are different, then each set of two protons would be a doublet. Or perhaps the substituent is such that the ring is para-substituted, making the two doublets. So perhaps, the ring has two substituents in the para positions, but that doesn't fit with the integration. Wait, the integrations are 2H each. So that's four protons in total for the aromatic region. So perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, each substituent having two protons. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, each substituent is a single group, but the substitution leads to each set of two equivalent protons. For instance, if the substituent is at position 4, but that's the same as position 1. Wait, perhaps the benzene ring is para-substituted with something that causes the two sets of protons to split into doublets. For example, if the ring has two substituents, like a para-dimethyl group, but that would lead to a singlet.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent is a para-substituted group with an electrondonating group, making the adjacent protons more deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each causing the ring's protons to split into doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substituted ring with two substituents, but that might complicate the splitting. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of the possible structures.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, integrating to 1H. This could be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps attached to an aromatic ring. Maybe a CH in a side chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to 2H. Maybe part of a CH2 group next to a CH or something else.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to 3H. A methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH group. For example, in an isobutyl group, the CH would be split into a doublet by the adjacent CH2 or CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. That's a terminal CH3 group, probably attached to a CH2. Like an ethyl group's end.

Putting this together, perhaps we have a benzene ring with a substituent that has a chain leading to a terminal CH3. Let me try to imagine the structure.

So, from the NMR, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. So if the substituent is at position 4, then the substituent has a chain attached. The substituent itself could be an aldehyde group, but wait, the aldehyde proton is at 10.5. If the substituent is an aldehyde (RCHO), that would make sense, but the other NMR signals don't seem to fit. Alternatively, the substituent could be a ketone, but the aldehyde proton is at 10.5, which is more in line with an aldehyde.

Wait, but if the substituent is an aldehyde, then the benzene ring would have a CHO group attached. But what about the rest of the NMR data?

Looking at the NMR again, the aldehyde proton is broad and only 1H, so that fits. Then the rest of the signals are for a substituent attached to the benzene.

Looking at the signals after the aromatic ones:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH adjacent to something, perhaps an oxygen or another CH2.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, likely a CH2 group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): Could this be a methyl group attached to a CH, such as in an isobutyl group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl, which suggests an ethyl chain. So putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, with some branching.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let me think: an isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? Wait no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2—no, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, perhaps I should draw it mentally.

Wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-?

Wait, maybe I should think of the substituent as a chain attached to the benzene ring. So, benzene ring, then a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CHO? No, but the aldehyde is on the benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but then I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to imagine the structure based on the NMR.

Let me think: The substituent comes off the benzene ring as a chain. The benzene is para-substituted, so the substituent is at position 4.

The substituent has a CH2 group (from 1.7 ppm, 2H), a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), and then a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d, 3H). Also, a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H). Hmm, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but perhaps branching.

Wait, if the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group attached via a CH2. Wait, an isobutyl group is (CH2)CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps I should consider the substituent as a propyl chain with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which would correspond to the terminal CH3 of an ethyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group? No, that seems too long.

Wait, another approach. The NMR data suggests a chain structure. Let's sum up the integrations: 1H at 2.9, 2H at 1.7, 3H at 1.4 (d), 3H at 0.9 (t). So, if we consider that, perhaps the chain is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that would make an isobutyl group. Wait, let's see:

The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But in that case, the NMR would show the CH(CH3)2 group, which has a singlet for the CH, but in the data, the 1H at 2.9 is a multiplet. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH3. No, not matching the NMR.

Wait, maybe the chain is:

benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but let's think about the splitting. The 0.9 triplet would imply that the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So, if it's CH2CH2CH3, but that's ethyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group has a branch at the second carbon. So, structure would be benzene-CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH3). Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as a CH2-CH(CH(CH3)-CH2CH3). No, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl chain with a methyl branch.

Let me count the number of protons:

The 2.9 ppm (1H) probably corresponds to a CH group. The 1.7 (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 (3H, d) could be a methyl group attached to the CH. And the 0.9 (3H, t) would be the end of an ethyl group.

Wait, that would suggest a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's pentyl, but with a branching. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, no, that would be a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-methylpentyl group? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests it's a CH2CH2CH3 group attached to something else. So, maybe the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So that would be a butyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group, but perhaps I'm getting lost.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. So, the substituent is benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a methyl group. For example, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-something. No, then the 0.9 ppm would be the end of the propyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then, the NMR would show the CH group at 2.9 ppm, the CH2 next to it at 1.7, the CH(CH3) at 1.4 (as a doublet, but wait, CH(CH3) would have more than one neighboring group). Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a benzyl group with a side chain. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary carbon, like CH(CH3)CH2CH3. But then, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH3 attached to the CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group attached via a CH2. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then, the CH(CH3)2 would have a CH that is split into a multiplet, but the CH2 next to it would have a triplet.

Wait, but the NMR for 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. If it's CH2CH(CH3)2, then the CH2 would be next to the CH(CH3)2. So, the CH2 would be split into a triplet, perhaps, but in the data it's a multiplet. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So, benzene-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But then, the CH(CH3) would have neighboring CH2 groups. Let me think: the structure would be -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The CH(CH3) would have two CH2 groups attached? No, it's attached to the benzene and two CH2 groups. So the protons on CH(CH3) would be split into a triplet, maybe, by the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which is a multiplet. So maybe the CH is connected to two different groups, like a CH2 and another CH2 or a CH.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3 group. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. Then, the CH2 next to the benzene (at 1.7 ppm) would be split into a quartet or something else.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the IR data again. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1720 is a bit low for an aldehyde (which is around 1720, actually), or maybe an ester or a ketone. Wait, no, aldehydes are around 1700-1725. Esters are around 1730-1760. Carboxylic acids have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1680-1720, but their O-H stretch is very strong. So in the IR, the 3400–2500 might be a broad O-H, which would suggest a carboxylic acid.

But then, the NMR at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. That fits better with a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So if the compound has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached, then the substituent is a -COOH group.

But wait, the other NMR signals, which include a CH2 group, a CH, a doublet of CH3, and a triplet. So, the substituent would have a chain leading to the COOH group.

Wait, so the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent that's a chain leading to a carboxylic acid. So, benzene-COOH? No, because that would be a single substituent, but perhaps with a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a carboxylic acid at the end. So, benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH. But then, the NMR would show triplet for the CH2 next to the COOH, but the current data doesn't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a carboxylic acid at the end. So, benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is a benzyl group attached to a carboxylic acid. But that might not fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (4-ethyl)phenylpropanoic acid. Wait, that's one of the options, option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Let me think about that structure. So the structure would be propanoic acid with a substituent at the second carbon being a 4-ethylphenyl group.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be CH2-C6H4-CH2-COOH (where the ethyl is in the para position). But then, in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be as observed: two doublets, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H. That fits a para-substituted benzene ring.

So the substituent in this case is a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to the second carbon of propanoic acid.

But then, what would the NMR look like?

The propanoic acid would have a COOH proton at around 10.5 ppm (broad singlet), which matches the data. The aromatic protons would split into two doublets because of the para substitution. The ethyl group (from the 4-ethylphenyl) would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH2CH3), and the CH2 next to it would be a quartet, but in the given data, there's a 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Wait, the substituent is 4-ethylphenyl, so the ethyl is on the benzene ring. So, in that case, the CH2CH3 group would be on the benzene. But in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) suggests a CH2 somewhere else, not on the benzene.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right structure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the substituent on the benzene ring has a chain that includes a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a propyl chain that ends with a ketone. But the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone.

Wait, but then the aldehyde proton wouldn't be present. So maybe the substituent is a ketone. But the 10.5 ppm peak is more like an aldehyde or carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the IR's 1720 is an ester. But then, the NMR wouldn't have a proton at 10.5. Unless it's a different group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzophenone structure, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

I think I'm spinning my wheels here. Let me try to look at the options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so the options are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings with alkyl groups.

So, the problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a bromide, say, then the reaction would eliminate H and Br to form a double bond. But if X is a tosylate or another leaving group, similar.

Wait, but looking at the options, all the options except for A and C are substituted benzene rings without any functional groups. So perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction forming an alkene.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I think that's the Hunsdiecker reaction. Wait, no, the Hunsdiecker reaction is when a vicinal dihalide (two halogens on adjacent carbons) reacts with red phosphorus to eliminate and form an alkene.

Alternatively, if the compound is an alkyl bromide, perhaps it's undergoing an elimination reaction when treated with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, another reaction: when an alkyl bromide is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can lead to the formation of an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. So, if the starting material is a bromide, the product would be an alkene.

Wait, but then the product options don't have alkenes. Looking at the options, options A and C are benzoic acids, which suggests that the reaction might not be elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the reaction wrong. Red phosphorus and HI could also be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I don't see any nitriles in the options.

Alternatively, another reaction is the substitution of an alkyl halide with HI, leading to an alkyl iodide, but that doesn't seem to change the functional group.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: if the compound is a bromoalkane, then red phosphorus and HI would dehydrohalogenate to form an alkene. So, the product would have a double bond.

But the options don't have alkenes. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. For example, if Compound X is an ester, then hydrolysis with acid or base would yield a carboxylic acid. But the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) don't seem to fit ester hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a tosyl group, but I don't have data about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but that's usually for amines.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one would be formed from the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X were a 4-(sec-butyl) benzyl bromide, then treating with HI and red phosphorus might substitute the bromide with an iodide, but that’s not elimination. Alternatively, if X is a bromide adjacent to a hydrogen, elimination would form a double bond.

Alternatively, if X is a benzyl bromide with a substituent that allows elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: if X is an alkyl bromide attached to a benzene ring, such as benzyl bromide, then treatment with red phosphorus and HI would lead to elimination, forming an alkene. But in that case, the product would be a styrene-type compound, but the options don't show that.

Wait, the given options don't have alkenes. So perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, let me think again about the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is likely the aldehyde proton. So perhaps the substituent is an aldehyde.

Wait, if X is an aldehyde attached to a benzene ring, then after treatment with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps nothing happens, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a bromide adjacent to the aldehyde, making it possible for elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzal bromide, like benzaldehyde with a bromide in the side chain.

Wait, looking at the NMR again, the 1H at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group between the benzene and the aldehyde. So the structure might be benzene-CH2-CHO. But then, the IR would show a carbonyl (the aldehyde) at around 1720 cm-1. The NMR would have a triplet for the CH2 next to the aldehyde, but in the data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH(CH2CHO)-something, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propanal group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a propyl chain ending in a bromide. But I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider the options.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would be a benzene ring with a substituent at position 4, which is a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but the NMR data for the aromatic region is two doublets, which would be the case for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has a single substituent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the structure of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6, which would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5, which would also be equivalent. So the aromatic region would show two doublets: one for the protons ortho to the substituents and one for the para.

Wait, but in that case, the aromatic protons would be a pair of doublets. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the given data. So perhaps this is the structure.

Then, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2-?

Wait, no. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-?

Wait, no. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the IUPAC name for a sec-butyl group is but-2-yl. The structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, perhaps I should think of it as a four-carbon chain with the substituent on the second carbon.

So, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

- The main chain is four carbons (butane), but the substituent is on the second carbon.

So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, maybe I should think of the substituent as a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group with branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. No, that's iso-butyl.

Wait, maybe it's a tert-butyl group? No, that's (CH3)3C-.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think about the NMR data for a sec-butyl group.

In a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the protons on the CH would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2. The CH2 would be split into a quartet by the CH and the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), so perhaps that's the CH group. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), which could be the CH2 groups next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to the CH. So, the substituent would have a CH(CH3) group, which fits with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group. Or wait, perhaps it's a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

No, that's four carbons, so a butyl group. Wait, but that's iso-butyl group.

Wait, the structure of iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. So, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene ring.

But then, the NMR would show the CH(CH3) as a triplet, perhaps, but in the data, it's a multiplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The substituent is a carboxylic acid, so the NMR would have a broad peak at around 10 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm peak. The aromatic protons would be in two sets, each a doublet, which matches the data.

The substituent (sec-butyl group) would have the following NMR signals: the CH(CH3) group would have a triplet at around 1.4 ppm (if it's attached to a CH2), but wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck again. Let me think about the options and see which one fits the NMR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Structure: benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct. Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group with branching on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) (at 1.4 ppm, d, 3H) would be a doublet because it's attached to a CH2.

- The CH2 groups would show up as triplets or multiplets.

Wait, in the substituent:

The CH2 next to the benzene (let's say it's position 1) would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

The CH2 at position 1 would be adjacent to a CH group. The CH group (position 2) is attached to a CH3 and another CH2 (position 3). The CH2 at position 3 would be attached to a CH3.

So in the NMR:

The CH2 at position 1 would have a triplet (due to coupling with the adjacent CH group).

The CH at position 2 would have a quartet (coupling with the adjacent CH2 groups).

But in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could be the CH group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be the CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is the CH3 attached to the CH group.

The 0.9 ppm (3H, t) is the CH3 at the end of the chain, which would be attached to the CH2 at position 3.

So, putting it all together, the substituent would be a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group attached to the benzene. Which would make it a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, but that's not a butyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me try to match the options with the data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. The structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a substituent at position 4, which is a sec-butyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)CH2-).

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Then, the NMR would show the CH(CH2CH3) as a triplet, and the CH2 next to it as a quartet. But in the data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), suggesting a methyl group attached to a CH.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck on the structure but perhaps I should proceed.

Assuming that option C is correct, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But how would the reaction with red phosphorus and HI form that?

Wait, wait. The question is about the product of the reaction, not the structure of X. So perhaps X is a bromide, which upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI eliminates to form an acid.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about what the reaction does.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which converts a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent halogens) into an alkene. Alternatively, in some cases, they can be used for the substitution of alkyl halides, but more commonly for elimination.

But in this case, perhaps X is a bromide adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, a benzal bromide. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would cause elimination, forming a double bond between the aldehyde carbon and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, that would form a benzaldehyde with a double bond, but that's not possible because the aldehyde is already a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is in a position that allows elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, if X is a benzyl bromide with a substituent that allows elimination, the product would be a styrene-type compound.

But looking at the options, none of them are alkenes. So perhaps the reaction doesn't form an alkene but instead is a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. For example, if X is an ester, then hydrolysis would form a carboxylic acid. But then, the reaction conditions don't seem right for hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but I don't see any nitriles in the data.

Wait, looking back at the IR data. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. So, if that's a ketone, ester, or aldehyde, but the NMR data suggests an aldehyde or carboxylic acid.

If the product is a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be from the acid. So, the reaction must have introduced the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide is replaced by a hydroxyl group, which is then oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But I don't think so because the reaction conditions don't include oxidizing agents.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each option and see which one fits the NMR and IR data.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: propanoic acid with a substituent on the second carbon which is a 4-ethylphenyl group.

So, the structure would be CH2-C6H4-CH2-COOH, where the ethyl is in the para position of the benzene.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets, which matches the data. The COOH proton would be at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet, which matches. The ethyl group on the benzene would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which matches the data. The CH2 groups in the propanoic acid would show up as something else.

Wait, the propanoic acid chain has CH2-CH2-COOH. So, the CH2 next to the benzene would be a quartet, and the CH2 next to the COOH would be a triplet. But in the given NMR data, there's a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might not fit.

Alternatively, the substituent's structure might have some branching that fits the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a CH in the middle. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Then, the CH(CH3) would have a triplet, but in the data, it's a multiplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. But I'm not sure.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The benzoic acid's COOH would give the peak at 10.5 ppm. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. The NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) as a triplet (if adjacent to CH2 groups), but in the data it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2 groups would be split into quartets or triplets.

Hmm, but the data has 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

So, the substituent would be a chain ending with a CH3 (0.9 ppm, t), a CH2 (1.7 ppm), a CH (2.9 ppm), and a CH3 attached to the CH (1.4 ppm, d).

That fits a substituent like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a pentyl group. No, but perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Then, the CH2 groups would be adjacent to each other, giving rise to the multiplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, which would fit the NMR data.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carboxylic acid or an ester. The broad peak at ~10.5 ppm in NMR is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids.

Option A: substituent is a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to the second carbon of propanoic acid. The NMR would have the aromatic protons, the ethyl group's triplet at 0.9 ppm, and the propanoic acid's chain.

Option C: substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to benzoic acid.

Which of these fits the NMR data?

The NMR shows for the substituent:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): this is a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): this is a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3 group.

This suggests a substituent chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which would be a pentyl group. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) group at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The adjacent CH2 groups at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

- The CH3 attached to CH at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

So, the substituent would be a 3-methylbutyl group, which would be a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the third carbon.

But looking at the options, option C is a sec-butyl group, which is a butyl group. So perhaps option C's substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have a structure that fits the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps option A's substituent is a 4-ethylphenyl group, which would have an ethyl group attached to the benzene, giving a triplet at 0.9 ppm and a quartet elsewhere.

But the substituent in option A is a phenyl group, so the NMR signals would be different. The substituent is a benzene ring with an ethyl group, so the ethyl's triplet at 0.9 would be present, but the rest of the substituent would be the propanoic acid chain.

Wait, in option A, the structure is propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group on the second carbon. So, the substituent is a benzene ring attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the propanoic acid. So, the substituent would be CH2-C6H4-CH2-COOH, with the ethyl in the para position.

In that case, the substituent would have a CH2 group next to the benzene (from the propanoic acid chain). So, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (from CH2-C6H4-) as a triplet, perhaps at around 3.5 ppm, but the data shows 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the substituent is a benzyl group attached to a CH2CH2COOH. But I'm not sure.

I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about the reaction outcome. The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product.

If X is a bromide, perhaps the product is an elimination product, forming an alkene.

Looking at the options, options B and D are substituted benzene rings without functional groups. So, if X is a bromide attached to a benzene ring, the product would be a styrene-like compound. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution.

Wait, another reaction: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, a tosyl group (OTs) can be replaced by iodide. But in that case, the product would be an alkyl iodide, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene.

If X is a bromide like benzyl bromide, the product would be styrene. But options don't match that.

Wait, maybe X is a dihalide, and the reaction forms an alkene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl bromide, which upon elimination would form an alkyne, but again, the options don't match.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think again.

The IR and NMR data point towards a compound with a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and a substituent with a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 structure.

So, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to a benzene ring, which is attached to a carboxylic acid.

That would make the structure 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

The NMR would then show:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets.

- The COOH proton as a broad peak at 10.5 ppm.

- The substituent's CH(CH3) as a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.

- The substituent's CH2 groups as a multiplet at 1.7 ppm.

- The methyl groups as a doublet (1.4 ppm) and a triplet (0.9 ppm).

So, that fits the data.

Therefore, the product would be option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction where Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis of the IR and NMR data provided is as follows:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid due to the broad nature of the peak.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretches, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets in the aromatic region, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely corresponding to a CH group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely corresponding to a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely corresponding to a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely corresponding to a terminal methyl group (CH₃) at the end of a chain.

### Reaction Analysis:
The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI, which are typically used for elimination reactions (e.g., dehydrohalogenation) or substitutions. However, the IR and NMR data strongly suggest that the product is a carboxylic acid, as indicated by the broad O-H stretch at 10.5 ppm and the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. This rules out elimination products (alkenes) and focuses on substitution or hydrolysis products.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure includes a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. The aromatic protons would match the two doublets observed in the NMR. However, the substituent's chain does not fully align with the NMR data, particularly the signals at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure is an alkylated benzene without a carboxylic acid group. The absence of a carboxylic acid proton in the NMR data rules out this option.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure includes a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. The aromatic protons match the two doublets observed in the NMR. The sec-butyl group explains the signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton. This option fits the data well.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   Similar to Option B, this structure is an alkylated benzene without a carboxylic acid group. The absence of a carboxylic acid proton in the NMR data rules out this option.

### Conclusion:
The IR and NMR data are most consistent with **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, as it explains the presence of the carboxylic acid group, the para-substituted benzene ring, and the sec-butyl substituent's NMR signals.

**Answer: C**
