Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think through it. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, right, I need to find the energy levels.

Wait, I remember that potentials can sometimes be expressed in terms of polar coordinates, and maybe we can separate the variables here. Oh right, in two dimensions, the particle's motion can be broken down into radial and angular parts if the potential allows it.

Let me write down the potential again. V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, that can be factored. Let's see: (1/2) kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, but wait, maybe I can think of this as a sum of two terms. Maybe the first term is like a harmonic oscillator in r, and the second term is something involving θ. Or perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of another coordinate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the potential in terms of cartesian coordinates. Since r² cos²θ is x², right? Because in polar coordinates, r cosθ = x, so r² cos²θ = x². Similarly, r² sin²θ = y². Wait, but the potential is (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out kr²: V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, wait, cos²θ can be expressed using the double-angle identity. I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2)*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. So 1/2 plus (3/2)*(1/2) is 1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4. Then there's the (3/2)*(cos 2θ)/2 term, which is (3/4) cos2θ. So V = kr² (5/4 + (3/4) cos 2θ ). Alternatively, V = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think about this in Cartesian coordinates. Because cos2θ is (x² - y²)/(r²), right? Because cos2θ = cos²θ - sin²θ, which in cartesian is (x² - y²)/r². So V can be rewritten as (5/4) kr² + (3/4)k r² (x² - y²)/r². The r² cancels, so that term becomes (3k/4)(x² - y²). So the potential becomes:

V = (5/4) k r² + (3k/4)(x² - y²).

Wait, but x² + y² is r², so x² is r² cos²θ, so perhaps this approach is making it more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the potential can be written as a sum of two harmonic oscillators in x and y directions. Let me try that.

Wait, expanding V(r,θ) in terms of x and y. Let's see, since x = r cosθ, so x² = r² cos²θ, and y² = r² sin²θ. So V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Let me factor out r²: V = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ]

Hmm, maybe I can express this as a sum of terms involving x and y. Let's see, since x = r cosθ, x² = r² cos²θ, so cos²θ = x²/r². Substituting into V:

V = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² (x² / r² )

Simplify, the r² terms cancel in the second term: V = (1/2) kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting. So V becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) ) + (3/2)k x². Because r² = x² + y². So substituting that in, V = (1/2 k)(x² + y²) + (3/2 k) x².

Wait, combining like terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². Because the first term is (1/2 k)x² + (1/2 k)y², and the second is (3/2 k)x², so total is (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y².

1/2 + 3/2 is 2, so V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh! So the potential is a sum of harmonic oscillators in x and y directions, but with different frequencies. Because in general, a harmonic oscillator has potential (1/2) m ω² x², right? So comparing, for the x-direction, the potential is 2k x², which would be (1/2) m ω_x² x², so (1/2)m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-component is (1/2)k y² = (1/2)m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So this is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator where the x and y directions have different frequencies. In such cases, the energy levels are quantized as E = (n_x + n_y + 1) (ℏ ω_x ) / 2 for x and similarly for y? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy levels for each harmonic oscillator in the x-direction would be E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, and similarly for y: E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y. So the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Substituting the ω values: ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Simplify this: E = [ (n_x + 1/2)*2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Compute the coefficients: 2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1, and (n_y + 1/2) is just that. So adding them: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let me check the options:

Option C says E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m). So that matches.

But wait, another way to approach this: the initial potential might be written as a sum of two harmonic oscillators, so the energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Another point to consider: the original potential was V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. When we converted it into Cartesian coordinates, we found V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So the x and y potentials are 2k x² and (1/2)k y², respectively.

So each contributes their own energy levels. So the x part is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, where ω_x² = 2k/m → ω_x = sqrt(2k/m). Wait, wait a second, because the potential is 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = 4k/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). As I had earlier.

So that energy is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m).

The y part is (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → k = m ω_y² → ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So energy is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

Adding them gives E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2. So the same as before.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is E = (2n_x + n_y +3/2)ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that's the correct one.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Decomposition**:  
   The potential can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates. Using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \), the term \( r^2 \cos^2\theta \) becomes \( x^2 \). Substituting this, the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
   \]  
   Combining terms, this simplifies to:  
   \[
   V = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]

2. **Energy Levels**:  
   The potential represents two independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, with different frequencies. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by \( E = (n + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega \), where \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).  
   - For the \( x \)-direction, the potential is \( 2kx^2 \), corresponding to \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). Its energy contribution is:  
     \[
     E_x = \left(2n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]
   - For the \( y \)-direction, the potential is \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), corresponding to \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). Its energy contribution is:  
     \[
     E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:  
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: \( E = (2n_x + 3n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the coefficients of \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) do not match the derived energy levels.

- **Option B**: \( E = (n_x + 3n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the coefficients of \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are swapped and do not match the derived energy levels.

- **Option C**: \( E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)  
  This matches the derived energy levels and is correct.

- **Option D**: \( E = (3n_x + 2n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the coefficients of \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) do not match the derived energy levels.

### Final Answer:
The correct energy spectrum is given by **Option C**:  
\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think through it. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, right, I need to find the energy levels.

Wait, I remember that potentials can sometimes be expressed in terms of polar coordinates, and maybe we can separate the variables here. Oh right, in two dimensions, the particle's motion can be broken down into radial and angular parts if the potential allows it.

Let me write down the potential again. V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, that can be factored. Let's see: (1/2) kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, but wait, maybe I can think of this as a sum of two terms. Maybe the first term is like a harmonic oscillator in r, and the second term is something involving θ. Or perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of another coordinate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the potential in terms of cartesian coordinates. Since r² cos²θ is x², right? Because in polar coordinates, r cosθ = x, so r² cos²θ = x². Similarly, r² sin²θ = y². Wait, but the potential is (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out kr²: V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, wait, cos²θ can be expressed using the double-angle identity. I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2)*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. So 1/2 plus (3/2)*(1/2) is 1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4. Then there's the (3/2)*(cos 2θ)/2 term, which is (3/4) cos2θ. So V = kr² (5/4 + (3/4) cos 2θ ). Alternatively, V = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think about this in Cartesian coordinates. Because cos2θ is (x² - y²)/(r²), right? Because cos2θ = cos²θ - sin²θ, which in cartesian is (x² - y²)/r². So V can be rewritten as (5/4) kr² + (3/4)k r² (x² - y²)/r². The r² cancels, so that term becomes (3k/4)(x² - y²). So the potential becomes:

V = (5/4) k r² + (3k/4)(x² - y²).

Wait, but x² + y² is r², so x² is r² cos²θ, so perhaps this approach is making it more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the potential can be written as a sum of two harmonic oscillators in x and y directions. Let me try that.

Wait, expanding V(r,θ) in terms of x and y. Let's see, since x = r cosθ, so x² = r² cos²θ, and y² = r² sin²θ. So V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Let me factor out r²: V = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ]

Hmm, maybe I can express this as a sum of terms involving x and y. Let's see, since x = r cosθ, x² = r² cos²θ, so cos²θ = x²/r². Substituting into V:

V = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² (x² / r² )

Simplify, the r² terms cancel in the second term: V = (1/2) kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting. So V becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) ) + (3/2)k x². Because r² = x² + y². So substituting that in, V = (1/2 k)(x² + y²) + (3/2 k) x².

Wait, combining like terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². Because the first term is (1/2 k)x² + (1/2 k)y², and the second is (3/2 k)x², so total is (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y².

1/2 + 3/2 is 2, so V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh! So the potential is a sum of harmonic oscillators in x and y directions, but with different frequencies. Because in general, a harmonic oscillator has potential (1/2) m ω² x², right? So comparing, for the x-direction, the potential is 2k x², which would be (1/2) m ω_x² x², so (1/2)m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-component is (1/2)k y² = (1/2)m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So this is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator where the x and y directions have different frequencies. In such cases, the energy levels are quantized as E = (n_x + n_y + 1) (ℏ ω_x ) / 2 for x and similarly for y? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy levels for each harmonic oscillator in the x-direction would be E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, and similarly for y: E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y. So the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Substituting the ω values: ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Simplify this: E = [ (n_x + 1/2)*2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Compute the coefficients: 2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1, and (n_y + 1/2) is just that. So adding them: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let me check the options:

Option C says E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m). So that matches.

But wait, another way to approach this: the initial potential might be written as a sum of two harmonic oscillators, so the energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Another point to consider: the original potential was V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. When we converted it into Cartesian coordinates, we found V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So the x and y potentials are 2k x² and (1/2)k y², respectively.

So each contributes their own energy levels. So the x part is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, where ω_x² = 2k/m → ω_x = sqrt(2k/m). Wait, wait a second, because the potential is 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = 4k/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). As I had earlier.

So that energy is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m).

The y part is (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → k = m ω_y² → ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So energy is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

Adding them gives E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2. So the same as before.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is E = (2n_x + n_y +3/2)ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that's the correct one.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Decomposition**:  
   The potential can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates. Using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \), the term \( r^2 \cos^2\theta \) becomes \( x^2 \). Substituting this, the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
   \]  
   Combining terms, this simplifies to:  
   \[
   V = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]

2. **Energy Levels**:  
   The potential represents two independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, with different frequencies. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by \( E = (n + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega \), where \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).  
   - For the \( x \)-direction, the potential is \( 2kx^2 \), corresponding to \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). Its energy contribution is:  
     \[
     E_x = \left(2n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]
   - For the \( y \)-direction, the potential is \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), corresponding to \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). Its energy contribution is:  
     \[
     E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:  
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: \( E = (2n_x + 3n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the coefficients of \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) do not match the derived energy levels.

- **Option B**: \( E = (n_x + 3n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the coefficients of \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are swapped and do not match the derived energy levels.

- **Option C**: \( E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)  
  This matches the derived energy levels and is correct.

- **Option D**: \( E = (3n_x + 2n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the coefficients of \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) do not match the derived energy levels.

### Final Answer:
The correct energy spectrum is given by **Option C**:  
\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Answer: C
