Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particles and Lorentz factors. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly but travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so the original situation has a Lorentz factor gamma = 20, and 1/3 of the particles make it to the walls. We need to find the new gamma that results in 2/3 making it. 

I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, time dilation would affect how quickly they decay. The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector's wall depends on its speed, right?

Let me think about the decay process. The particles are produced at the center of the detector and move outward. They decay after some proper time, say tau. But from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

The distance the particle travels before decaying is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. Velocity v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles. So the distance is v * gamma * tau. 

But wait, particles that reach the detector walls must have their decay time such that they travel the entire radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. 

So, when a particle decays, it does so at a certain distance from the center. The fraction that reach the walls must have their decay distance equal to or greater than 30 meters. 

Wait, actually, the problem says that on average, one third reach the walls. So that implies that the average decay length is such that only 1/3 of them make it to 30 meters. 

Wait, maybe I should model this probabilistically. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance L is given by the exponential decay function. 

The decay probability P(L) is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed before reaching L. The decay length L is given by L = c * gamma * tau. 

But the number of particles that decay beyond a certain point is given by the survival probability. Wait, no, the number that have decayed before reaching L is 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma tau)). Wait, actually, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed yet when it has traveled distance L is e^(-L/(c gamma tau)), right? Because the decay follows an exponential distribution. So the particles that reach the wall are those that haven't decayed before traveling 30 meters.

So P = e^(-30/(c gamma tau)).

In the original scenario, gamma is 20, and P is 1/3. So,

1/3 = e^(-30/(c * 20 * tau)).

We can solve for (30/(c tau)) first. Let me compute that.

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 tau)

ln(1/3) is approximately -1.0986.

So,

-1.0986 = -30/(20 c tau)

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau)

Simplify 30/(20) = 3/2.

So,

1.0986 = (3)/(2 c tau) → 2 c tau = 3/(1.0986)
Calculating 3 / 1.0986 ≈ 2.731.

So 2 c tau ≈ 2.731 → c tau ≈ 1.3655 meters.

Wait, but wait, that's the value of c tau. So, c tau ≈ 1.3655 meters.

But when the Lorentz factor increases, gamma increases, which affects the exponent in the survival probability.

Now, in the new scenario, we want P_new = 2/3.

So,

2/3 = e^(-30/(c gamma' tau))

Take natural logs:

ln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma' tau)

ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(c gamma' tau)

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 = 30/(c gamma' tau)

We can solve for gamma':

gamma' = 30/(0.4055 c tau)

But wait, earlier we found that c tau ≈ 1.3655 meters.

So substituting c tau:

gamma' = 30 / (0.4055 * 1.3655)

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.4055 * 1.3655 ≈ 0.4055 * 1.3655.

Calculating that:

0.4 * 1.3655 = 0.5462; 0.0055 * 1.3655≈0.0075. So total about 0.5537.

So denominator is approx 0.5537.

So 30 / 0.5537 ≈ let's see, 30 / 0.55 is approximately 54.545.

Wait, 0.55 * 54 = 29.7, which is close to 30. So 54.545 is about 54.5.

Looking at the options given: option A is 54, option B is 68, C is 40, D is28.

So the closest is 54, which is option A.

Wait, but wait! Let me double-check the calculation because I might have made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, the denominator is 0.4055 * 1.3655. Let me compute it accurately.

Compute 0.4055 * 1.3655:

0.4055 * 1.3655.

Hmm, perhaps I should write it as 0.4055 * 1.3655.

Let me compute 0.4 * 1.3655 = 0.5462.

0.0055 * 1.3655 = 0.00751025.

Adding them gives 0.5462 + 0.00751025 ≈ 0.55371025.

So yes, denominator is approx 0.5537.

So 30 / 0.5537 ≈ 54.18. So the new gamma is approximately 54.2.

Looking at the options, A is 54. So that's the answer.

Hmm, but wait another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can set up a ratio.

We have from the first situation:

e^(-30/( c gamma tau )) = 1/3.

Take natural logs: -30/(c gamma tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So,

30 = c gamma tau * 1.0986.

So,

c gamma tau = 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.31 meters.

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense because earlier I had c tau ≈1.3655 m. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, let me go back.

Original equation: 1/3 = e^(-30/(c gamma tau))

Take natural logs:

ln(1/3) = -30/(c gamma tau)

So,

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 = 30/(c gamma tau).

Wait, wait no:

ln(1/3) = - ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So,

-1.0986 = -30/(c gamma tau)

Multiply both sides by -1: 1.0986 = 30/(c gamma tau)

So,

c gamma tau = 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.31 meters.

Wait, but earlier I had c tau ≈ 1.3655 meters. That must have been a mistake. Wait, because in the first step I had:

c tau = 1.3655 m, but that's not correct.

Wait, let's redo that part.

Wait, from the first scenario,

c gamma tau = 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.31 meters.

So, c gamma tau = 27.31.

In the second scenario, the same c tau, but gamma increases to gamma'.

We have e^(-30/(c gamma' tau)) = 2/3.

Take natural logs:

ln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma' tau).

ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055.

So,

0.4055 = 30/(c gamma' tau).

But from the first scenario, we know that c gamma tau =27.31 meters.

So, c tau = 27.31 / gamma.

Wait, substituting c tau into the second equation:

gamma' = 30/(0.4055 * c tau )

But c tau = 27.31 / gamma, which is 27.31 /20 = 1.3655 m. Oh wait, that's where I got that earlier. So that was correct. So substituting,

gamma' = 30/(0.4055 * (27.31 /20 )) 

Wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, c tau = (27.31)/gamma.

Because c gamma tau = 27.31, so tau = 27.31/(c gamma).

So, c tau = 27.31 / gamma.

So when gamma is 20, c tau is 27.31/20=1.3655 m.

So in the second scenario, we have:

gamma' = 30/(0.4055 * (27.31 / gamma') )

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again.

In the second scenario, the equation is:

0.4055 = 30/(c gamma' tau )

But c gamma' tau = 27.31 * (gamma' / gamma ) ?

Wait, no. Wait, let me see.

Wait, from the first scenario, c gamma1 tau =27.31 m.

gamma1 is 20.

In the second scenario, gamma becomes gamma2, so c gamma2 tau = (gamma2/gamma1) * (c gamma1 tau ) = (gamma2/20)*27.31.

So,

30/(c gamma2 tau ) = 30/( (gamma2/20)*27.31 )

But from the second equation, 0.4055 = 30/(c gamma2 tau )

So,

0.4055 = 30/( (gamma2/20)*27.31 )

Simplify denominator:

(gamma2/20)*27.31 = gamma2 * 27.31 /20.

So,

0.4055 = 30 / (gamma2 * 27.31 /20 )

Which can be rewritten as:

0.4055 = (30 *20 )/(gamma2 *27.31 )

Simplify numerator: 30*20=600.

So,

0.4055 = 600/(gamma2 *27.31 )

Multiply both sides by (gamma2 *27.31 ):

0.4055 * gamma2 *27.31 =600.

So,

gamma2 = 600/(0.4055 *27.31 )

Compute denominator: 0.4055 *27.31 ≈ 11.066.

So,

gamma2 =600 /11.066 ≈54.2.

So, approximately 54.2 is the Lorentz factor needed. So the closest option is A)54.

Wait a minute, but in the first calculation, I arrived at the same answer, so that's consistent.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A, 54.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, particle decay, and the distance traveled. The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with radius 30 meters. The probability of a particle reaching the detector's inner walls depends on its decay length, which is influenced by the Lorentz factor, $\gamma$, through time dilation.

### Key Equations and Relationships:
1. **Decay Probability**: The probability that a particle reaches the detector's walls is given by the survival probability:
   \[
   P = e^{-\frac{L}{c \gamma \tau}}
   \]
   where:
   - \(L = 30 \, \text{m}\) is the distance to the detector's walls,
   - \(c\) is the speed of light,
   - \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor,
   - \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

2. **Original Scenario**: For \(\gamma = 20\), \(P = \frac{1}{3}\). Substituting into the survival probability formula:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = e^{-\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}}
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}
   \]
   Using \(\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986\), we solve:
   \[
   1.0986 = \frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau} \implies c \cdot \tau = \frac{30}{1.0986 \cdot 20} \approx 1.3655 \, \text{m}.
   \]

3. **New Scenario**: We want \(P = \frac{2}{3}\). Substituting into the survival probability formula:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = e^{-\frac{30}{c \cdot \gamma' \cdot \tau}}
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \cdot \gamma' \cdot \tau}
   \]
   Using \(\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055\), we solve:
   \[
   0.4055 = \frac{30}{c \cdot \gamma' \cdot \tau}.
   \]

4. **Substitute \(c \cdot \tau\)**: From the original scenario, \(c \cdot \tau \approx 1.3655 \, \text{m}\). Substituting into the new equation:
   \[
   0.4055 = \frac{30}{\gamma' \cdot 1.3655}.
   \]
   Rearranging for \(\gamma'\):
   \[
   \gamma' = \frac{30}{0.4055 \cdot 1.3655}.
   \]

5. **Calculate \(\gamma'\)**: Compute the denominator:
   \[
   0.4055 \cdot 1.3655 \approx 0.5537.
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   \gamma' = \frac{30}{0.5537} \approx 54.2.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The Lorentz factor needed for approximately two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's walls is closest to **54**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
