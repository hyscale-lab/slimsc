Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph when used with an 8m VLT telescope. The condition is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph. It's used for things like detecting exoplanets via the radial velocity method. The key here is the S/N ratio. I think the S/N depends on factors like the brightness of the star, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency.

Wait, the stars are given with their absolute magnitudes and distances. Absolute magnitude (M) is how bright a star is at 10 parsecs away. The apparent magnitude (m) would tell us how bright it appears here. Oh right, the formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. That gives us the apparent magnitude, which relates to the flux we receive.

The flux received from a star is higher for closer stars and brighter (lower magnitude) stars. So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent magnitude. Then, using their apparent brightness, determine if the S/N is at least 10.

I also need to know ESPRESSO's performance. From what I recall, ESPRESSO can achieve a certain S/N ratio per pixel for a given exposure time and star brightness. Wait, I think ESPRESSO's S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the brightness. Oh right, S/N ∝ sqrt(t) * sqrt(flux), where flux depends on the star's brightness.

But how does the magnitude translate into flux? The formula is: the flux from a star is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is a reference magnitude (like m=0, which is very bright). So brighter stars (lower m) produce more flux, leading to higher S/N.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. For each star, calculate its apparent magnitude m.
2. Convert m to flux (or perhaps use it to compare brightness).
3. Determine if, with a 1-hour exposure, the S/N is >=10.

Wait, but what's the typical S/N ESPRESSO can achieve? I remember that ESPRESSO is designed for high S/N. Oh, but maybe the exact numbers depend on the star's brightness. For example, a very bright star (like Canopus) would saturate, while a dimmer one (like a high apparent magnitude) would be too faint.

Let me think about each star:

Option a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star, one of the brightest in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7. That's super bright. But wait, would such a bright star be a problem for ESPRESSO? High flux can cause saturation, which reduces the S/N because the photons are not spread out. So maybe the S/N isn't as high as expected because the detector is saturated. So perhaps Canopus isn't detectable for this purpose. Or does ESPRESSO handle bright stars well? I'm not sure. I'll have to think about this later.

Option b) Polaris. I know Polaris is the North Star, and it's about magnitude 2.0. So that's brighter than many stars but not as bright as Canopus. So its apparent magnitude is lower than Canopus but higher than many others.

Option c) Star with M=15 mag at 10 pc. So using m = M +5 +5 log10(d). d is 10 pc, so log10(10)=1. So m=15+5+5*1=25. So apparent magnitude of 25. That's very faint. I think ESPRESSO might not get a good S/N on such a faint star in 1 hour. But wait, the exposure time is 1 hour, so maybe even faint stars are detectable if the instrument is sensitive enough.

Option d) Same as c but at 200 pc. m =15 +5 +5 log10(200). Log10(200)=2.301. So m=15+5 +5*2.301=15+5+11.505=31.505. That's way too faint. I don't think ESPRESSO can reach S/N 10 on such a star in an hour. Probably not detectable.

Option e) M=15 mag at 5 pc. So d=5. Log10(5)=0.69897. So m=15+5 +5*0.69897≈15+5+3.495=23.495. So about magnitude 23.5. Hmm, that's still quite faint. I'm not sure if ESPRESSO can reach S/N 10 on that in 1 hour. Maybe not. Let me think about the formula.

Option f) M=15 mag at 50 pc. Log10(50)=1.69897. So m=15+5+5*1.69897 =20 +8.49485≈28.494. So m≈28.5. That's even fainter than d.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating the formula. Let me double-check. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 * log10(d). Because d is in parsecs. So yes, that's correct.

Now, how does the S/N depend on the apparent magnitude? The S/N is given by some function of the flux, which depends on the star's apparent brightness. The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(t)) / noise, where noise is related to the background and other factors.

Alternatively, I remember that for a given instrument, the S/N can be approximated by S/N ~  sqrt(N_photons). The number of photons depends on the star's flux and exposure time.

Flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), because each magnitude step is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness. So higher (more positive) magnitudes mean fainter stars.

But I'm not sure of the exact formula. Let's think about a reference: if a star has an apparent magnitude m, then the flux f is f = f0 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where f0 is a reference flux at m0.

Assuming that the reference m0 is such that m0=0 corresponds to a certain flux. But without knowing f0, perhaps we can compare stars relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the square root of the flux. So S/N = k * sqrt(t) * sqrt(f), where k is a constant determined by the instrument and the noise.

Wait, more accurately, S/N is proportional to sqrt(t * f). Because for a longer exposure, you get more photons, and higher flux (f) means more photons per unit time.

But the exact numbers would require knowing the system's efficiency. But perhaps I can find a rule of thumb or a formula.

Looking for some data: I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when used with the VLT (8m telescope), can achieve a certain S/N for a star of a given magnitude in a certain exposure time.

Wait, I found an example somewhere in my memory. Let's suppose that for a star of V magnitude 9, ESPRESSO can achieve S/N 100 per pixel in 1 hour. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe it's lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S/N = (10^(-0.4*(m - m_ref)) ) * sqrt(t) * some constant.

But without exact numbers, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I can make an approximate calculation.

Let me think about a star that's bright enough. The stars with apparent magnitudes below about 10 might be detectable quickly, but dimmer stars may require longer exposures or more photons.

Wait, the problem says that the star must have S/N ≥10 per binned pixel. So which of these stars have enough photons in the exposure to reach that?

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Compute the apparent magnitude m for each star (a to f).

2. For each m, determine if S/N ≥10 in 1 hour.

But without knowing the exact S/N per magnitude, I'm not sure. Maybe I can find a way to compare using the formula.

I found online (but in my mind) that the S/N ratio for a star with magnitude m observed for time t is given by:

S/N = 5.9e-4 * sqrt(t) * (10^(-0.4*(m - 20))) )

Wait, I think this formula might be something like that. Let me think: when m is lower (brighter), the exponent is negative, so 10^(-0.4*(m-20)) becomes larger. So that would make S/N higher.

But I'm not sure about the exact number. Alternatively, another source I've heard: the S/N per pixel for a star with V magnitude m is S/N ≈ 2.7 * 10^(-0.35*(m - 19)) * sqrt(t), where t is in seconds.

Wait, that might not be accurate, but perhaps I can use an approximate approach.

Let me assume that for a given m, the S/N scales as 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is a reference magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a resource that tells me the typical S/N ESPRESSO can achieve.

Wait, looking up (in my mind) the ESPRESSO performance. I think the design goal is to reach S/N of 100 per pixel for a V=9 star in 1 hour. So if a star is brighter than V=9, S/N increases, and if it's fainter, S/N decreases.

So, for example, a V=9 star gives S/N 100 in 1 hour. A V=15 star would be 10 magnitudes fainter. Since each magnitude is a factor of ~2.5 in brightness, 10 magnitudes would be (2.5)^10 ≈ 95. So that's about 95 times fainter.

But wait, the flux is 10^(-0.4*(15-9)) = 10^(-0.4*6) = 10^-2.4 ≈ 3.98e-3. So 3.98% of the flux of a V=9 star.

Since the S/N scales with sqrt(flux), the S/N would be 100 * sqrt(3.98e-3) ≈ 100 * 0.063 ≈ 6.3. So S/N of about 6.3 for a V=15 star in 1 hour.

Wait, that's below 10. So that star (if such a star existed) would not meet the S/N requirement.

But wait, in this case, the stars have different distances, so their apparent magnitudes vary.

Wait, let me get back to the options.

First, let's compute each star's apparent magnitude.

Star (a) Canopus: Let's look it up. I remember Canopus is a -0.7 magnitude star. So m ≈ -0.7.

Star (b) Polaris: m is around 2.0.

Star (c): M=15, d=10 pc.

m = 15 +5 +5*1 =25.

Star (d): M=15, d=200 pc.

m =15 +5 +5*log10(200)=15+5+5*(2.301)=15+5+11.505=31.505.

Star (e): M=15, d=5 pc.

m=15+5 +5*log10(5)=20 +5*(0.69897)=20+3.495=23.495.

Star (f): M=15, d=50 pc.

log10(50)=1.69897.

m=15+5 +5*(1.69897)=20+8.49485≈28.495.

Now, for each of these m, what is their S/N?

Assuming that for m=9, S/N is 100 in 1 hour. Let's use that as a reference.

But wait, for m brighter than 9, the S/N increases. For example, for m=0, which is brighter than 9 by 9 magnitudes.

Each magnitude is a factor of ~2.512 in flux. So 9 magnitudes is 2.512^9 ≈ 318. So flux is 318 times higher. So S/N would be 100 * sqrt(318) ≈ 100 * 17.83 ≈ 1783. So S/N would be way more than 10. But that's for m=0, which is brighter than m=9.

Wait, but wait, the formula I used earlier: S/N ~ 100 * (flux ratio)^0.5.

Flux ratio is 10^(-0.4*(m -9)).

Wait, no, because for m=9, flux is F. For m=0, flux is F * 10^(-0.4*(0-9)) )= F * 10^(3.6) ≈ F * 4100. So the flux is 4100 times higher. So S/N would be 100 * sqrt(4100) ≈ 100 * 64 ≈ 6400. That's way higher than 10.

But for m=25, which is much fainter than m=9, the flux ratio is 10^(-0.4*(25-9))=10^(-5.6)=2.5e-6. So flux is 2.5e-6 times that of m=9.

So S/N would be 100 * sqrt(2.5e-6) = 100 * 0.00158 ≈ 0.158. That's way below 10.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because for m=25, the S/N is way below 10, so not detectable. But for m=0, it's way over.

But let's see, for each star:

a) Canopus, m=-0.7. So flux ratio is 10^(-0.4*(-0.7-9)) = 10^(-0.4*(-9.7)) = 10^(3.88) ≈ 76568.

So S/N = 100 * sqrt(76568) = 100 * 276.7 ≈ 27670. Way above 10.

But wait, but for very bright stars, the instrument might saturate. So maybe the S/N doesn't scale that way. So perhaps for stars brighter than a certain magnitude (like m=0), the S/N doesn't increase because the detectors are saturated.

So in reality, the S/N for very bright stars might be lower than the formula suggests because you can't collect more photons than the detector can handle. But I'm not sure about the specifics. For the purpose of this question, should I assume that the S/N scales as the formula, or does saturation come into play?

I think in the context of the question, they expect us to use the formula and not consider saturation. Alternatively, perhaps some stars are too bright and aren't detected because they're saturated, but I'm not certain.

So, let's proceed with the formula.

Star a: m=-0.7. S/N ~ 100 * sqrt(10^(-0.4*(-0.7-9))) ) ?

Wait, wait. Let me correct the formula.

The formula is S/N = 100 * sqrt(10^(-0.4*(m - 9)))

Because for m=9, it's 100. For m brighter than 9, the exponent is negative, making the factor bigger.

So for m=-0.7:

Exponent: -0.4*(-0.7 -9) = -0.4*(-9.7) = 3.88.

10^3.88≈76568.

S/N = 100 * sqrt(76568) ≈ 100 * 276.7 ≈ 27670. So definitely above 10.

Star b: m=2.

Exponent: -0.4*(2-9)= -0.4*(-7)=2.8.

10^2.8≈630.96.

S/N=100 * sqrt(630.96)=100 * 25.12≈2512. Still way above 10.

Star c: m=25.

Exponent: -0.4*(25-9)= -0.4*16= -6.4.

10^-6.4≈3.98e-7.

S/N=100 * sqrt(3.98e-7) ≈100 * 0.00063≈0.063. Way below 10.

Star d: m=28.495.

Exponent: -0.4*(28.495-9)= -0.4*19.495≈-7.798.

10^-7.798≈1.6e-8.

S/N=100 * sqrt(1.6e-8)≈100 * 1.26e-4≈0.0126. Below 10.

Star e: m=23.495.

Exponent: -0.4*(23.495-9)= -0.4*14.495≈-5.798.

10^-5.798≈1.6e-6.

S/N=100 * sqrt(1.6e-6) ≈ 100 * 0.00126≈0.126. Still below 10.

Star f: m=28.495.

Wait, same as star d. So S/N same as d, which is below 10.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Because the formula I used was S/N = 100 * sqrt(10^(-0.4*(m -9))).

But wait, perhaps I should have written it as S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(m -9)).

Because the scaling with m is S/N ~ 10^(-0.4*(m -9)) * 100, but wait, no. Let's think again.

The S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux). Flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is a reference.

So S/N ~ sqrt(10^(-0.4*(m - m0))) ) * constant.

Which is 10^(-0.2*(m -m0)) * constant.

So if m0 is 9, then S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(m -9)).

Wait, that's a different way to write it. Let me re-calculate.

For m=9, 10^(-0.2*(0))=1, so S/N=100.

For m=25: 10^(-0.2*(16))=10^(-3.2)=6.3e-4.

S/N=100 *6.3e-4 =0.063.

Which matches the previous calculation.

Wait, no, that's the same result. So the formula is correct.

So, which stars have S/N >=10?

Looking at each:

a) 27670 >10 → yes.

b) 2512 >10 → yes.

c) 0.063 <10 → no.

d) 0.0126 <10 → no.

e) 0.126 <10 → no.

f) 0.0126 <10 → no.

So, only stars a and b have S/N >=10.

Wait, but that's two stars, so option A) 2.

But wait, what about star e, which is at 5 pc. Its m is 23.495, which gives S/N of 0.126, which is way below 10.

So, a and b: 2 stars. So the answer would be A) 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Canopus might be so bright that it's saturated, but the formula suggests that the S/N is way above 10. Well, the question is about whether the signal is detectable (S/N ≥10). So even if the star is very bright, if the S/N is high enough, it's considered detectable.

But wait, sometimes very bright stars can saturate the detectors, which can cause the S/N to drop because the photons are not spread out, leading to fewer counts. So perhaps in reality, Canopus might not reach S/N=10 because it's saturated, but I'm not sure. The problem states that the S/N per binned pixel must be at least 10. So if the star is too bright, could the binned pixels have a lower S/N?

But the question doesn't mention saturation, so perhaps we can ignore it. So based on the formula, a and b would be detectable.

So the correct answer is A) 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for each star. A star is considered detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The apparent magnitude \( m \) of each star is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 + 5 \log_{10}(d)
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N is then estimated using the relationship:

\[
\text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2 \cdot (m - 9)}
\]

This formula assumes that a star with \( m = 9 \) achieves an S/N of 100 in 1 hour, and the S/N scales with the flux of the star.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star (a): Canopus**  
   Apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \).  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2 \cdot (-0.7 - 9)} = 100 \cdot 10^{3.88} \approx 27670
   \]  
   The S/N is much greater than 10, so Canopus is detectable.

2. **Star (b): Polaris**  
   Apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \).  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2 \cdot (2 - 9)} = 100 \cdot 10^{2.8} \approx 2512
   \]  
   The S/N is much greater than 10, so Polaris is detectable.

3. **Star (c): \( M = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)**  
   Apparent magnitude \( m = 25 \).  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2 \cdot (25 - 9)} = 100 \cdot 10^{-3.2} \approx 0.063
   \]  
   The S/N is much less than 10, so this star is not detectable.

4. **Star (d): \( M = 15 \), \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \)**  
   Apparent magnitude \( m \approx 31.505 \).  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2 \cdot (31.505 - 9)} = 100 \cdot 10^{-7.798} \approx 0.0126
   \]  
   The S/N is much less than 10, so this star is not detectable.

5. **Star (e): \( M = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)**  
   Apparent magnitude \( m \approx 23.495 \).  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2 \cdot (23.495 - 9)} = 100 \cdot 10^{-5.798} \approx 0.126
   \]  
   The S/N is much less than 10, so this star is not detectable.

6. **Star (f): \( M = 15 \), \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \)**  
   Apparent magnitude \( m \approx 28.495 \).  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2 \cdot (28.495 - 9)} = 100 \cdot 10^{-6.798} \approx 0.0126
   \]  
   The S/N is much less than 10, so this star is not detectable.

### Conclusion:
Only stars (a) and (b) have an S/N of at least 10. Therefore, the number of detectable stars is **2**.
