Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I think I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with some underlying symmetry principles. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Let me think through each.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, in the Standard Model, all the interactions respect Lorentz symmetry, which includes rotations and boosts. Since SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM, I believe all operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So if the theory has a Poincare symmetry, it includes Lorentz as well. But do all SMEFT operators respect this? Well, I think the SMEFT is constructed in a way that maintains Poincare invariance. Because the operators are built from the SM fields and their derivatives, which respect Poincare. So 2 is also a must. But wait, I've heard that in some effective theories, especially beyond a certain cutoff, you might have operators that break Poincare, but in the SMEFT framework, I think they're kept. So 2 is included.

CP symmetry: Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of things like the CKM phase contributing to CP violation. So in the SM, not all operators respect CP. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? Or is CP violation allowed? I think SMEFT allows for CP violation because it's an effective theory, and the SM already has it. So probably, the operators in SMEFT don't need to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry: Wait, CPT is a big one. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT must be a symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, the LSZ formula and the structure of the theory require that if a theory is Lorentz invariant, it is also CPT symmetric. So if the SMEFT operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they must automatically respect CPT symmetry. So 4 must be a symmetry that all operators respect.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but I thought earlier that Poincare is a bigger symmetry. Wait, but the question lists Poincare as option 2, and Lorentz as 1. So if 2 is a must, then 1 is also a must, but if all operators have to respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, then 1 is automatically included. Hmm, but the question is which of the options must be respected by all operators.

Wait, let me think again. The SMEFT is built to respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM (and thus SMEFT) respects Poincare symmetry. So the operators must be Poincare invariant. Which would imply they're Lorentz and translation-invariant. So 2 is a must, which would include 1, but the question is about which must be respected. So the operators must respect all three? Or just 2? No, because 2 is Poincare, which already includes Lorentz. So the question is asking which of the four symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, the options are presented as 1,2,3,4. The question is which of these must be respected. So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Because Poincare (2) includes Lorentz (1), but the question is listing them as separate options. So the correct operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So options 1,2,4 are correct. So looking at the choices, option C says 1,2,4. Option C is choice C which is 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait: another angle. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation. So if all SMEFT operators respect Poincare, then they must respect both, but in the question, Lorentz is a separate point. So the operators must respect Poincare, which already includes Lorentz. So in the given options, the operators must respect 2 (Poincare) and 4 (CPT). But the question also lists 1 (Lorentz) as a separate option. So if 2 is correct, 1 is automatically correct. But the question is whether all of 1,2,4 must be respected, or just 2 and 4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The Poincare group consists of Lorentz transformations, space and time translations, and their combinations. So any operator that respects Poincare symmetry must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So if an operator respects Poincare (2), it automatically respects Lorentz (1). But the question is which symmetries must be respected. So if 2 is correct, then 1 is also correct. So the correct selection would include 1,2,4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought the SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry. So operators must be Poincare invariant, which implies they are also Lorentz and translation invariant. So in the given options, 1,2,4 are all required.

But let me double-check. The SMEFT operators are built from the SM fields and are required to be renormalizable? No, wait, SMEFT is non-renormalizable. But they are constructed as higher-dimension operators which must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT operators must too. Hence, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

So the answer would include 1,2,4. So options 1,2,4 must be respected by all operators. So the correct choice is option C) 1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry as well as translations in space and time. Since SMEFT is built to respect Poincaré symmetry, all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that Lorentz symmetry is automatically included.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM already violates CP symmetry (e.g., due to the CKM phase). Since SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM, it allows for CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I think I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with some underlying symmetry principles. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Let me think through each.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, in the Standard Model, all the interactions respect Lorentz symmetry, which includes rotations and boosts. Since SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM, I believe all operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So if the theory has a Poincare symmetry, it includes Lorentz as well. But do all SMEFT operators respect this? Well, I think the SMEFT is constructed in a way that maintains Poincare invariance. Because the operators are built from the SM fields and their derivatives, which respect Poincare. So 2 is also a must. But wait, I've heard that in some effective theories, especially beyond a certain cutoff, you might have operators that break Poincare, but in the SMEFT framework, I think they're kept. So 2 is included.

CP symmetry: Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of things like the CKM phase contributing to CP violation. So in the SM, not all operators respect CP. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? Or is CP violation allowed? I think SMEFT allows for CP violation because it's an effective theory, and the SM already has it. So probably, the operators in SMEFT don't need to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry: Wait, CPT is a big one. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT must be a symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, the LSZ formula and the structure of the theory require that if a theory is Lorentz invariant, it is also CPT symmetric. So if the SMEFT operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they must automatically respect CPT symmetry. So 4 must be a symmetry that all operators respect.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but I thought earlier that Poincare is a bigger symmetry. Wait, but the question lists Poincare as option 2, and Lorentz as 1. So if 2 is a must, then 1 is also a must, but if all operators have to respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, then 1 is automatically included. Hmm, but the question is which of the options must be respected by all operators.

Wait, let me think again. The SMEFT is built to respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM (and thus SMEFT) respects Poincare symmetry. So the operators must be Poincare invariant. Which would imply they're Lorentz and translation-invariant. So 2 is a must, which would include 1, but the question is about which must be respected. So the operators must respect all three? Or just 2? No, because 2 is Poincare, which already includes Lorentz. So the question is asking which of the four symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, the options are presented as 1,2,3,4. The question is which of these must be respected. So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Because Poincare (2) includes Lorentz (1), but the question is listing them as separate options. So the correct operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So options 1,2,4 are correct. So looking at the choices, option C says 1,2,4. Option C is choice C which is 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait: another angle. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation. So if all SMEFT operators respect Poincare, then they must respect both, but in the question, Lorentz is a separate point. So the operators must respect Poincare, which already includes Lorentz. So in the given options, the operators must respect 2 (Poincare) and 4 (CPT). But the question also lists 1 (Lorentz) as a separate option. So if 2 is correct, 1 is automatically correct. But the question is whether all of 1,2,4 must be respected, or just 2 and 4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The Poincare group consists of Lorentz transformations, space and time translations, and their combinations. So any operator that respects Poincare symmetry must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So if an operator respects Poincare (2), it automatically respects Lorentz (1). But the question is which symmetries must be respected. So if 2 is correct, then 1 is also correct. So the correct selection would include 1,2,4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought the SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry. So operators must be Poincare invariant, which implies they are also Lorentz and translation invariant. So in the given options, 1,2,4 are all required.

But let me double-check. The SMEFT operators are built from the SM fields and are required to be renormalizable? No, wait, SMEFT is non-renormalizable. But they are constructed as higher-dimension operators which must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT operators must too. Hence, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

So the answer would include 1,2,4. So options 1,2,4 must be respected by all operators. So the correct choice is option C) 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry as well as translations in space and time. Since SMEFT is built to respect Poincaré symmetry, all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that Lorentz symmetry is automatically included.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM already violates CP symmetry (e.g., due to the CKM phase). Since SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM, it allows for CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected. Therefore, the correct answer is:
