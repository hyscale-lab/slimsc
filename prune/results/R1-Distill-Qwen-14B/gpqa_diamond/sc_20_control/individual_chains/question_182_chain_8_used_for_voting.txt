Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices, especially in the space-charge-limited current regime. Let me think about what each part of the equation means and the conditions under which it's applicable.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V² / L³). From what I recall, this equation describes the current (J) in terms of the dielectric constant (ε), carrier mobility (μ), voltage (V), and the length of the device (L). But wait, isn't there something about the space-charge-limited condition? Oh right, in that regime, the current is limited by the electric field generated by the space charge itself, rather than other factors like series resistance or carrier generation.

So the equation is valid when the device is in SCLC, which implies that the space charge is significant enough to limit the current. Now, the question is about the conditions under which this equation holds true. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate things, causing carrier trapping which isn't accounted for in the simple Mott-Gurney model. Single-carrier suggests that it's either electrons or holes, not both. Ohmic contact means the contacts don't create a barrier for carriers. But negligible drift current? Or wait, in the Mott-Gurney scenario, the current is due to drift, right? Because the space-charge builds up and creates a field that accelerates the carriers, leading to drift current. So if drift current is negligible, maybe this condition isn't right. Or am I mixing up the terms?

Wait, another thought: in SCLC, the current is primarily due to the drift of carriers, so if drift is negligible, the equation wouldn't apply. So if option A says "negligible drift current", that would make the equation invalid. So perhaps A is incorrect.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. So, no injection barrier—maybe that refers to Ohmic contacts, as opposed to Schottky barriers. And negligible diffusion current. Wait, in the Mott-Gurney model, the current is due to drift because the space charge is forming. So diffusion is less important here, I think. So if diffusion is negligible, that fits the model, as the dominant current is drift. So B says negligible diffusion current, which makes sense. And it's single-carrier, trap-free. But what about the injection barrier? Ohmic contacts don't have a barrier, so no carrier injection barrier would mean it's Ohmic. So maybe B is correct.

Option C: Single-carrier device with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts have a barrier, so the carriers have to overcome it. But in the Mott-Gurney equation, does the presence of a Schottky contact affect the validity? I'm not too sure. The model assumes that the injection is efficient, perhaps. Or maybe the equation doesn't account for contact barriers. Hmm. Alternatively, the equation might assume that the carriers can move freely, so any contact barriers would complicate things. So if the contact is Schottky, you might have thermionic emission or tunneling, which could affect the current. So the Mott-Gurney equation is more applicable when the contacts are Ohmic, to avoid complications from the contact barrier affecting the space-charge build-up. So option C might not be correct because it mentions a Schottky contact.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, right? Because for two-carrier (like electrons and holes), the space-charge effects would be more complex, especially in cases like Zener diodes or where both carriers contribute to the current. So if the device has both carriers, maybe the equation isn't applicable, so D is incorrect.

So, putting it together: the equation holds for a single-carrier, trap-free device. The contacts should be Ohmic, so no injection barriers. The dominant current is drift, so diffusion must be negligible. So looking at the options:

Option B says "no carrier injection barrier" which implies Ohmic contacts, and "negligible diffusion current", which fits. So B should be correct.

Wait, but wait. The Mott-Gurney equation is applicable when the current is space-charge limited, which typically occurs when the injection is in the regime where the space charge dominates. So the model assumes that the carrier concentration is such that the space charge creates the electric field. So if the contacts are Ohmic, that allows easy injection, so the space charge can build up. If they were Schottky, maybe the injection is limited, so the current wouldn't be space-charge limited but instead limited by the contact.

So, the correct conditions would be single-carrier, trap-free, Ohmic contacts, and negligible diffusion (so drift-dominated). So looking at the options:

Option B says "no carrier injection barrier" (so Ohmic) and negligible diffusion current. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, option B says "no carrier injection barrier" and "single-carrier". So that would match. What about option A? Option A says "Ohmic contact" (so no barrier) and "negligible drift current", which doesn't make sense because the Mott-Gurney equation is about drift current. So option A is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The Mott-Gurney equation, which describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, is given by:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

This equation is valid under specific conditions. The analysis of the options is as follows:

- **Option A**: This option states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation is fundamentally based on drift current, as the space charge builds up and creates an electric field that accelerates carriers. If drift current is negligible, the equation would not apply. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This option specifies a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (implying Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is dominated by drift, with diffusion being negligible. Additionally, Ohmic contacts allow for efficient carrier injection, which aligns with the assumptions of the equation. This option is consistent with the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.

- **Option C**: This option describes a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts introduce a barrier that complicates the current injection process, potentially affecting the space-charge build-up. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes efficient carrier injection, which is not guaranteed with a Schottky contact. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: This option refers to a two-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation is specifically applicable to single-carrier devices, as the inclusion of both electrons and holes introduces complexities that are not accounted for in the equation. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

In conclusion, the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current, as described in **Option B**.
