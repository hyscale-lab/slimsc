Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax—right, that's the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. So parallax is inversely related to distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their actual distances (or distances in real space) are spread out uniformly. But wait, when we observe them, their distribution in terms of parallax might not be uniform because parallax depends on the distance. So the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax (like, per light-year of parallax or something) changes as parallax changes.

Let me think. Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds, and it's given by the formula plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1/plx. Now, if the stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density of stars is constant. So, for a given volume, the number of stars is proportional to the volume.

Wait, but how does that translate to the number of stars in a given range of parallax? Let's break it down. Let's say we have a small range of parallax, delta plx. Each star in that range corresponds to a certain distance range. Parallax is inversely related to distance, so a small delta plx would correspond to a range of distances from d to d + delta d, where delta d is related to delta plx.

Wait, let's get the exact relationship. We have d = 1/plx. So delta d = derivative of d with respect to plx times delta plx. The derivative of d = 1/plx is dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense. The magnitude of delta d would be (1/plx^2) * delta plx. So delta d is proportional to (1/plx^2) * delta plx.

But since we're looking for the number of stars per unit parallax, let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + delta d. The volume of a thin spherical shell is approximately 4π d² delta d. So the number of stars in that shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density (n), which is the number of stars per unit volume.

So number of stars N = n * 4π d² delta d. But delta d is (1/plx²) delta plx. Substituting d = 1/plx, we get d² = 1/(plx²). So N = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * [ (1/plx^2) delta plx ) ].

Wait, hold on. Let me substitute delta d correctly. So delta d is (1/plx²) delta plx. So N = n *4 π (d^2) (delta d) = n *4 π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (1/(plx^2) delta plx ). So N = n *4 π (1/plx^4) delta plx.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. That means N divided by delta plx. So (N / delta plx ) = n *4 π (1/ plx^4 ).

Wait, but the question is phrased as "number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx." So what's the number per unit plx? That would be the number N for a delta plx of 1, divided by 1. So (N / (delta plx)) = n *4 π (1/ plx^4 ). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Because when plx increases (i.e., when the stars are farther away), the number of stars per unit plx should decrease, right? Because higher plx means lower density of stars since they're farther apart. But according to this, the number decreases as 1/plx^4, which makes sense, because as you go to larger plx (farther away), the number of stars you can see in each unit of plx drops off more steeply.

But wait, let's double-check. Number density n is constant. The surface area is 4π d². For a given plx, d=1/plx, so surface area is 4π (1/plx)^2. Now, the volume element (delta d) for a given delta plx is delta d = (1/(plx)^2) delta plx. So the volume of the shell is 4π d² delta d = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2 delta plx) )= 4 π (1/plx^4) delta plx. Multiply by n to get N. So N = n *4 π (1/plx^4) delta plx. So the number per unit plx is N/(delta plx) = n *4 π / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A, ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but another thought: is this considering the entire volume up to that plx? Because if the distribution is uniform, maybe the number of stars within a certain distance is proportional to volume. Let's think in terms of cumulative number, but the question is about per unit plx, so maybe the first approach is correct.

Alternatively, if the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a thin shell (between distance d and d + delta d) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4 pi d² delta d. Now, the number per unit of delta d would be (n *4 pi d² delta d) / delta d) = n 4 pi d². So it's proportional to d². But we need the number per unit plx. So delta plx is (1/d^2) delta d as before. So delta d = d^2 delta plx. Substituting into the expression, number per unit plx would be number per delta d divided by delta plx. So n *4 pi d² / (d² delta plx / delta plx )) ? Not sure, getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. Then the number per unit plx is (n *4 pi (1/plx)^2) * (delta d) ) / delta plx. But delta d is (1/plx²) delta plx. So substituting in, the number per unit plx is n *4 pi (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) delta plx / delta plx. Because delta plx is the denominator. So the delta plx cancels out, leaving n *4 pi / plx^4.

So yes, so the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach: the number of stars within a certain parallax range. Let me think about integrating. Number of stars with plx less than p is proportional to the volume up to distance d=1/p. So Volume = (4/3) pi d³. So N(p) ∝ d³ = (1/p)^3. So N(p) ∝ 1/p^3. But that's the cumulative number. The differential number, dN/dp, would be the rate of change of N with p. So dN/dp = d/dp (n * (4/3 pi (1/p)^3 )) ) = n *4/3 pi * (-3) (1/p)^4 )= -4 n pi (1/p)^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4, which matches the earlier conclusion.

So the correct answer is option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax is inversely related to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d},
\]

where \(d\) is the distance to the star. For a small range of parallax \(\Delta \text{plx}\), the corresponding distance range is:

\[
\Delta d = \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}.
\]

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell between distances \(d\) and \(d + \Delta d\) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4 \pi d^2 \Delta d.
\]

Substituting \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and \(\Delta d = \Delta \text{plx}/\text{plx}^2\), the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4 \pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4 \pi \Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the number density of stars \(n\), so the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\text{Number per unit plx} = \frac{\text{Number of stars}}{\Delta \text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot 4 \pi \Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4 \cdot \Delta \text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot 4 \pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \(1/\text{plx}^4\). This result aligns with the fact that as parallax increases (stars are farther away), the number of stars per unit parallax decreases more steeply.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
