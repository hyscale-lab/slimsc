Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read through it again carefully.

So the scenario is that we've got a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR spectrum is mostly as expected except for two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is the expected amount. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. 

Then there's an LC-MS analysis done at elevated temperature, which shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So I need to figure out what's causing this.

Hmm, the NMR is showing two peaks for the same proton. Since the shifts are similar and the integral adds up, it's not splitting due to coupling because the coupling would affect the splitting, not the integral. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin. So maybe it's something else.

Wait, the peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So maybe the molecule is in some sort of conformational state, causing the proton to split into two environments, but that usually leads to different shifts and maybe a multiplet. Or perhaps it's something to do with diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, but in NMR, enantiomers don't split each other because they're mirror images. So if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would look the same as a single enantiomer because the environments are identical for each proton. So in that case, the NMR would just show a single peak. So that doesn't explain the two peaks.

So maybe it's diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would show different peaks. But wait, the alpha proton's environment is the same in both diastereomers? Or no. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is forming some kind of tautomer or another structure.

Wait, looking at the options. Option B is enantiomers, which probably doesn't explain the NMR. Option D is diastereomers. If the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers, each would have a different environment for the alpha protons, leading to two separate peaks.

But wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So if they're diastereomers, their mass would be the same because the molecular formula is the same. So that fits.

Wait, but why would the NMR show two peaks? If there are diastereomers, each would have a different environment for the alpha protons, but their shifts might be similar if the structures are similar. But in that case, the peaks might split into a multiplet or not? Or perhaps the diastereomers are in rapid equilibrium on the NMR timescale, leading to two separate peaks if the exchange is slow. Or if the diastereomers are not interconverting quickly.

Wait, but the question says the NMR spectrum is otherwise consistent with the expected molecule. So maybe the diastereomer is not the issue. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else.

Another possibility is that during the synthesis, there's some sort of coupling that's causing a double bond to form or something. Oh, wait, option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, I'm not sure I remember what that is. Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, an intermediate forms that has two possible coupling pathways, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the molecule is in a mixture of epimers. Epimers are a type of diastereomers that differ only in the configuration around one stereocenter. For example, if the alpha carbon has two different stereoisomers, that could cause the same proton to split into two peaks if there's restricted rotation or something.

Wait, but in the NMR, if the molecule is a racemic mixture (enantiomers), the peaks would overlap because the environments are mirror images. So the integral would be the same as a single peak. But in this case, the two peaks are for the same proton, so it's more likely that the molecule exists as diastereomers. Or perhaps, what if the molecule has a dynamic process, like a process where the proton exchanges between environments that are not interconverting on the NMR timescale?

Wait, but the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So perhaps the molecule has two different environments for that same proton. How could that happen? If the molecule has some kind of symmetry breaking, but that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a racemic mixture but with another type of stereoisomer. Wait, no. Enantiomers would not split into two peaks for the same proton.

Wait, another angle: the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of the same mass. So the molecular weight is the same, meaning same molecular formula. So perhaps it's a diastereomer. Because enantiomers have the same molecular weight but would co-elute in LC if the column isn't chiral. But wait, the question says that the LC-MS is done at elevated temperature. Hmm, perhaps the elevated temperature is causing the compounds to elute at different times. But if the compounds are enantiomers, they would have the same retention time on a regular LC column, unless it's a chiral column. But the question doesn't specify.

Wait, but the problem says both peaks have the same mass spectrumâ€”so same molecular weight, same structure. So the peaks are for the same compound but different forms. So perhaps the compound is a diastereomer or an enantiomer mixture.

Wait, but the NMR is the same as expected except for this. So the diastereomer scenario: if the compound is a diastereomer, the NMR would show different shifts for some protons. So, for the alpha-proton, which is the same in both diastereomers? No, wait, if it's a diastereomer, the environment would be different for some protons but not necessarily all.

Wait, perhaps the issue is not in the LC-MS but in the NMR. So the NMR is showing two peaks for the same proton, which could be due to splitting from coupling with another proton, but the question says the coupling pattern rules that out. So maybe the splitting isn't due to spin-spin coupling but perhaps something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in a dynamic process, such as a process where the proton is in different environments but interconverts on a timescale that's not fast enough. But that would lead to a singlet if the interconversion is fast.

Wait, but the NMR shows separate peaks, not a singlet. That suggests that the two environments are not averaging. So maybe the molecule has two distinct diastereomers, each with a different environment for that alpha-proton, leading to two separate peaks.

But if the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, the peaks would integrate to 1H each, but the total would be 2H. Wait, no, the question says together they integrate to 1H. So each peak integrates to roughly the same amount, adding up to 1H. So maybe each peak is 0.5H. That suggests that for each molecule, the alpha proton is split into two environments, but that doesn't make sense. Because each molecule has one alpha proton.

Wait, no. If the molecule itself has two alpha protons but in equivalent environments, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is due to the presence of a diastereomer with a stereocenter that leads to two different environments for the same proton. For example, if the compound has a stereocenter adjacent to the alpha carbon, leading to different environments in different diastereomers.

Wait, but if two diastereomers are present, each would have their own set of peaks. So the same alpha proton in each would have different shifts, leading to two separate peaks in the NMR. So the integral would add up to 1H if each diastereomer contributes 0.5H. But wait, no, each molecule has one alpha proton. So if there are two diastereomers, each would contribute their own alpha proton's peak. So the integral for each peak would be 1H each, but the question says the two peaks together integrate to 1H. So that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe the diastereomers are in a 1:1 ratio, but each has the same alpha proton? No, that can't be. Each diastereomer would have its own shift for the alpha proton.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about diastereomers but about something else. Let's think about the options again.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Then the LC-MS would show a peak with a lower mass, and the NMR would have some extra peaks not matching the expected molecule. But the question says the NMR is consistent except for two peaks for the same alpha proton, and the LC-MS has same mass. So the extra peak in LC-MS would have a different mass. So option A is probably not correct.

Option B: Enantiomers. As I thought before, the NMR would not split the peaks because they're mirror images, unless the NMR is run on a chiral column, but the question doesn't mention that. Also, the LC-MS would show two peaks if the column isn't chiral. But the question says the peaks have same mass, so they must be the same compound. Enantiomers would have same mass, so that's possible. But the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks for the same proton because they are enantiomers. So I don't think B is correct.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Hmm, not sure what this means. Maybe during the formation of the amide, two different coupling partners are involved, but I'm not familiar with this term. Maybe it's a situation where the amide bond formation leads to two different coupling patterns for the alpha protons. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's some other coupling. Alternatively, perhaps it's a situation where the alpha proton is coupling with two different protons, but that would cause multiplet splitting, not two separate peaks.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. So the molecule has stereocenters, and the synthesis didn't go to full diastereomeric excess, resulting in a mixture. That would cause the NMR to show two separate peaks for the same proton if the diastereomers have different environments for that proton. But wait, in that case, each diastereomer would contribute its own set of peaks, not just two for the same proton. So maybe the diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a stereocenter that affects the alpha proton's environment. For example, if the alpha carbon is a stereocenter, then the diastereomers would have different environments for that proton. So when you have a 50:50 mixture, you see two peaks in the NMR.

But wait, for a single stereocenter, the diastereomer would be enantiomers if there's only one stereocenter. No, wait, enantiomers are a type of diastereomer when there's only one stereocenter. Wait, no. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images, which are a specific type of diastereomer when there's only one chiral center. So if a molecule has one chiral center, the diastereomers are the same as the enantiomers. But in that case, the NMR would not split into two peaks because they are mirror images.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, with same integral. So the two peaks are due to two different environments for the same proton in the same molecule. But that's not possible unless the molecule has some dynamic process that changes the environment, like some sort of fluxionality.

Wait, but the problem says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's something else. For instance, if the proton is being split by coupling with another nucleus that isn't a proton, but that's less likely because in 1H NMR, coupling with other spins is less common.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a stereocenter that leads to the same proton being in different environments in different diastereomers. So when both diastereomers are present, you get two peaks in the NMR. But wait, if the molecule has two stereocenters, each diastereomer would have a different environment. So for each diastereomer, the alpha proton's shift would be different, leading to two separate peaks each integrating to 0.5H if present in equal amounts.

Wait, but the integral adds up to 1H. So if each diastereomer has 0.5H, that adds to 1H. So for two diastereomers, each with the same environment for the alpha proton, but that's not possible because diastereomers have different environments.

Wait, maybe the molecule has two stereocenters, but in such a way that in each diastereomer, the alpha proton's environment is the same. But that would mean the diastereomers are identical for that proton, which can't be. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about epimers. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in the configuration around one stereocenter. If the alpha carbon is a stereocenter, then the epimers would have different environments for the alpha proton, leading to separate NMR peaks. So if the compound is a 50:50 mix of two epimers, the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton.

But wait, the question says that in the NMR, the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. If they are epimers, their shifts might be similar but not identical. So that could fit.

And in the LC-MS, since the molecular formula is the same, they would elute as two separate peaks if the column can separate them. But why would they be separated on the LC-MS? Unless the column is chiral, but the question doesn't specify that. Wait, but the problem says the LC-MS was run at elevated temperature. Maybe that affects the retention time, causing the diastereomers to separate more. Because diastereomers can have different physical properties, like solubility and interactions with the column, leading to different retention times.

So putting it together, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton because it's a mixture of diastereomers, each with a slightly different environment for that proton. The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass because the diastereomers have same molecular weight. So the correct answer would be D) mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but earlier I thought that diastereomers would have different shifts for multiple protons, not just the same one. So if the diastereomers are enantiomers, their shifts would be same but that's not the case here. So maybe it's a different kind of diastereomer.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the presence of a double bond and some kind of coupling, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the problem states that the peaks have the same mass. So the molecular formula is the same, meaning they are isomers, either constitutional, enantiomers, or diastereomers. Enantiomers have same mass; diastereomers also same mass if same formula.

So if the answer is diastereomers (D), that would fit the LC-MS. And the NMR would show two peaks if the diastereomers have different environments for the same proton.

So in conclusion, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (totaling 1H). The LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass spectrum as the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **NMR Spectrum**:
   - The two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggest two distinct environments for the proton, likely due to stereoisomerism.
   - The integrals add up to 1H, indicating that the two peaks correspond to equal contributions from two forms of the compound.
   - Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the explanation, so the splitting is not due to proton-proton interactions.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum indicate that the compound exists as two isomeric forms with the same molecular formula.
   - Elevated temperature likely caused the isomers to separate during chromatography, as diastereomers can have different physical properties (e.g., solubility, interaction with the column).

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **(A) Contaminated with a precursor**: This would result in an additional peak in the LC-MS with a different mass, which is not observed. Thus, this option is incorrect.
   - **(B) Mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and would not split the NMR signal for the same proton because their environments are identical. Additionally, LC-MS would show a single peak for enantiomers unless a chiral column is used, which is not mentioned. Therefore, this option is unlikely.
   - **(C) Double coupling during amide-bond formation**: This term is unclear, but it likely refers to spin-spin coupling, which is explicitly ruled out in the question. Thus, this option is not viable.
   - **(D) Mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereomers have different physical and chemical environments due to differences in stereochemistry. This would explain the two distinct NMR peaks for the same alpha-proton, as the two diastereomers create different environments for the proton. The LC-MS results also align with this explanation, as diastereomers have the same molecular formula and can separate into two peaks based on their distinct physical properties.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This accounts for the two distinct NMR peaks for the same alpha-proton and the two LC-MS peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum.
