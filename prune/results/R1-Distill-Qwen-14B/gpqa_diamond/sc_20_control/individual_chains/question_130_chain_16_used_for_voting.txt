Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting quasars using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. And we need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission/absorption line in hydrogen. It's in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So when a quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs that light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, creating a absorption line.

But wait, the problem is about redshift. Because if the cloud is moving away from us, the wavelength of the absorbed light would shift to longer wavelengths (redshifted). So the observed wavelength would be longer than the rest wavelength.

So the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs it at 1216 Angstroms. But if the cloud is at a high redshift, the observed wavelength would be longer than that. But wait, optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths beyond a certain point because the atmosphere absorbs them. Oh right, the atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV and some infrared. So ground-based optical telescopes can't see into the UV beyond about 300 nm or so? Or wait, visible light is about 400-700 nm, but UV is lower than that. So if the observed wavelength is in the optical range, that implies that the Lyman alpha line (originally at 121.6 nm, wait 0.1216 micrometers) has been redshifted into the optical range.

Wait, wait, let me get the units straight. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So for ground-based optical telescopes, which can't observe UV, the only way we can detect the absorption is if the Lyman alpha line has been redshifted into the optical range.

So the observed wavelength (obs) must be greater than the cutoff for optical, which I think is about 300 nm (since below that is UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere). So if the observed wavelength is at least 300 nm, we can detect it with optical telescopes.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact cutoff. Maybe the cutoff is around 300 nm? Or perhaps longer. Let me think. The atmosphere is mostly opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm, so it's called the UV cutoff. So anything below that is not observable from the ground.

So for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical range, the observed wavelength (lambda_obs) must be >= 300 nm. Because if it's less than that, we can't see it from the ground.

So the redshift z is given by (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1. Lambda_rest is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm.

So lambda_obs should be >= 300 nm. Let's compute z.

z = (300 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1.

Calculating that: 300 / 121.6 ≈ 2.468. So 2.468 -1 = 1.468.

So z should be at least approximately 1.47.

Wait, but if the observed wavelength is longer than 300 nm, then the redshift would be higher. So the lower limit for z is when lambda_obs = 300 nm.

So z_min = (300 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 1.47.

Looking at the options: option B is 1.2, D is 1.9. Wait, 1.47 is between B and D, but the options don't have 1.47. Hmm.

Wait wait, perhaps the optical telescopes can actually observe a bit beyond 300 nm. Let me think again. The atmospheric cutoff for UV is about 300 nm, but perhaps modern instruments can go a bit lower. Or maybe the cutoff is considered to be at 310 nm or 320 nm? Let me verify. I think the atmospheric transmission in the UV is poor below about 300 nm. So perhaps the cutoff is at 300 nm.

Wait another thought: hydrogen's Lyman-alpha transition is at 121.6 nm. So when the quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs at 121.6 nm in the rest frame of the cloud. But if the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength is stretched.

So the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

We want lambda_obs to be >= 300 nm (so that it's in the optical range where ground-based telescopes can see it).

So 121.6 * (1+z) >= 300.

Solving for z:

1 + z >= 300 / 121.6.

300 / 121.6 is approximately 2.468. So 1 + z >= 2.468 → z >= 1.468.

So the minimal redshift is around 1.47.

Looking at the options, the closest higher value is D) 1.9, but that's higher than 1.47. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the cutoff. Maybe the optical telescopes can only observe up to about 400 nm (visible light ends around 700 nm, but the lower end is 400 nm). Wait, no, that's not right. Visible light ranges from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So for Lyman-alpha to be in the visible, it must be redshifted to at least 400 nm.

Wait, wait, that would be a higher redshift. Let me recalculate.

If lambda_obs >= 400 nm, then:

z = (400 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 3.29 - 1 = 2.29.

So z >= approximately 2.29.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is just above this. So maybe the lower limit is around 2.29, so 2.4 would be the next option.

But wait, earlier I thought the cutoff is at 300 nm, but if the optical telescopes can't go beyond 400 nm (visible light starts at 400 nm), then perhaps the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted into the visible range.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's think again.

The question is about detecting the absorption line in optical wavelengths. So the observed wavelength must be in the optical range, which is roughly 400-700 nm. If the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm, then for it to be observed in the optical, it must be redshifted so that 121.6*(1+z) >= 400 nm.

So solving for z:

(1 + z) = 400 / 121.6 ≈ 3.29 → z≈2.29.

But none of the options exactly match 2.29. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the closest is C)2.4, but that's a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the cutoff is lower. Because maybe the instrument can detect wavelengths just into the near UV, perhaps below 400 nm. Let's say 350 nm is the limit. Then:

z = (350/121.6) -1 ≈ 2.88 -1 = 1.88.

So z ~1.88. The options have D as 1.9, which is very close.

So perhaps the correct approach is to find when lambda_obs >= cutoff. If the cutoff is 350 nm, then z≈1.88, so 1.9 is the minimal z.

But I'm not sure about the exact cutoff. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Lyman limit. Wait, the Lyman series transitions: Lyman alpha is 121.6 nm, and Lyman beta is 102.6 nm, but the Lyman limit is about 91 nm. So, Lyman alpha is the first line in the Lyman series that has a wavelength that can be observed from space. But here, the problem is about ground-based telescopes.

Wait, but for ground-based telescopes, UV is difficult. So any absorption line in the UV would be hard to observe, unless it's redshifted into the optical.

But let me think again. The Lyman-alpha absorption is at 121.6 nm. If the object (quasar) is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 121.6*(1+z) Angstrom.

Wait, but wait, 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm. So to have the observed wavelength in the optical, which is about 400 nm to 700 nm, then 121.6*(1+z) must be >=400 nm.

So 1+z =400/121.6 ≈3.29 → z≥2.29.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. The options are C)2.4 and A)3. So 2.4 is just above 2.29, so option C would be the minimal redshift.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z where it's just entering the optical range. So for z=2.29, it's at 400 nm. But the options don't have 2.29. The closest higher is 2.4.

Wait, but let me think about whether the Lyman-alpha line is entirely in the optical. Or if part of it is in the optical. Because if the observed wavelength is, say, 400 nm, that's violet, and the telescope can observe it. So the lower limit is when the line is just in the optical.

So the minimal z is when 121.6*(1+z) equals 400 nm → z= (400/121.6) -1 ≈ 2.29. So any z above that would have the line in the optical.

So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal redshift is about 2.29. The options are:

A)3: higher than 2.29.

B)1.2: too low.

C)2.4: just above 2.29.

D)1.9: lower than 2.29.

So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is when z >=2.29. So the minimal is 2.29, but since the options don't have that, the next higher option is C)2.4.

Wait, but wait. Let me also consider that the quasar's light is in the optical when it's emitted. Then, if the quasar is at a high redshift, the emitted optical light would be redshifted into the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can observe. But the question is about the absorption line from the hydrogen cloud.

Ah, right. The quasar emits light across a broad spectrum, including the Lyman-alpha wavelength (if it's a source of ionizing photons). But the hydrogen cloud in front of it absorbs at 121.6 nm. So for us to see that absorption line, it must have been redshifted into the optical range.

So the quasar's own light would be redshifted, but the absorption line's redshift is determined by the cloud's redshift (assuming the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar, which it is because it's between us and the quasar).

Wait, no. The cloud is in front of the quasar, so it's closer to us, so lower redshift. So the cloud's redshift is the determining factor for the absorption line.

So the hydrogen cloud is at redshift z, so the Lyman-alpha line is observed at 121.6*(1+z) Angstroms.

So for us to detect it in optical, 121.6*(1+z) must be less than about 700 nm (the end of visible light). So if z is 3, 121.6 *4 = 486.4 nm, which is blue. That's visible.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit—what's the smallest z where the line is still in the optical. So the smallest z where 121.6*(1+z) is just in the optical.

Wait, but 121.6 nm * (1+z) = 400 nm → z= (400/121.6)-1 ≈2.29.

So, for z=2.29, the line is at 400 nm (violet). So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any z above that would have the line in the visible.

So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. The options are 2.4 and 1.9. So 2.4 is higher than 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29, so any z above that is acceptable. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the closest option is C)2.4.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the question is about the lower limit in terms of being able to detect the line, not the exact cutoff. So perhaps the Lyman-alpha line is observed in the near-UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see. So the minimal z is when the line is just beyond the atmospheric cutoff.

The atmospheric cutoff is at about 300 nm. So, if 121.6*(1+z) =300 nm → z= (300/121.6) -1 ≈1.468.

So if the cloud is at z>1.468, the line would be observed beyond 300 nm, which is the limit of what ground-based optical can see. Because below 300 nm is UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere.

So if z=1.468, the observed wavelength is 300 nm. If the cloud is at z=1.468, then the line is at 300 nm, but that's at the limit. But ground-based telescopes can't observe below 300 nm, so anything above that is okay.

Wait, no: wait, wait. If the observed wavelength is 300 nm, that's the cutoff. If the cloud is at z=1.468, the line is at 300 nm, which is the limit. So the minimal z is 1.468, meaning anything above that allows the line to be observed in the optical.

So the lower limit on the redshift is z=1.468. The options are B)1.2, D)1.9.

So 1.468 is higher than B and lower than D. So, the minimal z is about 1.47. So the lower limit is when z is 1.47. So any cloud with z>1.47 would have the Lyman-alpha line in the optical, which can be observed.

So which option is the lower limit? The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is 1.47. So the smallest z you can have that allows the line to be observed is 1.47. So the lower limit is z=1.47. So any object with z above 1.47 can be detected.

So the options are 1.2, 1.9, etc. So 1.47 is between 1.2 and 1.9. So the lower limit is 1.47, so any z above that is acceptable. So the minimal acceptable z is 1.47, so any z higher than that will work. So the lower limit is 1.47.

But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is 1.47, so any object with z >=1.47 can be detected.

But the options don't have 1.47. The closest higher is D)1.9, which is 1.9.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the lower limit on z. So the minimal z is when the line is just entering the optical. So if the minimal is z=1.47, then any z >=1.47 is acceptable. So the lower limit is 1.47.

But the options don't have that. So which option is the minimal z that allows for detection. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as the lower limit, so the minimal possible. So, the minimal redshift for the cloud to be detected is about 1.47, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the next higher option is D)1.9.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, the redshift formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z)

We want lambda_obs >= the cutoff (e.g., 300 nm).

So z >= (cutoff / lambda_rest) -1.

If the cutoff is 300 nm, then:

z >= (300 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 2.468 -1 → 1.468.

So z must be at least approximately 1.47.

Looking at the options, D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.47. So if the minimal z is 1.47, then the lower limit is 1.47, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the quasar's redshift, not the cloud's. Or maybe it's about the cloud's redshift relative to the quasar.

Wait, no. The cloud is in front of the quasar, so it's at a lower redshift. So the cloud's redshift determines the observed wavelength.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the redshift the wrong way. Let's think: if the cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman alpha line (121.6 nm) is observed at 121.6*(1+z) nm.

We need 121.6*(1+z) > 300 nm, so that it's in the optical.

So z > (300/121.6) -1 ≈1.468.

So the minimal redshift is about 1.47.

Now, the options are B)1.2, D)1.9.

So the minimal is 1.47, so the lower limit is when z is around 1.47. So objects with z less than 1.47 won't be detected, because the line would be in the UV, which is blocked by the atmosphere.

So the lower limit on z is 1.47. So the minimal z is 1.47. So any cloud with z >=1.47 would have the line in the optical.

So the options are: B is 1.2 (too low), D is 1.9 (higher than 1.47). So the minimal is 1.47, so the lower limit is 1.47. So any z above that is acceptable. So the answer would be the minimal z is 1.47, which isn't an option, but the next higher is D)1.9.

Wait, but wait: the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects". So the minimal z is 1.47. So any z ≥1.47 is acceptable. So the lower limit is 1.47, so the minimal redshift is 1.47. So the answer is the smallest option that is above 1.47, which is D)1.9.

Wait, but the options include 2.4 (option C). So why would the answer be 1.9 and not 2.4?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cutoff. If the cutoff is higher, say 350 nm, then:

z=(350/121.6) -1≈ (2.88) -1=1.88.

So z must be ≥1.88. So the minimal z is about 1.88, which is very close to option D)1.9.

So perhaps the correct cutoff is 350 nm. So the answer is D)1.9.

But why would the cutoff be 350 nm? Because maybe the question assumes that the optical telescopes can only observe up to 350 nm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the Lyman-alpha wavelength needs to be observed in the visible part of the spectrum, which starts at 400 nm. So:

z=(400/121.6)-1≈2.29.

So minimal z is about 2.29, so the closest option is C)2.4.

So now I'm confused because it depends on the assumed cutoff.

Looking back, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So we need to find the minimal z where the Lyman-alpha line is in the optical.

But what is the optical range? That's 400-700 nm. So the minimal z is when 121.6*(1+z) =400 → z≈2.29.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29, so the lower limit is that. So the answer would be option C)2.4, as it's the next higher option.

But wait, if the cloud's redshift is 2.4, then lambda_obs is 121.6 *3.4=413.44 nm, which is in the violet part of visible light. So yes, detectable.

So, for z=2.4, the line is at 413 nm (violet). For z=1.9, it's 121.6*(2.9)=352.64 nm. That's near the UV. Wait, but can ground-based telescopes observe 352 nm?

Hmm, 352 nm is in the near-UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere. So if the cutoff is around 300 nm, then 352 is above that. So for z=1.9, the line is at 352 nm, which is in the near-UV. But ground-based telescopes can't observe that. So the line would not be detected.

Wait, but this contradicts earlier calculations. So perhaps I'm mixing up the direction of redshift.

Wait, wait, let me do the calculation again: for z=1.9, lambda_obs=121.6*(1+1.9)=121.6*2.9=352.64 nm. So that's 352 nm, which is in the near-UV.

So if the atmospheric cutoff is at 300 nm, then 352 is above that, meaning it's in the optical range. Wait, but 352 nm is in the UV, right?

Wait no, visible light starts at 400 nm. So 352 is UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere. So ground-based telescopes can't see it.

So for the Lyman-alpha line to be in the optical (visible), the observed wavelength must be ≥400 nm. So for that, z must be ≥2.29.

So option C is 2.4, which is the first option above 2.29.

So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the answer would be C)2.4.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier calculation where when the line is at 300 nm, the redshift is about 1.47. So in that case, the line would be at 300 nm, which is in the UV, and the ground-based telescopes can't observe it. So the minimal z is when the line is just in the optical, i.e., 400 nm.

So I think the correct approach is to calculate when the line is at 400 nm. So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the answer is option C)2.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of objects such that the Lyman-alpha absorption line (rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \)) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) falls within the optical range. Optical ground-based telescopes can only observe wavelengths above the atmospheric cutoff, which is approximately \( 300 \, \text{nm} \). However, the visible spectrum starts at \( 400 \, \text{nm} \), so it is reasonable to assume the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted into the visible range for detection.

The relationship between the observed wavelength and redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Rearranging for \( z \):

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

### Case 1: Lyman-alpha line at the visible spectrum limit (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 400 \, \text{nm} \))
Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 400 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
z = \frac{400}{121.6} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Any redshift \( z \geq 2.29 \) will place the Lyman-alpha line in the visible range.

### Case 2: Lyman-alpha line at the atmospheric cutoff (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 300 \, \text{nm} \))
If we instead assume the cutoff is \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 300 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
z = \frac{300}{121.6} - 1 \approx 2.47 - 1 = 1.47
\]

However, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 300 \, \text{nm} \) is in the near-UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere and cannot be detected by optical telescopes. Therefore, the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted into the visible range (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 400 \, \text{nm} \)) for detection.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A (3):** \( z = 3 \) corresponds to \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 121.6 \cdot 4 = 486.4 \, \text{nm} \), which is in the visible range. This is valid but not the minimal redshift.
- **Option B (1.2):** \( z = 1.2 \) corresponds to \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 121.6 \cdot 2.2 = 267.5 \, \text{nm} \), which is in the UV and undetectable by optical telescopes.
- **Option C (2.4):** \( z = 2.4 \) corresponds to \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 121.6 \cdot 3.4 = 413.4 \, \text{nm} \), which is in the visible range. This is the closest option to the calculated minimal redshift \( z \approx 2.29 \).
- **Option D (1.9):** \( z = 1.9 \) corresponds to \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 121.6 \cdot 2.9 = 352.6 \, \text{nm} \), which is in the near-UV and undetectable by optical telescopes.

### Conclusion
The minimal redshift for the Lyman-alpha line to be detectable in the visible range is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest and valid choice is \( z = 2.4 \).
