Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve the state vector and the corresponding operator. 

The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, is that a column vector? I think so. So the electron's spin state is represented by a two-component vector. Let me write that down. The state vector ψ is [3i; 4]. Or in ket notation, |ψ⟩ = 3i |↑⟩ + 4 |↓⟩, assuming the first component is spin-up and the second is spin-down. 

The operator for S_y is given, which is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because the spin operators are S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i. So σ_y is the Pauli matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the S_y operator is (ħ/2) * that matrix.

The expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. So I need to compute this. Let me break it down.

First, I'll represent ψ as a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose of ψ, which is ψ†, would be [ -4i, 3 ]. Wait, because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, but since it's a row vector, the components are [3i*, 4*], so [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait wait, no. Wait, the original vector is (3i,4). So ψ† would be [3i*, 4*], which is [-3i, 4], correct.

Wait, no. Wait, the original state is (3i,4) as a column vector. So ψ is:

[3i]
[4]

Then, ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*], which is [-3i, 4], because 3i's complex conjugate is -3i, and 4's conjugate is 4.

So now, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Let me write that out.

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So ψ† multiplied by S_y is (ħ/2) times ψ† multiplied by σ_y.

So let's compute ψ† σ_y first. σ_y is the matrix:

[0    -i]
[i     0]

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Multiplying ψ† with σ_y:

First element: (-3i)(0) + 4(i) → 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element: (-3i)(-i) + 4(0) → (3i^2) → since i^2 is -1, 3*(-1) = -3. So 3i^2 is -3, but wait let me compute it step by step.

Wait, no. Let me compute each term.

Wait, no, when I multiply a row vector by a matrix, each element is a dot product with the columns of the matrix.

Wait, no, that's when you have a row vector multiplied by a matrix, each element of the resulting row vector is the sum of the products of the row elements with the corresponding column elements.

So ψ† is [a, b], σ_y is [[c, d], [e, f]]. So ψ† σ_y would be [ a*c + b*e , a*d + b*f ].

So for our case, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So first element: (-3i)*0 + 4*(i) → 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 → (3i^2) +0 → 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Then, we multiply this by ψ. So [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i; 4].

Wait, ψ is [3i;4], so when we compute the product [4i, -3] * [3i;4], it's 4i*(3i) + (-3)*4.

Compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

(-3) *4 = -12.

So total is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

But wait, remember that the S_y operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y. So the entire expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this result.

Wait, no. Let me go back. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ψ† σ_y ψ ].

Wait, the calculation I just did was ψ† σ_y ψ, which was [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i;4], giving -24. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the possible answers have fractions, like 12 hbar/25, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check each step.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the state vector. Let me re-express the state. The state is (3i,4), which is a column vector with first component 3i, second 4. So ψ = [3i;4].

Calculating ψ† is [3i*, 4*], which is [-3i,4]. Because 3i is 3 times i, its complex conjugate is -3i. 4 is real, so conjugate is 4.

Now, ψ† σ_y is [ (-3i)*0 + 4*(i) , (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 ].

First element: 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (3i^2) +0 → 3*(-1) =-3.

So ψ† σ_y = [4i, -3].

Then, multiply by ψ: [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i;4].

Which is 4i*(3i) + (-3)*4.

4i*3i = 12 i² = -12.

-3*4 =-12.

Total is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are fractions. For example, option A is -12 ħ/25. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Oh wait, perhaps the state is a normalized state? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their inner product with themselves is 1.

Let me check if the given state is normalized. Compute ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is sqrt(25)=5. So the state isn't normalized. Therefore, I should probably normalize it before computing the expectation value.

Ah, right! So the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, because the state isn't normalized. Oh wait, no. Actually, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| (S_y) |ψ⟩ only when |ψ⟩ is normalized. If it's not, you have to normalize it. So maybe I need to normalize the state first.

In that case, the normalized state would be (1/5) [3i;4], because the norm is 5, as I found before. So the normalized ψ is (1/5)(3i,4). So the calculation would be (1/5)^2 times the previous expectation value.

Wait no. Let me think. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. Because the state isn't normalized. Oh wait, wait, no. No, the expectation value is (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩), because the state is |ψ⟩, not a unit vector.

So in our case, the expectation value would be ( ( [3i,4] S_y [3i;4] ) * ħ/2 ) / ( [3i,4] [3i;4] ) )

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate everything properly.

Let me recompute.

Compute ψ† S_y ψ, then divide by ψ† ψ.

First, compute ψ† S_y ψ without normalization.

We did that earlier and got -24 ħ/2, which is -12 ħ.

Wait, no. Wait, S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y. So ψ† S_y ψ = (ħ/2) ψ† σ_y ψ.

We computed ψ† σ_y ψ = -24. So ψ† S_y ψ = (ħ/2)(-24) = -12 ħ.

Now, the norm squared is ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 +16=25. So the expectation value is (-12 ħ) /25.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the state isn't normalized, so I should have normalized it. But the formula for expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, provided that |ψ⟩ is normalized. If it's not, you can still compute it, but it's not the expectation value of the physical state unless the state is normalized. So perhaps the correct approach is to include the normalization factor.

Wait, no. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ only when the state is not normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ when |ψ⟩ isn't a unit vector.

So in this problem, since the state isn't normalized, the expectation value is (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩).

Wait, but in our first calculation, ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ was -12 ħ, and ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is 25. So the expectation value would be (-12 ħ) /25. So that's option A.

Looking back at the options, option A is -12ħ/25. So the correct answer should be option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the given spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \). Thus,  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **State Vector**: The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
   \]

4. **Normalization Factor**: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) to normalize the state:
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \psi = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]

5. **Matrix Multiplication**: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \):
   - \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \),
   - \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = 4i(3i) + (-3)(4) = 12(-1) - 12 = -24. \)

6. **Expectation Value**: Substitute into the formula:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
