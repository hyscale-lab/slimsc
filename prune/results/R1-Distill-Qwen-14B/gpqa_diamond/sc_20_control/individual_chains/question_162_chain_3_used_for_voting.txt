Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, the denominator looks like 4 minus (x² + y²), so that's 4 - r² if r² is x² + y². Oh, right, because r would be the radial coordinate in 2D, so r² is x² + y². So the denominator is 4 - r².

I remember that in general relativity, the metric often describes the geometry around a mass or a charge. Oh wait, this might be similar to the metric of a Schwarzchild or Reissner-Nordström solution, but maybe that's not exactly what's being asked here. Or perhaps it's a different kind of geometry.

The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... that's a term I've heard in the context of hyperbolic geometry, right? A pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. Or maybe it's a term used in general relativity for a specific type of spacetime.

Wait, no, a pseudosphere is also called a tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure how that connects to the metric given. Alternatively, sometimes, especially in higher dimensions, a pseudosphere might refer to a sphere in a spacetime context, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's take a step back. The metric is given in terms of x and y coordinates. So it's a 2-dimensional metric because it's only involving dx and dy. So this is a two-dimensional spacetime? Or perhaps a spatial slice? Either way, the area would involve integrating over a region.

So the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, to find the area, I probably need to compute the area element in this metric. The area element in a 2D metric is given by the determinant of the metric tensor, right?

Wait, the metric tensor g has components g_xx, g_xy, g_yx, g_yy. Since this metric is diagonal (no cross terms), the determinant would be (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²). But since there's no g_xy (off-diagonal terms are zero), the determinant is just g_xx * g_yy.

Looking at the metric, both dx² and dy² are multiplied by the same factor, 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric tensor is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². So the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, but the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dr dθ, right? Or wait, perhaps I should express it in polar coordinates because r² is x² + y², which suggests polar coordinates would make this easier.

So in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² becomes r² dθ² + dr². Wait, no, wait: (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 in polar is (dr)^2 + r^2 (dθ)^2. So substituting, the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So to find the area element, which is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Let's compute det g here.

The metric in polar coordinates (r,θ) is diagonal as well. The components are g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = [32 r²]/(4 - r²). Because when you write the metric in polar, you have g_rr, g_θθ, and the cross terms are zero. So the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ, because the off-diagonal terms are zero.

So det g = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dr dθ = [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ. Because sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ) is 32 r / (4 - r²), right?

Wait, because sqrt(a^2 b^2) is |a b|, which is a b if they are positive. Since 32 is positive, and (4 - r²) could be positive or negative depending on r. But when considering the geometry, we likely have 4 - r² positive, so r <2, because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, which would cause the metric to blow up, suggesting a singularity.

So the area element is (32 r / (4 - r²)) dr dθ.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what a pseudosphere of radius 2 would look like in this metric. Maybe it's a coordinate sphere, meaning all points where r=2? But if r=2, then the denominator in the metric becomes zero, which would be a problem. So that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is a surface at constant r, but I'm not certain.

Wait, in the metric, when r approaches 2, the coefficient for dr² and r² dθ² becomes very large, indicating that the geometry changes drastically there. So perhaps the model here is similar to the hyperbolic plane, where the area element is given by something like (dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2)/(1 - r^2/a^2), but here it's 32/(4 - r^2) times the flat metric. So perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space.

Wait, hyperbolic space has negative curvature, and the metric would look like (dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2)/(1 - (r^2)/(a^2)) ), but I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, the metric could be a conformal metric.

In any case, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, but in hyperbolic space, the surface area of a sphere of radius r is 4π a^2 sinh(r/a), where a is the radius of curvature. But I'm not certain if that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere at radius r=2 would have an area that we can compute using the area element we found.

But wait, the area of a sphere in 2D is the circumference. Wait, no, in 2D, a sphere would be a circle. Wait, I'm getting confused because in 2D, a sphere is a circle. But the question mentions a pseudosphere, which in 2D is usually a tractrix or something else, but perhaps the context here is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using "pseudosphere" to refer to a sphere in a spacelike hypersurface with some metric. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's think about what the question is asking. It's a metric in 2D, so I think the pseudosphere refers to a 2D surface. But then, the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2 in this metric.

Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere here is the surface at a constant r=2. But wait, if I plug r=2 into the metric, the denominator becomes zero, so that's a problem. So perhaps the pseudosphere is the limit as r approaches 2 from below.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is that of a hyperbolic plane, and the pseudosphere is a circle of radius r=2. In hyperbolic geometry, the circumference of a circle of radius r is 2π sinh(r) a, where a is the radius of curvature. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression.

Wait, in the metric given, the coefficient is 32/(4 - r²). Let me factor that 32/(4 - r²) as 32/(4(1 - (r²)/4)) )= 8/(1 - (r²/4)).

So, 8/(1 - (r^2/4)) is like 1/(1 - (r^2)/(4)) multiplied by 8. Hmm, in the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space, the metric is usually (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²)^2, but that's a different form. Or wait, another model, perhaps the Beltrami-Klein model, but perhaps the metric here isn't matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different scaling. Let me think about the standard hyperbolic metric in 2D. The standard metric is:

ds^2 = dr^2 + (a^2 / cosh^2(r/a)) dθ^2.

Wait, but that's in radial coordinates. Alternatively, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is ds² = (4a²/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk, and a is the curvature radius. So perhaps in this problem, the metric is similar to a hyperbolic plane with a certain radius.

Let me compare the given metric to the Poincaré disk model. The given metric is (32/(4 - r²))(dr² + r² dθ²).

We can write 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4(1 - (r²/4))) )= 8/(1 - (r²/4)). So if I set 4a²=32, then a²=8. Or, wait, perhaps the denominator is 4 - r², so if I set r² = something.

Wait, if we consider the Poincaré metric as (4 a²)/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), but our given metric is 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²).

So perhaps this is similar to a hyperbolic metric scaled differently. Let me see: 8/(1 - (r²/4)) = (8) [1/(1 - (r²/4))].

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the scaling factor is 4 a²/(1 - r²)^2, which doesn't directly match. So perhaps the area element can be computed using the given metric.

Wait, the area element dA is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ, as I derived earlier.

If I want to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2, perhaps I need to integrate this area element over the appropriate region. But wait, in 2D, a sphere would be a circle, so the pseudosphere in this context could refer to a circle of radius 2 in this metric.

Wait, but in a metric space, the radius of a circle is defined in terms of the proper distance from the center. So perhaps the radius r=2 in the metric is not the same as in flat space. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the pseudosphere refers to a surface at a fixed coordinate r, but I'm not certain. If that's the case, then perhaps the circumference or area in this metric for a given r would be computed.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but in the metric, when r=2, the denominator becomes zero, leading the area element to blow up. So perhaps the area is infinite because the coordinate r=2 is a singularity, so integrating up to r=2 would give an infinite area.

Wait, but in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented within a finite radius (the disk of radius 1 in the model), but the actual hyperbolic plane is infinite. So maybe in this metric, the radius r=2 is the boundary, and beyond that is not part of the manifold. So the area up to r=2 would be finite, but beyond that, it's not.

Wait, no, if the metric is (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), then as r approaches 2 from below, the metric's coefficients approach infinity. So the region r < 2 is a part of the manifold, and r >=2 is another connected component or a singularity. So, perhaps the area is the integral from r=0 to r=2 of the area element.

So the area would be the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2.

But wait, let me do the integral. The area A is the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

So, A = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

We can compute the inner integral first. Let me compute ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2 r dr. So - (du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r/(u)] dr = ∫ [32 * ( - du/(2) ) ] / u = ∫ (-16) (1/u) du.

The limits when r=0: u=4. When r=2: u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (-16/u) du.

Which is the same as ∫ from 0 to4 of (16/u) du.

Wait, because flipping the limits removes the negative sign. So ∫ (16/u ) du from 0 to 4 is 16 ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4.

But ∫ (1/u) du is ln |u| + C. So evaluating from 0 to4 would be 16 [ln 4 - ln 0]. But ln 0 is negative infinity, so this integral would diverge to infinity. Therefore, the area would be infinite.

Wait, but that can't be possible because the region up to r=2 is finite in the coordinate system. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me recompute the integral. Let me compute ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → (-du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r/(u)] dr = ∫ (32/(u)) (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-32/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

Which is (-16) [ln u] evaluated from 4 to 0.

So [ln 0 - ln4] → [ -infty - ln4 ].

So (-16) ( -infty - ln4 ) → (-16) (-infty) → positive infinity.

So the integral diverges to plus infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

But wait, the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. As r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand becomes very large. So integrating up to r=2 would indeed result in an infinite area.

But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding what the pseudosphere refers to. Because if the radius is 2, and the area is infinite, then option D is +infty. But perhaps pseudosphere in this context refers to something else.

Wait, let me think about the given options. Option A is 0. Option B is 4π(x² + y²). Option C is 4π(x² - y²). Option D is +infty.

Wait, but the question is asking about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. If the area is infinite, then the correct answer would be D) +infty.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is defined differently here. For instance, in hyperbolic geometry, the "area" of a circle (pseudosphere) with radius r is 2π a sinh(r/a), where a is the curvature radius. But without knowing a, I can't compute that.

Wait, but in the given metric, perhaps the curvature can be found. Let's think about the Gaussian curvature of this metric.

The Gaussian curvature K of a metric ds² = E dr² + G r² dθ² (since it's diagonal) is given by K = - (1/(2√(EG))) [ (dE/dθ)/(r²) + ... ] Wait, perhaps it's easier using another formula.

Another approach: The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = L(r) (dr² + r² dθ²) is given by K = (1/(2 r²)) [d/d r (r² dL/dr) ] evaluated at a certain point.

Wait, more accurately, for a metric ds² = L(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K = [ (d/dr)(r² (dL/dr)) ] / (2 r² L(r)).

So for our case, L(r) = 32/(4 - r²). Then dL/dr = 32 * (2 r)/(4 - r²)^2.

So dL/dr = (64 r)/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, r² (dL/dr) = r² * (64 r)/(4 - r²)^2 = 64 r^3/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, d/dr [64 r^3/(4 - r²)^2 ] = let me compute this derivative.

Let me denote f(r) = 64 r^3, g(r) = (4 - r²)^2.

df/dr = 192 r².

dg/dr = 2 (4 - r²)(-2 r) ) = -4 r (4 - r²).

So using the quotient rule: (df/dr * g(r) - f(r) * dg/dr ) / [g(r)^2].

So numerator:

192 r^2 * (4 - r²)^2 - 64 r^3 * (-4 r (4 - r²)).

Simplify:

192 r^2 (4 - r²)^2 + 256 r^4 (4 - r²).

Factor out 64 r^2 (4 - r²):

64 r^2 (4 - r²) [3 (4 - r²) + 4 r² ].

Wait, let's compute that:

Inside the brackets: 3*(4 - r²) +4 r² = 12 - 3 r² + 4 r² = 12 + r².

So numerator becomes: 64 r^2 (4 - r²) (12 + r²).

Denominator is [ (4 - r²)^2 ]^2 = (4 - r²)^4.

So the derivative is [64 r^2 (4 - r²) (12 + r²)] / (4 - r²)^4 ) = [64 r^2 (12 + r²)]/(4 - r²)^3.

So the curvature K is:

[ (d/dr (r² dL/dr) ) ] / (2 r² L(r) )

= [64 r^2 (12 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3 ] / [ 2 r² * (32/(4 - r²)) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

2 r² * 32/(4 - r²) ) = 64 r²/(4 - r²).

So K = [64 r^2 (12 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3 ] / [64 r²/(4 - r²)] ) 

= [ (12 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3 ] * [ (4 - r²) / 1 ]

= (12 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Hmm, so the curvature is (12 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2. That's a positive curvature for r² <4, which suggests it's locally like a positively curved space. But that can't be right because the denominator approaches zero, leading to a singularity at r=2.

Wait, but that's the curvature expression. So at r=0, K would be (12 + 0)/(4)^2 = 12/16=3/4, positive. So this is a space with positive curvature, but it's singular at r=2.

Wait, but earlier I thought this might be a hyperbolic space, but the curvature is positive. Hmm.

Anyway, perhaps the area is indeed infinite, as the integral suggests. So the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 would be infinity, making the answer D) +infty.

Let me look back at the options. Option D is +infty, which seems to fit.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we first compute the area element in this metric. In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element \(dA\) is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta\), where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\det g = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{(32)^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we integrate \(dA\) over the region \(0 \leq r \leq 2\) and \(0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi\):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The inner integral over \(r\) is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-16}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges as \(u \to 0\), leading to an infinite result. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area in the given metric.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not relevant to the metric or the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the integral diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
