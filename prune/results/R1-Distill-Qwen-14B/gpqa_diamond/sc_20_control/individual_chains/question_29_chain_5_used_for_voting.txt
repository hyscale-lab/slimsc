Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

So, the situation is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. That's bad because it can't be used for food. They found the gene responsible for making this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. Then, they used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants. After sequencing, they found changes in the first exon area.

The question is asking which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the idea is probably that the gene product (a protein) is responsible for making the compound, and a mutation that disrupts the gene's function would stop the compound from being made.

Looking at the options, I see four mutants (1-4) and the intact gene. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a mutant.

First, let me look at the sequences provided.

The intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon, methionine), followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… and ends with TGA (stop codon). 

Now, looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact gene, I see that the sequence is the same up to a point. Let me check each position.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, maybe looking at the exact differences would help. Let me line them up:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

Wait, exact positions might be tricky, but perhaps I can look for where the changes are.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to scan for where the sequences differ.

Wait, let's compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTC changes to CTACGCT? Wait, maybe I should look for exact nucleotide changes.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for changes in the DNA that would lead to changes in the protein (amino acids), which might disrupt the function.

But wait, since the gene has introns, but the sequencing was done on the target gene in all mutants. But the question says changes are in the first exon area. So, possibly, the mutations are in the first exon.

But how do the mutations affect the coding sequence?

Let me see each mutant.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Comparing to the intact gene:

First part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1's sequence: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for each exact position where the letters differ.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for where the codons change.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach: the gene's product is a protein, and the anti-nutritional compound is likely a product of that protein. If the mutation disrupts the gene's function, the compound won't be made.

Mutations that cause a frameshift would lead to a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, possibly leading to a nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, a missense mutation might change an amino acid, maybe in a critical region.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Let me see the differences. The first part of the gene after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

In Mutant 1, the sequence is TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, let me compare the two:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant 1: TTCTACGCT. So, perhaps in the intact, it's TTT CTC GCT, and in mutant 1, it's TTCTACGCT. Hmm, wait, perhaps I should look at the exact nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at the DNA sequences for each mutant.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, comparing each position:

ATG remains the same.

Next, let's see:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

Mutant 1: TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, maybe I should break it down into individual nucleotides.

Let me write the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, perhaps the changes are at the 5th position? Let me count.

1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC (intact) vs. CT ACG? Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the exact position where the base changes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the exact positions where the sequences differ.

Looking at the first part of the gene:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGT...

So, the intact has CTC GCT, and mutant1 has CT ACG CT?

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, in the intact gene, after TTT is CTC GCT GGT. In mutant1, after TTT is CT ACG CTG GT.

Hmm, perhaps the positions where they diverge are:

Intact: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ...CTA CGC TGG TAC...

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should line up the sequences.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, so the first change is at position 7-9: Intact is CTC, mutant1 is CT A? No, because the sequence in mutant1 is CT ACG.

Wait, maybe another approach: let me look at the point where the sequences differ.

Intact: position 4-6: TTT
Mutant1: same first three nucleotides, TTT.

Next, position 7-9: intact has CTC, mutant1 has CT A (maybe the next nucleotides differ).

Wait, perhaps the first point of mutation is at the CTC in Intact vs. CT ACG in Mutant1. So:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...
Mutant1: TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG ...

So, the first change is in the 4th codon (after ATG, which is position 1-3, then 4-6 is TTT, 7-9 is CTC in intact, and in mutant1, it's CT ACG? Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find where the nucleotides differ. Let me write the first part in detail.

Intact:
Positions 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
...

Mutant1:
Positions 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CT A (maybe at position 7-9, it's CT A? Or perhaps the sequence is CT ACG in positions 7-15?)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for where the DNA changes, and whether those changes lead to a stop codon, or a frameshift, or a missense.

In the given scenario, the anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene product. To eliminate it, we need to disrupt the gene's function. So, the best way is a mutation that causes a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift that changes the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the options:

Mutant1: The last part of the sequence is CGC. The stop codon is TGA, so in mutant1, the last part is ...GTCGC…TGA. So, the last codon before stop is CGC, which is arginine. So, no stop codon. So, perhaps a missense mutation.

Mutant2: The last part is ...GTCGC…TGA. So, same as mutant1.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA. So, maybe a different change.

Mutant4: The sequence is shorter, perhaps a frameshift? Let me check.

Mutant4's sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, looking at the intact gene, the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps the mutant4 sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe it's better to find where the mutations are and see if any of them introduce a stop codon.

Let me look for the presence of a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). The original gene ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1: Ends with ...CGT…TGA. So, the last codon before TGA is CGC, which is arginine. So, no early stop.

Mutant2: Ends with ...CGC…TGA. Same as mutant1.

Mutant3: Ends with ...GTCGT…TGA. So, no stop before.

Mutant4: Ends with ...TCGT…TGA. Hmm, same as intact in that part. But wait, maybe the beginning is different.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, so after ATG, it's TTT, then TAC instead of CTC in intact. So, the third codon in intact is CTC (leucine), in mutant4, it's TAC (tyrosine). No stop codon introduced there.

Hmm, but perhaps I should check if any of the mutants have a frameshift.

A frameshift would change the reading frame downstream, potentially leading to a completely different sequence and possibly a premature stop codon.

Looking for insertions or deletions (indels) in the mutants.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’

Comparing the two, I don't see any insertions or deletions; the length seems the same. So, no frameshift here.

Mutant2: 5’-ATG TTT CT AAG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’

Again, same length, so no frameshift.

Mutant3: 5’-ATG TTT TTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the sequence is longer here? Let me count the letters.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant3, there's an extra base somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution, not a frameshift.

Wait, no, looking at the way the sequence is written, perhaps it's a substitution. So, length remains same, so no frameshift.

Mutant4: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Same length as the intact, so no frameshift.

Hmm, so perhaps all the mutations are point mutations, not frameshifts.

Then, the next possibility is a nonsense mutation, which introduces a stop codon earlier. Let's see if any of the mutants have a stop codon before the original TGA.

Wait, how would that happen? Let's see.

In the original gene, the stop codon is TGA. So, if any of the mutations introduce TAA, TAG, or a TGA earlier, that would lead to a premature stop.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact gene: ... TGT CGT ... TGA.

Mutant1: ... TGT CGC ... TGA. The last codon before TGA is CGC (Arg), no stop.

Mutant2: ... TGT CGC ... TGA. Same as mutant1.

Mutant3: ... TGT CGT ... TGA. Last codon is TGT (Cys), then C, G, T. Wait, no stop before TGA.

Wait, perhaps I should look more carefully.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence is different enough that a stop codon appears earlier. Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, the last part is ...TGT CGT ... TGA. So, same as the intact gene. No early stop.

So, none of the mutants have a stop codon before the original one. So, perhaps the mutations are missense, altering amino acids.

But the goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, so the gene product must be nonfunctional. If the mutation is in a critical region, maybe the enzyme can't function.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation leading to a nonfunctional enzyme would require a change in a critical residue.

But without knowing the exact protein structure, perhaps the best bet is a mutation that creates a stop codon early, or a frameshift.

Wait, but in all the mutants, it's the same length. So, no frameshift. So, what else?

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates an alternative splice site, but the question says the changes are in the first exon, so probably not affecting splicing much.

Wait, another idea: perhaps a nonsense mutation that creates a stop codon earlier. Let me see if any of the mutants have a TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1: Let's see, does it have any of the stop codons before the end?

The sequence for mutant1 is ...CGC...TGA. So, no stop before TGA.

Mutant2: ...CGC...TGA. Same as mutant1.

Mutant3: Let's see, the sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT … TGA.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant3, the sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

So, the codons after ATG would be TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), and then TGA (stop).

No stop codons before TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

After ATG, it's TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

So, the codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), then TGA (stop). No stop before TGA.

Hmm, so none of the mutants have a premature stop codon. So, perhaps the mutations are missense, but which one would disrupt the function the most.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a stop codon in a way I'm not seeing.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the changes occur in the codons.

Let me try to compare the codons.

The intact gene is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

The first few codons: Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Tyr, Cys, Arg, ..., stop.

Now, looking at each mutant.

Mutant1:

ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

So, the first few codons after ATG are:

- TTT (Phe)
- CT ACG -> Wait, how does that split into codons? Wait, the DNA sequence is CT ACG. Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as CTACGCT... So, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant1, it's CTA (Leu) and CG (but that would be a problem unless it's CTACGCT.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused with the reading frame. Let me think: DNA is read in triplets. So, let me write the sequences in triplets.

Intact gene first part:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant1:

ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Wait, so the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant1, it's CT A (maybe the third codon is CT A?), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should split the DNA sequences into codons.

Wait, the DNA is read as 5' to 3', and each codon is three nucleotides. So, the first codon after ATG is TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc.

For Mutant1:

The DNA after ATG is TTT followed by CT ACG. Wait, that would be TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT ... ?

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire DNA sequence in triplets:

Intact:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant1:

ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA

Wait, that's not making sense because the number of letters must be a multiple of three. Let me double-check the sequences provided.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact letters and see where the changes are.

Let me compare each position in the first exon.

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, the intact has 'CTCGC', while mutant1 has 'TACGC'.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look at the actual nucleotide changes.

Let me write the original and mutant sequences in the first exon area.

Intact: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...
Mutant1: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Let me try to line them up:

Intact: positions 4-20: T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...
Mutant1: positions 4-20: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...

So, in position 7-9 of the intact, it's CTC, and in mutant1, it's CT A (maybe).

Wait, perhaps the exact nucleotides are:

Intact: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant1: ...TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT...

So, the first few codons:

Intact:
- TTT (Phe)
- CTC (Leu)
- GCT (Ala)
- GGT (Gly)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- etc.

Mutant1:
- TTT (Phe)
- CT ACG --> Wait, codons are in triplets, so after TTT, the next three are CT A, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps the next three are CT ACG? No, that would be four nucleotides. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternative approach: Let me write the sequences as nucleotide triplets.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA

So, codons in mutant1 after TTT are CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT...

Wait, that would be:

- TTT (Phe)
- CT A (which is CT A; but wait, that's two nucleotides, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each codon is three nucleotides. So, the mutant1's sequence after ATG is TTT, then CT ACG, which is four nucleotides. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the sequences provided are longer, so I need to make sure that the triplet alignment is correct.

Another approach: perhaps the mutation in Mutant1 is the change of the third codon from CTC (Leu) to CT A (but that's only two nucleotides, which isn't possible, so perhaps it's CTA and then CG...).

Wait, perhaps the third codon in intact is CTC, and in mutant1, it's CTA. But that would be a substitution of the third nucleotide from C to A, making it CTA, which is Leu (CTA is still Leu). So, no change in the amino acid.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the specific point mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compare the DNA sequences and see where the changes are.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, the first change is from CTC to TAC. Wait, no: let me see:

Intact: positions 4-20: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...
Mutant1: positions 4-20: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...

Hmm, perhaps the 'CTC' in intact becomes 'CTA' in mutant1. Let me see:

Wait, perhaps the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in mutant1 it's CTA (Leu), so no change in amino acid. Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), and in mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). So, the fourth codon changes from Ala to Arg.

That would be a missense mutation. So, the amino acid changes from Ala to Arg. That's a substitution, but whether it disrupts function depends on where it is.

Alternatively, perhaps looking for nonsense mutations is the key, but none seem to have that.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the mutation in mutant4 causes a loss of a critical region. Looking at mutant4's sequence:

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the codons are:

- TTT (Phe)
- TAC (Tyr)
- GCT (Ala)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAT (His)
- ATT (Ile)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TGT (Cys)
- CGT (Arg)
- TGA (stop)

Wait, compared to the intact gene, which is:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the codons are:

- TTT (Phe)
- CTC (Leu)
- GCT (Ala)
- GGT (Gly)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAT (His)
- ATT (Ile)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TGT (Cys)
- CGT (Arg)
- TGA (stop)

So, in mutant4, after TTT, the next codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So, that's a change from Leu to Tyr. Then the next codon is GCT (Ala) in intact, but in mutant4, it's GCT as well, but perhaps the next one is different.

Wait, no, in mutant4, the sequence is TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Intact: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, in mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), and the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) instead of GCT (Ala). So, no change in the fourth codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me write the first few codons of each.

Intact:

ATG (1-3)
TTT (4-6)
CTC (7-9)
GCT (10-12)
GGT (13-15)
ACT (16-18)
TCT (19-21)
GTG (22-24)
GAT (25-27)
GAA (28-30)
CAT (31-33)
ATT (34-36)
TAT (37-39)
TGT (40-42)
CGT (43-45)
TGA (46-48)

Mutant1:

ATG (1-3)
TTT (4-6)
CTA (7-9) [if the next is CTA, but I'm not sure]
ACG (10-12) [but that would be a frameshift... no, because the length remains same]
Wait, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which mutation introduces a stop codon.

Wait, another approach: the question is about which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, the gene is responsible for making it. If the mutation disrupts the gene, the compound won't be made.

A nonsense mutation (stop codon) would likely do that. But as I don't see any, perhaps the next best is a frameshift, which would change the entire downstream amino acid sequence, possibly leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking again at the mutants, perhaps Mutant4 has a frameshift.

Wait, let's count the number of nucleotides in each. The intact gene starts with ATG and ends with TGA. The length should be a multiple of three.

Intact: Let's count the letters. The given sequence is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Assuming the … represents some middle part, but the first part is ATG followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT.

Wait, perhaps the length is:

ATG (3) + TTT (3) + CTC (3) + GCT (3) + GGT (3) + ACT (3) + TCT (3) + GTG (3) + GAT (3) + GAA (3) + CAT (3) + ATT (3) + TAT (3) + TGT (3) + CGT (3) + TGA (3). So 17 codons? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact length isn't the point. Let me look for any insertions or deletions that would cause a frameshift.

Looking at Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Compare to intact: the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, perhaps the fourth codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). So, substitution, not frameshift.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each mutant for any insertions or deletions.

Looking at Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, the intact has CTC GCT GGT, and Mutant2 has CTA AGC TGG.

Wait, that's a substitution, not a frameshift. So, same length.

Hmm, I'm not finding any frameshift mutations. So, perhaps the best option is a mutation that changes a critical amino acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. Let me see Mutant4's sequence:

Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So, after ATG, it's TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the codons are:

- TTT (Phe)
- TAC (Tyr)
- GCT (Ala)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAT (His)
- ATT (Ile)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TGT (Cys)
- CGT (Arg)
- TGA (stop)

Wait, but in the intact gene, after TTT, the next codon is CTC (Leu), so in Mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr) instead. So, the third codon is changed from Leu to Tyr.

So, that's a missense mutation. Whether that disrupts the function depends on the protein's structure.

But among the options, which mutation leads to a frameshift or a stop codon?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again for any possible frameshift.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4 has a deletion or insertion.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, in the intact, after TTT, it's CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

In Mutant4, after TTT, it's TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the sequence in Mutant4 is TAC GCT ACT TCT..., whereas in intact it's CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, in Mutant4, the second codon after TTT is TAC (Tyr), whereas in intact it's CTC (Leu). Then, the third codon in Mutant4 is GCT (Ala), same as intact. Wait, no, in intact, it's GCT in the third codon, but in Mutant4, the third codon after TTT is GCT as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the number of nucleotides.

Intact gene: Let's count the length up to the first stop codon.

The given sequence is ATG followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Assuming the ... in the middle doesn't affect the reading frame, perhaps the total number of nucleotides is a multiple of three.

Mutant4's sequence is ATG followed by TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Let me count the letters after ATG.

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA → each triplet is 3 letters, so 17 triplets (51 letters after ATG, making 54 total).

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA → also 17 triplets (51 letters after ATG). So, same length. So, no frameshift.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Another angle: the question states that the target gene's first exon area has mutations. The first exon is part of the coding sequence, so changes there could affect the protein's structure early on.

Which mutation is likely to cause a nonfunctional protein?

If the mutation changes a critical amino acid early in the protein, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Looking at the first few codons:

Intact: Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Tyr, Cys, Arg, ..., stop.

Mutant1:

Met, Phe, Leu (if the third codon is CTA, same as Leu), then Arg (changed from Ala).

Mutant2:

Met, Phe, Leu (if third codon is CTA), then Ala? Or perhaps changed.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which mutation changes the reading frame, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant3, there's a change that causes a frameshift.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

After ATG, it's TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the codons are:

- TTT (Phe)
- TAC (Tyr)
- GCT (Ala)
- GGT (Gly)
- GTC (Val)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAT (His)
- ATT (Ile)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TGT (Cys)
- CGT (Arg)
- TGA (stop)

Wait, in the intact gene, after TTT comes CTC (Leu), but in Mutant3, it's TAC (Tyr). So, another substitution.

Hmm, but if I were to choose which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function, perhaps the one that changes the most critical region. Since the mutations are all in the first exon, which is near the beginning of the coding sequence, perhaps even a single substitution could have a significant effect, especially if it's in a catalytic site or another important region.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 introduces a stop codon earlier, but I don't see that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation. Let me check each mutant again for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence, after some codons, does it have any of the stop codons before the last one?

No, the sequence ends with TGA as the last codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the end of each mutant.

Mutant 4's sequence is:

...TGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, the last part is TGT CGT … TGA. So, the stop is at the end.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one with a significant change in the first few codons, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's missing some nucleotides, causing a frameshift. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested it is the same length.

Wait, perhaps I should look for indels.

Wait, the original gene is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

Mutant4 is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the difference is in the third codon: CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr). So, that's a substitution, not a frameshift.

So, none of the mutants have a frameshift. So, the only way to disrupt the gene is through a missense mutation that disrupts the enzyme's function.

Which mutation would do that? Without knowing the exact function, perhaps the mutant that changes the most in a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes a change in the first few amino acids, which are critical for the protein's structure or function.

In any case, given the options, I think the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it's the only one that changes the second codon from Leu to Tyr, which might be in a critical region.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a TAC codon (Tyr) where the original has CTC (Leu), which could be in a critical part of the protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes a later codon.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a change in a crucial part of the gene, like the start of the coding sequence. So, Mutant4 changes the third codon, which is early on.

In that case, the correct answer is D) Mutant4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the gene sequence provided. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or altering a critical region of the protein (missense mutation). 

### Key Observations:
1. **Intact Gene Sequence**:
   The intact gene starts with `ATG` (start codon), followed by `TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA` (coding sequence), and ends with `TGA` (stop codon). The sequence is a multiple of three nucleotides, indicating no frameshift.

2. **Mutant Analysis**:
   - **Mutant 1**: The sequence changes from `CTCGCT` in the intact gene to `CTACGC`. This results in a missense mutation where the third codon remains `CTA` (Leu), and the fourth codon changes from `GCT` (Ala) to `CGC` (Arg). No premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 2**: The sequence changes from `CTCGCT` to `CTAAGC`. This also results in a missense mutation, with no premature stop codon introduced.
   - **Mutant 3**: The sequence changes from `CTCGCT` to `TTACGC`. This introduces a missense mutation where the third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr). No premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 4**: The sequence changes from `CTCGCT` to `TACGCT`. This results in a missense mutation where the third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr). The rest of the sequence remains the same, and no premature stop codon is introduced.

3. **Frameshift and Stop Codon Check**:
   - None of the mutants introduce a frameshift, as all sequences are the same length as the intact gene.
   - None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) before the original `TGA`.

### Conclusion:
The mutations in all four mutants are missense mutations, altering specific amino acids. Among these, **Mutant 4** changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr), which occurs early in the coding sequence. This change is likely to disrupt the function of the protein significantly, as early substitutions often affect critical regions of the protein. Therefore, **Mutant 4** is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

So, the situation is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. That's bad because it can't be used for food. They found the gene responsible for making this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. Then, they used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants. After sequencing, they found changes in the first exon area.

The question is asking which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the idea is probably that the gene product (a protein) is responsible for making the compound, and a mutation that disrupts the gene's function would stop the compound from being made.

Looking at the options, I see four mutants (1-4) and the intact gene. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a mutant.

First, let me look at the sequences provided.

The intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon, methionine), followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… and ends with TGA (stop codon). 

Now, looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact gene, I see that the sequence is the same up to a point. Let me check each position.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, maybe looking at the exact differences would help. Let me line them up:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

Wait, exact positions might be tricky, but perhaps I can look for where the changes are.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to scan for where the sequences differ.

Wait, let's compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTC changes to CTACGCT? Wait, maybe I should look for exact nucleotide changes.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for changes in the DNA that would lead to changes in the protein (amino acids), which might disrupt the function.

But wait, since the gene has introns, but the sequencing was done on the target gene in all mutants. But the question says changes are in the first exon area. So, possibly, the mutations are in the first exon.

But how do the mutations affect the coding sequence?

Let me see each mutant.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Comparing to the intact gene:

First part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1's sequence: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for each exact position where the letters differ.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for where the codons change.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach: the gene's product is a protein, and the anti-nutritional compound is likely a product of that protein. If the mutation disrupts the gene's function, the compound won't be made.

Mutations that cause a frameshift would lead to a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, possibly leading to a nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, a missense mutation might change an amino acid, maybe in a critical region.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Let me see the differences. The first part of the gene after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

In Mutant 1, the sequence is TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, let me compare the two:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant 1: TTCTACGCT. So, perhaps in the intact, it's TTT CTC GCT, and in mutant 1, it's TTCTACGCT. Hmm, wait, perhaps I should look at the exact nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at the DNA sequences for each mutant.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, comparing each position:

ATG remains the same.

Next, let's see:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

Mutant 1: TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, maybe I should break it down into individual nucleotides.

Let me write the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, perhaps the changes are at the 5th position? Let me count.

1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC (intact) vs. CT ACG? Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the exact position where the base changes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the exact positions where the sequences differ.

Looking at the first part of the gene:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGT...

So, the intact has CTC GCT, and mutant1 has CT ACG CT?

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, in the intact gene, after TTT is CTC GCT GGT. In mutant1, after TTT is CT ACG CTG GT.

Hmm, perhaps the positions where they diverge are:

Intact: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ...CTA CGC TGG TAC...

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should line up the sequences.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, so the first change is at position 7-9: Intact is CTC, mutant1 is CT A? No, because the sequence in mutant1 is CT ACG.

Wait, maybe another approach: let me look at the point where the sequences differ.

Intact: position 4-6: TTT
Mutant1: same first three nucleotides, TTT.

Next, position 7-9: intact has CTC, mutant1 has CT A (maybe the next nucleotides differ).

Wait, perhaps the first point of mutation is at the CTC in Intact vs. CT ACG in Mutant1. So:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...
Mutant1: TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG ...

So, the first change is in the 4th codon (after ATG, which is position 1-3, then 4-6 is TTT, 7-9 is CTC in intact, and in mutant1, it's CT ACG? Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find where the nucleotides differ. Let me write the first part in detail.

Intact:
Positions 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
...

Mutant1:
Positions 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CT A (maybe at position 7-9, it's CT A? Or perhaps the sequence is CT ACG in positions 7-15?)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for where the DNA changes, and whether those changes lead to a stop codon, or a frameshift, or a missense.

In the given scenario, the anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene product. To eliminate it, we need to disrupt the gene's function. So, the best way is a mutation that causes a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift that changes the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the options:

Mutant1: The last part of the sequence is CGC. The stop codon is TGA, so in mutant1, the last part is ...GTCGC…TGA. So, the last codon before stop is CGC, which is arginine. So, no stop codon. So, perhaps a missense mutation.

Mutant2: The last part is ...GTCGC…TGA. So, same as mutant1.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA. So, maybe a different change.

Mutant4: The sequence is shorter, perhaps a frameshift? Let me check.

Mutant4's sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, looking at the intact gene, the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps the mutant4 sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe it's better to find where the mutations are and see if any of them introduce a stop codon.

Let me look for the presence of a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). The original gene ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1: Ends with ...CGT…TGA. So, the last codon before TGA is CGC, which is arginine. So, no early stop.

Mutant2: Ends with ...CGC…TGA. Same as mutant1.

Mutant3: Ends with ...GTCGT…TGA. So, no stop before.

Mutant4: Ends with ...TCGT…TGA. Hmm, same as intact in that part. But wait, maybe the beginning is different.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, so after ATG, it's TTT, then TAC instead of CTC in intact. So, the third codon in intact is CTC (leucine), in mutant4, it's TAC (tyrosine). No stop codon introduced there.

Hmm, but perhaps I should check if any of the mutants have a frameshift.

A frameshift would change the reading frame downstream, potentially leading to a completely different sequence and possibly a premature stop codon.

Looking for insertions or deletions (indels) in the mutants.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’

Comparing the two, I don't see any insertions or deletions; the length seems the same. So, no frameshift here.

Mutant2: 5’-ATG TTT CT AAG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’

Again, same length, so no frameshift.

Mutant3: 5’-ATG TTT TTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the sequence is longer here? Let me count the letters.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant3, there's an extra base somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution, not a frameshift.

Wait, no, looking at the way the sequence is written, perhaps it's a substitution. So, length remains same, so no frameshift.

Mutant4: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Same length as the intact, so no frameshift.

Hmm, so perhaps all the mutations are point mutations, not frameshifts.

Then, the next possibility is a nonsense mutation, which introduces a stop codon earlier. Let's see if any of the mutants have a stop codon before the original TGA.

Wait, how would that happen? Let's see.

In the original gene, the stop codon is TGA. So, if any of the mutations introduce TAA, TAG, or a TGA earlier, that would lead to a premature stop.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact gene: ... TGT CGT ... TGA.

Mutant1: ... TGT CGC ... TGA. The last codon before TGA is CGC (Arg), no stop.

Mutant2: ... TGT CGC ... TGA. Same as mutant1.

Mutant3: ... TGT CGT ... TGA. Last codon is TGT (Cys), then C, G, T. Wait, no stop before TGA.

Wait, perhaps I should look more carefully.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence is different enough that a stop codon appears earlier. Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, the last part is ...TGT CGT ... TGA. So, same as the intact gene. No early stop.

So, none of the mutants have a stop codon before the original one. So, perhaps the mutations are missense, altering amino acids.

But the goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, so the gene product must be nonfunctional. If the mutation is in a critical region, maybe the enzyme can't function.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation leading to a nonfunctional enzyme would require a change in a critical residue.

But without knowing the exact protein structure, perhaps the best bet is a mutation that creates a stop codon early, or a frameshift.

Wait, but in all the mutants, it's the same length. So, no frameshift. So, what else?

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates an alternative splice site, but the question says the changes are in the first exon, so probably not affecting splicing much.

Wait, another idea: perhaps a nonsense mutation that creates a stop codon earlier. Let me see if any of the mutants have a TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1: Let's see, does it have any of the stop codons before the end?

The sequence for mutant1 is ...CGC...TGA. So, no stop before TGA.

Mutant2: ...CGC...TGA. Same as mutant1.

Mutant3: Let's see, the sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT … TGA.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant3, the sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

So, the codons after ATG would be TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), and then TGA (stop).

No stop codons before TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

After ATG, it's TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

So, the codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), then TGA (stop). No stop before TGA.

Hmm, so none of the mutants have a premature stop codon. So, perhaps the mutations are missense, but which one would disrupt the function the most.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a stop codon in a way I'm not seeing.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the changes occur in the codons.

Let me try to compare the codons.

The intact gene is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

The first few codons: Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Tyr, Cys, Arg, ..., stop.

Now, looking at each mutant.

Mutant1:

ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

So, the first few codons after ATG are:

- TTT (Phe)
- CT ACG -> Wait, how does that split into codons? Wait, the DNA sequence is CT ACG. Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as CTACGCT... So, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant1, it's CTA (Leu) and CG (but that would be a problem unless it's CTACGCT.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused with the reading frame. Let me think: DNA is read in triplets. So, let me write the sequences in triplets.

Intact gene first part:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant1:

ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Wait, so the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant1, it's CT A (maybe the third codon is CT A?), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should split the DNA sequences into codons.

Wait, the DNA is read as 5' to 3', and each codon is three nucleotides. So, the first codon after ATG is TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc.

For Mutant1:

The DNA after ATG is TTT followed by CT ACG. Wait, that would be TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT ... ?

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire DNA sequence in triplets:

Intact:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant1:

ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA

Wait, that's not making sense because the number of letters must be a multiple of three. Let me double-check the sequences provided.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact letters and see where the changes are.

Let me compare each position in the first exon.

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, the intact has 'CTCGC', while mutant1 has 'TACGC'.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look at the actual nucleotide changes.

Let me write the original and mutant sequences in the first exon area.

Intact: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...
Mutant1: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Let me try to line them up:

Intact: positions 4-20: T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...
Mutant1: positions 4-20: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...

So, in position 7-9 of the intact, it's CTC, and in mutant1, it's CT A (maybe).

Wait, perhaps the exact nucleotides are:

Intact: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant1: ...TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT...

So, the first few codons:

Intact:
- TTT (Phe)
- CTC (Leu)
- GCT (Ala)
- GGT (Gly)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- etc.

Mutant1:
- TTT (Phe)
- CT ACG --> Wait, codons are in triplets, so after TTT, the next three are CT A, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps the next three are CT ACG? No, that would be four nucleotides. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternative approach: Let me write the sequences as nucleotide triplets.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA

So, codons in mutant1 after TTT are CT ACG CTG GT ACT TCT...

Wait, that would be:

- TTT (Phe)
- CT A (which is CT A; but wait, that's two nucleotides, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each codon is three nucleotides. So, the mutant1's sequence after ATG is TTT, then CT ACG, which is four nucleotides. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the sequences provided are longer, so I need to make sure that the triplet alignment is correct.

Another approach: perhaps the mutation in Mutant1 is the change of the third codon from CTC (Leu) to CT A (but that's only two nucleotides, which isn't possible, so perhaps it's CTA and then CG...).

Wait, perhaps the third codon in intact is CTC, and in mutant1, it's CTA. But that would be a substitution of the third nucleotide from C to A, making it CTA, which is Leu (CTA is still Leu). So, no change in the amino acid.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the specific point mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compare the DNA sequences and see where the changes are.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, the first change is from CTC to TAC. Wait, no: let me see:

Intact: positions 4-20: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...
Mutant1: positions 4-20: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T ...

Hmm, perhaps the 'CTC' in intact becomes 'CTA' in mutant1. Let me see:

Wait, perhaps the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in mutant1 it's CTA (Leu), so no change in amino acid. Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), and in mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). So, the fourth codon changes from Ala to Arg.

That would be a missense mutation. So, the amino acid changes from Ala to Arg. That's a substitution, but whether it disrupts function depends on where it is.

Alternatively, perhaps looking for nonsense mutations is the key, but none seem to have that.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the mutation in mutant4 causes a loss of a critical region. Looking at mutant4's sequence:

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the codons are:

- TTT (Phe)
- TAC (Tyr)
- GCT (Ala)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAT (His)
- ATT (Ile)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TGT (Cys)
- CGT (Arg)
- TGA (stop)

Wait, compared to the intact gene, which is:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the codons are:

- TTT (Phe)
- CTC (Leu)
- GCT (Ala)
- GGT (Gly)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAT (His)
- ATT (Ile)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TGT (Cys)
- CGT (Arg)
- TGA (stop)

So, in mutant4, after TTT, the next codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So, that's a change from Leu to Tyr. Then the next codon is GCT (Ala) in intact, but in mutant4, it's GCT as well, but perhaps the next one is different.

Wait, no, in mutant4, the sequence is TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Intact: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, in mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), and the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) instead of GCT (Ala). So, no change in the fourth codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me write the first few codons of each.

Intact:

ATG (1-3)
TTT (4-6)
CTC (7-9)
GCT (10-12)
GGT (13-15)
ACT (16-18)
TCT (19-21)
GTG (22-24)
GAT (25-27)
GAA (28-30)
CAT (31-33)
ATT (34-36)
TAT (37-39)
TGT (40-42)
CGT (43-45)
TGA (46-48)

Mutant1:

ATG (1-3)
TTT (4-6)
CTA (7-9) [if the next is CTA, but I'm not sure]
ACG (10-12) [but that would be a frameshift... no, because the length remains same]
Wait, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which mutation introduces a stop codon.

Wait, another approach: the question is about which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, the gene is responsible for making it. If the mutation disrupts the gene, the compound won't be made.

A nonsense mutation (stop codon) would likely do that. But as I don't see any, perhaps the next best is a frameshift, which would change the entire downstream amino acid sequence, possibly leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking again at the mutants, perhaps Mutant4 has a frameshift.

Wait, let's count the number of nucleotides in each. The intact gene starts with ATG and ends with TGA. The length should be a multiple of three.

Intact: Let's count the letters. The given sequence is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Assuming the … represents some middle part, but the first part is ATG followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT.

Wait, perhaps the length is:

ATG (3) + TTT (3) + CTC (3) + GCT (3) + GGT (3) + ACT (3) + TCT (3) + GTG (3) + GAT (3) + GAA (3) + CAT (3) + ATT (3) + TAT (3) + TGT (3) + CGT (3) + TGA (3). So 17 codons? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact length isn't the point. Let me look for any insertions or deletions that would cause a frameshift.

Looking at Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Compare to intact: the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, perhaps the fourth codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). So, substitution, not frameshift.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each mutant for any insertions or deletions.

Looking at Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, the intact has CTC GCT GGT, and Mutant2 has CTA AGC TGG.

Wait, that's a substitution, not a frameshift. So, same length.

Hmm, I'm not finding any frameshift mutations. So, perhaps the best option is a mutation that changes a critical amino acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. Let me see Mutant4's sequence:

Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So, after ATG, it's TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the codons are:

- TTT (Phe)
- TAC (Tyr)
- GCT (Ala)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAT (His)
- ATT (Ile)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TGT (Cys)
- CGT (Arg)
- TGA (stop)

Wait, but in the intact gene, after TTT, the next codon is CTC (Leu), so in Mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr) instead. So, the third codon is changed from Leu to Tyr.

So, that's a missense mutation. Whether that disrupts the function depends on the protein's structure.

But among the options, which mutation leads to a frameshift or a stop codon?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again for any possible frameshift.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4 has a deletion or insertion.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, in the intact, after TTT, it's CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

In Mutant4, after TTT, it's TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the sequence in Mutant4 is TAC GCT ACT TCT..., whereas in intact it's CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, in Mutant4, the second codon after TTT is TAC (Tyr), whereas in intact it's CTC (Leu). Then, the third codon in Mutant4 is GCT (Ala), same as intact. Wait, no, in intact, it's GCT in the third codon, but in Mutant4, the third codon after TTT is GCT as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the number of nucleotides.

Intact gene: Let's count the length up to the first stop codon.

The given sequence is ATG followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Assuming the ... in the middle doesn't affect the reading frame, perhaps the total number of nucleotides is a multiple of three.

Mutant4's sequence is ATG followed by TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Let me count the letters after ATG.

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA → each triplet is 3 letters, so 17 triplets (51 letters after ATG, making 54 total).

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA → also 17 triplets (51 letters after ATG). So, same length. So, no frameshift.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Another angle: the question states that the target gene's first exon area has mutations. The first exon is part of the coding sequence, so changes there could affect the protein's structure early on.

Which mutation is likely to cause a nonfunctional protein?

If the mutation changes a critical amino acid early in the protein, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Looking at the first few codons:

Intact: Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Tyr, Cys, Arg, ..., stop.

Mutant1:

Met, Phe, Leu (if the third codon is CTA, same as Leu), then Arg (changed from Ala).

Mutant2:

Met, Phe, Leu (if third codon is CTA), then Ala? Or perhaps changed.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which mutation changes the reading frame, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant3, there's a change that causes a frameshift.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

After ATG, it's TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the codons are:

- TTT (Phe)
- TAC (Tyr)
- GCT (Ala)
- GGT (Gly)
- GTC (Val)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAT (His)
- ATT (Ile)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TGT (Cys)
- CGT (Arg)
- TGA (stop)

Wait, in the intact gene, after TTT comes CTC (Leu), but in Mutant3, it's TAC (Tyr). So, another substitution.

Hmm, but if I were to choose which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function, perhaps the one that changes the most critical region. Since the mutations are all in the first exon, which is near the beginning of the coding sequence, perhaps even a single substitution could have a significant effect, especially if it's in a catalytic site or another important region.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 introduces a stop codon earlier, but I don't see that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation. Let me check each mutant again for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence, after some codons, does it have any of the stop codons before the last one?

No, the sequence ends with TGA as the last codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the end of each mutant.

Mutant 4's sequence is:

...TGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, the last part is TGT CGT … TGA. So, the stop is at the end.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one with a significant change in the first few codons, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's missing some nucleotides, causing a frameshift. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested it is the same length.

Wait, perhaps I should look for indels.

Wait, the original gene is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

Mutant4 is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA.

So, the difference is in the third codon: CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr). So, that's a substitution, not a frameshift.

So, none of the mutants have a frameshift. So, the only way to disrupt the gene is through a missense mutation that disrupts the enzyme's function.

Which mutation would do that? Without knowing the exact function, perhaps the mutant that changes the most in a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes a change in the first few amino acids, which are critical for the protein's structure or function.

In any case, given the options, I think the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it's the only one that changes the second codon from Leu to Tyr, which might be in a critical region.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a TAC codon (Tyr) where the original has CTC (Leu), which could be in a critical part of the protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes a later codon.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a change in a crucial part of the gene, like the start of the coding sequence. So, Mutant4 changes the third codon, which is early on.

In that case, the correct answer is D) Mutant4.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the gene sequence provided. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or altering a critical region of the protein (missense mutation). 

### Key Observations:
1. **Intact Gene Sequence**:
   The intact gene starts with `ATG` (start codon), followed by `TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA` (coding sequence), and ends with `TGA` (stop codon). The sequence is a multiple of three nucleotides, indicating no frameshift.

2. **Mutant Analysis**:
   - **Mutant 1**: The sequence changes from `CTCGCT` in the intact gene to `CTACGC`. This results in a missense mutation where the third codon remains `CTA` (Leu), and the fourth codon changes from `GCT` (Ala) to `CGC` (Arg). No premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 2**: The sequence changes from `CTCGCT` to `CTAAGC`. This also results in a missense mutation, with no premature stop codon introduced.
   - **Mutant 3**: The sequence changes from `CTCGCT` to `TTACGC`. This introduces a missense mutation where the third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr). No premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 4**: The sequence changes from `CTCGCT` to `TACGCT`. This results in a missense mutation where the third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr). The rest of the sequence remains the same, and no premature stop codon is introduced.

3. **Frameshift and Stop Codon Check**:
   - None of the mutants introduce a frameshift, as all sequences are the same length as the intact gene.
   - None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) before the original `TGA`.

### Conclusion:
The mutations in all four mutants are missense mutations, altering specific amino acids. Among these, **Mutant 4** changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr), which occurs early in the coding sequence. This change is likely to disrupt the function of the protein significantly, as early substitutions often affect critical regions of the protein. Therefore, **Mutant 4** is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
