Okay, so I have this question about gamma rays and the CMB. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I studied about this. The question says that high-energy gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. So the reaction is γγ → e+e-. I need to find out at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process.

Wait, the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. I think the CMB is the cosmic microwave background radiation, which has a blackbody spectrum peaking in the microwave region. The average energy is around that, right.

So, the process is gamma + photon → electron and positron. The lifetime of the gamma-ray is limited by this interaction. I've heard about photon-photon interactions in the context of the pair production. Oh right, there's something called the photon-photon cross-section, and when the product of two photon energies is sufficient to create a pair, the reaction is possible.

But wait, the cross-section for this process is probably dependent on the energy of the photons involved. I think the cross-section is significant when the center-of-mass energy is above the threshold, which is twice the electron mass. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so twice that is about 1.022 MeV. So both photons together need to have a combined energy of at least that.

But here, one photon is a high-energy gamma (let's call its energy E) and the other is a CMB photon with energy ε = 1e-3 eV. So the center-of-mass energy squared would be s = (E + ε)^2. But for the cross-section to be non-zero, s needs to be at least (2m_e c²)^2.

Wait, but wait, the exact formula for the cross-section is a bit tricky. I think the cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is given by something like σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² m_e^4) / (E_cm^4), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. But maybe I should think about the threshold condition first.

The threshold occurs when the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame is just enough to produce the electron-positron pair. Since the CMB photon has much lower energy than the gamma, I can approximate E_cm ≈ sqrt(2 E γ ε) when E >> ε. Does that make sense? Because if E is much larger than ε, then the center-of-mass energy is roughly sqrt(2 E γ ε). So the condition is sqrt(2 E γ ε) >= 2 m_e c².

Wait, m_e is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 m_e c² is 1.022 MeV. So let's express everything in the same units.

E is the gamma-ray energy in GeV. Let's convert m_e c² to GeV. 0.511 MeV is 0.000511 GeV. So 2 m_e c² is 0.001022 GeV.

So the condition is sqrt(2 E γ ε) >= 0.001022 GeV.

Wait, but ε is 1e-3 eV. Let's convert that to GeV. 1 eV is 1e-9 GeV, so ε = 1e-3 eV = 1e-12 GeV.

So plug in ε = 1e-12 GeV:

sqrt(2 * E * 1e-12 ) >= 0.001022

Squaring both sides:

2 * E * 1e-12 >= (0.001022)^2

Calculate the right side: (0.001022)^2 is about 1.044e-6.

So 2 * E * 1e-12 >= 1.044e-6

E >= (1.044e-6) / (2 * 1e-12) ) 

E >= (1.044e-6) / (2e-12) )

Which is (1.044 / 2) ) * 1e6 GeV.

Wait, 1e6 GeV is 1e3 TeV. 1e6 GeV is 1e6 * 1e9 eV = 1e15 eV, which is a petaelectronvolt, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

So 1.044 / 2 is approximately 0.522, so E >= 0.522e6 GeV, which is 5.22e5 GeV. Wait, but looking back at the options:

Options are A) ~1e4 GeV, B) ~1.8e5, C) 2.6e5, D) ~4e5.

Wait, 5e5 is 500,000 GeV, which is higher than any of the options. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's double-check the math.

We have:

sqrt(2 E γ ε) = 2 m_e c²

So, square both sides:

2 E γ ε = (2 m_e c² )^2.

So,

E = ( (2 m_e c² )^2 ) / ( 2 ε )

Plugging in the numbers:

(2 m_e c²) is 1.022 MeV = 0.001022 GeV.

So (0.001022 GeV)^2 is (1.022e-3)^2 GeV² = (1.044e-6) GeV².

Denominator: 2 ε = 2 * 1e-12 GeV.

So E = 1.044e-6 / (2e-12) GeV.

E = (1.044e-6 ) / 2e-12 = (1.044 / 2) * 1e6 GeV.

Wait, 1e6 GeV is 1e6 * 1e9 eV = 1e15 eV? Wait, no, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1e6 GeV is 1e15 eV. But the options are all in the GeV scale.

Wait, 1e6 GeV is 1e6 GeV, which is 1e6 * 1e9 eV = 1e15 eV. But that's way higher than the options given. The options are up to 4e5 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a unit conversion error. Let me double-check the units.

Wait, m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so 0.000511 GeV. So 2 m_e c² is 0.001022 GeV.

Wait, but the CMB photon's energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So 1e-3 eV is 1e-12 GeV, because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 / 1e9 = 1e-12 GeV.

So the calculation is correct. So E = ( (0.001022 GeV)^2 ) / ( 2 * 1e-12 GeV )

Wait, wait, let's compute that again.

(0.001022 GeV)^2 = (0.001022)^2 GeV^2 = (1.044e-6) GeV².

Denominator is 2 * 1e-12 GeV.

Wait, wait, no: denominator is 2 * ε, where ε is 1e-12 GeV.

So denominator is 2e-12 GeV.

So E = (1.044e-6 GeV²) / (2e-12 GeV) ) = (1.044e-6 / 2e-12 ) GeV.

1e-6 / 1e-12 = 1e6, so 1.044e6 / 2 = 0.522e6 GeV.

Which is 5.22e5 GeV.

But none of the options are that high. The highest option is D) 3.9e5 GeV.

Hmm. Did I do something wrong? Maybe I should consider the fact that the cross-section is significant only when the gamma energy is above a certain threshold, but perhaps the calculation is correct and the answer is not among the options. But that can't be. Maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me go back. The process is gamma + photon → e+e-.

The cross-section is non-zero when the center-of-mass energy exceeds 2m_e c². So the condition is sqrt(s) >= 2m_e c², where s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (p_γ c + p_photon c)^2. But for photons, the energy is |p| c, so s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2, because when they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite.

Wait, no, because for two photons moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So their energies are E_γ and ε, but the momenta would be E_γ / c and ε / c, but in opposite directions.

So the total energy is E_γ + ε, and the total momentum is (E_γ - ε)/c.

So s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - ( (E_γ - ε)/c )^2 c^2.

Wait, but c is the speed of light, so let me compute s:

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2.

Expanding that:

s = [E_γ² + 2 E_γ ε + ε²] - [E_γ² - 2 E_γ ε + ε²]

s = 4 E_γ ε.

So s = (4 E_γ ε).

The threshold condition is s = (2 m_e c²)^2.

So,

4 E_γ ε = (2 m_e c²)^2.

So,

E_γ = ( (2 m_e c²)^2 ) / (4 ε )

Simplify: E_γ = (4 m_e² c^4 ) / (4 ε ) = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε.

Ah! So I think I messed up earlier. I thought E_γ is sqrt(2 E γ ε), but it's actually E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / (ε).

That makes a big difference. Let me recalculate.

m_e c² is 0.511 MeV = 0.000511 GeV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 is (0.000511 GeV)^2 = (5.11e-4)^2 GeV² = approx 2.611e-7 GeV².

Divide that by ε, which is 1e-3 eV = 1e-12 GeV.

So E_γ = (2.611e-7 GeV²) / (1e-12 GeV) ) = 2.611e-7 / 1e-12 * GeV.

Which is 2.611e5 GeV.

Because 1e-7 / 1e-12 is 1e5.

So 2.611e-7 / 1e-12 = 2.611e5.

So E_γ ≈ 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly.

Yes, because earlier I had s = 4 E_γ ε, set equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So solving for E_γ:

E_γ = ( (2 m_e c^2 )^2 ) / (4 ε )

Which is,

E_γ = (4 m_e^2 c^4 ) / (4 ε )

Simplify numerator and denominator, 4 cancels.

E_γ = (m_e c^2 )^2 / ε.

So calculation is correct. So yes, the correct answer is C) 2.6e5 GeV.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The reaction requires the center-of-mass energy to be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e c^2 \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.000511 \, \text{GeV}$. Thus, the threshold condition is:

\[
\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2,
\]

where $s$ is the Mandelstam variable representing the square of the center-of-mass energy. For two photons with energies $E_\gamma$ (gamma-ray) and $\epsilon$ (CMB photon), moving in opposite directions, the Mandelstam variable $s$ is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + \epsilon)^2 - (E_\gamma - \epsilon)^2 = 4E_\gamma \epsilon.
\]

At the threshold, $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$, so:

\[
4E_\gamma \epsilon = (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Rearranging for $E_\gamma$, we find:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4\epsilon}.
\]

Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.000511 \, \text{GeV}$ and $\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} = 10^{-12} \, \text{GeV}$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(0.001022)^2}{4 \times 10^{-12}}.
\]

First, calculate $(0.001022)^2$:

\[
(0.001022)^2 = 1.044 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Then divide by $4 \times 10^{-12}$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{1.044 \times 10^{-6}}{4 \times 10^{-12}} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This simplifies to approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing this result with the given options:

- **A)** $9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too low.
- **B)** $1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too low.
- **C)** $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Matches the calculation.
- **D)** $3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too high.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

I think the cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is given by something like σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² m_e^4) / (E_cm^4), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy.

Because if E is much larger than ε, then the center-of-mass energy is roughly sqrt(2 E γ ε). So the condition is sqrt(2 E γ ε) >= 2 m_e c².

Wait, m_e is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 m_e c² is 1.022 MeV. So let's express everything in the same units.

E is the gamma-ray energy in GeV. Let's convert m_e c² to GeV. 0.511 MeV is 0.000511 GeV. So 2 m_e c² is 0.001022 GeV.

So the condition is sqrt(2 E γ ε) >= 0.001022 GeV.

Wait, but ε is 1e-3 eV. Let's convert that to GeV. 1 eV is 1e-9 GeV, so ε = 1e-3 eV = 1e-12 GeV.

So plug in ε = 1e-12 GeV:

sqrt(2 * E * 1e-12 ) >= 0.001022

Squaring both sides:

2 * E * 1e-12 >= (0.001022)^2

Calculate the right side: (0.001022)^2 is about 1.044e-6.

So 2 * E * 1e-12 >= 1.044e-6

E >= (1.044e-6) / (2 * 1e-12) ) 

E >= (1.044e-6) / (2e-12) )

Which is (1.044 / 2) ) * 1e6 GeV.

Wait, 1e6 GeV is 1e3 TeV. 1e6 GeV is 1e6 * 1e9 eV = 1e15 eV, which is a petaelectronvolt, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

So 1.044 / 2 is approximately 0.522, so E >= 0.522e6 GeV, which is 5.22e5 GeV. Wait, but looking back at the options:

Options are A) ~1e4 GeV, B) ~1.8e5, C) 2.6e5, D) ~4e5.

Wait, 5e5 is 500,000 GeV, which is higher than any of the options. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's double-check the math.

We have:

sqrt(2 E γ ε) = 2 m_e c²

So, square both sides:

2 E γ ε = (2 m_e c² )^2.

So,

E = ( (2 m_e c² )^2 ) / ( 2 ε )

Plugging in the numbers:

(2 m_e c²) is 1.022 MeV = 0.001022 GeV.

So (0.001022 GeV)^2 is (1.022e-3)^2 GeV² = (1.044e-6) GeV².

Denominator: 2 ε = 2 * 1e-12 GeV.

So E = 1.044e-6 / (2e-12) GeV.

E = (1.044e-6 ) / 2e-12 = (1.044 / 2) * 1e6 GeV.

Wait, 1e6 GeV is 1e6 * 1e9 eV = 1e15 eV? Wait, no, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1e6 GeV is 1e15 eV. But the options are all in the GeV scale.

Wait, 1e6 GeV is 1e6 GeV, which is 1e6 * 1e9 eV = 1e15 eV. But that's way higher than the options given. The options are up to 4e5 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a unit conversion error. Let me double-check the units.

Wait, m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so 0.000511 GeV. So 2 m_e c² is 0.001022 GeV.

Wait, but the CMB photon's energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So 1e-3 eV is 1e-12 GeV, because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 / 1e9 = 1e-12 GeV.

So the calculation is correct. So E = ( (0.001022 GeV)^2 ) / ( 2 * 1e-12 GeV )

Wait, wait, let's compute that again.

(0.001022 GeV)^2 = (0.001022)^2 GeV^2 = (1.044e-6) GeV².

Denominator is 2 * 1e-12 GeV.

Wait, wait, no: denominator is 2 * ε, where ε is 1e-12 GeV.

So denominator is 2e-12 GeV.

So E = (1.044e-6 GeV²) / (2e-12 GeV) ) = (1.044e-6 / 2e-12 ) GeV.

1e-6 / 1e-12 = 1e6, so 1.044e6 / 2 = 0.522e6 GeV.

Which is 5.22e5 GeV.

But none of the options are that high. The highest option is D) 3.9e5 GeV.

Hmm. Did I do something wrong? Maybe I should consider the fact that the cross-section is significant only when the gamma energy is above a certain threshold, but perhaps the calculation is correct and the answer is not among the options. But that can't be. Maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me go back. The process is gamma + photon → e+e-.

The cross-section is non-zero when the center-of-mass energy exceeds 2m_e c². So the condition is sqrt(s) >= 2m_e c², where s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (p_γ c + p_photon c)^2. But for photons, the energy is |p| c, so s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2, because when they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite.

Wait, no, because for two photons moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So their energies are E_γ and ε, but the momenta would be E_γ / c and ε / c, but in opposite directions.

So the total energy is E_γ + ε, and the total momentum is (E_γ - ε)/c.

So s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - ( (E_γ - ε)/c )^2 c^2.

Wait, but c is the speed of light, so let me compute s:

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2.

Expanding that:

s = [E_γ² + 2 E_γ ε + ε²] - [E_γ² - 2 E_γ ε + ε²]

s = 4 E_γ ε.

So s = (4 E_γ ε).

The threshold condition is s = (2 m_e c²)^2.

So,

4 E_γ ε = (2 m_e c²)^2.

So,

E_γ = ( (2 m_e c²)^2 ) / (4 ε )

Simplify: E_γ = (4 m_e² c^4 ) / (4 ε ) = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε.

Ah! So I think I messed up earlier. I thought E_γ is sqrt(2 E γ ε), but it's actually E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / (ε).

That makes a big difference. Let me recalculate.

m_e c² is 0.511 MeV = 0.000511 GeV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 is (0.000511 GeV)^2 = (5.11e-4)^2 GeV² = approx 2.611e-7 GeV².

Divide that by ε, which is 1e-3 eV = 1e-12 GeV.

So E_γ = (2.611e-7 GeV²) / (1e-12 GeV) ) = 2.611e-7 / 1e-12 * GeV.

Which is 2.611e5 GeV.

Because 1e-7 / 1e-12 is 1e5.

So 2.611e-7 / 1e-12 = 2.611e5.

So E_γ ≈ 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly.

Yes, because earlier I had s = 4 E_γ ε, set equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So solving for E_γ:

E_γ = ( (2 m_e c^2 )^2 ) / (4 ε )

Which is,

E_γ = (4 m_e^2 c^4 ) / (4 ε )

Simplify numerator and denominator, 4 cancels.

E_γ = (m_e c^2 )^2 / ε.

So calculation is correct. So yes, the correct answer is C) 2.6e5 GeV.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The reaction requires the center-of-mass energy to be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e c^2 \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.000511 \, \text{GeV}$. Thus, the threshold condition is:

\[
\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2,
\]

where $s$ is the Mandelstam variable representing the square of the center-of-mass energy. For two photons with energies $E_\gamma$ (gamma-ray) and $\epsilon$ (CMB photon), moving in opposite directions, the Mandelstam variable $s$ is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + \epsilon)^2 - (E_\gamma - \epsilon)^2 = 4E_\gamma \epsilon.
\]

At the threshold, $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$, so:

\[
4E_\gamma \epsilon = (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Rearranging for $E_\gamma$, we find:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4\epsilon}.
\]

Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.000511 \, \text{GeV}$ and $\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} = 10^{-12} \, \text{GeV}$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(0.001022)^2}{4 \times 10^{-12}}.
\]

First, calculate $(0.001022)^2$:

\[
(0.001022)^2 = 1.044 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Then divide by $4 \times 10^{-12}$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{1.044 \times 10^{-6}}{4 \times 10^{-12}} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This simplifies to approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing this result with the given options:

- **A)** $9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too low.
- **B)** $1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too low.
- **C)** $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Matches the calculation.
- **D)** $3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too high.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
