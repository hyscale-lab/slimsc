Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing two energy terms: the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They're also using small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. I remember that m can be -1, 0, 1 for p orbitals, and similar for other orbitals, but here it's small, so maybe m is 0 or ±1.

The problem asks to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The hydrogen atom's transition is given with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the Balmer series, right? Specifically, the H-alpha line, which is about 656 nm when redshifted, but wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is blue-green. Maybe that's the transition from n=4 to n=2 or something? Wait, no, 486 nm is the H-alpha line is 656 nm? Wait, I might be getting that mixed up. Alternatively, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is the H-alpha line? Or maybe I'm mixing up different emission lines. Well, regardless, I can calculate the energy ΔE using the wavelength.

So, first, let's find ΔE. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters. So plugging in:

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9)
Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approximately 4.092e-18 J.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that in eV, 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So converting this energy to eV: 4.092e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 25.5 eV. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, wait, wait, I'm probably making a mistake here. Because the Balmer series line at 486 nm is actually the H-alpha line? No, wait, H-alpha is at 656 nm. Oh, so perhaps this is a different transition. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the energy correctly.

Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm. Let me compute it again.

E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m)
= (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7)
Wait, 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 meters? No, wait, 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 meters? No, 1e-9 m is a nanometer, so 486.1 nm is 486.1e-9 m = 4.861e-7 m? Wait, no, 1e-9 is nanometer, so 486.1e-9 m is 4.861e-7 m? No, 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 meters? Wait, no, 486.1e-9 is 486.1 * 1e-9 m = 4.861e-7 m? Wait, no, 486.1e-9 is 0.4861e-6 m, because 1e-6 is a micrometer. So 0.4861 micrometers is 0.4861e-6 m. So 0.4861e-6 m equals 4.861e-7 m. So perhaps I should correct the calculation.

Wait no, the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 m. So let me recompute E.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9)
= (1.9878e-25) / (486.1e-9)
= 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7
Wait, no, 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7, so 4.861e-7 m. So E is 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.092e-19 J.

Wait, that's way lower than before. So 4.092e-19 J. Convert to eV: 4.092e-19 / 1.602e-19 = ~2.555 eV. Hmm, that's more reasonable. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels of hydrogen are much smaller. The ground state energy is about -13.6 eV, and transitions between energy levels are on the order of eV. So that makes sense.

Now, the other part: the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩. The paramagnetic term arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this is probably the Zeeman term, H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, wait, I might be mixing spin and orbital here. Alternatively, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l(l+1))^(1/2) * m_l / something. Hmm, perhaps I should write the Hamiltonian more accurately.

Wait, the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman term. The Zeeman Hamiltonian for orbital angular momentum is H_Z = -μ·B, where μ is the orbital magnetic moment. The orbital magnetic moment is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m_l, where m_l is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So, H_Z = (eħ B)/(2m_e) * m_l.

Wait, no, more accurately, the orbital magnetic dipole moment is μ = (μ_B) * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton (μ_B = eħ/(2m_e)). So, the energy is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, which is the z-axis, and m_l is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum, so the energy is H = -μ_B B m_l.

Wait, but in the problem, it's about the paramagnetic coupling term, which might involve spin-orbit coupling? Or is it purely the orbital contribution? Hmm, perhaps I should be careful. Alternatively, paramagnetic terms can arise from the spin, but in this case, the problem is about the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think refers to the orbital contribution because the orbital magnetic moment is paramagnetic.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The paramagnetic effect arises due to the magnetic moment of the electron, which can be spin or orbital. But in the Zeeman effect, we consider the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with the external field. So, for hydrogen, the main energy shift due to a magnetic field is the Zeeman effect, which is H = μ_B B m_l.

Wait, so the energy shift ⟨H⟩ is μ_B B m_l. So let's compute that.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. The magnetic field B is 1 T. m_l is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Since the problem says small values of m (m is m_l?), so m is small, like m=0, ±1, etc.

So, ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * B * m_l. So for m=0, it's zero. For m=1, it's μ_B * B *1.

So plugging in the numbers: 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but wait, that's the energy for m=1. So what's the order of magnitude? 1e-23 J.

Now, let's compare this with ΔE, which was about 2.55 eV. Let's convert ΔE to joules again. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 2.55 eV is 2.55 * 1.602e-19 = approx 4.08e-19 J.

So we have ⟨H⟩ = 9.274e-24 J, and ΔE = 4.08e-19 J.

Comparing these, 9.274e-24 is much smaller than 4.08e-19. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "paramagnetic coupling term". Oh, wait, could this be referring to the spin-orbit coupling instead of the orbital Zeeman effect? Because spin-orbit coupling is a different effect, but perhaps the question is mixing terms.

Wait, but the question says "paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE of Hydrogen atom". So the transition is between energy levels, which has energy ΔE, and the paramagnetic term is a perturbation.

Wait, but in the hydrogen atom, the Zeeman effect (orbital) is a perturbation when the magnetic field is applied, causing shifts in the energy levels. So the paramagnetic coupling term is this Zeeman term, which is H = μ_B B m_l.

So in that case, the ⟨H⟩ would be on the order of 1e-23 J, as I calculated earlier.

So when compared to ΔE, which is about 4e-19 J, ⟨H⟩ is much smaller. So the ratio is about (1e-23)/(4e-19) = 2.5e-5, which is way less than one. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

Therefore, the correct option would be C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Wait, but wait another thought. Could the paramagnetic term be the spin contribution instead? Because spin is also a magnetic moment. The spin magnetic moment is given by μ_s = γ_s S, where γ_s is the gyromagnetic ratio for spin.

The spin g-factor is about 2, so the spin magnetic moment is μ_s = (eħ)/(2m_e) * g_s * s_z, where s_z is the spin quantum number (which is ±1/2).

So the spin Zeeman energy would be H = -μ·B = -μ_s B. So H = (eħ g_s B)/(2m_e) * s_z.

Wait, let's compute that. The spin magnetic moment is μ_s = (g_s μ_B/2) * m_s, where m_s can be ±1/2.

So the energy is H = μ_B g_s m_s B / 2.

Wait, let me compute that. g_s is approximately 2.

So H = (μ_B * 2 * B * m_s)/2 = μ_B B m_s.

Wait, wait, so for spin, μ_s = (g_s μ_B/2) * m_s. So H = -μ·B = -(g_s μ_B m_s B)/2.

Wait, but in any case, let's plug in the numbers.

μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T. B is 1 T. m_s is ±1/2.

So H = (9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1/2) * 2? Wait, no, wait: H = (g_s μ_B B m_s)/2.

Wait, g_s is 2, so (2 * μ_B * B * m_s) / 2) = μ_B B m_s.

So for m_s = 1/2, H = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * (1/2) = 4.637e-24 J.

Which is even smaller than the orbital case. So that's 4.6e-24 J.

Comparing to ΔE of 4.08e-19 J, this is even smaller.

So regardless of whether it's spin or orbital, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but why is the orbital case m being small, like m=1, but the spin case m_s is 1/2.

So in any case, whether it's spin or orbital, the paramagnetic energy is much smaller than the transition energy.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the two energy scales:

1. **Transition Energy ΔE**:  
   The transition energy is calculated using the wavelength of the emitted photon, given by \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \).  
   - Planck's constant \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),  
   - Speed of light \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),  
   - Wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).  

   Substituting these values:  
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} = 4.092 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{4.092 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩**:  
   The paramagnetic term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \).  
   - For orbital magnetic moment:  
     \[
     \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}, \quad \langle H \rangle = \mu_B B m_l,
     \]  
     where \( m_l \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number. For small \( m_l \) (e.g., \( m_l = 0, \pm 1 \)), the energy shift is:  
     \[
     \langle H \rangle = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \times 1 \, \text{T} \times 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
     \]  
   - For spin magnetic moment:  
     The spin magnetic moment is smaller, with \( m_s = \pm 1/2 \):  
     \[
     \langle H \rangle = \frac{\mu_B B}{2} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{2} \approx 4.637 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
     \]  

3. **Comparison**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} = 4.08 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) is significantly larger than the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \), which is on the order of \( 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) for orbital contributions and even smaller for spin contributions. Thus, \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

**Conclusion**: The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom.
