Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the problem says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames of reference. Wait, inertial frames are those that are not accelerating, right? So, they're moving at a constant velocity relative to each other.

From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh, wait, but in reality, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at that speed in the galaxy's frame. Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta would be approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, they must be moving towards each other.

The question is asking: how far does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, time dilation comes into play here because of special relativity. Because in different frames, time passes at different rates.

Wait, so the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to find the proper time in the galaxy's frame to calculate the distance.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the situation. The ejecta is moving at velocity v relative to the galaxy. From the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at v. From the ejecta's perspective, the galaxy is approaching at v. So, the relative speed is v, which is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 meters per second. Wait, that's way higher than the speed of light. Oh wait, wait! The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 km/s is 20% the speed of light. So, relativistic effects are significant here.

So, we need to calculate the time in the galaxy's frame that corresponds to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Because the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by that time.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The distance in the galaxy's frame would be the speed of the ejecta multiplied by the time elapsed in the galaxy's frame. But the time given is in the ejecta's frame.

So, let me denote the time in the ejecta's frame as t' = 50 seconds. We need to find the time t in the galaxy's frame. Since the ejecta is moving, the two frames are in relative motion.

The time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, I'll need to compute gamma for v = 60,000 km/s.

Wait, wait, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into meters per second. Oh, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s, which is 6e7 m/s. Wait, no, wait: 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km is 6e4 * 1e3 meters, which is 6e7 meters. So, 6e7 m/s.

Wait, but the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v is 0.2c (since 0.2 * 3e8 is 6e7). So, v = 0.2 c.

Okay, so gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me compute this.

v = 0.2 c, so v²/c² = 0.04. So, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.98 (since 0.98^2 is 0.9604). So, sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98.

So, gamma ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ approximately 1.0204. Wait, wait, more accurately, 0.98 is 49/50. So, sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately.

But perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let's see, 0.98 squared is 0.9604. Wait, actually, 0.96 is (0.98)^2 = 0.9604, which is a bit more than 0.96. So, wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute sqrt(0.96) accurately. Let me compute it. Let me think, 0.96 is 96/100. So sqrt(96) is around 9.798. So sqrt(96/100) is 9.798/10 = 0.9798. So, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, gamma ≈ 1.0206.

Time in galaxy frame, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the time in the galaxy frame longer or shorter than the ejecta's frame? Because from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it should run slower. So, the time in the galaxy frame should be longer.

Wait, but in this case, the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So, t' = 50 s is the proper time for the ejecta. So, in the galaxy's frame, the same event would take longer, so t = gamma * t' which is longer than t'.

So, the calculation is correct.

Now, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t.

v is 60,000 km/s, and t is approximately 51.03 seconds.

So, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000, and 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So, 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. So approximately 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So that's very close.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute it more precisely.

v = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.

v²/c² = (6e7)^2 / (3e8)^2 = (36e14) / (9e16) = (36/9) * 1e-2 = 4 * 0.01 = 0.04.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

So, sqrt(0.96) = approx 0.979795897.

So, gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020622385.

So, t = gamma * t' = 1.020622385 * 50 ≈ 51.03111925 seconds.

So, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03111925 s = 60,000 * 51.03111925.

Calculate that:

51.03111925 * 60,000 = ?

Well, 50 *60,000=3,000,000.

1.03111925 *60,000= 61,867.155.

So total is 3,000,000 + 61,867.155 ≈ 3,061,867.155 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So, our calculation is about 3,061,867 km. But none of the options exactly match that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

So, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. But our calculation is 3,061,867 km.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I should consider length contraction.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. But perhaps I should consider the correct approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy, the time in the galaxy frame is longer than the ejecta's. So, the distance is v multiplied by t.

But perhaps I should think about the proper time. Alternatively, let me think about the relationship between the two frames.

In the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at velocity v, so after t' = 50 seconds, the galaxy has moved a distance of v * t' (in the ejecta's frame). But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it. So, the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t'.

Wait, but I think that's correct. So, the distance is 60,000 km/s * gamma * 50 s.

Wait, but perhaps I should re-calculate gamma more accurately.

Wait, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

We have v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04.

So,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062238.

So, t = gamma * t' = 1.02062238 * 50 = 51.031119 s.

Distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.031119 s = 3,061,867.14 km.

Hmm, but the options don't have that, but option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps they rounded gamma to a certain decimal point.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using more precise values.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.

We can compute sqrt(0.96) using the Taylor expansion or other methods.

Let me think: sqrt(0.96) = 0.97958976...

So, gamma is approximately 1.02062238.

So, 50 * 1.02062238 = 51.031119 s.

60,000 km/s * 51.031119 s = 60,000 * 51.031119 = 3,061,867.14 km.

Hmm, but the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, giving t=50 * 1.02 =51 s, so 60,000 * 51=3,060,000 km. So that's option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, perhaps considering the time in the ejecta's frame as the proper time. But wait, no, in this scenario, the time t' is in the ejecta's frame, which is the moving frame. The proper time is the time in the frame where the two events (start and end of the journey) occur at the same place. So, perhaps in this case, the proper time is the time measured in the galaxy frame because the distance the ejecta travels is happening at a fixed point in the galaxy's frame? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the proper time should be the shortest time between two events in spacetime, measured in the frame where the events happen at the same place. So, in this case, the two events are the start of the journey (ejecta leaving supernova) and the end of the journey (ejecta arrives at some point). So, the proper time would be in the ejecta's frame, because the events happen at the same place in that frame. So, the time in the ejecta's frame (t') is the proper time, and the galaxy's frame would see a longer time (t = gamma * t').

So, our initial approach is correct. So, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation and rounds to the nearest option, which is D) 3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute gamma more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a trick. Because the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, perhaps the relative velocity is 60,000 km/s, but in reality, each frame sees the other's velocity as v', where v' = (v + u)/(1 + vu/c²), but wait, no, that's when velocities are added. Wait, no, in this case, the relative velocity between the galaxy and the ejecta is v. So, from each frame, the other is moving at v.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because according to special relativity, if frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then in S, S' moves at velocity v, but in S', S is moving at velocity -v. So, they are symmetric in terms of velocity, but time dilation and length contraction would apply.

So, our initial approach holds.

Wait, but perhaps the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. So, the distance is v * t, where t = gamma * t'.

So, 60,000 km/s * gamma * 50 s.

But perhaps let me compute gamma exactly.

Let me compute gamma again.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) in a more precise way.

We know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is a bit higher than 0.96. So, 0.9798^2 would be 0.96.

Wait, 0.9798^2 = ?

0.9798 * 0.9798 = let's compute.

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

But 0.9798 is 0.98 - 0.0002.

So, (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = 0.98^2 - 2 *0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ approximately 0.960008.

Which is a bit higher than 0.96. So, 0.9798^2 ≈ 0.960008, which is a bit higher than 0.96.

So, perhaps sqrt(0.96) is about 0.979795897.

So, gamma is 1/0.979795897 ≈ 1.02062238.

So, t = 50 * 1.02062238 ≈ 51.031119 s.

So, 60,000 km/s * 51.031119 s = 60,000 *51.031119 = 3,061,867.14 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. So, it's the closest. So, the answer should be D.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction. Because in the galaxy's frame, the distance is contracted.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame is determined by the time in the galaxy's frame multiplied by the velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the distance in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, but I'm confident that the correct approach is to compute t as gamma * t', then multiply by v to get distance.

So, the calculation comes out to about 3,061,867 km, which is not exactly one of the options. But the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects a simpler approximation, like gamma =1.02.

So, t=50 * 1.02=51 s.

Distance = 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, which is exactly option D.

So, that's probably what the problem is expecting, so the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy. The ejecta is moving at a velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) (or \( 0.2c \)) towards the center of the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame during a time interval of \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) in the ejecta's reference frame. Since the frames are inertial, relativistic effects must be considered.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The time dilation formula relates the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) to the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)):  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.2c \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance (\( \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**. The slight discrepancy arises from rounding \( \gamma \) to a simpler approximation (\( \gamma \approx 1.02 \)) in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame during \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**, corresponding to option **D**.
