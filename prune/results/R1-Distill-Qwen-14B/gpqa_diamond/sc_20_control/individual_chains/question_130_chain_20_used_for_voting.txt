Okay, so I have this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through a cloud of hydrogen, it can absorb certain wavelengths. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is one of those. The Lyman-alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. 

The question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift for these clouds to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Wait, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because our atmosphere blocks it. So the light that reaches us from these quasars after being absorbed must have shifted into the optical range because of the redshift.

Redshift, z, is given by the formula (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) - 1. So if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, we need to find the smallest z such that the observed wavelength is in the optical range. But what's the cutoff for optical? I think optical is roughly from 400 to 700 nm, but wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is UV. 

So the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). We need λ_obs to be less than or equal to 700 nm, because anything beyond that is infrared, which I think ground-based optical telescopes can't detect effectively, or maybe that's pushing it. Or wait, some optical telescopes can handle a bit into the near-infrared, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the maximum wavelength that's observable in the optical without being absorbed by the atmosphere. Let me think.

Wait, the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm. So for ground-based optical telescopes, they can't observe below that. So the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) has to be redshifted into the optical. So the observed wavelength needs to be greater than 300 nm, perhaps? Because below that, the atmosphere blocks it. So the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is 300 nm.

Wait, no. The cloud is in deep space, so when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the hydrogen in the cloud absorbs at 1216 Angstroms (rest frame). For us to observe that absorption line, the wavelength must have been redshifted into the optical range. Wait, no... The quasar emits light in all wavelengths, but the hydrogen cloud absorbs some of it. The quasar's light that was emitted at 1216 Angstroms (Lyman-alpha) will be absorbed by the cloud. The rest of the quasar's light passes through, but the absorption is seen as a dark line in the spectrum. 

But wait, the absorption is in the quasar's frame, but when the quasar is at a high redshift, that absorption line shifts into a wavelength that we can observe. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the quasar must have a high enough redshift that 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) is in the optical range. Alternatively, if the quasar is too nearby, the absorption line would be in the UV, which we can't see from the ground.

So the condition is that 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) must be >= 300 nm (since below that, the atmosphere absorbs it). Wait, no, wait. Wait, 300 nm is 3000 Angstroms. So 1216 * (1 + z) >= 3000 Angstroms? Then (1 + z) >= 3000/1216 ≈ 2.468. So z >= approx 1.468. So the lower limit is about z=1.47.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.2, D is 1.9, C is 2.4. Hmm. Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. The cutoff for optical is about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So 1216 * (1 + z) = 3000 → 1 + z = 3000/1216 ≈ 2.466 → z ≈ 1.466. So the lower limit is z≈1.47. So any object with z below this would have the Lyman-alpha absorption in UV, which we can't see from ground. So the lower limit is z≈1.47. 

Looking at the options, option D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.47. Option B is 1.2, which is lower. So the lower limit would require that the redshift is at least 1.47. So the object must have a redshift higher than that. So the lower limit is z=1.47. So the minimum redshift for detection is about 1.47. So in the options, the closest is option D (1.9) or perhaps none. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms, and when it passes through the hydrogen cloud, the absorption line is at the rest wavelength of 1216. But to observe that absorption line, the quasar must be at a redshift such that 1216*(1+z) is in the range that we can observe with optical telescopes, i.e., longer than 400 nm (visible light starts around 400 nm). Wait, maybe I should use the visible range as the threshold.

Wait, the visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm. Let me compute for 400 nm. 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1+z) = 4000 → 1+z = 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29.

Wait, but that would make the lower limit higher. Hmm. Which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the absorption needs to be in the optical range, which starts around 400 nm. So the Lyman-alpha line should be redshifted from 1216 (121.6 nm) into the optical. So the minimum z is when 1216*(1+z) = 400 nm. Wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 1+z = 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29, so z ≈ 2.29.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. So which is correct?

Wait, the initial question is about what's the minimum redshift such that the absorption is detectable. So the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the quasar's frame at 1216 Angstroms. For us to observe that absorption in the optical, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. So the quasar's emission that is at 1216 in its frame must be redshifted into the optical.

But wait, quasars are very luminous. If the quasar is at a certain redshift, its own emission lines (including Lyman-alpha) are redshifted. But the absorption is due to intervening hydrogen clouds, which are at a different redshift.

Wait, wait, no. The question is about the clouds, not the quasars. So the quasar is behind the cloud. So the quasar's light is redshifted, and the cloud's hydrogen is at the same redshift as the quasar. Wait, no. Wait, no, the cloud is in front of the quasar. So the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is behind the cloud. So the quasar's light passes through the cloud, which causes absorption at the cloud's rest frame 1216 Angstroms.

So when we observe the quasar's spectrum, the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms as seen in the cloud's frame. But due to the cloud's redshift, the observed wavelength is longer. So the observed wavelength λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud).

So for λ_obs to be in the optical, which we can detect, it must be longer than UV. Since ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), the observed wavelength must be longer than that. So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 3000 Angstroms → 1 + z_cloud >= 3000/1216 ≈ 2.466 → z_cloud >= 1.466.

So the lower limit is z_cloud ≈ 1.466. So the minimum redshift is about 1.47. Looking at the options, the closest higher option is D)1.9. But wait, option B is 1.2, which is lower than 1.47, so that would mean the observed wavelength is 1216*(1.2+1) = 1216 * 2.2 = 2675.2 Angstroms = 267.5 nm, which is in the UV. So we can't detect that with optical telescopes, so z must be higher than 1.47.

So the lower limit is approximately 1.47, so the minimum redshift to detect is around 1.47. Looking at the options, the only options higher than 1.47 are C (2.4) and D (1.9). But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift, meaning the minimum z that allows detection.

So the minimal z is approximately 1.47, so any object with z >=1.47 can be detected. So the lower limit is z=1.47. So looking at the options, the first option above 1.47 is D)1.9.

But wait, none of the options are exactly 1.47. So perhaps the options are approximate. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A)3
B)1.2
C)2.4
D)1.9

So 1.9 is the next higher option after 1.47. So the lower limit is 1.47, so the minimal z is approximately 1.5, so the answer would be D)1.9, because anything below that wouldn't be detectable.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me re-calculate 300 nm. 300 nm is 3000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1 + z) = 3000 → 1+z=3000/1216 ≈ 2.467 → z ≈ 1.467.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 1.47. So the correct answer would be approximately 1.47, but in the options, the closest higher value is D)1.9. So the lower limit is 1.47, but since the options don't have 1.47, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman limit or another factor.

Wait another thought: maybe the quasar's emission itself is at a high redshift, and the Lyman-alpha absorption is from a different cloud. Hmm, no, the question states that the clouds are absorbing the quasar's light.

Alternatively, perhaps the clouds are at the same redshift as the quasar. Wait, but in reality, the clouds could be in front of the quasar, so their redshift is lower than the quasar's.

Wait, but the question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) such that they can be detected.

Wait no, the question says, "the lower limit on the redshift of this objects". So the objects are the clouds. So the cloud's redshift must be high enough that the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the optical.

So, cloud's redshift z_cloud must satisfy 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 3000 Angstroms → z_cloud >= 1.467.

So the lower limit is approximately 1.47, but the options are A:3, B:1.2, C:2.4, D:1.9.

So the minimal redshift is about 1.47, the options don't have that, so the next higher is D)1.9.

Wait, but why is option B 1.2? Let me calculate what 1216*(1+1.2) is. 2.2 *1216= 2,675.2 Angstroms, which is 267.5 nm, which is UV. So if the cloud has z=1.2, the absorption line is at 267.5 nm, which is in the UV and cannot be seen with optical telescopes. So that would not be detectable. So for detection, z needs to be higher than 1.47, so option D (1.9) is the first one where the absorption line is in the optical.

So the answer should be D)1.9.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that the Lyman-alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshift relationship. The observed wavelength of the absorption line is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\) (rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line), and \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) must fall within the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes. The optical range is approximately \(400 \, \text{nm}\) to \(700 \, \text{nm}\), or \(4000 \, \text{Å}\) to \(7000 \, \text{Å}\). However, ground-based telescopes cannot observe wavelengths shorter than \(300 \, \text{nm}\) (or \(3000 \, \text{Å}\)) due to atmospheric absorption. Thus, the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted to at least \(3000 \, \text{Å}\) for detection.

Rearranging the redshift formula:

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 3000 \, \text{Å}\) and \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\):

\[
1 + z = \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.467 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \approx 1.467
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(z \approx 1.47\). Any redshift below this value would result in the Lyman-alpha absorption line being in the ultraviolet (UV) range, which cannot be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Now, evaluating the options:

- **A) 3**: This is much higher than the calculated lower limit and is not the minimum redshift.
- **B) 1.2**: At \(z = 1.2\), the observed wavelength is \(1216 \cdot (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2 \, \text{Å}\) (or \(267.5 \, \text{nm}\)), which is in the UV range and not detectable with optical telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: This is higher than the lower limit but not the minimum redshift.
- **D) 1.9**: At \(z = 1.9\), the observed wavelength is \(1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3699.2 \, \text{Å}\) (or \(369.9 \, \text{nm}\)), which is in the optical range and detectable.

The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(z \approx 1.47\), and the smallest option above this value is **D) 1.9**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: D
