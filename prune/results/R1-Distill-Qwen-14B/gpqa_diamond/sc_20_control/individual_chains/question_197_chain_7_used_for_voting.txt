Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again and understand what's being asked. 

The question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the final product from the given options. To do this, I should first determine the structure of compound X using the provided IR and NMR data.

Let me look at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which I think might be due to an O-H stretch or maybe some kind of C-H stretch, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be broad, right? But the IR here has a region from 3400-2500, which is a broad region. Could it be both O-H and C-H stretches?

Looking at the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong sign of a carboxylic acid proton. Because in the NMR, the -COOH proton typically shows up around 10-12 ppm, and it's a broad signal because it's exchanging with the solvent. So that makes me think that compound X has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but let me not jump to conclusions. Alternatively, that peak could be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm, and I don't think they're as broad. So a carboxylic acid is more likely. So, the IR at 1720 cm-1 would fit a carboxylic acid (since the carbonyl for -COOH is around 1700 cm-1). But wait, sometimes if there's conjugation, the carbonyl might be a bit lower, like around 1680-1700. Hmm, but 1720 is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. Could it be an ester? Because esters have higher carbonyl frequencies, around 1720-1750 cm-1. So maybe it's an ester? But then the NMR would show an O-H stretch if it's an ester, but wait, esters don't have O-H. So maybe the 3400-2500 cm-1 is from an alkyl group. Wait, no, that's a broad region which could be O-H. So if the IR shows a carbonyl around 1720, and the NMR has a proton around 10.5, that's likely a carboxylic acid. So perhaps compound X is a substituted benzoic acid.

Let me look at the NMR shifts again. The 10.5 ppm is probably the -COOH proton. Then, the aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets each with 2H would be two sets of equivalent protons, which fits a para-substituted aromatic group. So, maybe something like p-methylbenzoic acid or similar.

Wait, but the protons might be from a meta or para substitution. So, in the aromatic region, two doublets with 2H each in a para substitution would mean that the substituent is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. So, if the benzene ring has substituents at the para position and perhaps another group, but from NMR, I see two doublets, each 2H. So, perhaps a substituent in the para position, and the ring is otherwise symmetric.

Looking at the other NMR peaks. 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – that's probably a methylene or methine group adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl or an oxygen. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another set of methylene protons, perhaps part of a branching. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH2 or a CH group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting that together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. For example, a benzene ring where one substituent is -COOH and the other is an ethyl or isobutyl group in the para position.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene would be a group attached via a chain. Let's think. The 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, perhaps as in an isobutyl group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet for 2H could be a CH2 next to a branching point. The 2.9 ppm multiplet for 1H could be a CH adjacent to both a CH2 and a CH3.

Hmm, maybe it's an isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let me draw this out mentally. So, the benzene ring has a -COOH group and an isobutyl group in the para positions. The isobutyl group would have the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring. Wait, no. Let's think about the structure of isobutyl. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene? No, wait, maybe it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. If the substituent is an ethyl group, then the NMR would have a triplet for the CH2CH3, but in this case, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (t) for 3H, which is a terminal CH2CH3. So the ethyl group would be attached somewhere. But the other signals at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would suggest a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isobutyl group.

Wait, let's consider the substituent on the benzene ring. Let me think about the structure. Suppose the substituents are at the para positions: one is -COOH and the other is an isobutyl group. So, the benzene has -COOH and -CH2CH(CH2CH3) groups? No, wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. But that might be a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Let me try to piece this together.

The NMR data shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely a -COOH proton.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): two protons in a doublet, probably on the benzene ring.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): another doublet, two protons. So, four aromatic protons in total, which suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So, the substituents are at opposite positions, like p-substituted.

So, the benzene ring has a -COOH group and another substituent in the para position.

The other substituent is on the benzene ring and perhaps is a branched alkyl group. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): possibly a methine (CH) group adjacent to something. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a CH2 group next to a branch. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl. So putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but wait, that's an isobutyl group.

Wait, no. Let me think. The substituent on the benzene ring is an isobutyl group. Let me imagine the structure:

Benzene ring with -COOH and -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's a larger substituent.

Wait, let me think about the structure of an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3) attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3), which is then connected to another CH2.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the substituent as a propyl group with a branch. Let me consider the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that would be a tertiary butyl group. Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which would be a pentyl or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. But then how would the NMR look? Let's break it down.

The substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring. So, the CH2 is connected to the ring, then a CH connected to another CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the structure a bit complex. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)- attached to something? Wait, no. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached via the middle CH. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group. Let's think of the substituent as a propyl group, but with branching.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that's a butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent would be a isopropyl group attached to the ring. But that would give a different NMR.

Wait, perhaps I should try to reconstruct the substituent based on the NMR signals.

The substituent's branch would have a structure like this: the benzene ring is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH3. Also, the CH would have another CH2 group attached, which ends with a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. No, that's a pentyl group. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group, which is a four-carbon group where the branching is at the second carbon. So the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, isobutyl is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), no, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, the structure of isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, that's not correct. Let me think: the isobutyl group is a four-carbon group where the branching is on the second carbon. So, it's CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene? Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure for isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3) attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3), with another CH2 group attached? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it a sec-propyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the integration of the NMR signals. The aromatic region is 2H each for two doublets, so the substituent is in the para position, making the ring have two sets of two equivalent protons each. That suggests that the substituent is either an electron-withdrawing group or an electron-donating group, but in our case, the -COOH is an electron-withdrawing group, so the other substituent is likely an alkyl group which is electron-donating.

So, the substituent is an alkyl group in the para position relative to the -COOH group.

Now, looking at the non-aromatic signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH group connected to something, perhaps next to a carbonyl or an oxygen.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe CH2 groups next to a branching point.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH. So maybe the structure is something like -CH(CH3)-CH2-.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, so perhaps a CH2CH3 at the end.

Putting this together, it could be a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which is a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). Wait, no, because a pentyl group would have more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Wait, but how is that attached? Maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that would be a tertiary butyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, the NMR would have a triplet for the CH(CH3)2 group? No, wait, the tertiary butyl group is (CH3)3C-, which would have a singlet for the CH3 groups. But in our NMR, the methyl groups are split into a doublet at 1.4 ppm, which suggests they are attached to a CH group.

Hmm, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me think: the substituent is attached as CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the structure would be benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group in the para position.

Wait, but how does that look in terms of NMR? The CH2 group attached to the ring would have protons that might appear as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm. The CH group in the middle would have protons appearing as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (the 1H), and the CH2CH3 group would have the triplet at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, it's a isopropyl group attached via the CH2.

Wait, another approach: the substituent has a structure like CH2CH2CH(CH3) but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a butyl group, but with a branch. Let me see:

The substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). The -CH2 group attached to the benzene would have two protons. But in the NMR, I don't see a peak for that, unless it's part of a multiplet.

Wait, the NMR shows a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be the CH group in the middle. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 groups adjacent to the branching. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH group, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal methyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, but I'm not quite getting it. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me think of the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. That would make it a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), so the substituent is attached via the CH group. So, the structure would be benzene ring with -COOH and -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) groups in the para positions.

But wait, does that fit the NMR data?

The substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the first CH2 (attached to the ring) would have protons that are adjacent to the CH group. The CH group would have one proton (as in the NMR, 1H at 2.9 ppm). The CH2 next to the CH group would have two protons (perhaps the 1.7 ppm m). And the CH2CH3 group would have three protons as a triplet (0.9 ppm t, 3H).

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which is a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. The substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the structure is benzene-(CH2)CH(CH3).

Wait, but that would give a substituent of a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think about the NMR for that structure.

The substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3) attached to the ring. So the CH2 group attached to the ring would have two protons. The CH group (middle) would have one proton. The CH3 group attached to the CH would have three protons as a doublet (since it's attached to a CH). The rest would be the terminal CH3. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, that's a butyl group with a branch on the third carbon. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which would be a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, maybe I should think of the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure of a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-. So, the substituent is attached via the central CH, which is connected to CH3 and CH2 groups.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would correspond to the central CH of the sec-butyl group. The CH2 groups would be the next. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the central CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the CH3 attached to the central CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal CH3 of the other CH2.

So, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group.

Putting it all together, the benzene ring has a -COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions. So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Let me check the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Yes, that's what I'm thinking.

Now, the reaction of compound X with red phosphorus and HI. What's that reaction? Oh, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Hinsberg reaction. The Hinsberg reaction is used to determine whether a compound is an amine, a primary amine, secondary amine, or not an amine. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing it. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used to cleave certain functional groups.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it might undergo some kind of substitution or elimination. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced.

Wait, what's the typical reaction of a carboxylic acid with HCl and red phosphorus? Oh, wait, another thought: maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's done with peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to form an acid chloride. But red phosphorus and HI are used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides. Oh, wait, I think that when a carboxylic acid reacts with excess of HCl or HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it converts the acid into an acid chloride. So, the -COOH group becomes -COCl.

But wait, if that's the case, then the product would have a Cl substituent. But the options don't include any Cl. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. Hmm.

Wait, another reaction: the treatment of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus can lead to the formation of an acid iodide. But I'm not sure how that's helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced with an iodide. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reagents. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for reducing carbonyl groups to CH2 groups. But that requires heating with NH2NH2 and a strong base, so I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by an iodide. For example, in the presence of a Lewis acid like red phosphorus, HI could act as a nucleophile, displacing the -OH in the carboxylic acid. But that's not straightforward because carboxylic acids are not good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is formed? No, because we have a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. But that would require activating the ring, which a carboxylic acid does. But I'm not sure how HI and red phosphorus would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction of benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI. Let me recall: I think that when benzoic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by an iodide. So, the reaction is:

Benzoic acid → benzoyl chloride (using SOCl2 typically), but with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a similar substitution.

Wait, but benzoic acid with excess HI and red phosphorus could form benzene iodide, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about deprotonating the -COOH and replacing the O- with I-.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Finkelstein reaction, but that typically involves halide exchange in the presence of a sodium iodide and a non-polar solvent. But in this case, red phosphorus and HI are used, which might be a different setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH group is deprotonated, and then HI acts as a nucleophile, replacing the O- with I-. So, the product would be benzene ring with a iodide and whatever substituent was present.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the product after substitution would be 4-iodo- substituted compound. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the reaction is not on the -COOH group but on another part of the molecule.

Wait, another thought: if compound X is a benzyl ester with a substituent, but I don't think so because the NMR shows a COOH proton.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the substituent. But the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is not a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. For example, if the substituent has a leaving group, but that's not the case here.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus is sometimes used in reductions, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a protection or deprotection of the carboxylic acid. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the -COOH group into an amine. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. But under what conditions? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, but the question is about the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the reaction is converting the -COOH group into something else.

Wait, if compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the -COOH is converted into an acid chloride. But then, what's the product? If the -COOH becomes Cl, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the -COOH group as CO2, but that would require strong conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, making 4-iodo-sec-butylbenzene. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, but that's more about aromatic rings under specific conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the substituent chain, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the reagents do. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hinsberg reaction to determine the nature of amines. Wait, no, the Hinsberg reaction is when an amine reacts with benzene sulfonyl chloride to form a sulfonamide, and then treated with base. If it's a primary amine, it forms a sulfonamide that is insoluble, and upon treatment with base, it forms a soluble amine. But that's unrelated here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, and then further reaction occurs. But without more information, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. If the benzene ring has a good leaving group, but in this case, the substituents are -COOH and -sec-butyl. The -COOH is a poor leaving group unless activated. So, perhaps under the reaction conditions, the -COOH group is converted into a better leaving group, like Cl or I, and then substituted with another group from HI.

Wait, but that would require activating the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where the -COOH is replaced by iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. If the substituent has a structure that can eliminate, but I don't see that here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm completely off track and the reaction is a simple substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -OH group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions in terms of the Hunsdiecker reaction, but that's about breaking C-X bonds with halogens, which isn't directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a protection of the carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the reaction part. Maybe I should focus back on the structure of compound X. Because the reaction might only change one part of the structure, perhaps the COOH group.

Wait, if compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would convert the -COOH into something else. If it becomes -COI (acid iodide), but then what's the product? Not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the -COOH group. Maybe it's on the substituent.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, perhaps the reaction is removing the methyl groups. But how?

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction is a substitution where the hydrogen is replaced by iodide. For example, if the substituent is an ethyl group, it could be substituted to an iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction as a way to form an ether or something else, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the substituent chain, but I don't see any good leaving groups there.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a rearrangement, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me think about the reagent's role. Red phosphorus is often used as a reducing agent. For example, it can reduce certain functional groups.

Wait, in the presence of HI, red phosphorus can reduce esters or other carbonyl groups. Wait, but in this case, the compound is a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but carboxylic acids are not easily reduced under normal conditions. However, in the presence of a strong reducing agent like red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the -COOH group is reduced to -CH2OH.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH is converted into a methyl group. But that would require more specific conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is converting the -COOH group into an alcohol. For example, using a Clemmensen reduction or something else. But Clemmensen uses Zn/Hg and HCl, not red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a reduction of the carbonyl group in the substituent. Wait, but the substituent is an alkyl group, which doesn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -OH group, but that doesn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is introducing iodine into the ring. But I think that requires a good leaving group and activating groups. The -COOH is a deactivating group, which would hinder substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nitration or something else, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a simple substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, making the product 4-iodo-sec-butylbenzene. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again: option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. No carboxylic acid group there. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Also no acid. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's our compound X.

So, the reaction is transforming compound X into one of these options. Wait, but the product is after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the reaction is removing the -COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis under acidic conditions, but that would require different reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH is converted into a methyl group, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, making the benzene ring have a iodide and a sec-butyl group in the para positions. But the options don't show that, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is cleaving the compound. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group, the reaction could break it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but that would require a different setup.

Wait, given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should think about the options. The correct structure of compound X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

If the reaction is converting the -COOH into an acid chloride (using SOCl2, but not sure with red phosphorus and HI), then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide. So, the product would be 4-iodo-sec-butylbenzene. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is reducing the -COOH to a CH2OH group, making 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is replacing the -COOH and the substituent. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, perhaps a hydrogen is replaced by iodide. But I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a good leaving group, but it's an alkyl group, which typically isn't.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the reaction is not changing the substituent but is eliminating the -COOH group. For example, perhaps it's decarboxylation.

If the reaction is decarboxylation, the -COOH group would be removed, releasing CO2, and the substituent would remain. So, we would have benzene with a para substituent which is a sec-butyl group. So, that would make the product 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3). So, the product would be benzene with a sec-butyl group in the para position relative to where the COOH was. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, but I don't see that option.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would imply that the substituents are a sec-butyl and a methyl group in the para positions. But that's not the case for compound X, which has a -COOH and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

Wait, unless the reaction is substituting the -COOH with a methyl group. But under what conditions would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, but that requires a metal and an organometallic reagent, which I don't think are present here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions in terms of HI as a nucleophile. If the -COOH group is deprotonated to form a carboxylate, which is a better leaving group, then HI could substitute it. But I'm not sure.

In that case, the product would be benzene with a para substituent, which would be iodide. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction is substituting a hydrogen with iodide.

Wait, I'm stuck. Perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent's end, converting a CH3 into a CH2I or something, but that's not directly leading to any of the options.

Wait, another thought: the reaction may be a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -OH group, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-iodination or something, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is cleaving the molecule. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group, maybe it's cleaving to form a smaller chain. But I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, forming a double bond. But in that case, the substituent would need to have adjacent hydrogens, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of the options again. The options are A to D. The structure of compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). So, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about the product.

If the reaction converts the -COOH into an iodide, then the product would be 4-iodo-sec-butylbenzene, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by an iodide, but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the -COOH to a -CH2OH group. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the structure of compound X. Let me double-check.

The IR has 1720 cm-1, which I thought was a carbonyl. But if it's a ketone, that would fit, but the NMR doesn't show a ketone proton. The NMR shows a proton at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the IR peak at 1720 is an ester. So, if it's an ester, then the NMR should show an ester oxygen, but the 10.5 ppm peak would not be present. But the NMR does show that. So, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Let me think again: the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is likely a carboxylic acid. So, the structure is a benzoic acid derivative.

Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I'm stuck on what this reaction does. Let me think of another possibility: perhaps it's a substitution where the -COOH group is converted into a bromide or iodide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I have an idea. In the presence of red phosphorus and HI, a carboxylic acid can undergo a reaction where the -COOH is converted into an acid iodide. So, RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O. Then, the acid iodide can undergo further reactions, but in this case, perhaps it's just the conversion.

But in the options, none of the products are acid iodides. So, perhaps this is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide. So, the product would be benzene with an iodide in the para position relative to the substituent. But the substituent is a sec-butyl group, so the product would be 4-iodo-sec-butylbenzene. But again, this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic displacement where the -COOH is replaced by I- via a substitution mechanism, but this requires a good leaving group, which -COOH is not. However, under certain conditions, perhaps it can leave as CO2, but that would require very strong conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH is protonated, making it a better leaving group (HCOOH+), and then HI could substitute it, replacing the -COOH with I-. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

If this were the case, the product would be 4-iodo-sec-butylbenzene. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an ethyl group or something else. But without knowing the exact reaction mechanism, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again. The product options are all either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. So, if compound X is a benzoic acid (option C), perhaps the reaction is not changing the substituent but the -COOH group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation to form a benzene ring with a substituent. So, the -COOH group is removed, and a CH2 group is formed. But that would require specific conditions, like high temperatures or catalysts. However, with red phosphorus and HI, I'm not sure.

If that's the case, the product would be benzene with a sec-butyl group in the para position. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But that's not an option. Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, that would imply a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group, not a sec-butyl group. But according to our earlier analysis, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess.

If the reaction is converting the -COOH into an iodide, then the product would have an iodide in the para position and a sec-butyl group. But none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is changed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -OCH3 group, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the -COOH is replaced by a different group. Without more information, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't on the -COOH group but on the substituent. For example, if the substituent is an ethyl group, the reaction could substitute it with iodide. But in our case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which isn't an ethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes a substitution to form a different alkyl group. For example, the -CH2CH(CH3) group could become -CH2CH2I. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is introducing iodide into the substituent. For example, the substituent could be a propyl group with a methyl branch, and the reaction is substituting a hydrogen with iodide, making a mono-iodinated substituent. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -OH group, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the reaction from another angle. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hinsberg reaction, which is used to determine whether a compound is an amine and its type. But since the compound is a carboxylic acid, that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide. So, the product is 4-iodo-sec-butylbenzene. But that's not an option, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Another possibility: maybe the reaction is a reduction of the -COOH group to a CH2OH group. Then, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl group, but I don't know why that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me think about the options again. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

If the product is option D, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, that would suggest that the substituent is a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions. But in compound X, the substituents are a -COOH and a sec-butyl group. So, perhaps the reaction is substituting the -COOH with a methyl group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl group, making the product a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions. That would be option D.

But under what reaction conditions would a -COOH group be converted into a methyl group? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a formylation followed by reduction, but that's not likely with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, but that requires a Grignard reagent, which isn't present here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl group from the reagent. But HI is a source of iodide, not methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl iodide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an alkyl halide and a Lewis acid catalyst. Red phosphorus might act as a Lewis acid, and HI could provide the halide. So, perhaps the -COOH group is activating the ring, allowing the Friedel-Crafts alkylation to occur, adding a methyl group in the para position.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts typically adds substituents in the ortho and para positions relative to the activating group. If the ring already has a substituent in the para position, adding another substituent would require specific conditions.

Wait, but in our case, compound X has a -COOH group (which is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing) and a sec-butyl group (which is activating, ortho/para-directing) in the para positions. So, the ring has two substituents in para positions. Adding another substituent via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult because the ring is already substituted.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl group from HI. But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl iodide, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm still stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

If the structure of compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI converts the -COOH group into an iodide, the product would be 4-iodo-sec-butylbenzene, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH is removed, leaving the substituent as a methyl group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus and HI can sometimes be used to reduce triple bonds to single bonds, but I'm not sure about carboxylic acids.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a way to form an alkyne, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -O- group, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a hydrogen, making the product benzene with a sec-butyl group in the para position, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)-4'-methylbenzene, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are a sec-butyl and a methyl group in the para positions. That would mean that the reaction is substituting the -COOH group with a methyl group.

But how would that happen? Perhaps if the -COOH is deprotonated, and then a methyl iodide (from HI) substitutes in. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH is a leaving group, which would require it to be activated. But under red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the -COOH is replaced by iodide, then further substitution occurs.

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should conclude that the reaction doesn't change the substituent and the product is option C. But that can't be right because the question states that compound X reacts to form the product.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, forming a double bond in the substituent. But that would require adjacent hydrogens.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the structure is benzene-(para)-COOH and -(CH2)CH(CH3). If the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, the substituent remains the same. But none of the options include iodine.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent, converting the -CH(CH3) into a CH2 group, but I don't see how.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that the product is option D, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would mean that the -COOH group is replaced by a methyl group.

But how? Maybe under the reaction conditions, the -COOH is deprotonated, and HI provides iodide which substitutes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl group, but I'm not aware of such a reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl group, but I'm not sure.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess. Based on the IR and NMR data, compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Reacting with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the -COOH is converted to a methyl group, leading to option D.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but removes the -COOH group, leaving a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is introducing a methyl group, making option D the product.

I'll have to go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR and NMR data provided suggest that compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carboxylic acid, and the NMR data supports the presence of a carboxylic acid proton at 10.5 ppm. Additionally, the aromatic region (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm) and the alkyl region (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring with a sec-butyl group.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is challenging to interpret, as the exact mechanism is unclear. However, one plausible outcome is that the -COOH group is replaced by a methyl group, resulting in a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions. This matches option D, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. While the reasoning involves some uncertainty, the most consistent conclusion is that the reaction modifies the -COOH group to a methyl group, leaving the sec-butyl group intact.

Answer: D
