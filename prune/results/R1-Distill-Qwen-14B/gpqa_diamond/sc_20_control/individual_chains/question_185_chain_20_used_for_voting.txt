Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of a system, and its eigenvalues give the possible energy levels.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So σ is a vector of the Pauli matrices, like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is an arbitrary direction, like a vector on the unit sphere.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, right? So σ · n would be the dot product, which means summing over each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So for example, if n is (n_x, n_y, n_z), then σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

I think the key here is that any spin operator in a particular direction has eigenvalues related to the spin itself. For electrons, the spin is ħ/2, but wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Let me recall: the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because, for example, σ_x |+x> = |+x> and σ_x |−x> = -|−x>, so their eigenvalues are ±1.

So if H is ε times σ · n, then H is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of H would be the eigenvalues of σ · n multiplied by ε. Because the eigenvalues of a scalar multiple of an operator are the scalar multiplied by the eigenvalues of the operator. So if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then H would have eigenvalues ±ε.

Wait, but I should make sure about the properties of σ · n. Let me think about this. The operator σ · n is a spin component in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of any spin component operator (like σ · n) are ±1, because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and n is a unit vector. So when you take the dot product, the overall operator's eigenvalues are ±1.

So the eigenvalues of H are ε * 1 and ε * (-1), which is ε and -ε. Looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε. Option C is ε hbar/2 and negative, which might be if the spin was multiplied by ħ, but wait, the Pauli matrices don't have the ħ factor. Let me think again.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are given by:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Each of these has eigenvalues ±1. So when you have σ · n, the eigenvalues are ±1. So H = ε σ · n would have eigenvalues ±ε. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about another approach. The trace of the Hamiltonian is zero because σ ·n is traceless (each Pauli matrix is traceless, and n is a unit vector, so their sum is traceless). The determinant of the Hamiltonian would be (for 2x2 matrix) (ε n · σ)^2. Wait, let me compute the square. Since (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding that, each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), and the cross terms are σ_i σ_j which are i ε_{ijk} σ_k. But when you square σ·n, you get (n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2) + terms from cross products. The cross terms will involve σ_i σ_j which anticommute. But then, when you take (σ · n)^2, it equals n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I + ... wait, actually, no. Because (σ·n)^2 = (n · σ)(n · σ) = n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. Now, σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. So when you sum over i and j, you get n_i n_j (I δ_ij) + i n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k. The first term is (n_i^2) I, summed over i, which is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. Since n is a unit vector, that's I. The second term is a bit more complicated, but when squared, perhaps the cross terms vanish when you take the trace. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, I can think of the operator H = ε σ · n as being a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues ±ε. Because, for any unit vector n, σ · n is a spin component operator in that direction, which has eigenvalues ±1. So multiplying by ε gives eigenvalues ±ε.

So looking at the options again, option B is +ε and -ε. So the correct answer is option B.

The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of \(H\).

The Pauli spin matrices (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) are 2x2 matrices, and their eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\). The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \(\vec{n}\), i.e., \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z\). Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a spin component operator in the direction of \(\vec{n}\), which also has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\).

When multiplied by the scalar \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\). This is because the eigenvalues of a scalar multiple of an operator are the scalar multiplied by the eigenvalues of the operator.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\), not 1.
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as shown above.
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are \(\pm 1\), not \(\pm \hbar/2\).
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve the scaling factor \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).

Answer: B
