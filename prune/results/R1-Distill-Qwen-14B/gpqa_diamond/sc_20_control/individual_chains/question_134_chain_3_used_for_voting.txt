Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options given are A, B, C, D, with some values in kcal and kJ. Hmm, I need to find out which option is correct.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value for strong acids and bases is about -57 kJ/mol, but I guess here I need to calculate it based on the amounts given.

But wait, the problem is mixing multiple solutions. So first, I need to figure out the reactions that will occur when these three are mixed. Let's see, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base.

Wait, but wait a second. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole of H2SO4 will give 2 moles of H+ ions. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; each mole gives 2 moles of OH- because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So first, I should calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let me list each solution:

1. HCl: 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) of 0.2 M. Moles of HCl = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+. So total H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

2. H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each mole gives 2 H+, so H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 mol.

3. Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. The OH- is 0.2 mol. 

Wait, but wait. When mixing, the H+ and OH- will neutralize. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is per mole of H+ reacting. So the limiting reagent here is OH-, since there's 0.2 mol OH- and 0.28 mol H+.

So all 0.2 mol of OH- will react with 0.2 mol of H+. The remaining H+ (0.08 mol) will remain unreacted.

So the amount of H+ that actually reacts is 0.2 mol. Each mole of H+ reacting releases enthalpy. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically around -57 kJ per mole for strong acids and strong bases. But wait, sometimes it's given per mole of H+ or per mole of acid. Let me think. Oh right, the enthalpy change is per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. So if 0.2 mol of H+ reacts, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if the problem gives the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed. Oh, but each mole of H+ and OH- makes one mole of H2O. So 0.2 moles of H2O are formed. So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, or perhaps I should calculate the heat released and then see which option it corresponds to.

Wait, but another thought: the enthalpy of neutralization might be taken as -57 kJ per mole of H+ from the acid. So 0.2 mol H+ reacting would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's negative: -11.4 kJ.

But wait the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Oh, wait, the units are mixed here. Oh, the problem gives some options in kcal and others in kJ.

Wait, what's the standard unit for enthalpy of neutralization? I think it's usually in kJ. For instance, the standard value is about -57 kJ/mol. But if the problem is using kcal as the unit, I need to make sure.

Wait, let me check the options. Option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, wait 0.2 mol × 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ, so the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which would correspond to approximately 11.4 × 8.618 kcal? Wait no, wait. Wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is about 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.723 kcal. But that would give me around 2.72 kcal. But wait, the enthalpy is negative because it's exothermic, so it's -2.72 kcal. Wait, but that would be option A.

Wait, but I'm confused now. Let me recheck. The initial approach: how much H+ and OH- are present.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol × 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is in excess, but OH- is 0.2 mol.

So 0.2 mol H+ will react with 0.2 mol OH-.

Each mole of H+ reacting releases 57 kJ (but wait, wait! Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction, which is H+ + OH- → H2O. So per mole of that reaction, it's -57 kJ.

So 0.2 mol reaction → 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the total enthalpy is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but why the discrepancy in units between the options?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation using the exact enthalpy of neutralization for each acid-base pair. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but in neutralization, only the first dissociation is strong, perhaps. Or maybe both H+ ions are available.

Wait, no, for H2SO4, the first dissociation is strong (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, in solution, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates into H+ and HSO4^- in the first step, and then HSO4^- dissociates partially in the second step. But for neutralization purposes, when H2SO4 is a strong acid, both H+ ions are available for reaction. So the 0.09 mol H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+.

So that part I think I did correctly.

Now, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So each mole gives 2 moles OH-. So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct.

Now, the reaction is between H+ and OH-, so the limiting reagent is OH-, which is 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol H+ reacts.

So the total moles of H+ that react is 0.2, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options again, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for enthalpy of neutralization?

Wait, wait, sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is given as -57.3 kJ/mol. So 0.2 × 57.3 = 11.46. So -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But the option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the heat released using the specific values, not the standard value.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, let me go back. Let me compute the moles again.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ total: 0.28 mol. OH-: 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent, so 0.2 mol neutralization occurs.

So 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O. Enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So -11.4 kJ is the answer. Looking at options, option B is -11.42 kcal, but that's in kcal. Option D is -16.0 kJ. So none of the options give -11.4 kJ. Hmm, perhaps I did a mistake in the way I calculate.

Wait, but maybe the question is about the enthalpy per mole of reaction, but perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ available and see how much reacts. Wait, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me check again.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09. Correct. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. 0.1 * 2 = 0.2. Correct.

So the limiting reagent is OH- at 0.2 mol.

So the reaction produces 0.2 mol H2O, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider the H2SO4 as only providing one H+? No, that's not correct because H2SO4 is a strong acid and the first dissociation is complete. So in solution, it's H+ and HSO4^-.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that H2SO4 can donate two H+ but in neutralization, the second H+ may not be available because the solution may not have enough OH-.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is 0.2 mol, and the total H+ is 0.28 mol, so all OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

But regardless, the enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ neutralized.

So 0.2 mol H+ reacting.

Now, wait, perhaps the calculation is in kcal.

Wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. But that would be 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → 11.4 × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

But then the enthalpy change is negative, so -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, so which one is correct? The options have both kcal and kJ.

Wait, the problem could be that I'm using the standard value of 57 kJ/mol, but perhaps the problem expects a different approach, like considering the heat capacity of the solution, but that would require more data, which isn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, let me think about the units. The options have both kcal and kJ. Let's see:

Option A: -2.72 kcal.

Which would be approximately 2.72 kcal ×4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ 11.4 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is equivalent to -11.4 kJ. So if the question expects the answer in kcal, option B is -11.42 kcal which is approximately the same as 11.4 kJ, but wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is correct.

But the other option is option B, which is -11.42 kcal, which would be about -48.4 kJ.

Wait, that's a big difference. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total number of moles of H+ and OH- and find the difference.

Wait, the H+ is 0.28 mol; OH- is 0.2 mol. So H+ remaining is 0.08 mol. But in terms of neutralization, only 0.2 mol of H+ reacts.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So if the options have this, but in kJ, none of them match. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the heat using another approach. Maybe the problem is expecting me to calculate the total heat released using the heat capacity of the solution.

But wait, the problem doesn't provide any heat capacity data or temperature changes. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but only the first H+ is considered, so 0.09 moles instead of 0.18. Let me recalculate that.

If H2SO4 only contributes 0.09 mol H+ instead of 0.18, then the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19 mol. Then the OH- is 0.2 mol, so H+ is the limiting factor, and 0.19 mol OH- can't react because there's only 0.19 mol H+. So the reaction would be 0.19 mol H+ + 0.19 mol OH- → 0.19 mol H2O. So the enthalpy would be 0.19 × (-57) = approximately -10.83 kJ. Still not matching the options.

But that approach doesn't seem correct because H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ should be available.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kcal, so 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But then option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about -48.4 kJ, which doesn't fit.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the problem is considering the neutralization of all the OH- but using the correct stoichiometric ratios for each acid.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and see how much each contributes to the neutralization.

HCl provides 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 mol OH-.

The reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Total H+ is 0.28; OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will be neutralized by H+.

Which H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. So the OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+. It doesn't matter which H+ comes from where.

So the total enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have this. Option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. But since it's diprotic, 0.09 ×2=0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L × 0.5 M =0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol. Correct.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the heat using the specific enthalpy values for each acid-base pair. For example, HCl has an enthalpy of neutralization of about -57 kJ/mol, but H2SO4's first H+ is about -57, and the second is about -52, perhaps. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but in neutralization, the H+ from H2SO4 would react with the OH-.

Wait, but in the case of H2SO4, the first H+ is stronger and dissociates completely, so both H+ are available. So the enthalpy of neutralization for each H+ would be around -57 kJ. So 0.18 mol H+ from H2SO4 would contribute 0.18 × (-57) = -10.26 kJ, and the 0.1 mol H+ from HCl would contribute -5.7 kJ. But wait, the OH- is only 0.2 mol. So not all H+ can be neutralized.

Wait, perhaps the calculation needs to consider the source of H+. Let me think. The OH- can react with any H+, regardless of the source.

So the total H+ is 0.28 mol. The OH- is 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol H+ will react.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So why is option D -16.0 kJ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles.

Wait, HCl: 500 mL × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 300 mL × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol (each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol).

Ba(OH)2:200 mL ×0.5 M =0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So all correct.

Hmm. Maybe the question is about q = nΔH, but I'm using the standard ΔH value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation using the heat released per mole for each reaction and summing them up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it by considering each acid and base reacting separately.

Wait, perhaps the neutralization reactions are:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + H2O.

But wait, the stoichiometry would matter. Let me think.

But wait, since all three solutions are mixed, the reaction is between H+ and OH-, so the individual reactions may not be necessary. The overall reaction is the neutralization of H+ with OH-.

But maybe I should approach it by considering the neutralization of each acid with the base.

Wait, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the Ba(OH)2 is a strong base but when reacting with H2SO4, which is a diprotic acid, the reaction could produce BaSO4 precipitate, which might involve more steps. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

The reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2H2O.

But the stoichiometry is 1:1, producing 2 H2O. Each mole of H2SO4 would require 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.

So moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent (0.09 < 0.1). So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O. The enthalpy change for this would be 0.09 mol × ΔH(neutralization per mole of H2SO4). But wait, each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, so the neutralization for each H+ is -57 kJ. So for 2 H+ per mole, it's 2 × (-57) = -114 kJ/mol H2SO4. So 0.09 mol would be 0.09 × (-114) = -10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.01 mol × 2 = 0.02 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining HCl is 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

So the remaining H+ is 0.1, and the remaining OH- is 0.02.

So 0.02 mol OH- will react with 0.02 mol H+ from HCl. The enthalpy change is 0.02 × (-57) = -1.14 kJ.

So total enthalpy change is -10.26 -1.14 = -11.4 kJ.

Which again brings us to -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. But option D is -16.0 kJ. So what's going on here?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 has two H+ and each contributes to the neutralization.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So maybe the problem expects me to calculate the heat based on each acid separately, using their molarity and volume.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done in calories instead of kilojoules, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering both H+ from H2SO4 and HCl, but not considering that some H+ remains unreacted.

Wait, but I already accounted for that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the formula q = n × ΔH, where ΔH is the enthalpy per mole of H+ neutralized.

Wait, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized. 0.2 × (-57,000 cal/mol) → No, because 57 kJ is 57,000 J, which is about 13,600 cal. Wait, no, wait. 1 cal = 4.184 J. So 57 kJ is 57,000 J, which is 57,000 /4.184 ≈ 13,596 cal. So per mole, it's about -13,596 cal, which is -13.596 kcal. So 0.2 mol would be 0.2 × (-13.596) ≈ -2.719 kcal, which rounds to -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A.

But why would the problem use kcal? Maybe because the standard enthalpy of neutralization is sometimes given in kcal. For example, 57 kJ/mol is approximately 13.6 kcal/mol. So 0.2 × 13.6 is 2.72. So -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So that's correct.

So the possible answers are either option A (-2.72 kcal) or option D (-16 kJ). But based on the calculation, the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal. So option A.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which would imply a much larger enthalpy change (around -48.4 kJ). So that's not matching.

So option A is the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ available:

1. **HCl**:  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **H₂SO₄**:  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   As a diprotic acid, it contributes \( 2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into \( 2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \), so it contributes \( 2 \times 0.1 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

The total moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) are \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and the total moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) are \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \). Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) will react with \( \text{OH}^- \) to form water.

The enthalpy of neutralization for one mole of \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \) is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). Therefore, the total enthalpy change for \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) reacting is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

To convert this to kilocalories (kcal), note that \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \):  
\[
-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:  
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal)** matches the calculated value of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal)** corresponds to a much larger enthalpy change (\( \approx -48.4 \, \text{kJ} \)), which is inconsistent with the calculation.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal)** and **Option D (-16.0 kJ)** do not match the calculated values.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.

Answer: A
