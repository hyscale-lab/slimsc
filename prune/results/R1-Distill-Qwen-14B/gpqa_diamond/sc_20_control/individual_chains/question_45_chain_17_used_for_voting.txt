Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles have quantized energy levels. The energy levels are given by the formula E_n = (n² * π² ħ²) / (2mL²), which is written here as E multiplied by n², since E is defined as π² ħ²/(2mL²). So, E_n is n² times E.

Wait, but wait, the problem mentions four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, identical particles with half-integer spin are fermions. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can be occupied by at most one fermion. But wait, each particle has spin 1/2, so for each spatial state, there are two possible spin states: up and down.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3...). For each n, there are two possible spin states. So each spatial state can hold two particles.

So the system has four particles, which is an even number, so they can all be paired with opposite spins without any problem, as long as their spatial parts are in allowed states.

Now, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So we need to figure out the arrangement of the four particles in the lowest possible energy states, then the next, etc.

Let me think about the ground state first. Since particles are fermions, each must have a unique quantum state. So the first four particles will occupy the lowest possible n values, considering each n can hold two particles.

So for four particles:

The first two particles can go into n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two can go into n=2, again each with opposite spins. Because each n can hold two particles.

So the ground state configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2). Wait, no, because each n holds two particles, so the energy contributions are 2 * E_1 and 2 * E_2.

Wait, E_1 is (1²)E = E, E_2 is (2²)E =4E. So the energies for the ground state would be 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E = 10E? Wait, but wait, no, because each spatial state (n) can take two particles. So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option A: 30E, 39E, 50E — Hmm, these are much larger, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the particles are filled. Wait, no, in the ground state, with four particles, each spin state is filled. So n=1 can hold two particles, n=2 holds two. So 2 and 2. So the energies are 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Now, the first excited state. That would be the next possible energy level arrangement. So what's the next arrangement after n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles)?

Wait, perhaps the particles can be arranged in a way where some are in higher n, but maybe the next state is when one of the particles moves up. Like, perhaps one pair in n=1 (two particles) and the other two in n=3?

Wait, no, wait, because the first excited state would be when we have the lowest possible energy configuration beyond the ground state. Let me think about the possible configurations.

After the ground state (n=1:2 particles, n=2:2 particles), the next possible would involve moving one of the particles from n=2 to n=3, but that would require another state.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are in (n=1: 2 particles), n=2:1 particle, and n=3:1 particle. But wait, each n can hold two particles. So if we have four particles, and we've filled n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), that's the ground state. Then the next state would be perhaps moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. So then we have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the energy would be 2E + (1×4E) + (1×9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but wait, that's three particles. Wait no, no, four particles: in the ground state, two in n=1, two in n=2. So the first excited state would be when one of the particles from n=2 moves to n=3. So n=1: 2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So total energy is 2*E + (1*4E) + (1*9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that's for four particles. So the first excited state is 15E?

Wait, but wait, perhaps that's not correct. Because perhaps the first excited state would have the configuration where all four are in the lowest possible states, but in a different arrangement. Let me think again.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy possible, so any excited state would have higher energies. The first excited state is the next possible energy level that can be achieved while obeying the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the first two particles are in n=1, and the next two in n=3. So for four particles, two in n=1, two in n=3. Then the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E. Hmm, but that's higher than 15E.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the possible states again.

Each n can hold two particles. So the ground state is n=1:2, n=2:2. Then, the next possible step is to have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the energy would be 2*E +1*(4E) +1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but that's four particles: 2+1+1=4? No, that's 4 particles. So n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energy is 2*E +4E +9E=15E.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the first excited state is when all four particles are in n=1 and n=3, but that might not be possible because n=3 can hold two particles. Hmm, no, no, in n=3: two particles, and n=1: two. So that would give 2E + 18E = 20E. But that's higher than 15E. So perhaps the first excited state is 15E.

Wait, but the problem asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, what's the second excited state?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. So that's two particles in n=3. So energy is 2E + 0 + 18E=20E. So the order would be ground (10E), first excited (15E), second excited (20E). But looking at the options, none of them have 10 and 15 and 20.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C says: 4E, 10E,15E.

Option B:4E,10E,50E.

Option D:10,15,18.

Option A:30,39,50.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe the ground state isn't 10E. Because perhaps each particle's energy is n² E, but since they're fermions, each particle's state is unique. So for four particles, the first four spatial states (n=1,2,3,4) are filled, but each can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, no, wait, in a 1D infinite well, each n can have two fermions (spin up and down). So for four particles, we can have two in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2 (each opposite spins). So their energies would be 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Yes, that's the ground state.

Now the first excited state would be when the next available state is filled. So the next possible would be putting two particles in n=1, two in n=2, and then the next would be putting two in n=3, but that would require 2*(9E)=18E, but with four particles, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So the energy is 2E + 4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves up. So perhaps all four particles are in n=1 and n=3, with two in each. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 10,15,20. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E. Oh wait, perhaps the second excited state is when we have three particles in n=1 and one in n=3? No, because n=1 can take two, so that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when we have two in n=1, two in n=3, which sums to 20E, but that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the configuration for the first excited state. Maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, but perhaps it's better to arrange the particles as n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 (so 4 particles). So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle moves up, perhaps to n=4. So configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:0, n=4:1? No, wait, no, because each n can hold two particles. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state would be when the next available state is filled with two particles.

Wait, perhaps the next possible filling would be n=1:2, n=2:2, n=3:0, but that's the same as the ground state. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about it as filling the lowest possible states with two particles each.

The ground state is filled as n=1:2, n=2:2 → total energy 2E + 8E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, so n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 → energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves up to n=4. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1. But wait, that's five particles, but we only have four. So perhaps the second excited state is when n=3 has two particles and n=2 has zero, and n=1 has two, and n=4 has zero. No, that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first excited state is when the next available state (n=3) has two particles. So n=1:2, n=2:2, n=3:0. No, that's the same as the ground state. So perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of energies as each possible state is filled. Let me list the possible states in order of their energies:

The possible states:

n=1 → E=1² E = E → holds two particles.

n=2 → E=4E → holds two.

n=3 → 9E → holds two.

n=4 → 16E → holds two.

So the total energy for four particles in the ground state is 2E + 2*4E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, but that would require another state. Wait, but each n can hold two particles, so perhaps the next state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, making the configuration n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle moves up to n=4, so the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1. But that's four particles, so energy is 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the first excited state is when the next available state (n=3) is filled with two particles, and the lower states have their maximum filled except for one.

Wait, but the ground state is filled with n=1 and n=2, each at maximum capacity (two particles). So the next possible would be adding two particles into n=3. But that would require four particles: n=1:2, n=2:2, n=3:0. But that's the ground state. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3, but that would require another state.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering that the ground state is the lowest possible, then the first excited state is the next possible energy level that can be achieved by moving a particle to the next available state. Let me think about the energies:

Another approach: The ground state is the lowest possible, so the four particles are in the lowest possible states. Since each state can hold two, the first four states are n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles), giving a total energy of 2*1² E + 2*2² E = 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. The total energy would be 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state could be when another particle moves to n=4, so configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1. But that's four particles, so the energy is 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E.

Wait, but none of the options include 31E. Hmm. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=3:2. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

In that case, the ground state is 10E, first excited is 20E, and second excited might be higher.

But looking at the options, option B has 4E, 10E,50E. Hmm, 10E is the ground state, which would make sense. Then 50E is the second excited. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the possible arrangements. Another way to think about it is to list all possible ways the four particles can occupy the lowest possible states, then order them by energy.

Let me try that.

Possible configurations for four fermions:

1. All four in the lowest possible, filling n=1 and n=2 → 2 particles each. Energy=2E +8E=10E. → this is the ground state.

2. Next, perhaps one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Energy=2E +4E +9E=15E.

3. Then, another particle moves from n=2 to n=4. So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Energy=2E +4E +16E=22E.

But wait, that's higher than the previous. Or perhaps, in this state, we could have two in n=3, with no particles in n=4, but that would require two particles in n=3, so perhaps the configuration becomes two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy=2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but 20E is higher than 15E, so the order would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited). But none of the options match this.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, 18E could be 2*9E=18E, which would be two particles in n=3. So perhaps the second excited state is when the two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So 2E + 18E=20E. But option D's second excited state is 18E, which can't be correct because the total energy would require four particles: two in n=3 gives 18E, but where are the other two? They must be in another state, perhaps n=2 but that would add 4E, making 22E.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the configurations.

Alternative approach: Let's list the possible total energies for each possible arrangement of four particles.

Case 1: All four in n=1 and n=2. So 2 particles each.

Energy = 2*1² E + 2*2² E = 2E +8E=10E.

Case 2: Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Energy = 2E +4E+9E=15E.

Case 3: Two in n=1, two in n=3.

Energy=2E + 18E=20E.

Case 4: Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.

Energy=2E +4E +16E=22E.

Case 5: Two in n=2, one in n=1, one in n=3.

Wait, no, since n=2 can take two, perhaps when two are in n=2, and the others in higher.

Wait, perhaps another case: three in n=1, one in n=3. But that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two fermions. So that's not allowed.

Another case: two in n=1, two in n=2, and zero elsewhere. Which is the ground state.

So the possible energies in increasing order are 10E, 15E, 20E, 22E, etc.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 10,15,20. So perhaps the question is asking about something else. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which states are allowed. Let me think again about the filling.

Wait, perhaps each spatial state (n) can hold two particles (spin up and down), and each particle's state is determined by n and spin. So the ground state is when the four particles are in the lowest possible states, which would be n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles). So energy 10E.

First excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=4, so configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1. But that's four particles, so energy 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E.

But that's not an option. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and zero in n=4. So two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy 2E +18E=20E.

But again, no options have 20E.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct arrangement. Let me think about the possible options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4E,10E,15E. Hmm, 4E is lower than the ground state I calculated, which suggests perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the ground state. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each particle's energy is n² E, but the four particles are fermions, so each must have a unique combination of n and spin. So for four particles, the ground state would have the four lowest possible n values, each with two possible spins. Wait, but that can't be, because n=1 can take two, n=2 another two, so four in total.

So ground state is n=1:2, n=2:2 → 2E +8E=10E.

Ah, but maybe the question is considering each particle as having a unique n. Because if each particle must have a unique n, that would change things. Wait, no, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum number n is the principal quantum number, and each n can have two particles with opposite spins.

So the initial assumption was correct: four particles would occupy n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So ground state energy is 10E.

But looking at the options, option D says 10E,15E,18E.

Wait, 10E is ground, 15E first excited, 18E second excited. How does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So energy would be 2E + 18E=20E. But that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4, but that would require five particles, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when all four are in n=2 and n=3, but that can't be because each n can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. So energy would be E + 8E +9E=18E. So that would be 1E +8E +9E=18E.

Wait, but that's four particles: 1 (n=1) + 2 (n=2) +1 (n=3) =4. So the energy would be 1E +8E +9E =18E.

But in that case, the order of energies would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E (from configuration 2,1,1).

Second excited:18E (from configuration 1,2,1).

But that depends on whether the configuration with n=1:1, n=2:2, and n=3:1 is lower in energy than the configuration with n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

Wait, because in configuration 1,2,1, the total energy is E +8E +9E=18E.

In configuration 2,1,1, the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

So 15E is lower than 18E, so the first excited state is 15E, the second excited state is 18E.

So the energies would be:

Ground:10E.

First excited:15E.

Second excited:18E.

Which matches option D:10E,15E,18E.

So the correct option would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy levels are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, each quantum state (defined by \( n \) and spin) can be occupied by at most one particle. Each spatial state \( n \) can hold two particles (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).

3. **Filling the States**:  
   The four particles will occupy the lowest available energy states, starting from \( n=1 \), \( n=2 \), \( n=3 \), etc., with each \( n \) accommodating two particles.

---

### Ground State:
- The lowest energy configuration is achieved by placing two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E \).  
  - **Ground State Energy**: \( 10E \).

---

### First Excited State:
- The first excited state occurs when one particle from \( n=2 \) moves to \( n=3 \), resulting in the configuration:  
  - Two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).  
  - **First Excited State Energy**: \( 15E \).

---

### Second Excited State:
- The second excited state occurs when another particle moves from \( n=2 \) to \( n=4 \), resulting in the configuration:  
  - Two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), one particle in \( n=3 \), and one particle in \( n=4 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) + 1(4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 31E \).  
  - However, this configuration is not consistent with the provided options.  
- An alternative interpretation is that the second excited state corresponds to the configuration where two particles are in \( n=3 \) and two particles remain in \( n=1 \):  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E \).  
  - This configuration also does not match the options.  
- Based on the options, the second excited state is interpreted as \( 18E \), which corresponds to a configuration where one particle is in \( n=1 \), two particles are in \( n=2 \), and one particle is in \( n=3 \):  
  - Energy contribution: \( E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = 1(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).  
  - **Second Excited State Energy**: \( 18E \).

---

### Final Answer:
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 18E \), respectively. This matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles have quantized energy levels. The energy levels are given by the formula E_n = (n² * π² ħ²) / (2mL²), which is written here as E multiplied by n², since E is defined as π² ħ²/(2mL²). So, E_n is n² times E.

Wait, but wait, the problem mentions four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, identical particles with half-integer spin are fermions. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can be occupied by at most one fermion. But wait, each particle has spin 1/2, so for each spatial state, there are two possible spin states: up and down.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3...). For each n, there are two possible spin states. So each spatial state can hold two particles.

So the system has four particles, which is an even number, so they can all be paired with opposite spins without any problem, as long as their spatial parts are in allowed states.

Now, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So we need to figure out the arrangement of the four particles in the lowest possible energy states, then the next, etc.

Let me think about the ground state first. Since particles are fermions, each must have a unique quantum state. So the first four particles will occupy the lowest possible n values, considering each n can hold two particles.

So for four particles:

The first two particles can go into n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two can go into n=2, again each with opposite spins. Because each n can hold two particles.

So the ground state configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2). Wait, no, because each n holds two particles, so the energy contributions are 2 * E_1 and 2 * E_2.

Wait, E_1 is (1²)E = E, E_2 is (2²)E =4E. So the energies for the ground state would be 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E = 10E? Wait, but wait, no, because each spatial state (n) can take two particles. So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option A: 30E, 39E, 50E — Hmm, these are much larger, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the particles are filled. Wait, no, in the ground state, with four particles, each spin state is filled. So n=1 can hold two particles, n=2 holds two. So 2 and 2. So the energies are 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Now, the first excited state. That would be the next possible energy level arrangement. So what's the next arrangement after n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles)?

Wait, perhaps the particles can be arranged in a way where some are in higher n, but maybe the next state is when one of the particles moves up. Like, perhaps one pair in n=1 (two particles) and the other two in n=3?

Wait, no, wait, because the first excited state would be when we have the lowest possible energy configuration beyond the ground state. Let me think about the possible configurations.

After the ground state (n=1:2 particles, n=2:2 particles), the next possible would involve moving one of the particles from n=2 to n=3, but that would require another state.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are in (n=1: 2 particles), n=2:1 particle, and n=3:1 particle. But wait, each n can hold two particles. So if we have four particles, and we've filled n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), that's the ground state. Then the next state would be perhaps moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. So then we have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the energy would be 2E + (1×4E) + (1×9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but wait, that's three particles. Wait no, no, four particles: in the ground state, two in n=1, two in n=2. So the first excited state would be when one of the particles from n=2 moves to n=3. So n=1: 2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So total energy is 2*E + (1*4E) + (1*9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that's for four particles. So the first excited state is 15E?

Wait, but wait, perhaps that's not correct. Because perhaps the first excited state would have the configuration where all four are in the lowest possible states, but in a different arrangement. Let me think again.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy possible, so any excited state would have higher energies. The first excited state is the next possible energy level that can be achieved while obeying the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the first two particles are in n=1, and the next two in n=3. So for four particles, two in n=1, two in n=3. Then the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E. Hmm, but that's higher than 15E.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the possible states again.

Each n can hold two particles. So the ground state is n=1:2, n=2:2. Then, the next possible step is to have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the energy would be 2*E +1*(4E) +1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but that's four particles: 2+1+1=4? No, that's 4 particles. So n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energy is 2*E +4E +9E=15E.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the first excited state is when all four particles are in n=1 and n=3, but that might not be possible because n=3 can hold two particles. Hmm, no, no, in n=3: two particles, and n=1: two. So that would give 2E + 18E = 20E. But that's higher than 15E. So perhaps the first excited state is 15E.

Wait, but the problem asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, what's the second excited state?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. So that's two particles in n=3. So energy is 2E + 0 + 18E=20E. So the order would be ground (10E), first excited (15E), second excited (20E). But looking at the options, none of them have 10 and 15 and 20.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C says: 4E, 10E,15E.

Option B:4E,10E,50E.

Option D:10,15,18.

Option A:30,39,50.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe the ground state isn't 10E. Because perhaps each particle's energy is n² E, but since they're fermions, each particle's state is unique. So for four particles, the first four spatial states (n=1,2,3,4) are filled, but each can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, no, wait, in a 1D infinite well, each n can have two fermions (spin up and down). So for four particles, we can have two in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2 (each opposite spins). So their energies would be 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Yes, that's the ground state.

Now the first excited state would be when the next available state is filled. So the next possible would be putting two particles in n=1, two in n=2, and then the next would be putting two in n=3, but that would require 2*(9E)=18E, but with four particles, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So the energy is 2E + 4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves up. So perhaps all four particles are in n=1 and n=3, with two in each. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 10,15,20. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E. Oh wait, perhaps the second excited state is when we have three particles in n=1 and one in n=3? No, because n=1 can take two, so that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when we have two in n=1, two in n=3, which sums to 20E, but that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the configuration for the first excited state. Maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, but perhaps it's better to arrange the particles as n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 (so 4 particles). So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle moves up, perhaps to n=4. So configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:0, n=4:1? No, wait, no, because each n can hold two particles. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state would be when the next available state is filled with two particles.

Wait, perhaps the next possible filling would be n=1:2, n=2:2, n=3:0, but that's the same as the ground state. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about it as filling the lowest possible states with two particles each.

The ground state is filled as n=1:2, n=2:2 → total energy 2E + 8E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, so n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 → energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves up to n=4. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1. But wait, that's five particles, but we only have four. So perhaps the second excited state is when n=3 has two particles and n=2 has zero, and n=1 has two, and n=4 has zero. No, that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first excited state is when the next available state (n=3) has two particles. So n=1:2, n=2:2, n=3:0. No, that's the same as the ground state. So perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of energies as each possible state is filled. Let me list the possible states in order of their energies:

The possible states:

n=1 → E=1² E = E → holds two particles.

n=2 → E=4E → holds two.

n=3 → 9E → holds two.

n=4 → 16E → holds two.

So the total energy for four particles in the ground state is 2E + 2*4E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, but that would require another state. Wait, but each n can hold two particles, so perhaps the next state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, making the configuration n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle moves up to n=4, so the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1. But that's four particles, so energy is 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the first excited state is when the next available state (n=3) is filled with two particles, and the lower states have their maximum filled except for one.

Wait, but the ground state is filled with n=1 and n=2, each at maximum capacity (two particles). So the next possible would be adding two particles into n=3. But that would require four particles: n=1:2, n=2:2, n=3:0. But that's the ground state. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3, but that would require another state.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering that the ground state is the lowest possible, then the first excited state is the next possible energy level that can be achieved by moving a particle to the next available state. Let me think about the energies:

Another approach: The ground state is the lowest possible, so the four particles are in the lowest possible states. Since each state can hold two, the first four states are n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles), giving a total energy of 2*1² E + 2*2² E = 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. The total energy would be 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state could be when another particle moves to n=4, so configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1. But that's four particles, so the energy is 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E.

Wait, but none of the options include 31E. Hmm. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=3:2. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

In that case, the ground state is 10E, first excited is 20E, and second excited might be higher.

But looking at the options, option B has 4E, 10E,50E. Hmm, 10E is the ground state, which would make sense. Then 50E is the second excited. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the possible arrangements. Another way to think about it is to list all possible ways the four particles can occupy the lowest possible states, then order them by energy.

Let me try that.

Possible configurations for four fermions:

1. All four in the lowest possible, filling n=1 and n=2 → 2 particles each. Energy=2E +8E=10E. → this is the ground state.

2. Next, perhaps one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Energy=2E +4E +9E=15E.

3. Then, another particle moves from n=2 to n=4. So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Energy=2E +4E +16E=22E.

But wait, that's higher than the previous. Or perhaps, in this state, we could have two in n=3, with no particles in n=4, but that would require two particles in n=3, so perhaps the configuration becomes two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy=2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but 20E is higher than 15E, so the order would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited). But none of the options match this.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, 18E could be 2*9E=18E, which would be two particles in n=3. So perhaps the second excited state is when the two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So 2E + 18E=20E. But option D's second excited state is 18E, which can't be correct because the total energy would require four particles: two in n=3 gives 18E, but where are the other two? They must be in another state, perhaps n=2 but that would add 4E, making 22E.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the configurations.

Alternative approach: Let's list the possible total energies for each possible arrangement of four particles.

Case 1: All four in n=1 and n=2. So 2 particles each.

Energy = 2*1² E + 2*2² E = 2E +8E=10E.

Case 2: Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Energy = 2E +4E+9E=15E.

Case 3: Two in n=1, two in n=3.

Energy=2E + 18E=20E.

Case 4: Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.

Energy=2E +4E +16E=22E.

Case 5: Two in n=2, one in n=1, one in n=3.

Wait, no, since n=2 can take two, perhaps when two are in n=2, and the others in higher.

Wait, perhaps another case: three in n=1, one in n=3. But that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two fermions. So that's not allowed.

Another case: two in n=1, two in n=2, and zero elsewhere. Which is the ground state.

So the possible energies in increasing order are 10E, 15E, 20E, 22E, etc.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 10,15,20. So perhaps the question is asking about something else. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which states are allowed. Let me think again about the filling.

Wait, perhaps each spatial state (n) can hold two particles (spin up and down), and each particle's state is determined by n and spin. So the ground state is when the four particles are in the lowest possible states, which would be n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles). So energy 10E.

First excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=4, so configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1. But that's four particles, so energy 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E.

But that's not an option. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and zero in n=4. So two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy 2E +18E=20E.

But again, no options have 20E.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct arrangement. Let me think about the possible options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4E,10E,15E. Hmm, 4E is lower than the ground state I calculated, which suggests perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the ground state. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each particle's energy is n² E, but the four particles are fermions, so each must have a unique combination of n and spin. So for four particles, the ground state would have the four lowest possible n values, each with two possible spins. Wait, but that can't be, because n=1 can take two, n=2 another two, so four in total.

So ground state is n=1:2, n=2:2 → 2E +8E=10E.

Ah, but maybe the question is considering each particle as having a unique n. Because if each particle must have a unique n, that would change things. Wait, no, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum number n is the principal quantum number, and each n can have two particles with opposite spins.

So the initial assumption was correct: four particles would occupy n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So ground state energy is 10E.

But looking at the options, option D says 10E,15E,18E.

Wait, 10E is ground, 15E first excited, 18E second excited. How does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So energy would be 2E + 18E=20E. But that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4, but that would require five particles, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when all four are in n=2 and n=3, but that can't be because each n can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. So energy would be E + 8E +9E=18E. So that would be 1E +8E +9E=18E.

Wait, but that's four particles: 1 (n=1) + 2 (n=2) +1 (n=3) =4. So the energy would be 1E +8E +9E =18E.

But in that case, the order of energies would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E (from configuration 2,1,1).

Second excited:18E (from configuration 1,2,1).

But that depends on whether the configuration with n=1:1, n=2:2, and n=3:1 is lower in energy than the configuration with n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

Wait, because in configuration 1,2,1, the total energy is E +8E +9E=18E.

In configuration 2,1,1, the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

So 15E is lower than 18E, so the first excited state is 15E, the second excited state is 18E.

So the energies would be:

Ground:10E.

First excited:15E.

Second excited:18E.

Which matches option D:10E,15E,18E.

So the correct option would be D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy levels are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, each quantum state (defined by \( n \) and spin) can be occupied by at most one particle. Each spatial state \( n \) can hold two particles (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).

3. **Filling the States**:  
   The four particles will occupy the lowest available energy states, starting from \( n=1 \), \( n=2 \), \( n=3 \), etc., with each \( n \) accommodating two particles.

---

### Ground State:
- The lowest energy configuration is achieved by placing two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E \).  
  - **Ground State Energy**: \( 10E \).

---

### First Excited State:
- The first excited state occurs when one particle from \( n=2 \) moves to \( n=3 \), resulting in the configuration:  
  - Two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).  
  - **First Excited State Energy**: \( 15E \).

---

### Second Excited State:
- The second excited state occurs when another particle moves from \( n=2 \) to \( n=4 \), resulting in the configuration:  
  - Two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), one particle in \( n=3 \), and one particle in \( n=4 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) + 1(4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 31E \).  
  - However, this configuration is not consistent with the provided options.  
- An alternative interpretation is that the second excited state corresponds to the configuration where two particles are in \( n=3 \) and two particles remain in \( n=1 \):  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E \).  
  - This configuration also does not match the options.  
- Based on the options, the second excited state is interpreted as \( 18E \), which corresponds to a configuration where one particle is in \( n=1 \), two particles are in \( n=2 \), and one particle is in \( n=3 \):  
  - Energy contribution: \( E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = 1(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).  
  - **Second Excited State Energy**: \( 18E \).

---

### Final Answer:
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 18E \), respectively. This matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
