Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Right, expectation values are like the average outcome if you measure that operator many times on the system in this state.

So, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state. So here, O is 10σz +5σx. Maybe I can compute the expectation of each term separately and then add them together.

Wait, but σz and σx are Pauli matrices. I think their expectation values can be found individually. Also, since σx might not commute with σz, I'll have to handle each part separately.

First, let me write down the state. The given state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this in ket notation:

|ψ⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

Wait, I should check if this state is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them and add: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, the operator is O = 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for this state.

Starting with ⟨σz⟩: Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be easy. Let's recall that σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. So for any state expressed in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation value of σz is the sum of the coefficients squared times their respective eigenvalues.

So in this case, the coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. The eigenvalues for σz on these states are +1 and -1, respectively.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (3/4)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, let me compute that again.

(0.5)^2 is 0.25. So 0.25 * 1 (since |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1) is 0.25.

For |↓⟩, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2. Squared is (3/4). Multiply by eigenvalue -1: (3/4)*(-1) = -3/4 = -0.75.

Adding 0.25 and -0.75 gives -0.5. So yes, ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value directly using the state |ψ⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let's compute that.

But wait, σx has matrix elements. Let me think about the matrix forms.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? And |↑⟩ is the state [1,0], and |↓⟩ is [0,1].

So the state |ψ⟩ can be written as a column vector. Let's compute that.

|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Then, σx |ψ⟩ would be:

σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

So ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

So that's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = ?

Wait, let's compute each term:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4.

Same for the second term: sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = sqrt(3)/4.

Adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... approximately.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Another way to compute this is using the formula for expectation value, which for σx is (ψ| σx |ψ). Since the state is a linear combination, I can expand this.

Alternatively, another way: since σx is Hermitian, and for a spin-½ system, the expectation value can be found by the components.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value using the Bloch sphere. The state |ψ⟩ can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The expectation value of σx is twice the x-component of the Bloch vector, divided by the normalization (but in our case, the state is normalized, so it's just 2 times x-component).

Wait, the state |ψ⟩ is given by:

|ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓⟩.

In our case, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So 0.5 = cos(θ/2), and sqrt(3)/2 = sin(θ/2). So θ/2 is 60 degrees (because sin(60) = sqrt(3)/2), so θ is 120 degrees.

The x-component in the Bloch sphere representation is sin(θ) cos(φ). But wait, because the state is written as cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩.

Wait, since the coefficient of |↓⟩ is real and positive, the phase φ is zero. So φ=0.

The x-component is sinθ cosφ. Since φ is zero, cosφ is 1. So x = sinθ.

What is θ? Because cos(θ/2)=0.5, so θ/2=60 degrees, θ=120 degrees. So sinθ = sin(120) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So the x-component is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. So the expectation value of σx is twice this (since the Bloch vector components are scaled by ½?), wait no wait. Wait, the Bloch vector (x,y,z) is such that the expectation value of σi is just x, y, z respectively.

Wait, correction: The Bloch vector is (x,y,z), and the expectation value of σx is x, because σx is the Pauli matrix. So yeah, the expectation value of σx is equal to the x-component of the Bloch vector.

So in this case, the x-component is sqrt(3)/2. So yes, ⟨σx⟩=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't confuse anything with the coefficients. Because the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩, and when you write it in the Bloch sphere, the x-component is sinθ cosφ. Let me compute theta and phi again.

We have:

cos(θ/2) = 0.5 → θ/2 = 60 degrees → θ=120 degrees.

sin(θ/2) = sqrt(3)/2, correct.

And φ is the argument of the |↓⟩ coefficient. Since the coefficient is real and positive, phi is zero.

So x = sinθ cosφ = sin(120) * 1.

sin(120) is sin(60) = sqrt(3)/2. So x is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩=sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the matrix elements, I got the same result. So that's consistent.

So now, let's compute the expectation value for the operator O = 10σz +5σx.

We have ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5, and ⟨σx⟩= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So ⟨O⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )

= -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

Compute that numerically.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732.

So 5 * 1.732 = 8.66. Then 8.66 divided by 2 is 4.33.

So 10σz part is -5, 5σx part is 4.33.

Adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, that gives approximately -0.67. Hmm.

Wait, let me compute it more precisely.

sqrt(3) is about 1.73205.

So 5 * sqrt(3) = 8.66025.

Divide by 2: 4.330125.

So ⟨O⟩= 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

So approximately -0.67.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

Wait, -0.67 is close to -0.7, which is option C. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when to one decimal place.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Alternative approach: compute 5*sqrt(3)/2 plus 10*(-0.5).

Wait, 10*(-0.5) is -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5/2)*sqrt(3) ≈ 2.5 *1.732 ≈4.33.

So adding -5 and 4.33 gives -0.67.

Yes, that's correct.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which to one decimal is -0.7. So option C is -0.7.

But wait, the problem says "up to one decimal place." Let me see the exact value.

Exact value: 

⟨O⟩ = 10*(-1/2) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (-5) + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

5*sqrt(3) is about 8.660254, divided by 2 is 4.330127. So -5 +4.330127= -0.669873.

Rounded to one decimal place: -0.7.

So the correct answer is C) -0.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( O = 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
Since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2(+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2(-1).
\]

Squaring the coefficients:
\[
(0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), the state \( |\psi\rangle \) can be written as a column vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( |\psi\rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5).
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle O \rangle \)
Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) into \( \langle O \rangle \):
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:
\[
\langle O \rangle = -5 + \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Using \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
\[
\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{5(1.732)}{2} \approx 4.33.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle O \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
The expectation value \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.67 \) rounds to \( -0.7 \) when expressed to one decimal place.

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), corresponding to option C.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Right, expectation values are like the average outcome if you measure that operator many times on the system in this state.

So, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state. So here, O is 10σz +5σx. Maybe I can compute the expectation of each term separately and then add them together.

Wait, but σz and σx are Pauli matrices. I think their expectation values can be found individually. Also, since σx might not commute with σz, I'll have to handle each part separately.

First, let me write down the state. The given state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this in ket notation:

|ψ⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

Wait, I should check if this state is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them and add: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, the operator is O = 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for this state.

Starting with ⟨σz⟩: Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be easy. Let's recall that σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. So for any state expressed in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation value of σz is the sum of the coefficients squared times their respective eigenvalues.

So in this case, the coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. The eigenvalues for σz on these states are +1 and -1, respectively.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (3/4)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, let me compute that again.

(0.5)^2 is 0.25. So 0.25 * 1 (since |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1) is 0.25.

For |↓⟩, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2. Squared is (3/4). Multiply by eigenvalue -1: (3/4)*(-1) = -3/4 = -0.75.

Adding 0.25 and -0.75 gives -0.5. So yes, ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value directly using the state |ψ⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let's compute that.

But wait, σx has matrix elements. Let me think about the matrix forms.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? And |↑⟩ is the state [1,0], and |↓⟩ is [0,1].

So the state |ψ⟩ can be written as a column vector. Let's compute that.

|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Then, σx |ψ⟩ would be:

σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

So ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

So that's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = ?

Wait, let's compute each term:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4.

Same for the second term: sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = sqrt(3)/4.

Adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... approximately.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Another way to compute this is using the formula for expectation value, which for σx is (ψ| σx |ψ). Since the state is a linear combination, I can expand this.

Alternatively, another way: since σx is Hermitian, and for a spin-½ system, the expectation value can be found by the components.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value using the Bloch sphere. The state |ψ⟩ can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The expectation value of σx is twice the x-component of the Bloch vector, divided by the normalization (but in our case, the state is normalized, so it's just 2 times x-component).

Wait, the state |ψ⟩ is given by:

|ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓⟩.

In our case, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So 0.5 = cos(θ/2), and sqrt(3)/2 = sin(θ/2). So θ/2 is 60 degrees (because sin(60) = sqrt(3)/2), so θ is 120 degrees.

The x-component in the Bloch sphere representation is sin(θ) cos(φ). But wait, because the state is written as cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩.

Wait, since the coefficient of |↓⟩ is real and positive, the phase φ is zero. So φ=0.

The x-component is sinθ cosφ. Since φ is zero, cosφ is 1. So x = sinθ.

What is θ? Because cos(θ/2)=0.5, so θ/2=60 degrees, θ=120 degrees. So sinθ = sin(120) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So the x-component is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. So the expectation value of σx is twice this (since the Bloch vector components are scaled by ½?), wait no wait. Wait, the Bloch vector (x,y,z) is such that the expectation value of σi is just x, y, z respectively.

Wait, correction: The Bloch vector is (x,y,z), and the expectation value of σx is x, because σx is the Pauli matrix. So yeah, the expectation value of σx is equal to the x-component of the Bloch vector.

So in this case, the x-component is sqrt(3)/2. So yes, ⟨σx⟩=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't confuse anything with the coefficients. Because the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩, and when you write it in the Bloch sphere, the x-component is sinθ cosφ. Let me compute theta and phi again.

We have:

cos(θ/2) = 0.5 → θ/2 = 60 degrees → θ=120 degrees.

sin(θ/2) = sqrt(3)/2, correct.

And φ is the argument of the |↓⟩ coefficient. Since the coefficient is real and positive, phi is zero.

So x = sinθ cosφ = sin(120) * 1.

sin(120) is sin(60) = sqrt(3)/2. So x is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩=sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the matrix elements, I got the same result. So that's consistent.

So now, let's compute the expectation value for the operator O = 10σz +5σx.

We have ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5, and ⟨σx⟩= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So ⟨O⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )

= -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

Compute that numerically.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732.

So 5 * 1.732 = 8.66. Then 8.66 divided by 2 is 4.33.

So 10σz part is -5, 5σx part is 4.33.

Adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, that gives approximately -0.67. Hmm.

Wait, let me compute it more precisely.

sqrt(3) is about 1.73205.

So 5 * sqrt(3) = 8.66025.

Divide by 2: 4.330125.

So ⟨O⟩= 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

So approximately -0.67.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

Wait, -0.67 is close to -0.7, which is option C. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when to one decimal place.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Alternative approach: compute 5*sqrt(3)/2 plus 10*(-0.5).

Wait, 10*(-0.5) is -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5/2)*sqrt(3) ≈ 2.5 *1.732 ≈4.33.

So adding -5 and 4.33 gives -0.67.

Yes, that's correct.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which to one decimal is -0.7. So option C is -0.7.

But wait, the problem says "up to one decimal place." Let me see the exact value.

Exact value: 

⟨O⟩ = 10*(-1/2) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (-5) + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

5*sqrt(3) is about 8.660254, divided by 2 is 4.330127. So -5 +4.330127= -0.669873.

Rounded to one decimal place: -0.7.

So the correct answer is C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( O = 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
Since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2(+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2(-1).
\]

Squaring the coefficients:
\[
(0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), the state \( |\psi\rangle \) can be written as a column vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( |\psi\rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5).
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle O \rangle \)
Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) into \( \langle O \rangle \):
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:
\[
\langle O \rangle = -5 + \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Using \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
\[
\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{5(1.732)}{2} \approx 4.33.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle O \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
The expectation value \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.67 \) rounds to \( -0.7 \) when expressed to one decimal place.

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), corresponding to option C.
