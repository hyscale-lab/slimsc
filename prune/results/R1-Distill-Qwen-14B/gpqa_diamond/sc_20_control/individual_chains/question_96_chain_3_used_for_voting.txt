Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, ranging from 10^59 to 10^66 J/K.

Right, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. So I need to find the area of the event horizon first.

The event horizon's angular size is given. Angular size θ can be used with the distance d to find the actual size (like the diameter) using the small angle approximation. Oh wait, the formula for that is θ (in radians) ≈ opposite side / hypotenuse, which in this case is size = θ * d. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I'll need to convert that to radians first.

So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). Let me compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad is 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me calculate that:

θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 (since π/180 is approx 0.01745). So θ_rad ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Hmm, I need to convert parsecs into meters because the standard SI units are needed for the formula. I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 pc = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for the size using angular diameter distance is size = θ_rad * d. So the diameter of the event horizon is θ_rad * d. Let me compute that.

Size = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m ≈ 1.745 * 3.086 * 1e7 m. Let me multiply 1.745 by 3.086. Hmm, 1.7*3 is about 5.1, 0.045*3 is 0.135, 1.7*0.086 is around 0.1462, and 0.045*0.086 is small, about 0.00387. Adding all together: 5.1 + 0.135 is 5.235, plus 0.1462 is 5.3812, plus 0.00387 is about 5.385. So approximately 5.385e7 meters for the size. Wait, no, wait: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 is (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. Because 1e-19 * 1e26 is 1e7. So yes, about 5.38e7 meters. Wait, that's 5.38e7 meters, which is 5.38e4 kilometers, or about 53,800 kilometers. Hmm, sounds big but for a supermassive black hole, that's plausible.

Wait, but the radius would then be half that, so about 2.69e7 meters. But when calculating the area, we just need the radius squared multiplied by pi, so maybe I don't need to worry about that exact number right now.

Wait, the area A of the event horizon is the area of a sphere, right? A = 4π r^2. So if I can find r, the radius, I can compute A. Alternatively, since the size we've calculated is the diameter, which is 2r, so r = size / 2. Then A = 4π (size/2)^2 = π * size^2 / (4) *4? Wait, maybe better to think in terms of diameter.

Wait, let me think again. The size I calculated is the diameter D of the event horizon. So radius R is D/2. Then area A is 4π R^2 = π D^2 / ( (2)^2 ) *4? Wait, no, 4π (D/2)^2 = π D^2. Yes, because 4π*(D^2/4) = π D^2. So, the area A is π D^2.

So A = π * (θ_rad * d)^2.

Putting in the numbers: A = π * (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m)^2.

Let me compute that. First compute the product inside the square: 1.745e-19 *3.086e26 = (1.745 *3.086) * 1e7. As before, 1.745 *3.086 is approximately 5.385, so 5.385e7 m. Then square that: (5.385e7 m)^2 = (5.385)^2 * 1e14 m². 5.385 squared is about 28.99. So 28.99e14 m². Multiply by π, A ≈ 28.99e14 * 3.1416 ≈ 91.1e14 m², which is 9.11e15 m². Wait, that seems a bit low. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the product carefully.

θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m.

1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7. So 1.745 * 3.086 = let me compute that more precisely.

1.745 *3 =5.235, 1.745 *0.086= approx 0.15017. So total is 5.235 +0.15017 ≈5.38517. So 5.38517e7 meters. So D =5.385e7 m. So A = π D^2 = π (5.385e7)^2.

(5.385e7)^2 = (5.385)^2 * (1e7)^2 = 28.99 (approx) *1e14 = 2.899e15 m². Then multiply by π: A ≈ 9.11e15 m².

Wait, but I'm getting 9e15 m², but for a supermassive black hole, that seems a bit small. Because the Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2GM/c², and for a mass of say 1e8 solar masses, R_s is about 3e12 meters (since 1 solar mass R_s is about 3 km, so 1e8 solar masses would be 3e5 km = 3e8 meters? Wait wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c². For a solar mass (M_sun), R_s is approximately 2.95e3 m (about 3 km). So if the mass is M, then R_s is about 2.95e3 * M (in solar masses) meters. So if the event horizon size, D, is about 5e7 meters, then D = 2 R_s. So R_s = D/2 = 2.69e7 meters. So R_s = 2.69e7 m = 2.69e4 km, which is 26,900 km. That implies M = R_s/(2.95e3 m) * M_sun. Wait, M = (2.69e7 m) / (2.95e3 m) ) * M_sun = (2.69e7 / 2.95e3) ≈ 9120 M_sun. Hmm, that's a black hole of about 10^4 solar masses. But the question says it's a supermassive black hole, which are millions to billions of solar masses. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me go back.

θ is 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad is 1e-17 * (pi/180) = 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

Distance d is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters, so d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 =3.086e26 meters.

So θ_rad * d = 1.74533e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.74533 *3.086) * 1e7.

1.74533 *3.086: Let me compute that accurately. 1.7 *3 is 5.1. 1.7 *0.086 is ~0.1462. 0.04533 *3 = 0.13599. 0.04533 *0.086 ≈ 0.003898. Adding all: 5.1 + 0.1462 =5.2462 + 0.13599=5.3822 +0.003898=5.3861. So product is 5.3861e7 meters. So D = 5.3861e7 m.

So R = D/2 = 2.693e7 m.

Now, R_s = 2 G M / c². So M = R_s * c²/(2 G).

But perhaps another approach is to compute the area correctly. Since A =4π R^2, and R is 2.693e7 m, then A=4π*(2.693e7)^2.

(2.693e7)^2 = (approx) 7.25e14 m². So 4π *7.25e14 ≈ 4 *3.1416 *7.25e14 ≈ 12.566 *7.25e14 ≈ 9.07e15 m².

But earlier I thought that for a supermassive BH, the area would be much larger. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Let me think about the entropy formula.

The entropy S is given by S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Let me plug in the values.

We have A ≈9e15 m², c=3e8 m/s, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s, G=6.6743e-11 N·m²/kg², k_B=1.380649e-23 J/K.

So S = (9e15 m² * (3e8)^3) / (4 *1.0545718e-34 * 6.6743e-11 * 1.380649e-23 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 9e15 m² * (27e24 m³/s³) ) = 9 *27 =243e39 m^5/s^3. Wait, let me compute exponents correctly.

(3e8 m/s)^3 =27e24 (m^3/s^3). So 9e15 *27e24 = 9*27=243, and exponents 15+24=39. So 243e39 = 2.43e41 m^5/s^3.

Denominator:4 * 1.0545718e-34 * 6.6743e-11 * 1.380649e-23.

Let me compute each multiplication step:

First, 4 * 1.0545718e-34 =4.218e-34.

Then, multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743) * 1e-45.

4.218 *6.6743: 4 *6 =24, 4 *0.6743=2.697, 0.218 *6 =1.308, 0.218*0.6743≈0.147. Adding up: 24 + 2.697=26.697 +1.308=28.005 +0.147=28.152. So approximately 28.152e-45.

Next, multiply by 1.380649e-23: 28.152e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (28.152 *1.380649) *1e-68.

28.152 *1.380649: Let me approximate. 28 *1.38 is 38.64. 0.152 *1.38 is about 0.210. So total ~38.85.

So denominator is 38.85e-68 = 3.885e-67.

So S = (2.43e41) / (3.885e-67) ) J/K.

Dividing 2.43e41 by 3.885e-67: 2.43 /3.885 ≈ 0.626. So 0.626e(41 +67) = 0.626e108 = 6.26e107 J/K.

Wait, that's a big number, but the options are around 1e59 to 1e66. Hmm, but 6e107 is way larger than any of the options. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in some step. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, when computing the denominator:

4 * 1.05457e-34 = 4.218e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743) *1e-45.

4.218 *6.6743 = let me compute accurately.

6.6743 *4 =26.6972.

6.6743 *0.218 = approximately 1.4509.

Total: 26.6972 +1.4509 ≈28.1481.

So 28.1481e-45.

Then multiply by 1.380649e-23: 28.1481e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (28.1481 *1.380649) *1e-68.

28.1481 *1.380649: Let me compute this more accurately.

28 *1.38 is 38.64.

0.1481 *1.380649: 0.1 *1.380649=0.1380649, 0.0481 *1.380649≈0.0663. So total about 0.2043.

So total is 38.64 +0.2043=38.8443.

So denominator is 38.8443e-68 =3.88443e-67.

So S=2.43e41 / 3.88443e-67 = (2.43 /3.88443) *1e(41 +67) )= (0.626) *1e108 =6.26e107 J/K.

But the options are up to 1e66. That's way off. So probably I messed up somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Because I think I have a mistake there. Let me recalculate the area.

Wait, the formula for the area of the event horizon is A = 4π R², where R is the Schwarzschild radius, which is R_s = 2 G M / c². Alternatively, the area can be found using the diameter, which is D = 2 R_s = 4 G M / c².

Wait, if we have the angular diameter θ, then we can find D = θ_rad * d. So D is the diameter of the event horizon.

So A = π D².

Wait, let me recalculate that. D is 5.386e7 m. So A = π * (5.386e7)^2.

(5.386e7)^2 = (5.386)^2 *1e14 m² = 28.997 *1e14 =2.8997e15 m².

A= π * 2.8997e15 = approx 9.11e15 m².

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the formula for entropy. Let me confirm the formula. The entropy S is (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the numerator. Let me recompute the numerator.

Numerator: A * c^3 = (9.11e15 m²) * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3 =27e24 m³/s³.

So 9.11e15 *27e24 = 9.11 *27 = 245.97, and exponents 15+24=39, so 245.97e39 = 2.4597e41 (m^5/s^3).

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

Wait, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G is 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

k_B is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So denominator =4 * 1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Compute step by step:

4 * 1.0545718e-34 =4.218287e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218287e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218287 *6.6743) *1e-45.

4.218287 *6.6743 ≈28.148 (as before).

So 28.148e-45.

Multiply by 1.380649e-23: 28.148e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (28.148 *1.380649) *1e-68.

28.148 *1.380649 ≈38.844.

So denominator is 38.844e-68 =3.8844e-67.

So S = (2.4597e41) / (3.8844e-67) ) J/K.

2.4597e41 /3.8844e-67 = (2.4597/3.8844) *1e(41 +67) )= approx 0.633 *1e108 = 6.33e107 J/K.

But that's way larger than the options given. So I must have made a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the area was wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the area A is 4π R^2, where R is the Schwarzschild radius. Alternatively, R = (d * θ_rad)/2. Because θ_rad = D/(2d), where D is the diameter.

Wait, perhaps the formula to compute the area is A = π (θ_rad d)^2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the event horizon's diameter is D = θ_rad * d. So the radius R is D/2 = θ_rad *d / 2. So the area is A =4π R^2 = 4π (θ_rad d / 2 )^2 =4π * (θ_rad^2 d^2 ) /4 = π θ_rad^2 d^2. So yes, A=π θ_rad^2 d^2.

Wait, I think earlier I correctly computed A as π*(θ_rad*d)^2, which is π D².

So,

A = π * (1.745e-19 rad *3.086e26 m)^2.

Wait, let's compute that again.

1.745e-19 *3.086e26 =5.386e7 m.

So (5.386e7)^2 = (5.386)^2 *1e14 =28.997e14 m²=2.8997e15 m².

Multiply by π: A=9.11e15 m².

So that's correct.

Hmm, but according to that, the entropy is 6e107 J/K. But the options are much smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for entropy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but wait, I think I might have missed a factor. Let me check the formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check each step.

Wait, when I calculate A, I have it in m². c is m/s. So c^3 is m^3/s^3.

So in numerator: A in m² * c^3 (m^3/s^3) → m^5/s^3.

Denominator: 4 ħ G k_B.

ħ is J·s = (kg m²/s²) * s = kg m²/s.

G is m^3/(kg s²).

k_B is J/K = kg m²/(s² K).

So, denominator units:

4 * [kg m²/s * m^3/(kg s²) * kg m²/(s² K) ) ].

Wait, let me compute the units step by step.

Multiply ħ and G: (kg m²/s) * (m^3/(kg s²)) ) = (kg m²/s * m^3) ) / (kg s²) ) → (m^5 kg )/(s^3 kg) ) → m^5/s^3.

Then multiply by k_B: (m^5/s^3) * (kg m²/(s² K)) ) → (kg m^7)/(s^5 K).

So denominator units: 4 * (kg m^7)/(s^5 K).

Numerator units: m^5/s^3.

So S has units (m^5/s^3) / (kg m^7/(s^5 K)) ) → (m^5/s^3) * (s^5 K)/(kg m^7) ) → K/(kg m²).

Wait, but entropy S has units J/K, which is (kg m²/s²)/ K.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the unit analysis. Alternatively, perhaps a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use natural units where ħ= c= G= k_B=1, but that's beyond my current approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G * k_B.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G=6.6743e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

k_B=1.380649e-23 J/K.

So,

ħ * G = 1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.0545718 *6.6743) *1e-45.

1.0545718 *6.6743 ≈ 7.033. So 7.033e-45.

Multiply by k_B: 7.033e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (7.033 *1.380649) *1e-68.

7.033 *1.380649 ≈9.702.

So, 9.702e-68.

Multiply by 4: 4 *9.702e-68 =3.8808e-67.

So denominator is 3.8808e-67.

Numerator:2.4597e41.

So S = 2.4597e41 / 3.8808e-67 = (2.4597/3.8808) * 1e(41 +67) )= (0.633) *1e108 =6.33e107 J/K.

Hmm, same result as before. So why the discrepancy with the options?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the diameter. Let me think again about the angular size.

Wait, θ is the angular size of the event horizon, which is the angle subtended at the observer by the diameter of the black hole.

So, θ (in radians) = diameter / distance.

Diameter D = 2 R_s = 4 G M / c^2.

Alternatively, D = θ_rad * d.

So, R_s = D/2 = θ_rad * d /2.

So the area A =4π R_s^2 =4π (θ_rad d /2 )^2 = π (θ_rad d)^2.

So my calculation of A is correct.

So perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me think about the entropy formula again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents somewhere. Let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator: 4 *1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Compute step by step:

1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.0545718 *6.6743) *1e-45.

1.0545718 *6.6743 ≈7.033. So 7.033e-45.

7.033e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (7.033 *1.380649) *1e-68.

7.033 *1.380649 ≈9.702.

So 9.702e-68.

Multiply by 4: 3.8808e-67.

So denominator is 3.8808e-67.

Numerator: A c^3 =9.11e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3 =27e24 m³/s³.

So 9.11e15 *27e24 = 9.11 *27 =245.97, and 1e15 *1e24=1e39.

So 245.97e39 =2.4597e41.

So S=2.4597e41 /3.8808e-67 =6.33e107 J/K.

But the options are up to 1e66. So I'm way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distance d.

Wait, the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters, so d=1e10 *3.086e16=3.086e26 meters.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the diameter of the event horizon, but the formula for entropy uses the radius. Wait no, the area is correctly computed as π D^2, which is 4π R^2.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the angular size. θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. Maybe I should use the radius instead of the diameter. Wait no, because the angular size is based on the diameter.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I should calculate the mass M of the black hole from the angular size and distance.

We have D = θ_rad * d. D = 4 G M / c^2 → M = (D c^2)/(4 G).

So, M = ( (θ_rad * d) * c^2 ) / (4 G )

Let me compute that.

θ_rad =1e-17 degrees in radians: 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.745e-19 rad.

d=3.086e26 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

G=6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So,

M = (1.745e-19 rad *3.086e26 m) * (3e8 m/s)^2 / (4 *6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

(1.745e-19 *3.086e26) =5.386e7 m.

Multiply by (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s² → 5.386e7 *9e16 =4.8474e24 m^3/s².

Denominator:4 *6.674e-11 =2.6696e-10 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So M = (4.8474e24 m^3/s²) / (2.6696e-10 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 ) ) * kg.

Wait, units: m^3/s² divided by m³/(kg s²) ) → kg.

So M= (4.8474e24) / (2.6696e-10) ) kg.

4.8474e24 /2.6696e-10 = (4.8474/2.6696) *1e34 ≈ 1.815 *1e34 kg.

1.815e34 kg.

Wait, 1 solar mass is about 1.989e30 kg.

So M ≈1.815e34 /1.989e30 ≈9.12e3 solar masses.

Wait, that's about 10^4 solar masses. But the question says it's a supermassive black hole, which are typically millions to billions (1e6 to 1e9) solar masses. So this suggests that perhaps the angular size is too small, leading to a smaller mass than expected. But maybe that's correct because the distance is 1e10 parsecs, which is very far, so even a moderately large black hole would appear very small.

But perhaps the issue is that the calculation of the entropy leads to 6e107 J/K, which doesn't match any of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should instead calculate the area using the Schwarzschild radius formula.

Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c^2.

From M=9.12e3 M_sun, R_s= 2.95e3 m *9.12e3 =2.95e3 *9.12e3 =2.68e7 m. So the area is 4 pi R_s^2 =4 *pi*(2.68e7)^2.

(2.68e7)^2=7.18e14 m².

4 *pi *7.18e14 ≈ 8.99e15 m².

So same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the entropy formula.

I think I made a mistake in the entropy formula. Let me check.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Wait, but sometimes it's written as S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) ), where l_p is Planck length. l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ), so l_p^2 = ħ G / c^3.

So, S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B ) = A/(4 l_p^2 k_B ).

Wait, perhaps that's easier to compute.

l_p = sqrt( (ħ G)/c^3 ) ).

Compute l_p^2 = (ħ G)/c^3.

So,

l_p^2 = (1.0545718e-34 J s *6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )/( (3e8 m/s)^3 )

= (1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 ) / (2.7e24 ) ) m².

Wait,

1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 =7.033e-45.

7.033e-45 /2.7e24 = 2.605e-69 m².

So,

S = A/(4 *2.605e-69 m² *k_B )

But k_B is in J/K, which is m² kg / (s^2 K).

Wait, perhaps better to write the formula as S = A/(4 l_p^2 k_B ), but I think I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute S using the known formula:

S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B )

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the options are expecting the entropy in terms of the area in Planck units. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²).

k_B=1.380649e-23 J/K.

So,

4 *1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Compute step by step:

First, 1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 =7.033e-45.

Then, 7.033e-45 *1.380649e-23 =7.033 *1.380649 =9.702 → 9.702e-68.

Multiply by 4: 38.808e-68 =3.8808e-67.

So denominator is 3.8808e-67.

Numerator: A c^3 =9.11e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3 =9.11e15 *2.7e24 =2.4597e40 m^5/s^3.

So S=2.4597e40 /3.8808e-67 =6.33e106 J/K.

Wait, wait, that's 6.33e106. But earlier I thought it was 1e108. Oh, because 2.4597e40 /3.88e-67 = (2.4597/3.88) * 1e(40 +67) )= 0.633 *1e107 =6.33e106 J/K.

Wait, so S is about 6e106 J/K. Now, the options are:

A) 1e62

B) 1e59

C) 1e66

D)1e65

So 6e106 is 6e106, which is 1e106 is 1e106. But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me think.

Wait, the area A is π (θ_rad d)^2.

θ_rad is 1e-17 degrees in radians: 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.74533e-19 rad.

d=3.086e26 m.

So,

θ_rad *d =1.74533e-19 *3.086e26 =5.386e7 m.

So A=π*(5.386e7)^2 =pi *2.899e15 =9.11e15 m².

Wait, but perhaps I should compute A in terms of (G, c, etc.) to avoid unit issues. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute A in Planck units.

Wait, the Planck area is (l_p)^2, where l_p is sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ).

l_p = sqrt( (1.05e-34 *6.7e-11 )/(3e8)^3 ) ) = sqrt( (7e-45 )/(2.7e24) )) = sqrt(2.6e-69) )=5.1e-35 meters.

So each Planck area is (5.1e-35 m)^2 =2.6e-69 m².

So the area A is 9.11e15 m² / 2.6e-69 m² per Planck area = 3.5e84 Planck areas.

Wait, but the entropy formula in Planck units is S = A/(4 l_p^2 k_B ).

Wait, perhaps another approach. The entropy is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ).

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ).

Wait, but that's the same as earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy in terms of the number of Planck areas. Because each Planck area contributes a certain entropy.

Wait, the entropy S is proportional to the area A divided by the Planck area. So S = (A / l_p^2 ) * (c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ) *some factor.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy using the formula S = ( (π D^2) c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ), where D is the diameter of the event horizon.

But I don't think that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula S = ( (π (θ_rad d)^2 ) c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ).

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have used the radius instead of the diameter in the area calculation.

Wait, no. The area of the event horizon is 4π R^2, where R is the Schwarzschild radius. Since R= D/2, then A=4π (D/2)^2 = π D^2. So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the entropy is ~6e106 J/K, but the options are way smaller.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the distance. Wait, the distance is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters, so 1e10 parsec is 3.086e26 meters. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the entropy using the area in square centimeters or another unit, but I don't think that would help. The units should all be in SI.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I didn't account for the fact that the angular size is measured as the apparent size, not the actual size. But I think I did that correctly by using θ_rad * d = D.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the exponents more carefully.

Wait, numerator: A c^3 =9.11e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3 =27e24 m³/s³.

So 9.11e15 *27e24 = (9.11 *27 )e(15+24) = 245.97e39 = 2.4597e41.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G * k_B =3.8808e-67.

So S=2.4597e41 /3.8808e-67 = (2.4597/3.8808) * 1e(41 +67) )= 0.633 *1e108 =6.33e107 J/K.

Wait, that's 6.33e107 J/K. Which is 6.3e107, so about 1e108. None of the options match, so perhaps the question intended something else.

Wait, maybe the question uses a different formula, such as S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) *k_B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the entropy to be calculated using the radius instead of the diameter.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I used the diameter when I should have used the radius.

Wait, no, because the area is correctly computed as π D², which equals 4π R² where R is the radius.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as using the area as calculated from the Schwarzschild radius using the mass, and using M = (c^2 d θ)/(4 G ) or something similar.

Wait, let me try that.

M = (c^2 d θ )/(4 G ), where θ is in radians.

So,

θ=1e-17 degrees =1e-17 *pi/180 ≈1.745e-19 rad.

d=3.086e26 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

G=6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So,

M = (3e8^2 *3.086e26 *1.745e-19 )/(4 *6.674e-11 )

Compute numerator:

3e8^2 =9e16.

9e16 *3.086e26 =2.777e43.

2.777e43 *1.745e-19 =4.848e24.

Denominator:4 *6.674e-11=2.6696e-10.

So,

M=4.848e24 /2.6696e-10 = 1.815e34 kg.

1 solar mass is 1.989e30 kg, so M=1.815e34 /1.989e30 ≈9.12e3 M_sun.

So R_s=2 G M/(c^2 ). Plugging in M=9.12e3 M_sun.

R_s =2.95e3 m *9.12e3 =2.68e7 m.

Area A=4pi R_s^2=4pi (2.68e7)^2 =4pi *7.18e14 =8.99e15 m².

So same as before.

So S=6e107 J/K.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question has a typo, but more likely I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), which is the same as earlier.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the exponents of the denominator. Let me recheck.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G *k_B.

Which is 4 *1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 *1.38e-23.

Compute 1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 =7.0e-45.

7.0e-45 *1.38e-23=9.66e-68.

Multiply by 4: 3.86e-67.

So denominator=3.86e-67.

Numerator=2.45e41.

So S=2.45e41 /3.86e-67 =6.34e107 J/K.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the beginning steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the entropy to be calculated using the formula S = 10^something, and perhaps I should reconsider the initial steps for any missing factors.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the Schwarzschild radius.

R_s = 2 G M / c^2.

The entropy is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), and A=4 pi R_s^2.

So,

S = (k_B c^3 *4 pi R_s^2 )/(4 ħ G ) )= (k_B pi c^3 R_s^2 )/( ħ G )

But R_s = 2 G M/c^2 → R_s^2 =4 G^2 M²/c^4.

Substituting:

S = (k_B pi c^3 *4 G^2 M² / c^4 ) / ( ħ G )

Simplify:

= (4 pi k_B G^2 M² c^3 )/( ħ G c^4 )

= (4 pi k_B G M² )/( ħ c )

Hmm, perhaps this approach would be more manageable.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express M in terms of the given θ and d.

M = (c^2 d theta )/(4 G )

From earlier, M= (c^2 *d *theta_rad )/(4 G )

So,

M=(3e8)^2 *3.086e26 m *1.745e-19 rad / (4 *6.674e-11 )

Which is the same calculation as before, leading to M=9.12e3 M_sun.

So perhaps I'm correct in the calculations, but the options are way off. But that's impossible because the question expects one of the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the entropy using the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), but I should express A in terms of the Schwarzschild area, which is A =8 pi (G M c^-2 )^2.

So,

A=8 pi (G M/c^2 )^2.

So,

S= (k_B c^3 *8 pi (G M/c^2 )^2 )/(4 ħ G )

Simplify:

= (8 pi k_B c^3 G^2 M^2 )/(4 ħ G c^4 )

= (2 pi k_B G M^2 )/( ħ c )

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute S in terms of M.

But since I already have M=9.12e3 M_sun, perhaps I can compute S in terms of M.

Wait, the formula for entropy is S = ( (k_B c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) ) * A.

A =4 pi (2 G M /c^2 )^2 =16 pi G² M²/c^4.

So,

S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * 16 pi G² M^2 / c^4.

Simplify:

= (k_B c^3 *16 pi G² M^2 )/(4 ħ G c^4 )

= (4 pi k_B G M^2 )/( ħ c )

So S = (4 pi G k_B )/( ħ c ) * M^2.

Now, compute the coefficient:

4 pi G k_B / ( ħ c ) =4 *3.1416 *6.674e-11 *1.38e-23 / (1.054e-34 *3e8 )

Compute numerator:4 *3.1416≈12.566.

12.566 *6.674e-11 ≈8.386e-10.

8.386e-10 *1.38e-23 ≈1.156e-32.

Denominator:1.054e-34 *3e8 ≈3.163e-26.

So coefficient is 1.156e-32 /3.163e-26 ≈3.65e-7.

So S ≈3.65e-7 * M^2.

Now, M=9.12e3 M_sun.

But M_sun is 1.989e30 kg, so M=9.12e3 *1.989e30 =1.814e34 kg.

So,

S≈3.65e-7 * (1.814e34 )^2.

(1.814e34 )^2 =3.29e68.

3.65e-7 *3.29e68 =1.198e62 J/K.

So about 1e62 J/K.

Which corresponds to option A) 1e62 J/K.

Ah! So that's the correct answer. I must have made a mistake earlier in the calculation of the entropy, probably in the denominator. So the correct answer is option A) 1e62 J/K.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 \hbar G k_B}
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant, \(G\) is the gravitational constant, and \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant. The area \(A\) of the event horizon is given by:

\[
A = \pi D^2
\]

where \(D\) is the diameter of the event horizon. The diameter \(D\) can be calculated using the angular size \(\theta\) and the distance \(d\) to the black hole:

\[
D = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d
\]

### Step 1: Convert \(\theta\) to radians
The angular size is given as \(\theta = 10^{-17}^\circ\). Converting to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the diameter \(D\)
The distance to the black hole is \(d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs}\). Converting parsecs to meters:

\[
1 \, \text{parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}, \quad d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

The diameter is:

\[
D = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.386 \times 10^{7} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area \(A\)
The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = \pi D^2 = \pi (5.386 \times 10^{7})^2 \approx \pi \cdot 2.899 \times 10^{15} \approx 9.11 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the entropy \(S\)
Substitute \(A = 9.11 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2\) into the entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 \hbar G k_B}.
\]

The constants are:
- \(c = 3 \times 10^{8} \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\),
- \(G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}\),
- \(k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\).

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
A c^3 = (9.11 \times 10^{15}) \cdot (3 \times 10^{8})^3 = (9.11 \times 10^{15}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{24}) \approx 2.4597 \times 10^{40} \, \text{m}^5 \, \text{s}^{-3}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \hbar G k_B = 4 \cdot (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (1.380649 \times 10^{-23}).
\]

Step-by-step:
1. \(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} = 7.033 \times 10^{-45}\),
2. \(7.033 \times 10^{-45} \cdot 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} = 9.702 \times 10^{-68}\),
3. \(4 \cdot 9.702 \times 10^{-68} = 3.8808 \times 10^{-67}\).

Finally, calculate \(S\):

\[
S = \frac{2.4597 \times 10^{40}}{3.8808 \times 10^{-67}} \approx 6.33 \times 10^{106} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 5: Reconcile with the options
The calculated entropy is \(S \approx 6.33 \times 10^{106} \, \text{J/K}\), which is far larger than the given options. To resolve this discrepancy, we re-express the entropy in terms of the black hole's mass \(M\). The mass is derived from the Schwarzschild radius:

\[
R_s = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}, \quad M = \frac{R_s c^2}{2 G}.
\]

Using \(D = 4 G M / c^2\), we find \(M \approx 9.12 \times 10^3 M_\odot\). Substituting \(M\) into the entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{4 \pi G k_B}{\hbar c} M^2.
\]

After recalculating, the entropy is found to be approximately \(S \approx 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\), which matches option **A**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, ranging from 10^59 to 10^66 J/K.

Right, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. So I need to find the area of the event horizon first.

The event horizon's angular size is given. Angular size θ can be used with the distance d to find the actual size (like the diameter) using the small angle approximation. Oh wait, the formula for that is θ (in radians) ≈ opposite side / hypotenuse, which in this case is size = θ * d. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I'll need to convert that to radians first.

So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). Let me compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad is 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me calculate that:

θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 (since π/180 is approx 0.01745). So θ_rad ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Hmm, I need to convert parsecs into meters because the standard SI units are needed for the formula. I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 pc = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for the size using angular diameter distance is size = θ_rad * d. So the diameter of the event horizon is θ_rad * d. Let me compute that.

Size = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m ≈ 1.745 * 3.086 * 1e7 m. Let me multiply 1.745 by 3.086. Hmm, 1.7*3 is about 5.1, 0.045*3 is 0.135, 1.7*0.086 is around 0.1462, and 0.045*0.086 is small, about 0.00387. Adding all together: 5.1 + 0.135 is 5.235, plus 0.1462 is 5.3812, plus 0.00387 is about 5.385. So approximately 5.385e7 meters for the size. Wait, no, wait: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 is (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. Because 1e-19 * 1e26 is 1e7. So yes, about 5.38e7 meters. Wait, that's 5.38e7 meters, which is 5.38e4 kilometers, or about 53,800 kilometers. Hmm, sounds big but for a supermassive black hole, that's plausible.

Wait, but the radius would then be half that, so about 2.69e7 meters. But when calculating the area, we just need the radius squared multiplied by pi, so maybe I don't need to worry about that exact number right now.

Wait, the area A of the event horizon is the area of a sphere, right? A = 4π r^2. So if I can find r, the radius, I can compute A. Alternatively, since the size we've calculated is the diameter, which is 2r, so r = size / 2. Then A = 4π (size/2)^2 = π * size^2 / (4) *4? Wait, maybe better to think in terms of diameter.

Wait, let me think again. The size I calculated is the diameter D of the event horizon. So radius R is D/2. Then area A is 4π R^2 = π D^2 / ( (2)^2 ) *4? Wait, no, 4π (D/2)^2 = π D^2. Yes, because 4π*(D^2/4) = π D^2. So, the area A is π D^2.

So A = π * (θ_rad * d)^2.

Putting in the numbers: A = π * (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m)^2.

Let me compute that. First compute the product inside the square: 1.745e-19 *3.086e26 = (1.745 *3.086) * 1e7. As before, 1.745 *3.086 is approximately 5.385, so 5.385e7 m. Then square that: (5.385e7 m)^2 = (5.385)^2 * 1e14 m². 5.385 squared is about 28.99. So 28.99e14 m². Multiply by π, A ≈ 28.99e14 * 3.1416 ≈ 91.1e14 m², which is 9.11e15 m². Wait, that seems a bit low. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the product carefully.

θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m.

1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7. So 1.745 * 3.086 = let me compute that more precisely.

1.745 *3 =5.235, 1.745 *0.086= approx 0.15017. So total is 5.235 +0.15017 ≈5.38517. So 5.38517e7 meters. So D =5.385e7 m. So A = π D^2 = π (5.385e7)^2.

(5.385e7)^2 = (5.385)^2 * (1e7)^2 = 28.99 (approx) *1e14 = 2.899e15 m². Then multiply by π: A ≈ 9.11e15 m².

Wait, but I'm getting 9e15 m², but for a supermassive black hole, that seems a bit small. Because the Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2GM/c², and for a mass of say 1e8 solar masses, R_s is about 3e12 meters (since 1 solar mass R_s is about 3 km, so 1e8 solar masses would be 3e5 km = 3e8 meters? Wait wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c². For a solar mass (M_sun), R_s is approximately 2.95e3 m (about 3 km). So if the mass is M, then R_s is about 2.95e3 * M (in solar masses) meters. So if the event horizon size, D, is about 5e7 meters, then D = 2 R_s. So R_s = D/2 = 2.69e7 meters. So R_s = 2.69e7 m = 2.69e4 km, which is 26,900 km. That implies M = R_s/(2.95e3 m) * M_sun. Wait, M = (2.69e7 m) / (2.95e3 m) ) * M_sun = (2.69e7 / 2.95e3) ≈ 9120 M_sun. Hmm, that's a black hole of about 10^4 solar masses. But the question says it's a supermassive black hole, which are millions to billions of solar masses. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me go back.

θ is 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad is 1e-17 * (pi/180) = 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

Distance d is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters, so d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 =3.086e26 meters.

So θ_rad * d = 1.74533e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.74533 *3.086) * 1e7.

1.74533 *3.086: Let me compute that accurately. 1.7 *3 is 5.1. 1.7 *0.086 is ~0.1462. 0.04533 *3 = 0.13599. 0.04533 *0.086 ≈ 0.003898. Adding all: 5.1 + 0.1462 =5.2462 + 0.13599=5.3822 +0.003898=5.3861. So product is 5.3861e7 meters. So D = 5.3861e7 m.

So R = D/2 = 2.693e7 m.

Now, R_s = 2 G M / c². So M = R_s * c²/(2 G).

But perhaps another approach is to compute the area correctly. Since A =4π R^2, and R is 2.693e7 m, then A=4π*(2.693e7)^2.

(2.693e7)^2 = (approx) 7.25e14 m². So 4π *7.25e14 ≈ 4 *3.1416 *7.25e14 ≈ 12.566 *7.25e14 ≈ 9.07e15 m².

But earlier I thought that for a supermassive BH, the area would be much larger. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Let me think about the entropy formula.

The entropy S is given by S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Let me plug in the values.

We have A ≈9e15 m², c=3e8 m/s, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s, G=6.6743e-11 N·m²/kg², k_B=1.380649e-23 J/K.

So S = (9e15 m² * (3e8)^3) / (4 *1.0545718e-34 * 6.6743e-11 * 1.380649e-23 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 9e15 m² * (27e24 m³/s³) ) = 9 *27 =243e39 m^5/s^3. Wait, let me compute exponents correctly.

(3e8 m/s)^3 =27e24 (m^3/s^3). So 9e15 *27e24 = 9*27=243, and exponents 15+24=39. So 243e39 = 2.43e41 m^5/s^3.

Denominator:4 * 1.0545718e-34 * 6.6743e-11 * 1.380649e-23.

Let me compute each multiplication step:

First, 4 * 1.0545718e-34 =4.218e-34.

Then, multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743) * 1e-45.

4.218 *6.6743: 4 *6 =24, 4 *0.6743=2.697, 0.218 *6 =1.308, 0.218*0.6743≈0.147. Adding up: 24 + 2.697=26.697 +1.308=28.005 +0.147=28.152. So approximately 28.152e-45.

Next, multiply by 1.380649e-23: 28.152e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (28.152 *1.380649) *1e-68.

28.152 *1.380649: Let me approximate. 28 *1.38 is 38.64. 0.152 *1.38 is about 0.210. So total ~38.85.

So denominator is 38.85e-68 = 3.885e-67.

So S = (2.43e41) / (3.885e-67) ) J/K.

Dividing 2.43e41 by 3.885e-67: 2.43 /3.885 ≈ 0.626. So 0.626e(41 +67) = 0.626e108 = 6.26e107 J/K.

Wait, that's a big number, but the options are around 1e59 to 1e66. Hmm, but 6e107 is way larger than any of the options. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in some step. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, when computing the denominator:

4 * 1.05457e-34 = 4.218e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743) *1e-45.

4.218 *6.6743 = let me compute accurately.

6.6743 *4 =26.6972.

6.6743 *0.218 = approximately 1.4509.

Total: 26.6972 +1.4509 ≈28.1481.

So 28.1481e-45.

Then multiply by 1.380649e-23: 28.1481e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (28.1481 *1.380649) *1e-68.

28.1481 *1.380649: Let me compute this more accurately.

28 *1.38 is 38.64.

0.1481 *1.380649: 0.1 *1.380649=0.1380649, 0.0481 *1.380649≈0.0663. So total about 0.2043.

So total is 38.64 +0.2043=38.8443.

So denominator is 38.8443e-68 =3.88443e-67.

So S=2.43e41 / 3.88443e-67 = (2.43 /3.88443) *1e(41 +67) )= (0.626) *1e108 =6.26e107 J/K.

But the options are up to 1e66. That's way off. So probably I messed up somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Because I think I have a mistake there. Let me recalculate the area.

Wait, the formula for the area of the event horizon is A = 4π R², where R is the Schwarzschild radius, which is R_s = 2 G M / c². Alternatively, the area can be found using the diameter, which is D = 2 R_s = 4 G M / c².

Wait, if we have the angular diameter θ, then we can find D = θ_rad * d. So D is the diameter of the event horizon.

So A = π D².

Wait, let me recalculate that. D is 5.386e7 m. So A = π * (5.386e7)^2.

(5.386e7)^2 = (5.386)^2 *1e14 m² = 28.997 *1e14 =2.8997e15 m².

A= π * 2.8997e15 = approx 9.11e15 m².

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the formula for entropy. Let me confirm the formula. The entropy S is (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the numerator. Let me recompute the numerator.

Numerator: A * c^3 = (9.11e15 m²) * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3 =27e24 m³/s³.

So 9.11e15 *27e24 = 9.11 *27 = 245.97, and exponents 15+24=39, so 245.97e39 = 2.4597e41 (m^5/s^3).

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

Wait, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G is 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

k_B is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So denominator =4 * 1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Compute step by step:

4 * 1.0545718e-34 =4.218287e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218287e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218287 *6.6743) *1e-45.

4.218287 *6.6743 ≈28.148 (as before).

So 28.148e-45.

Multiply by 1.380649e-23: 28.148e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (28.148 *1.380649) *1e-68.

28.148 *1.380649 ≈38.844.

So denominator is 38.844e-68 =3.8844e-67.

So S = (2.4597e41) / (3.8844e-67) ) J/K.

2.4597e41 /3.8844e-67 = (2.4597/3.8844) *1e(41 +67) )= approx 0.633 *1e108 = 6.33e107 J/K.

But that's way larger than the options given. So I must have made a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the area was wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the area A is 4π R^2, where R is the Schwarzschild radius. Alternatively, R = (d * θ_rad)/2. Because θ_rad = D/(2d), where D is the diameter.

Wait, perhaps the formula to compute the area is A = π (θ_rad d)^2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the event horizon's diameter is D = θ_rad * d. So the radius R is D/2 = θ_rad *d / 2. So the area is A =4π R^2 = 4π (θ_rad d / 2 )^2 =4π * (θ_rad^2 d^2 ) /4 = π θ_rad^2 d^2. So yes, A=π θ_rad^2 d^2.

Wait, I think earlier I correctly computed A as π*(θ_rad*d)^2, which is π D².

So,

A = π * (1.745e-19 rad *3.086e26 m)^2.

Wait, let's compute that again.

1.745e-19 *3.086e26 =5.386e7 m.

So (5.386e7)^2 = (5.386)^2 *1e14 =28.997e14 m²=2.8997e15 m².

Multiply by π: A=9.11e15 m².

So that's correct.

Hmm, but according to that, the entropy is 6e107 J/K. But the options are much smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for entropy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but wait, I think I might have missed a factor. Let me check the formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check each step.

Wait, when I calculate A, I have it in m². c is m/s. So c^3 is m^3/s^3.

So in numerator: A in m² * c^3 (m^3/s^3) → m^5/s^3.

Denominator: 4 ħ G k_B.

ħ is J·s = (kg m²/s²) * s = kg m²/s.

G is m^3/(kg s²).

k_B is J/K = kg m²/(s² K).

So, denominator units:

4 * [kg m²/s * m^3/(kg s²) * kg m²/(s² K) ) ].

Wait, let me compute the units step by step.

Multiply ħ and G: (kg m²/s) * (m^3/(kg s²)) ) = (kg m²/s * m^3) ) / (kg s²) ) → (m^5 kg )/(s^3 kg) ) → m^5/s^3.

Then multiply by k_B: (m^5/s^3) * (kg m²/(s² K)) ) → (kg m^7)/(s^5 K).

So denominator units: 4 * (kg m^7)/(s^5 K).

Numerator units: m^5/s^3.

So S has units (m^5/s^3) / (kg m^7/(s^5 K)) ) → (m^5/s^3) * (s^5 K)/(kg m^7) ) → K/(kg m²).

Wait, but entropy S has units J/K, which is (kg m²/s²)/ K.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the unit analysis. Alternatively, perhaps a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use natural units where ħ= c= G= k_B=1, but that's beyond my current approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G * k_B.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G=6.6743e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

k_B=1.380649e-23 J/K.

So,

ħ * G = 1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.0545718 *6.6743) *1e-45.

1.0545718 *6.6743 ≈ 7.033. So 7.033e-45.

Multiply by k_B: 7.033e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (7.033 *1.380649) *1e-68.

7.033 *1.380649 ≈9.702.

So, 9.702e-68.

Multiply by 4: 4 *9.702e-68 =3.8808e-67.

So denominator is 3.8808e-67.

Numerator:2.4597e41.

So S = 2.4597e41 / 3.8808e-67 = (2.4597/3.8808) * 1e(41 +67) )= (0.633) *1e108 =6.33e107 J/K.

Hmm, same result as before. So why the discrepancy with the options?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the diameter. Let me think again about the angular size.

Wait, θ is the angular size of the event horizon, which is the angle subtended at the observer by the diameter of the black hole.

So, θ (in radians) = diameter / distance.

Diameter D = 2 R_s = 4 G M / c^2.

Alternatively, D = θ_rad * d.

So, R_s = D/2 = θ_rad * d /2.

So the area A =4π R_s^2 =4π (θ_rad d /2 )^2 = π (θ_rad d)^2.

So my calculation of A is correct.

So perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me think about the entropy formula again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents somewhere. Let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator: 4 *1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Compute step by step:

1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.0545718 *6.6743) *1e-45.

1.0545718 *6.6743 ≈7.033. So 7.033e-45.

7.033e-45 *1.380649e-23 = (7.033 *1.380649) *1e-68.

7.033 *1.380649 ≈9.702.

So 9.702e-68.

Multiply by 4: 3.8808e-67.

So denominator is 3.8808e-67.

Numerator: A c^3 =9.11e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3 =27e24 m³/s³.

So 9.11e15 *27e24 = 9.11 *27 =245.97, and 1e15 *1e24=1e39.

So 245.97e39 =2.4597e41.

So S=2.4597e41 /3.8808e-67 =6.33e107 J/K.

But the options are up to 1e66. So I'm way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distance d.

Wait, the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters, so d=1e10 *3.086e16=3.086e26 meters.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the diameter of the event horizon, but the formula for entropy uses the radius. Wait no, the area is correctly computed as π D^2, which is 4π R^2.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the angular size. θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. Maybe I should use the radius instead of the diameter. Wait no, because the angular size is based on the diameter.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I should calculate the mass M of the black hole from the angular size and distance.

We have D = θ_rad * d. D = 4 G M / c^2 → M = (D c^2)/(4 G).

So, M = ( (θ_rad * d) * c^2 ) / (4 G )

Let me compute that.

θ_rad =1e-17 degrees in radians: 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.745e-19 rad.

d=3.086e26 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

G=6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So,

M = (1.745e-19 rad *3.086e26 m) * (3e8 m/s)^2 / (4 *6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

(1.745e-19 *3.086e26) =5.386e7 m.

Multiply by (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s² → 5.386e7 *9e16 =4.8474e24 m^3/s².

Denominator:4 *6.674e-11 =2.6696e-10 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So M = (4.8474e24 m^3/s²) / (2.6696e-10 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 ) ) * kg.

Wait, units: m^3/s² divided by m³/(kg s²) ) → kg.

So M= (4.8474e24) / (2.6696e-10) ) kg.

4.8474e24 /2.6696e-10 = (4.8474/2.6696) *1e34 ≈ 1.815 *1e34 kg.

1.815e34 kg.

Wait, 1 solar mass is about 1.989e30 kg.

So M ≈1.815e34 /1.989e30 ≈9.12e3 solar masses.

Wait, that's about 10^4 solar masses. But the question says it's a supermassive black hole, which are typically millions to billions (1e6 to 1e9) solar masses. So this suggests that perhaps the angular size is too small, leading to a smaller mass than expected. But maybe that's correct because the distance is 1e10 parsecs, which is very far, so even a moderately large black hole would appear very small.

But perhaps the issue is that the calculation of the entropy leads to 6e107 J/K, which doesn't match any of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should instead calculate the area using the Schwarzschild radius formula.

Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c^2.

From M=9.12e3 M_sun, R_s= 2.95e3 m *9.12e3 =2.95e3 *9.12e3 =2.68e7 m. So the area is 4 pi R_s^2 =4 *pi*(2.68e7)^2.

(2.68e7)^2=7.18e14 m².

4 *pi *7.18e14 ≈ 8.99e15 m².

So same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the entropy formula.

I think I made a mistake in the entropy formula. Let me check.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Wait, but sometimes it's written as S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) ), where l_p is Planck length. l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ), so l_p^2 = ħ G / c^3.

So, S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B ) = A/(4 l_p^2 k_B ).

Wait, perhaps that's easier to compute.

l_p = sqrt( (ħ G)/c^3 ) ).

Compute l_p^2 = (ħ G)/c^3.

So,

l_p^2 = (1.0545718e-34 J s *6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )/( (3e8 m/s)^3 )

= (1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 ) / (2.7e24 ) ) m².

Wait,

1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 =7.033e-45.

7.033e-45 /2.7e24 = 2.605e-69 m².

So,

S = A/(4 *2.605e-69 m² *k_B )

But k_B is in J/K, which is m² kg / (s^2 K).

Wait, perhaps better to write the formula as S = A/(4 l_p^2 k_B ), but I think I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute S using the known formula:

S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B )

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the options are expecting the entropy in terms of the area in Planck units. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²).

k_B=1.380649e-23 J/K.

So,

4 *1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Compute step by step:

First, 1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 =7.033e-45.

Then, 7.033e-45 *1.380649e-23 =7.033 *1.380649 =9.702 → 9.702e-68.

Multiply by 4: 38.808e-68 =3.8808e-67.

So denominator is 3.8808e-67.

Numerator: A c^3 =9.11e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3 =9.11e15 *2.7e24 =2.4597e40 m^5/s^3.

So S=2.4597e40 /3.8808e-67 =6.33e106 J/K.

Wait, wait, that's 6.33e106. But earlier I thought it was 1e108. Oh, because 2.4597e40 /3.88e-67 = (2.4597/3.88) * 1e(40 +67) )= 0.633 *1e107 =6.33e106 J/K.

Wait, so S is about 6e106 J/K. Now, the options are:

A) 1e62

B) 1e59

C) 1e66

D)1e65

So 6e106 is 6e106, which is 1e106 is 1e106. But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me think.

Wait, the area A is π (θ_rad d)^2.

θ_rad is 1e-17 degrees in radians: 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.74533e-19 rad.

d=3.086e26 m.

So,

θ_rad *d =1.74533e-19 *3.086e26 =5.386e7 m.

So A=π*(5.386e7)^2 =pi *2.899e15 =9.11e15 m².

Wait, but perhaps I should compute A in terms of (G, c, etc.) to avoid unit issues. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute A in Planck units.

Wait, the Planck area is (l_p)^2, where l_p is sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ).

l_p = sqrt( (1.05e-34 *6.7e-11 )/(3e8)^3 ) ) = sqrt( (7e-45 )/(2.7e24) )) = sqrt(2.6e-69) )=5.1e-35 meters.

So each Planck area is (5.1e-35 m)^2 =2.6e-69 m².

So the area A is 9.11e15 m² / 2.6e-69 m² per Planck area = 3.5e84 Planck areas.

Wait, but the entropy formula in Planck units is S = A/(4 l_p^2 k_B ).

Wait, perhaps another approach. The entropy is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ).

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ).

Wait, but that's the same as earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy in terms of the number of Planck areas. Because each Planck area contributes a certain entropy.

Wait, the entropy S is proportional to the area A divided by the Planck area. So S = (A / l_p^2 ) * (c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ) *some factor.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy using the formula S = ( (π D^2) c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ), where D is the diameter of the event horizon.

But I don't think that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula S = ( (π (θ_rad d)^2 ) c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ).

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have used the radius instead of the diameter in the area calculation.

Wait, no. The area of the event horizon is 4π R^2, where R is the Schwarzschild radius. Since R= D/2, then A=4π (D/2)^2 = π D^2. So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the entropy is ~6e106 J/K, but the options are way smaller.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the distance. Wait, the distance is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters, so 1e10 parsec is 3.086e26 meters. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the entropy using the area in square centimeters or another unit, but I don't think that would help. The units should all be in SI.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I didn't account for the fact that the angular size is measured as the apparent size, not the actual size. But I think I did that correctly by using θ_rad * d = D.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the exponents more carefully.

Wait, numerator: A c^3 =9.11e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3 =27e24 m³/s³.

So 9.11e15 *27e24 = (9.11 *27 )e(15+24) = 245.97e39 = 2.4597e41.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G * k_B =3.8808e-67.

So S=2.4597e41 /3.8808e-67 = (2.4597/3.8808) * 1e(41 +67) )= 0.633 *1e108 =6.33e107 J/K.

Wait, that's 6.33e107 J/K. Which is 6.3e107, so about 1e108. None of the options match, so perhaps the question intended something else.

Wait, maybe the question uses a different formula, such as S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) *k_B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the entropy to be calculated using the radius instead of the diameter.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I used the diameter when I should have used the radius.

Wait, no, because the area is correctly computed as π D², which equals 4π R² where R is the radius.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as using the area as calculated from the Schwarzschild radius using the mass, and using M = (c^2 d θ)/(4 G ) or something similar.

Wait, let me try that.

M = (c^2 d θ )/(4 G ), where θ is in radians.

So,

θ=1e-17 degrees =1e-17 *pi/180 ≈1.745e-19 rad.

d=3.086e26 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

G=6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So,

M = (3e8^2 *3.086e26 *1.745e-19 )/(4 *6.674e-11 )

Compute numerator:

3e8^2 =9e16.

9e16 *3.086e26 =2.777e43.

2.777e43 *1.745e-19 =4.848e24.

Denominator:4 *6.674e-11=2.6696e-10.

So,

M=4.848e24 /2.6696e-10 = 1.815e34 kg.

1 solar mass is 1.989e30 kg, so M=1.815e34 /1.989e30 ≈9.12e3 M_sun.

So R_s=2 G M/(c^2 ). Plugging in M=9.12e3 M_sun.

R_s =2.95e3 m *9.12e3 =2.68e7 m.

Area A=4pi R_s^2=4pi (2.68e7)^2 =4pi *7.18e14 =8.99e15 m².

So same as before.

So S=6e107 J/K.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question has a typo, but more likely I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), which is the same as earlier.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the exponents of the denominator. Let me recheck.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G *k_B.

Which is 4 *1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 *1.38e-23.

Compute 1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 =7.0e-45.

7.0e-45 *1.38e-23=9.66e-68.

Multiply by 4: 3.86e-67.

So denominator=3.86e-67.

Numerator=2.45e41.

So S=2.45e41 /3.86e-67 =6.34e107 J/K.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the beginning steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the entropy to be calculated using the formula S = 10^something, and perhaps I should reconsider the initial steps for any missing factors.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the Schwarzschild radius.

R_s = 2 G M / c^2.

The entropy is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), and A=4 pi R_s^2.

So,

S = (k_B c^3 *4 pi R_s^2 )/(4 ħ G ) )= (k_B pi c^3 R_s^2 )/( ħ G )

But R_s = 2 G M/c^2 → R_s^2 =4 G^2 M²/c^4.

Substituting:

S = (k_B pi c^3 *4 G^2 M² / c^4 ) / ( ħ G )

Simplify:

= (4 pi k_B G^2 M² c^3 )/( ħ G c^4 )

= (4 pi k_B G M² )/( ħ c )

Hmm, perhaps this approach would be more manageable.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express M in terms of the given θ and d.

M = (c^2 d theta )/(4 G )

From earlier, M= (c^2 *d *theta_rad )/(4 G )

So,

M=(3e8)^2 *3.086e26 m *1.745e-19 rad / (4 *6.674e-11 )

Which is the same calculation as before, leading to M=9.12e3 M_sun.

So perhaps I'm correct in the calculations, but the options are way off. But that's impossible because the question expects one of the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the entropy using the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), but I should express A in terms of the Schwarzschild area, which is A =8 pi (G M c^-2 )^2.

So,

A=8 pi (G M/c^2 )^2.

So,

S= (k_B c^3 *8 pi (G M/c^2 )^2 )/(4 ħ G )

Simplify:

= (8 pi k_B c^3 G^2 M^2 )/(4 ħ G c^4 )

= (2 pi k_B G M^2 )/( ħ c )

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute S in terms of M.

But since I already have M=9.12e3 M_sun, perhaps I can compute S in terms of M.

Wait, the formula for entropy is S = ( (k_B c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) ) * A.

A =4 pi (2 G M /c^2 )^2 =16 pi G² M²/c^4.

So,

S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * 16 pi G² M^2 / c^4.

Simplify:

= (k_B c^3 *16 pi G² M^2 )/(4 ħ G c^4 )

= (4 pi k_B G M^2 )/( ħ c )

So S = (4 pi G k_B )/( ħ c ) * M^2.

Now, compute the coefficient:

4 pi G k_B / ( ħ c ) =4 *3.1416 *6.674e-11 *1.38e-23 / (1.054e-34 *3e8 )

Compute numerator:4 *3.1416≈12.566.

12.566 *6.674e-11 ≈8.386e-10.

8.386e-10 *1.38e-23 ≈1.156e-32.

Denominator:1.054e-34 *3e8 ≈3.163e-26.

So coefficient is 1.156e-32 /3.163e-26 ≈3.65e-7.

So S ≈3.65e-7 * M^2.

Now, M=9.12e3 M_sun.

But M_sun is 1.989e30 kg, so M=9.12e3 *1.989e30 =1.814e34 kg.

So,

S≈3.65e-7 * (1.814e34 )^2.

(1.814e34 )^2 =3.29e68.

3.65e-7 *3.29e68 =1.198e62 J/K.

So about 1e62 J/K.

Which corresponds to option A) 1e62 J/K.

Ah! So that's the correct answer. I must have made a mistake earlier in the calculation of the entropy, probably in the denominator. So the correct answer is option A) 1e62 J/K.


To determine the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 \hbar G k_B}
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant, \(G\) is the gravitational constant, and \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant. The area \(A\) of the event horizon is given by:

\[
A = \pi D^2
\]

where \(D\) is the diameter of the event horizon. The diameter \(D\) can be calculated using the angular size \(\theta\) and the distance \(d\) to the black hole:

\[
D = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d
\]

### Step 1: Convert \(\theta\) to radians
The angular size is given as \(\theta = 10^{-17}^\circ\). Converting to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the diameter \(D\)
The distance to the black hole is \(d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs}\). Converting parsecs to meters:

\[
1 \, \text{parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}, \quad d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

The diameter is:

\[
D = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.386 \times 10^{7} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area \(A\)
The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = \pi D^2 = \pi (5.386 \times 10^{7})^2 \approx \pi \cdot 2.899 \times 10^{15} \approx 9.11 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the entropy \(S\)
Substitute \(A = 9.11 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2\) into the entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 \hbar G k_B}.
\]

The constants are:
- \(c = 3 \times 10^{8} \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\),
- \(G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}\),
- \(k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\).

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
A c^3 = (9.11 \times 10^{15}) \cdot (3 \times 10^{8})^3 = (9.11 \times 10^{15}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{24}) \approx 2.4597 \times 10^{40} \, \text{m}^5 \, \text{s}^{-3}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \hbar G k_B = 4 \cdot (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (1.380649 \times 10^{-23}).
\]

Step-by-step:
1. \(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} = 7.033 \times 10^{-45}\),
2. \(7.033 \times 10^{-45} \cdot 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} = 9.702 \times 10^{-68}\),
3. \(4 \cdot 9.702 \times 10^{-68} = 3.8808 \times 10^{-67}\).

Finally, calculate \(S\):

\[
S = \frac{2.4597 \times 10^{40}}{3.8808 \times 10^{-67}} \approx 6.33 \times 10^{106} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 5: Reconcile with the options
The calculated entropy is \(S \approx 6.33 \times 10^{106} \, \text{J/K}\), which is far larger than the given options. To resolve this discrepancy, we re-express the entropy in terms of the black hole's mass \(M\). The mass is derived from the Schwarzschild radius:

\[
R_s = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}, \quad M = \frac{R_s c^2}{2 G}.
\]

Using \(D = 4 G M / c^2\), we find \(M \approx 9.12 \times 10^3 M_\odot\). Substituting \(M\) into the entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{4 \pi G k_B}{\hbar c} M^2.
\]

After recalculating, the entropy is found to be approximately \(S \approx 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\), which matches option **A**.

ANSWER: A
