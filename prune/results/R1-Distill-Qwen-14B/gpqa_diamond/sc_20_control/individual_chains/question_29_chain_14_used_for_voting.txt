Okay, so I've got this question about barley genetics and mutations. Hmm, let's try to unpack this.

The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis. They sequenced the mutants and found changes in the first exon area.

I need to figure out which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound. I think this means the mutation should disrupt the gene's function—so probably a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the protein significantly.

Looking at the options, let's compare each mutant to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact, the first part is ATGTTT... in intact; mutant 1 has ATGTTCTA... Wait, wait. Let me look at the exact changes. Let me write down the segments.

Intact: ATGTTTCT C GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTA CGC TGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Hmm, so in the first part, the intact has TTTCTC, while mutant1 has TTCTAC. Wait, maybe I should look for where the mutations are.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the exact mutations.

Wait, let me think about the reading frame. The start codon is at the beginning, so a mutation that changes the reading frame early on could cause a frameshift, leading to a premature stop.

Alternatively, a substitution that creates a stop codon early would also truncate the protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:

Original: ...TTCTCGC...
Mutant: ...TTCTACG...
Wait, or maybe looking at the exact nucleotides:

Wait, the first part of the intact is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, the first part after ATG is TTTCTC in intact? Or wait, the first segment is ATG, then TTTCTC, then GCT, etc. Let me compare.

Wait, the intact is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GT…

Mutant 1: ATG T T C T A C G C T GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GC…

Wait, perhaps the mutation in mutant 1 is a substitution in the third nucleotide. Let me count the letters.

Intact: positions 1-20 maybe.

Wait, maybe another approach: for each mutant, see if the mutation leads to a stop codon, or a frameshift.

Alternatively, looking for a change in the reading frame that introduces a stop codon early.

Alternatively, a nonsense mutation (creates a stop codon) would be a good candidate.

Let me see each mutant:

Mutant 1:

Change in the 6th position? Let me line them up. Let's see the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GT...

Mutant 1: ATG T T C T A C G C T GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GC...

Wait, perhaps it's better to see where the change occurs.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So the original after 'TTCT' is CGCTGG, but in mutant1, it's CGCTGG? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me look for the exact letters.

At the first point of change: In the first exon, the intact sequence has "CTCGCTGGTACT". Mutant1 has "CTACGCTGGTACT".

Wait, so the part after ATG is:

Intact: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant1: TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So the first 6 nucleotides in the intact are TTTCTC.

In mutant1, it's TTCTAC.

Wait, let me write the letters:

Intact: positions 4-9: T T C T C G

Mutant1: positions 4-9: T T C T A C

So, in position 6 (counting from 4 as 1?), the G in the intact is changed to A.

Wait, maybe the mutation is at position 6, changing C to A? No, wait, let me see:

Wait, perhaps the first part is:

Intact: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T ... 

Mutant1: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T ... 

So, comparing the two, the first three are TTT, and in mutant1 they're TTC. Wait, no, the first part.

Wait, maybe I should look for where the mutations are.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to look for the presence of a stop codon in each mutant.

The sequence is read in triplets, starting from the start codon (ATG).

So, let's take each mutant's sequence and see if any triplet becomes a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA).

Let me try for each mutant:

Intact gene:

First few triplets:

ATG (start), TTT, CTC, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, C AT AT TTA T TG TGT CGT… TGA.

But wait, the last part is ...TGA, which is a stop codon. So the intact gene has a stop at the end.

If a mutation creates a stop codon earlier, the protein will be truncated.

So for each mutant, I need to look for any triplet that becomes a stop codon before the original stop.

Mutant 1:

Sequence: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T GAA C ATA TTT ATT GTC GC...

Wait, let's split into triplets:

ATG, TTT, CTA, CGC, TGG, TAC, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATT, TGT, CG (wait, maybe not, because the length is 3 letters each time).

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire sequence of the mutant and split into triplets.

Wait, the intact is: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA C AT AT TTA T TG TGT CGT TGA.

Wait, but for Mutant 1, the sequence is:

ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Wait, maybe I should write the entire sequence as a string and split into codons.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see where the mutations are and whether they create a stop earlier.

Maybe the approach is to look for where the mutations occur and whether they cause a frameshift or a substitution that creates a stop.

Mutant 1:

The first part of the sequence after ATG is T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GC...

Wait, let me see the exact change:

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So in the original, after TTT comes CTC (so the next triplet is CTC). In mutant1, after TTT comes TCT (so the next triplet is TCT?), wait, no. Wait, the length might have changed, but I think EMS causes point mutations, not indels, so the reading frame isn't shifted. So it's a substitution, not a frameshift.

Wait, but how can I be sure? Oh, because the question says "changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area." So maybe they substituted some nucleotides but didn't change the reading frame length.

So for each mutant, we can check whether the substitution introduces a stop codon.

Let me list each mutant's sequence and see if any codon becomes a stop.

Mutant 1:

Looking at the original and the mutant:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the triplet after ATG (start) is TTT in original, which codes for Phe. Then CTC is next, which is Leu.

In mutant1, first triplet is TTC (Phe), next is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), etc.

So, no stop codons introduced.

So, no early stop in Mutant1.

Mutant2:

Sequence: ATG TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

So, let's see:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant2: TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the triplets after ATG are TTC (Phe), then TAA (stop codon), then GCT (Ala), etc.

Wait, so the second codon after the start is TAA, which is a stop codon. So this would cause the protein to terminate early, truncating it. Possibly making it nonfunctional, which would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

So this might be a good candidate.

Wait, but let me check the other mutants.

Mutant3:

Sequence: ATG TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, the original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: TT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps it's:

After ATG, the triplet is TTT (Phe), then TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), etc.

Wait, let me see the exact changes.

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GT CAC TTCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps the change is in the third codon. Looking at the part:

Original has ...CTC GCT...

Mutant3: ...TAC GCT...

So the triplet after CTC is GCT in the original. In mutant3, it's TAC, so the first part would be:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp)... etc.

In mutant3, perhaps the triplet after CTC is TAC.

Wait, perhaps the original has:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GT CAC TTCT GTG GAT...

Wait, maybe the structure is a bit off, but let's see the triplets in Mutant3.

ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, GGT, GT (wait, that's only two letters), no, perhaps it's ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, GGT, GTC, etc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to find where the stop codons are.

In Mutant3, after ATG, do any of the codons become stop? Let me see:

After ATG, the triplets are TTT, TAC, GCT, GGT, GT CAC... Hmm, TAC is Tyr, GCT is Ala, etc. Doesn't look like a stop codon.

So, no stop in Mutant3.

Mutant4:

Sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Looking at the sequence:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, the triplet after TTT is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr), etc. So, the codons are TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT...

No stop codons here either. So the only mutant with a stop codon in the early sequence is Mutant2.

So, the correct answer should be Mutant2, which has a TAA codon (TAA is a stop), which would lead to a truncated protein, possibly nonfunctional, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or significantly alters the protein structure (e.g., frameshift). Since EMS mutagenesis typically causes point mutations rather than frameshifts, we focus on identifying stop codons introduced in the sequence.

### Intact Gene Sequence:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
   - Comparison with the intact gene shows substitutions in the sequence, but no stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) are introduced. The reading frame remains intact, and the protein is unlikely to be truncated.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
   - Comparison reveals that the second codon after the start (ATG) is changed to TAA, which is a stop codon. This introduces a premature termination of the protein, likely rendering it nonfunctional and eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
   - Substitutions are present, but no stop codons are introduced in the sequence. The protein is unlikely to be significantly altered or truncated.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
   - Substitutions occur, but no stop codons are introduced. The reading frame remains intact, and the protein is unlikely to be truncated.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** introduces a stop codon (TAA) early in the sequence, leading to a truncated protein. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
