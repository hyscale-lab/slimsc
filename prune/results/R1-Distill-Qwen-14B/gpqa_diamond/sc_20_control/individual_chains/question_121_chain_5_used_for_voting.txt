Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about reacting a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. That's a mouthful! Let me try to visualize its structure. So, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it's a norbornane structure, right? Norbornane has two rings: a five-membered and a three-membered ring? Wait, no, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have bridges of 4 and 1 carbons, but I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Anyway, the substituents are at positions 1,3,4, and 6. So, 1,3,4-trimethyl and an oxygen at position 7 (the epoxide oxygen).

So, the molecule is an epoxide, and epoxides react with organocuprates (like Me2CuLi) in a way where the cuprate acts as a nucleophile. Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack the less hindered carbon in an epoxide. But wait, in a disubstituted epoxide, the attack can lead to inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks.

Wait, the question says that when saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. So the cuprate will open the epoxide by adding its methyl group (since it's Me2CuLi) to the less hindered carbon. Then, the other part of the epoxide will take the hydroxide, but I'm not sure if that's a part of the product here.

Alternatively, in the opening of epoxides with organocuprates, the mechanism is a ring-opening where the cuprate attacks the less substituted, less hindered carbon, leading to the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, which then gets protonated.

Wait, another thing: the problem says that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile (Nu) is added. So, when the Nu (the methyl from the cuprate) attacks, the configuration at that carbon flips.

So, the starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S). Let's think about the structure. The bicyclo system has the epoxide oxygen at position 7, which is the bridgehead. Wait, no, bridgehead in bicyclo systems can't have epoxides because bridgehead epoxides are not possible due to Bredt's rule? Or is that only for certain systems? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have the oxygen in a bridge. So, positions 1 and 7 are connected, making an epoxide. So, the molecule is a bicyclo structure where the epoxide is between, say, C1 and C6, maybe? Wait, the numbering is 1R,3R,4R,6S. So, C1 is one bridgehead, C6 is another bridgehead. The oxygen is at C7? Wait, no, 7-oxa means the oxygen is at position 7. So, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is a 7-membered bicyclic system with bridges of 4 and 1 carbons. Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me try to draw it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is similar to norbornene but with an epoxide. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, but here it's [4.1.0], so maybe a different arrangement.

But perhaps I should focus less on the structure and more on the reaction. The reaction is with Me2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile. The epoxide will open, and the methyl group will add to the less hindered carbon.

In the given molecule, the epoxide is between two carbons. Which one is more substituted? The question says that the methyl is added to the less hindered carbon. So I need to determine which carbon is less hindered in the epoxide.

Wait, the starting molecule is 1,3,4-trimethyl. So, perhaps the epoxide is between C1 and another carbon. If C1 is already substituted with a methyl group (since it's 1R), then the other carbon in the epoxide might be at position 6 (since the 6 is S configuration). So, the epoxide is between C1 and C6.

So, when the cuprate attacks, it will choose the less substituted carbon. If C1 has a methyl group and is R configuration, and C6 is S, which one is less hindered?

Alternatively, maybe the two carbons of the epoxide are each connected to other substituents. So, if the epoxide is between two bridgehead carbons, each might have some substituents. The question states that the product's configuration inverts at the carbon where the Nu is added.

So, perhaps the methyl adds to one carbon, and the configuration inverts there. So, let me try to imagine the transition state. The nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, leading to the opening of the epoxide with inversion at that carbon.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the product. The options are all cyclohexanol derivatives. The starting material is a bicyclo system, but the product is a cyclohexane ring. So, maybe the bicyclo ring is opening up upon reaction. Wait, when the epoxide opens with a nucleophile, the ring might open into a larger ring, like cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo system is converted into a cyclohexanol structure. So the product is a cyclohexane with four methyl groups (since the starting material is trimethyl, but the product has four methyl groups—so maybe the addition brings another methyl from the cuprate).

So the product is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexanol or similar. Looking at the options, they all are 2,2,4,5 or 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl, etc.

Wait, the starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So after the reaction, which positions will have methyl groups, and what will their configurations be?

When the cuprate attacks the less hindered carbon, let's say the attack is on C1. Since C1 is R, then the attack would cause inversion, making it S. But wait, the starting configuration is 1R, and if it inverts, then it becomes S. But the options don't seem to have all that. Alternatively, perhaps the attack is on another position.

Wait, maybe the epoxide is between C1 and another carbon, but the other carbon (say, C6) is more substituted. So, the cuprate would attack the less substituted, which is perhaps C6? Because if C1 is already substituted with a methyl, then C6 might be less substituted. Or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack is on the less substituted carbon of the epoxide. So, the methyl from the cuprate adds to the less hindered carbon, which could be the one with fewer substituents.

Wait, perhaps in the starting material, the epoxide is between C1 and C2 in the bicyclo structure. So, if C1 is a bridgehead with methyl groups, then C2 might be less substituted, so the cuprate attacks C2.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the outcome. The product is a cyclohexanol, which suggests the bicyclo ring has opened into a six-membered ring.

So, when the epoxide opens, the two carbons that were connected by the epoxide (C1 and C6, perhaps) become adjacent in the cyclohexane ring. Wait, no, maybe it's C1 and C2 that become adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe the ring opens by adding the methyl across the epoxide, leading to the cyclohexane structure.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the mechanism.

Epoxide ring opening with organocuprates typically involves a two-step process. First, the cuprate (which is a strong base) deprotonates the epoxide, but wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the cuprate's methyl group acts as a nucleophile, attacking the less hindered epoxide carbon.

The attack occurs in such a way that the nucleophile adds to the less substituted carbon, leading to a trans addition. Wait, no, organocuprates typically do a ring-opening with anti addition because of the mechanism. Or is it a concerted process?

Wait, the mechanism for epoxide ring-opening by organocuprates is a two-step process. First, the cuprate's methyl attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, leading to the opening of the epoxide oxygen, which then gets an oxygen with a negative charge. Then, a protonation step occurs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that when the methyl adds to the less substituted (less hindered) carbon, the addition is such that the configuration inverts at that carbon.

So, in the starting material, the configuration at the carbon where the methyl adds will invert.

So, the starting material has specific stereochemistry: 1R,3R,4R,6S.

So, after the reaction, the configuration at the attack site will flip.

So, for example, if the methyl adds to C1, which was R, it becomes S.

But the product options have various configurations.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol

Option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol

Option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol 

Option D: (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol 

Hmm. So, the product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups attached. So, the reaction adds a methyl from the cuprate to the epoxide, leading to a new carbon structure.

Wait, but the starting molecule is a bicyclo, and the product is a cyclohexane. So, perhaps the bicyclo is opening into a six-membered ring.

So, the epoxide (O) is in the bridge. So, when the cuprate opens it, one of the bridge bonds breaks, and the ring becomes a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridge remains, but the epoxide opens, leading to a new structure.

But perhaps the key is to determine which carbon the methyl adds to and the resulting configuration changes.

Let me think again about the starting material: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.

So, the substituents on the bicyclo system are methyl groups at 1,3,4. The oxygen is at 7.

So, the epoxide is between C1 and C7? Or C6 and C7? Wait, the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has seven carbons. So, the structure is bicyclo with a bridge of four carbons and another bridge of one carbon.

I think the actual structure is such that the epoxide is between two bridgehead carbons, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is between C6 and C7. Hmm, perhaps I should practice drawing this.

Wait, considering the numbering: the 7-oxa is the epoxide oxygen, so it's at position 7. So, the bridge is between C1 and C6 (if the bicyclo is [4.1.0]heptane, which might have 7 carbons in total, with bridges of 4 and 1). So, the epoxide is between C1 and C6, and the oxygen is at position 7.

So, C1 is connected to C6 via an oxygen bridge (epoxide). So, the structure is like a bridge between C1 and C6, where the bridge is an oxygen.

So, when Me2CuLi is added, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack either C1 or C6.

Which of these is less hindered? If C1 is already substituted with a methyl (since it's 1R, trimethyl), perhaps C6 is less substituted, so the attack would be on C6.

But wait, the starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So, C6 has an S configuration. If the methyl adds to C6, then the configuration at C6 would invert.

So, if before the attack, C6 is S configuration, then after the attack, it becomes R.

But looking at the options, the product is a cyclohexanol, so perhaps the ring opens into a six-membered ring with an OH group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening where the epoxide oxygen becomes an alcohol (since the cuprate adds methyl to one carbon, and the other oxygen becomes -OH in the product. Or maybe the hydroxyl is formed after the ring opens.

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanism is such that the cuprate attacks one carbon, and then the other oxygen becomes an alkoxy group that eventually gets protonated to an -OH.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider the possible products.

The starting material is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with epoxide at 7. The reaction adds a methyl group to the less hindered carbon. Let's say that's C6.

So, methyl adds to C6, which was originally S configuration. After attack, it becomes R.

So, the configuration at C6 flips from S to R.

Now, the product is a cyclohexanol derivative. So the ring opens, and the OH is on a particular carbon.

Wait, perhaps the position of the OH would be on the carbon that was part of the epoxide. So if the cuprate attacks C6, then the other part of the epoxide (C1) would form the OH group.

Wait, but the product is an alcohol. So, perhaps after adding methyl to C6, the other oxygen becomes an -OH, but where?

Alternatively, the ring opens, and the two carbons (C1 and C6) become adjacent, and the methyl is on C6, and the OH is on C1.

But the product is a cyclohexanol, which would have the OH on a specific carbon.

Alternatively, the ring opening would create a new six-membered ring, and the OH would be on a different position.

Wait, perhaps the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is norbornane-like. When the epoxide opens, the bridge is broken, and the ring becomes a cyclohexane.

So, for example, if the epoxide is between C1 and C6, opening the ring by adding methyl to C6 might result in the formation of a cyclohexane ring where the former C1 and C6 are now adjacent, and the OH is on another position.

But I'm not getting the exact structure. Maybe I should think about the configuration changes.

In the starting material, the configuration at C6 is S. After attack by the nucleophile (methyl adds to C6), the configuration inverts to R. So, in the product, C6 (now part of the cyclohexane) would be R.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones have R configuration at that position.

Option A: (1S,4R,5S). So, positions 1,4,5 are S, R, S.

Option B: (1R,4R,5R). So, all R at 1,4,5.

Option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R). So, positions 1,2,4,5 are R.

Option D: (1R,2S,4R,5R). So, 1R, 2S, 4R,5R.

Wait, perhaps the product has a new methyl group added in a specific position, leading to four methyl groups: the original three (1,3,4) plus the new one from the cuprate.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is 1,3,4-trimethyl. The product is tetramethyl, so the cuprate adds a methyl group. So, the product would have four methyl groups in total.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl. So, methyl groups on carbons 2 (two of them), 4,5.

Option B: 2,2,4,5.

Option C: 1,2,4,5.

Option D: 1,2,4,5.

Hmm. So, the positions vary. So, the product must have four methyl groups added.

But the initial structure had methyl groups at 1,3,4. Wait, 3 and 4 are in the bicyclo, but in the product, perhaps some of these positions are now different.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering in the product is different because the ring has opened.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexane with substituents at 1,2,4,5. Let's see.

If the cuprate adds to C6, then in the product, that becomes a new substituent.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible product structures.

Another approach: the starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's imagine the structure as a bicyclo with methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4. The epoxide is between C1 and C6.

When the cuprate attacks the less hindered carbon, which is C6, because C1 has a methyl group (so it's more substituted). So, methyl adds to C6, which was S configuration, so after attack, it becomes R.

The other carbon, C1, which was R configuration, would have the oxygen. Then, after ring-opening, the structure becomes a cyclohexane, but where?

Wait, perhaps the attack on C6 and the ring opening would lead to the formation of a cyclohexanol where the OH is on C5 or C1, depending on the attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack on C6 and the ring opening leads to the new substituents being arranged in such a way that the product has four methyl groups, including the added one.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexane where the methyl groups are on positions 2,2,4,5. So, two methyl groups on C2, and one each on C4 and C5.

Which option matches that? Options A and B are 2,2,4,5.

Option A: (1S,4R,5S) → 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl.

Option B: (1R,4R,5R) → same.

So, the configurations would determine which one is correct.

In the starting material, the attack occurs at C6, which flips its configuration from S to R.

But in the product, C6 would be part of the cyclohexane. Wait, maybe the product's numbering is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's substituents are at 2,2,4,5. So, which option has that?

Options A and B both have 2,2,4,5.

So, the next step is to determine the configuration at each chiral center in the product.

In the starting material, the configuration at C6 was S. After the attack by the cuprate, which adds methyl to C6, the configuration becomes R.

But in the product, where would that R configuration end up?

Assuming the product is a cyclohexane, perhaps C6 in the starting material corresponds to C5 in the product.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mapping of the carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering in the product is such that the former C1 becomes C1 in the product, and the other carbons are renumbered.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's structure is such that C1 in the starting material becomes C1 in the product, and the new methyl is added to C2.

Wait, it's getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think in terms of stereochemistry.

The starting material's C6 is S. After attack, it becomes R. So, in the product, wherever C6 maps, it should be R.

Looking at option B: (1R,4R,5R). So, all three positions are R. That would fit if the C6 becomes R in the product and maps to, say, C5.

But this is just speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the product has four chiral centers, and their configuration depends on the attack.

Wait, the product options:

Option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R) → four R configurations.

Option D: (1R,2S,4R,5R).

So, if the attack flips the configuration, which leads to R at the attacked carbon, perhaps the product has R at that position.

Hmm. Another point: when the cuprate attacks, the nucleophile adds to the less hindered carbon, leading to a trans addition. Wait, no, organocuprates typically add in a way that the nucleophile adds to the less hindered, and the ring opens with inversion.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is such that the addition is anti to the leaving group (the oxygen), leading to trans addition across the epoxide.

But I'm not entirely clear. Maybe I should think about the possible products based on the options.

Option C has four R configurations. So, if the attack leads to R configuration at the attacked carbon and the existing R configurations are retained, perhaps that's the case.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps the correct product is option C.

Wait, another approach: if the starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S), and the methyl adds to C6, which was S, making it R. So, in the product, the configuration at that position is R.

Looking at the product options, option C has all R's except maybe one.

Alternatively, perhaps after the ring opens, the configuration at C1 (starting) remains as R, and the new methyl's position (say, C2) is R.

Wait, perhaps the product has four chiral centers: 1,2,4,5. So, options C and D have four chiral centers.

If the new methyl is added to C2, and the configuration at C2 is R, then option C would have 2R, leading to all R's. Option D has 2S.

But why would the configuration be R or S?

Wait, perhaps the attack occurs in a way that the new methyl adds to the less substituted carbon, which is C2.

Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclo, so perhaps the product's C2 corresponds to the starting C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's C2 is where the methyl was added, and the configuration there is R because of the inversion.

So, in the product, positions 1,2,4,5 are R. That would make option C the correct choice.

Wait, but let's think about the starting material's configuration: 1R,3R,4R,6S.

After the methyl adds to C6 (which was S), it becomes R. So, in the product, perhaps C5 is the former C6, and thus R.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should rely on the fact that the product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.

If the methyl adds to the less hindered carbon (C6), and the configuration inverts, leading to R at C6, which in the product is perhaps C5.

So, in the product, C5 is R.

Looking at the options, options B and C have 5R.

Wait, but options A and B have 5S and 5R respectively.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is option C because it has four R's, which would make sense if the attack occurred at a carbon that was S and became R, and the others were already R.

Wait, the starting material has 1R,3R,4R,6S. The product has four methyl groups. So, the new methyl is added to C6 (which was S), making it R. The original methyl groups at 1,3,4 are now in the product, but perhaps some positions are renumbered.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's chiral centers are 1,2,4,5.

If the new methyl is at position 2, and the configuration at 2 is R, then option C is (1R,2R,4R,5R), which would fit.

Alternatively, if the configuration at 2 is S, then option D.

Wait, perhaps the attack on C6 leads to the new methyl being at C2 in the product, and the configuration inverts from S to R. Thus, the product would have R at C2, which is option C.

So, putting it all together, the product would have R configurations at 1,2,4,5, making option C the correct answer.

When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile (Nu) is added. The given compound, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, is a bicyclic epoxide with methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4, and an epoxide oxygen at position 7. The reaction with Me₂CuLi introduces a methyl group at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, leading to inversion of configuration at that carbon.

The epoxide is between C1 and C6 in the bicyclic structure. C1 is more substituted due to the methyl group, making C6 the less hindered carbon. The methyl group from Me₂CuLi attacks C6, inverting its configuration from S to R. The ring-opening of the epoxide results in the formation of a cyclohexane derivative with a hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1, which is protonated to form an alcohol.

The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups: the original three from the starting material (positions 1, 3, and 4) and the new methyl group added at C6 (now mapped to C2 in the product). The configurations at the chiral centers are determined as follows:
- C1 retains its R configuration.
- C2, where the methyl group is added, becomes R due to inversion.
- C4 retains its R configuration.
- C5, corresponding to the original C6, becomes R after inversion.

Thus, the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which matches option C.

Answer: C
