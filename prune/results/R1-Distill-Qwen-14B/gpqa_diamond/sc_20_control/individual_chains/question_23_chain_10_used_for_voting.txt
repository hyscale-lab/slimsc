Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. So, I need to figure out what the products are based on the options given.

First, let me try to draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Breaking this down, the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached to it. The other part is a butenyl group. Let's see, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. But wait, but has four carbons, so numbering starts from the end where the substituent is attached. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3 because the numbering starts from the point of attachment. Wait, maybe I should write it out.

The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the substituents are on C2, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be right because but has four carbons. Let me count. If the group is 1-yl, then the attachment is on C1. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with substituents. Wait, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, meaning on the second carbon.

Wait, so the structure of the substituent is:

1 - 2 - 3 - 4

But the group is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. The structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, let me try again. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that doesn't make sense because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's four carbons. Wait, but the substituents are on C2, so the structure is:

CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the main chain is four carbons, with a double bond starting at C3, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's not possible because the position of the double bond in butenyl groups is usually between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure where the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be right because but has only four carbons, so the double bond starts at the third carbon, which would be the third from where the chain starts.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. The substituent is attached via the first carbon. So, the substituent is: 

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), so it's:

CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but only has four carbons, so the substituent would be:

O
|
CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 ?

No, wait, it's but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with methyl groups on the second carbon. So:

The substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that's but-3-en-1-yl? Let me count: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH(CH3)2?), no, wait, 2,2-dimethyl means two methyl groups on C2. So, the substituent is:

CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C3 and C4. So that would make it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, which is impossible because that would require five carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look up the structure of but-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be:

The substituent is attached at carbon 1. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH=CH2

Wait, but that's but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. But but only has four carbons, so carbon 4 is the end. So it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But in that case, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, no, that's not correct. Maybe the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, no, that's not possible. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me move on and come back to the structure later.

The starting material is an ether, specifically a benzene ring connected via an oxygen to a butenyl group. When it's treated with HBr, I think about possible reactions. The options are that the double bond might undergo acid-catalyzed addition or perhaps some kind of substitution.

Wait, but the reaction is between an ether and HBr. Ethers are generally not very reactive towards HBr unless there's a good leaving group, like in an SN2 reaction, but ethers are usually not that reactive. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in the substituent is undergoing a reaction, like an acid-catalyzed addition.

Wait, the substituent is a butenyl group. So if the starting material is an ether with a double bond in the substituent (the butenyl group), then reacting with HBr could lead to the addition of H and Br across the double bond.

But wait, the structure is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the substituent has a double bond between C3 and C4? So the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between... Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2? No, that can't be because but-3-en-1-yl would have the substituent CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that doesn't have the methyl groups.

Ah, wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is:

Carbon 1: attached to the oxygen. So structure is:

O
|
CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2

Wait, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the correct structure would be:

O
|
CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 

Wait no, that can't be right because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, which in a four-carbon chain would be the last two carbons, so the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with methyl groups on C2. So, substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2 ?

Wait, but how does that work with the double bond? Because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but the substituent is on C2. So perhaps the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, that would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as follows:

The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, meaning the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon (as it's 2,2-dimethyl). So:

O
|
CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2

Wait, but this would give substituent as CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 ?

Wait, that seems correct. Now, when this reacts with HBr, what happens?

HBr is a strong acid and a source of H+ and Br-. The substituent has a double bond, so possible reactions include addition or perhaps some kind of substitution.

But ethers are generally not very reactive towards HBr. However, if the substituent is an allyl group, perhaps the HBr can add to the double bond via an acid-catalyzed addition mechanism. Or maybe there's a possibility of ring formation if the double bond is in a position that allows it.

Wait, another possibility: the ether could undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage. Wait, but in what conditions? Typically, strong acids can cleave ethers, but I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, the substituent's double bond could undergo addition.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be, because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, which is the case when the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So with the substituents on C2, it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that position would have a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, because the question says but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the reaction. The starting material is an ether with a butenyl substituent. Reacting with HBr, which is a source of H+ and Br-.

If the substituent has a double bond, perhaps the HBr adds across the double bond. The addition could be either via an acid-catalyzed mechanism, leading to a bromide on one end and a hydrogen on the other.

In such a situation, the double bond would open up, and the Br would attach to one of the carbons, and H to the other. The question is, which position would the Br add to?

The substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 (if but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, with methyl groups on C2). The addition of HBr would likely follow anti-Markovnikov orientation, as H+ would protonate the less substituted carbon (in case of an acid-catalyzed addition). Alternatively, if it's a radical addition, the Br might add to the more substituted carbon, but I think in this case, the acid-catalyzed addition would be more likely.

Wait, but in an acid-catalyzed addition, the H+ adds to the less substituted carbon, and Br- adds to the more substituted. So in the substituent CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, with a double bond between which carbons? Wait, maybe the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So the substituent would be:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Now, adding HBr to the double bond. The double bond is between C4 and C5? Wait, no, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, meaning the substituent is four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to number the substituent as follows:

The substituent is 1 (CH2), 2 (C(CH3)2), 3 (CH2?), and 4 (CH2?), but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2.

Wait, that makes sense. So substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2.

So when you add HBr to a double bond, the H adds to one carbon and Br to the other, typically in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. So the Br would add to the more substituted carbon.

In this case, the double bond is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2.

So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So when HBr adds, H+ would protonate the less substituted carbon, which is C4, and Br- would add to C3.

Wait, no. In an acid-catalyzed addition, the H+ adds to the less substituted carbon (the less substituted end of the double bond), and the Br adds to the more substituted carbon.

Wait, for example, in propene, CH2=CH2, adding HBr would give CH2Br-CH22. But that's Markovnikov's rule, where the Br adds to the more substituted carbon.

Wait, anti-Markovnikov addition would be the reverse. But wait, in acid-catalyzed addition, it's Markovnikov orientation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think: Markovnikov's rule says that the Br adds to the carbon with more hydrogens, which in the case of propene would be the middle carbon.

Wait, but in the substituent, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So C3 is connected to C2 (which has two methyl groups and a CH2 group), and C4 is connected to CH2.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure:

The substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So when HBr adds, the H would add to the less substituted carbon (C4), and Br to the more substituted carbon (C3). So the product would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2.

But wait, that's if the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the substituent after addition would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3?

No, wait, because the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr would give CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, wait, no. H adds to one carbon, Br to the other.

Wait, perhaps the substituent becomes CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br, but I think that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe it's an allylic bromination, but that usually requires peroxides and light, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the double bond could undergo an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, leading to a cyclic bromide. But that seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is a diene, but no, it's a monoene.

Alternatively, could the reaction be an acid-catalyzed elimination, but that doesn't make sense because HBr is a source of H+ and Br-, which is more about addition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an allylic bromination. In allylic bromination, HBr adds across the double bond, leading to a bromide. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another approach: The reaction could be a substitution. But the substituent is an ether, and substitution would require a good leaving group. However, the oxygen in the ether isn't a good leaving group unless under specific conditions, which may not be the case here.

Alternatively, if the substituent's double bond is part of a cyclic structure, maybe it could form a cyclic product upon addition, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the double bond, leading to two different products.

Wait, but the TLC shows two new spots, meaning two products. So the reaction produces two products, perhaps from different positions of addition.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a conjugated diene, but no, the question states it's but-3-en-1-yl, which is a monoene.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that the addition can occur in two different positions, leading to two products.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has two different possible sites for the addition of HBr, leading to two different products.

Wait, but if the substituent has a symmetric structure, maybe adding HBr in different positions would give the same product.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't addition but something else. Wait, the starting material is an ether with a substituent that has a double bond. Maybe the double bond can undergo some kind of ring-forming reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a di-substituted alkene, which upon addition of HBr would give two different products.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look at the options.

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. Wait, these are phenol derivatives with substituents in the 2 and 4 positions. But the starting material is an ether, so how would it become a phenol? Unless the ether oxygen is converted into an alcohol. But that would require some kind of cleavage, which I'm not sure about with HBr.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So one product is a brominated ether, and the other is a different ether with a double bond shifted. Hmm, perhaps one product is the result of HBr adding to the double bond, and the other is an isomerization.

Wait, but if the starting substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, and after adding HBr, it becomes 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy, then perhaps that's one product. The other product might be an isomer where the double bond has shifted, perhaps via some mechanism.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures look more like cyclic ethers or other ring structures. Chromane is a bicyclic structure, and dihydrobenzofuran is a furan derivative. But I'm not sure how adding HBr would lead to ring formation unless some kind of cyclization occurs.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both are brominated ethers, but substituted at different positions.

Wait, so the options suggest that the products are ethers where bromine has been added at different positions.

But how would bromine get added to the substituent?

If the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, and HBr adds to the double bond, then let's think about the addition. The double bond is between C3 and C4, and the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr would result in CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, that can't be right because HBr would add one H and one Br each to adjacent carbons.

Wait, no, each molecule of HBr adds one H and one Br. So the substituent would become CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, that's not correct. Wait, each HBr adds across the double bond, so each of the two carbons in the double bond would get one H and one Br. Wait, no, no. For a single HBr addition, the H adds to one carbon, and Br to the adjacent, across the double bond.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: structure before reaction is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding HBr would add H to one end and Br to the other, leading to CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? Or perhaps CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br with some H added elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products.

If the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, and HBr adds, then the product would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent becomes CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br, but that doesn't account for the addition.

Wait, maybe the addition is such that the Br could be added at either end, leading to different products. But wait, the substituent is symmetric in some way?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the HBr can add in two different positions, leading to two different products. For example, if the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr could result in Br being added either to C3 or to C4, leading to two different brominated ethers.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent after addition would have Br on different carbons, which would lead to two different products.

So option D has two products: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So the bromine is on C3 and C4 of the substituent.

Alternatively, option B has a product which is a different alkene, perhaps due to a shift in the double bond.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the reaction again.

The starting material is an ether with a butenyl substituent. Reacting with HBr could lead to the addition of H and Br across the double bond, leading to a bromoalkane ether. But if the addition can occur on either end of the double bond, you could get two different products, each with Br on a different carbon.

In the substituent CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, the double bond is between C3 and C4. Adding HBr would give either:

CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br (Br on C4)

or 

CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3 (Br on C3)

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would have Br on C3 or C4, leading to two different products.

Looking at option D, the products are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So the substituent is now a butoxy group with Br on C3 or C4.

So that would fit with the addition of HBr to either end of the double bond, leading to two different brominated ethers.

Alternatively, option B has a product where the double bond has shifted, which might involve some isomerization. But if the starting material is but-3-en-1-yl, after adding HBr, the double bond would be gone, so that's probably not the case.

So perhaps option D is the correct answer. But let me check the options again.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbutoxy, with Br on position 3 or 4.

But the starting substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. After addition of HBr, the substituent would become 2,2-dimethylbut-3-enyl bromide? No, wait, the double bond would be replaced by single bonds with Br and H.

Wait, perhaps the substituent becomes 2,2-dimethylbutyl bromide, with Br at either C3 or C4.

But wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, which after HBr addition would become 2,2-dimethylbutyl with Br at either C3 or C4.

Hmm, I think option D makes sense because adding HBr to a double bond can lead to Br on either adjacent carbon, depending on the addition.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of allylic bromination, but that usually involves different mechanisms.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction isn't addition but substitution. If the substituent is an allyl group, perhaps the Br could substitute the hydrogen at the allylic position.

But I'm not sure about that either.

Alternatively, considering the options, option B has one product as (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and another as ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the second product has a double bond at a different position. Maybe it's an isomerization, but I'm not sure how that would happen with HBr.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement, shifting the double bond.

But I'm not confident about that.

Given the options, I think option D is more plausible because it involves the addition of Br to two different positions in the substituent, leading to two different brominated ethers.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an ether with a butenyl substituent containing a double bond between C3 and C4. Upon reaction with HBr, the double bond undergoes acid-catalyzed addition, where H+ adds to one carbon and Br- adds to the adjacent carbon. This results in two possible products depending on which carbon the bromine attaches to.

The substituent structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding HBr can lead to two products:
1. Bromine adds to C3, resulting in (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.
2. Bromine adds to C4, resulting in (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

This explains the two new spots observed in the TLC analysis, corresponding to these two brominated ether products. 

Option D correctly identifies these two products, making it the most plausible answer. Other options either suggest unrelated transformations (e.g., phenol formation or isomerization) or do not align with the expected reaction mechanism.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. So, I need to figure out what the products are based on the options given.

First, let me try to draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Breaking this down, the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached to it. The other part is a butenyl group. Let's see, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. But wait, but has four carbons, so numbering starts from the end where the substituent is attached. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3 because the numbering starts from the point of attachment. Wait, maybe I should write it out.

The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the substituents are on C2, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be right because but has four carbons. Let me count. If the group is 1-yl, then the attachment is on C1. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with substituents. Wait, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, meaning on the second carbon.

Wait, so the structure of the substituent is:

1 - 2 - 3 - 4

But the group is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. The structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, let me try again. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that doesn't make sense because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's four carbons. Wait, but the substituents are on C2, so the structure is:

CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the main chain is four carbons, with a double bond starting at C3, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's not possible because the position of the double bond in butenyl groups is usually between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure where the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be right because but has only four carbons, so the double bond starts at the third carbon, which would be the third from where the chain starts.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. The substituent is attached via the first carbon. So, the substituent is: 

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), so it's:

CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but only has four carbons, so the substituent would be:

O
|
CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 ?

No, wait, it's but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with methyl groups on the second carbon. So:

The substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that's but-3-en-1-yl? Let me count: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH(CH3)2?), no, wait, 2,2-dimethyl means two methyl groups on C2. So, the substituent is:

CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C3 and C4. So that would make it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, which is impossible because that would require five carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look up the structure of but-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be:

The substituent is attached at carbon 1. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH=CH2

Wait, but that's but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. But but only has four carbons, so carbon 4 is the end. So it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But in that case, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, no, that's not correct. Maybe the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, no, that's not possible. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me move on and come back to the structure later.

The starting material is an ether, specifically a benzene ring connected via an oxygen to a butenyl group. When it's treated with HBr, I think about possible reactions. The options are that the double bond might undergo acid-catalyzed addition or perhaps some kind of substitution.

Wait, but the reaction is between an ether and HBr. Ethers are generally not very reactive towards HBr unless there's a good leaving group, like in an SN2 reaction, but ethers are usually not that reactive. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in the substituent is undergoing a reaction, like an acid-catalyzed addition.

Wait, the substituent is a butenyl group. So if the starting material is an ether with a double bond in the substituent (the butenyl group), then reacting with HBr could lead to the addition of H and Br across the double bond.

But wait, the structure is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the substituent has a double bond between C3 and C4? So the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between... Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2? No, that can't be because but-3-en-1-yl would have the substituent CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that doesn't have the methyl groups.

Ah, wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is:

Carbon 1: attached to the oxygen. So structure is:

O
|
CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2

Wait, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the correct structure would be:

O
|
CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 

Wait no, that can't be right because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, which in a four-carbon chain would be the last two carbons, so the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with methyl groups on C2. So, substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2 ?

Wait, but how does that work with the double bond? Because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but the substituent is on C2. So perhaps the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, that would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as follows:

The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, meaning the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon (as it's 2,2-dimethyl). So:

O
|
CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2

Wait, but this would give substituent as CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 ?

Wait, that seems correct. Now, when this reacts with HBr, what happens?

HBr is a strong acid and a source of H+ and Br-. The substituent has a double bond, so possible reactions include addition or perhaps some kind of substitution.

But ethers are generally not very reactive towards HBr. However, if the substituent is an allyl group, perhaps the HBr can add to the double bond via an acid-catalyzed addition mechanism. Or maybe there's a possibility of ring formation if the double bond is in a position that allows it.

Wait, another possibility: the ether could undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage. Wait, but in what conditions? Typically, strong acids can cleave ethers, but I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, the substituent's double bond could undergo addition.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be, because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, which is the case when the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So with the substituents on C2, it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that position would have a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, because the question says but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the reaction. The starting material is an ether with a butenyl substituent. Reacting with HBr, which is a source of H+ and Br-.

If the substituent has a double bond, perhaps the HBr adds across the double bond. The addition could be either via an acid-catalyzed mechanism, leading to a bromide on one end and a hydrogen on the other.

In such a situation, the double bond would open up, and the Br would attach to one of the carbons, and H to the other. The question is, which position would the Br add to?

The substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 (if but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, with methyl groups on C2). The addition of HBr would likely follow anti-Markovnikov orientation, as H+ would protonate the less substituted carbon (in case of an acid-catalyzed addition). Alternatively, if it's a radical addition, the Br might add to the more substituted carbon, but I think in this case, the acid-catalyzed addition would be more likely.

Wait, but in an acid-catalyzed addition, the H+ adds to the less substituted carbon, and Br- adds to the more substituted. So in the substituent CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, with a double bond between which carbons? Wait, maybe the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So the substituent would be:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Now, adding HBr to the double bond. The double bond is between C4 and C5? Wait, no, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, meaning the substituent is four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to number the substituent as follows:

The substituent is 1 (CH2), 2 (C(CH3)2), 3 (CH2?), and 4 (CH2?), but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2.

Wait, that makes sense. So substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2.

So when you add HBr to a double bond, the H adds to one carbon and Br to the other, typically in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. So the Br would add to the more substituted carbon.

In this case, the double bond is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2.

So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So when HBr adds, H+ would protonate the less substituted carbon, which is C4, and Br- would add to C3.

Wait, no. In an acid-catalyzed addition, the H+ adds to the less substituted carbon (the less substituted end of the double bond), and the Br adds to the more substituted carbon.

Wait, for example, in propene, CH2=CH2, adding HBr would give CH2Br-CH22. But that's Markovnikov's rule, where the Br adds to the more substituted carbon.

Wait, anti-Markovnikov addition would be the reverse. But wait, in acid-catalyzed addition, it's Markovnikov orientation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think: Markovnikov's rule says that the Br adds to the carbon with more hydrogens, which in the case of propene would be the middle carbon.

Wait, but in the substituent, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So C3 is connected to C2 (which has two methyl groups and a CH2 group), and C4 is connected to CH2.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure:

The substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So when HBr adds, the H would add to the less substituted carbon (C4), and Br to the more substituted carbon (C3). So the product would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2.

But wait, that's if the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the substituent after addition would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3?

No, wait, because the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr would give CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, wait, no. H adds to one carbon, Br to the other.

Wait, perhaps the substituent becomes CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br, but I think that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe it's an allylic bromination, but that usually requires peroxides and light, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the double bond could undergo an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, leading to a cyclic bromide. But that seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is a diene, but no, it's a monoene.

Alternatively, could the reaction be an acid-catalyzed elimination, but that doesn't make sense because HBr is a source of H+ and Br-, which is more about addition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an allylic bromination. In allylic bromination, HBr adds across the double bond, leading to a bromide. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another approach: The reaction could be a substitution. But the substituent is an ether, and substitution would require a good leaving group. However, the oxygen in the ether isn't a good leaving group unless under specific conditions, which may not be the case here.

Alternatively, if the substituent's double bond is part of a cyclic structure, maybe it could form a cyclic product upon addition, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the double bond, leading to two different products.

Wait, but the TLC shows two new spots, meaning two products. So the reaction produces two products, perhaps from different positions of addition.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a conjugated diene, but no, the question states it's but-3-en-1-yl, which is a monoene.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that the addition can occur in two different positions, leading to two products.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has two different possible sites for the addition of HBr, leading to two different products.

Wait, but if the substituent has a symmetric structure, maybe adding HBr in different positions would give the same product.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't addition but something else. Wait, the starting material is an ether with a substituent that has a double bond. Maybe the double bond can undergo some kind of ring-forming reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a di-substituted alkene, which upon addition of HBr would give two different products.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look at the options.

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. Wait, these are phenol derivatives with substituents in the 2 and 4 positions. But the starting material is an ether, so how would it become a phenol? Unless the ether oxygen is converted into an alcohol. But that would require some kind of cleavage, which I'm not sure about with HBr.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So one product is a brominated ether, and the other is a different ether with a double bond shifted. Hmm, perhaps one product is the result of HBr adding to the double bond, and the other is an isomerization.

Wait, but if the starting substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, and after adding HBr, it becomes 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy, then perhaps that's one product. The other product might be an isomer where the double bond has shifted, perhaps via some mechanism.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures look more like cyclic ethers or other ring structures. Chromane is a bicyclic structure, and dihydrobenzofuran is a furan derivative. But I'm not sure how adding HBr would lead to ring formation unless some kind of cyclization occurs.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both are brominated ethers, but substituted at different positions.

Wait, so the options suggest that the products are ethers where bromine has been added at different positions.

But how would bromine get added to the substituent?

If the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, and HBr adds to the double bond, then let's think about the addition. The double bond is between C3 and C4, and the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr would result in CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, that can't be right because HBr would add one H and one Br each to adjacent carbons.

Wait, no, each molecule of HBr adds one H and one Br. So the substituent would become CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, that's not correct. Wait, each HBr adds across the double bond, so each of the two carbons in the double bond would get one H and one Br. Wait, no, no. For a single HBr addition, the H adds to one carbon, and Br to the adjacent, across the double bond.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: structure before reaction is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding HBr would add H to one end and Br to the other, leading to CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? Or perhaps CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br with some H added elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products.

If the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, and HBr adds, then the product would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent becomes CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br, but that doesn't account for the addition.

Wait, maybe the addition is such that the Br could be added at either end, leading to different products. But wait, the substituent is symmetric in some way?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the HBr can add in two different positions, leading to two different products. For example, if the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr could result in Br being added either to C3 or to C4, leading to two different brominated ethers.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent after addition would have Br on different carbons, which would lead to two different products.

So option D has two products: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So the bromine is on C3 and C4 of the substituent.

Alternatively, option B has a product which is a different alkene, perhaps due to a shift in the double bond.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the reaction again.

The starting material is an ether with a butenyl substituent. Reacting with HBr could lead to the addition of H and Br across the double bond, leading to a bromoalkane ether. But if the addition can occur on either end of the double bond, you could get two different products, each with Br on a different carbon.

In the substituent CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, the double bond is between C3 and C4. Adding HBr would give either:

CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br (Br on C4)

or 

CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3 (Br on C3)

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would have Br on C3 or C4, leading to two different products.

Looking at option D, the products are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So the substituent is now a butoxy group with Br on C3 or C4.

So that would fit with the addition of HBr to either end of the double bond, leading to two different brominated ethers.

Alternatively, option B has a product where the double bond has shifted, which might involve some isomerization. But if the starting material is but-3-en-1-yl, after adding HBr, the double bond would be gone, so that's probably not the case.

So perhaps option D is the correct answer. But let me check the options again.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbutoxy, with Br on position 3 or 4.

But the starting substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. After addition of HBr, the substituent would become 2,2-dimethylbut-3-enyl bromide? No, wait, the double bond would be replaced by single bonds with Br and H.

Wait, perhaps the substituent becomes 2,2-dimethylbutyl bromide, with Br at either C3 or C4.

But wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, which after HBr addition would become 2,2-dimethylbutyl with Br at either C3 or C4.

Hmm, I think option D makes sense because adding HBr to a double bond can lead to Br on either adjacent carbon, depending on the addition.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of allylic bromination, but that usually involves different mechanisms.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction isn't addition but substitution. If the substituent is an allyl group, perhaps the Br could substitute the hydrogen at the allylic position.

But I'm not sure about that either.

Alternatively, considering the options, option B has one product as (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and another as ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the second product has a double bond at a different position. Maybe it's an isomerization, but I'm not sure how that would happen with HBr.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement, shifting the double bond.

But I'm not confident about that.

Given the options, I think option D is more plausible because it involves the addition of Br to two different positions in the substituent, leading to two different brominated ethers.


The reaction involves ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an ether with a butenyl substituent containing a double bond between C3 and C4. Upon reaction with HBr, the double bond undergoes acid-catalyzed addition, where H+ adds to one carbon and Br- adds to the adjacent carbon. This results in two possible products depending on which carbon the bromine attaches to.

The substituent structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding HBr can lead to two products:
1. Bromine adds to C3, resulting in (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.
2. Bromine adds to C4, resulting in (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

This explains the two new spots observed in the TLC analysis, corresponding to these two brominated ether products. 

Option D correctly identifies these two products, making it the most plausible answer. Other options either suggest unrelated transformations (e.g., phenol formation or isomerization) or do not align with the expected reaction mechanism.

Answer: D
