Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question gives me the uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx, and asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. 

So, the electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction. The uncertainty in position is Δx = 0.1 nm. Wait, nanometers are 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

I think the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, I can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum, Δp, from Δx.

Let me plug in the numbers. Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). So, plugging in the values: ħ is about 1e-34 J·s, and Δx is 1e-10 m. So, 2Δx is 2e-10. So, Δp ≈ (1e-34) / (2e-10) = (1e-34)/(2e-10) = 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, no, let me do that again. 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1/2) * 1e-34 / 1e-10 = 0.5 * 1e-24 = 5e-25 kg·m/s. Yeah, that's right.

Now, I need to find the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think the energy of a particle is related to its momentum. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So, maybe I can relate Δp to ΔE.

Wait, but since we're looking for the uncertainty in energy, perhaps we can use the uncertainty principle again but involving energy and time? Oh wait, no, because the question is about energy, not time. Alternatively, since energy is related to momentum, perhaps we can calculate ΔE using the momentum uncertainty.

Let me think. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in E, ΔE, would be approximately ( (Δp)^2 )/(2m). Because when taking the uncertainty, the square of the momentum will give the square of the uncertainty in p.

So, substituting the values, m is the mass of the electron, which is about 9.11e-31 kg. So, ΔE ≈ ( (5e-25)^2 ) / (2 * 9.11e-31 )

Let me compute that step by step. 

First, square 5e-25: (5e-25)^2 = 25e-50 = 2.5e-49.

Then, denominator is 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30.

So, ΔE ≈ (2.5e-49) / (1.822e-30) = Let's compute that division.

2.5 / 1.822 is approximately 1.372. And 1e-49 divided by 1e-30 is 1e-19. So, 1.372e-19 J.

Wait, but this is an approximation. Let me make sure I did the math right. 5e-25 squared is 25e-50, which is 2.5e-49. Divided by 1.822e-30, that's (2.5 / 1.822) * 1e-19. 2.5 / 1.822 is about 1.37. So, 1.37e-19 J, which is about 1e-19 J. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: sometimes the uncertainty principle is applied using the time-energy form, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider relativistic effects? But the speed given is 2e8 m/s, which is about 20% the speed of light (since light is ~3e8 m/s). Hmm, but non-relativistic approximations might still be okay, or maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, another thought: since the question gives the speed, maybe I should calculate the momentum from the speed and mass, then find the uncertainty in momentum. But no, because the uncertainty in position is given, so I use that to find the uncertainty in momentum.

Wait, let me double-check my initial approach. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, so Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Then, since energy E is p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). So I think that's correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the precise way to compute the energy uncertainty. Alternatively, the energy uncertainty could be linked to the uncertainty in momentum. Let me think about the relation between ΔE and Δp. Since E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be dE ≈ (2p/m) * Δp. Because differentials, dE/dp = (2p)/(2m) = p/m, so ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but that would be for ΔE when p is the average momentum. But since we're dealing with uncertainties, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, but I don't have a time uncertainty here. So perhaps that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the relation between energy and uncertainty principle. The minimum uncertainty in energy would come from the uncertainty in momentum, and hence the kinetic energy.

So, to recap: I have Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = (1e-34)/(2*1e-10) = 5e-25 kg m/s.

Then, ΔE is the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which is (Δp)^2/(2m). So (5e-25)^2 = 25e-50 = 2.5e-49; divided by (2 * 9.11e-31 kg) gives 2.5e-49 / 1.822e-30 ≈ 1.37e-19 J.

So that's approximately 1e-19 J, so option C.

Wait, but wait another thing: sometimes the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is written with an approximate equality, using the order of magnitude. So perhaps the exact calculation isn't necessary, and just the exponent is important.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. Let's compute 5e-25 squared: 5^2 =25, (1e-25)^2 =1e-50. So 25e-50, which is 2.5e-49. Divide by 2 * 9.11e-31 = 18.22e-31 = 1.822e-30. So 2.5e-49 / 1.822e-30 = (2.5 / 1.822) * 1e-19.

2.5 / 1.822 is approximately 1.37, so 1.37e-19 J. So that's ~1e-19 J, which is option C.

But wait, the options are A) 1e-18, B) 1e-17, C) 1e-19, D) 1e-16.

So the correct answer should be C.

To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum. The given data includes the uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, and the speed of the electron, v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s. The reduced Planck's constant is ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s, and the mass of the electron is m ≈ 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg.

### Step 1: Uncertainty in momentum
From the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is given by:
\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta x}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Uncertainty in energy
The kinetic energy of a particle is related to its momentum by:
\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m}
\]
The uncertainty in energy, ΔE, is approximately:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(5 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}
\]
First, calculate \((5 \times 10^{-25})^2\):
\[
(5 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 25 \times 10^{-50} = 2.5 \times 10^{-49}
\]
Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 1.822 \times 10^{-30}
\]
Now divide:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{2.5 \times 10^{-49}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Final answer
The minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately \(1.37 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\), which is closest to \(10^{-19} \, \text{J}\). Therefore, the correct option is:
