Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see what I can figure out.

The problem says that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, since these particles are ultra-relativistic, maybe their velocity v is so close to the speed of light c that v ≈ c. That might simplify things.

The key here is probably the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before that. Because if they decay, they won't reach the walls. So the problem is about the particle's lifetime as seen in the lab frame versus its own rest frame.

Wait, right. The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is tau. The lab frame would see a longer lifetime due to time dilation, so the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is the radius of the detector, 30 meters. The time they have to live to reach the wall is the time it takes for light to travel that distance, but since they are moving at v ≈ c, maybe I can approximate the time as t = distance / speed. So t ≈ 30 m / c. Let's compute that.

Wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 meters per second. So 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. So t ≈ 1e-7 seconds.

But wait, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau. So for the particle to reach the detector, it must live longer than t. So, gamma * tau >= t. Or tau >= t / gamma.

But in the initial scenario, with gamma =20, one third of the particles reach the walls. That suggests that the probability of the particle not decaying before traveling 30 meters is 1/3. So the probability is P = (gamma * tau) / t ? Or maybe it's the ratio of the proper lifetime to the observed time. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of particle decay probabilities.

In particle physics, the average lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. The probability that a particle lives longer than time t is given by e^(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that it decays before reaching the wall is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)), and the probability of reaching the wall is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The decay process is exponential. The probability that a particle decays before time t is P = 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

So the survival probability, which is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t, is S = e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the first scenario, with gamma =20, the survival probability is 1/3. So 1/3 = e^(-t/(20 tau)).

Wait no, wait. Because for gamma=20, one third reach the walls, which is the survival probability. So yes, 1/3 = e^(-t/(20 tau)).

So taking natural logs, ln(1/3) = -t/(20 tau). So ln(3) = t/(20 tau), since ln(1/3) is -ln(3).

So t = 20 tau ln(3).

But wait, for the problem, we need to find what gamma is needed for the survival probability to be 2/3. So let's call this gamma as gamma_new.

So, S_new = 2/3 = e^(-t/(gamma_new tau)).

Taking natural logs: ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma_new tau).

Which gives t = gamma_new tau * ln(3/2).

Wait, because ln(2/3) is negative. Let me write it as:

ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma_new tau)

=> t/(gamma_new tau) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2).

So t/(gamma_new tau) = ln(3/2).

But from the earlier equation, t = 20 tau ln(3).

So substituting t into the second equation:

(20 tau ln(3)) / (gamma_new tau) ) = ln(3/2).

Simplify: (20 ln(3)) / gamma_new = ln(3/2).

So solving for gamma_new:

gamma_new = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2).

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute ln(3) and ln(3/2).

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

Divide that by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ around 54.15.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps rounding is involved.

Wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. The survival probability S = e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

2. Given gamma=20, S=1/3. So:

1/3 = e^(-t/(20 tau)).

Taking ln: ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau).

Which is: ln(3) = t/(20 tau).

So t = 20 tau ln(3).

3. For the new gamma, gamma_new, we want S=2/3.

So 2/3 = e^(-t/(gamma_new tau)).

Take ln: ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma_new tau).

Which is t/(gamma_new tau) = ln(3/2).

4. Substitute t from step 2:

(20 tau ln(3)) / (gamma_new tau) ) = ln(3/2).

The tau cancels, so 20 ln(3) / gamma_new = ln(3/2).

Solving for gamma_new:

gamma_new = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2).

Compute that:

20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.15.

So the closest option is A) 54.

But wait, let me think about the setup again. The initial scenario says that one third reach the walls, so the survival probability is 1/3. So using that, when gamma increases, the survival probability increases as well. Because a higher gamma means the same t is a smaller fraction of the particle's lifetime, so more particles survive. So going from 1/3 to 2/3 requires a higher gamma, which matches our calculation of around 54.

The options given are:

A)54

B)68

C)40

D)28

So the correct answer should be A)54.

To determine the Lorentz factor required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the survival probability of the particles. The survival probability is given by:

\[
S = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}
\]

where \(t\) is the time it takes for the particles to travel the radius of the detector, \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, and \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particles.

### Step 1: Time to travel the detector radius
The radius of the detector is \(30 \, \text{m}\), and the particles travel at a speed close to the speed of light (\(v \approx c\)). The time to travel the radius is:

\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{30}{c} \approx \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Survival probability for the initial scenario
For the initial Lorentz factor \(\gamma = 20\), one-third of the particles survive to reach the walls. Thus, the survival probability is:

\[
S = \frac{1}{3} = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{t}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

Substituting \(\gamma = 20\):

\[
t = 20 \tau \ln(3).
\]

### Step 3: Survival probability for the new scenario
For the new scenario, we want two-thirds of the particles to survive, so:

\[
S_{\text{new}} = \frac{2}{3} = e^{-t / (\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau)}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \(t = 20 \tau \ln(3)\) from Step 2:

\[
\frac{20 \tau \ln(3)}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma_{\text{new}}} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Solve for \(\gamma_{\text{new}}\):

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 4: Numerical calculation
Using approximations:
\[
\ln(3) \approx 1.0986, \quad \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055.
\]

Substitute these values:

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \times 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx \frac{21.972}{0.4055} \approx 54.15.
\]

### Step 5: Final answer
The closest option to the calculated value of \(54.15\) is \(54\). Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is:
