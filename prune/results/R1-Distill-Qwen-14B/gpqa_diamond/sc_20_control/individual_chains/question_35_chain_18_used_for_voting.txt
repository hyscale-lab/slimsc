Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I should write down what Ay looks like.

First, let's figure out what the matrix S is. S is a 2x2 matrix:

Row 1: 0   -i  
Row 2: i    0

So, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Then, c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/4π) * S. So Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]  
= [[0, (-i h)/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]]

Wait, that's the matrix for Ay. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So the question is about which statement is correct regarding these eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

But before that, the options are A, B, C, D. Let's think about each option as I go along.

The question is multiple-choice, so perhaps I don't need to compute all the eigenvalues, but perhaps I can reason out the correct statement.

First, I should find the eigenvalues of Ay. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Wait, let's represent Ay as a matrix:

Ay = [ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
        [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

So the matrix is [[0, a12], [a21, 0]] where a12 = (-i h)/(4π) and a21 = (i h)/(4π). 

The eigenvalues λ are found by solving det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant equation is:

| (-λ)      (-i h)/(4π)     |
| (i h)/(4π)    -λ      | = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ] = 0.

So determinant = λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, let's compute that term. (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1.

So that term is (1) * (h²)/(16 π²). So the determinant equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So λ^2 = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π).

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4 π). So that's the eigenvalues. Hmm, but looking at the options, let's check.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, but the eigenvalues we found are real. Because λ is h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, so the eigenvalues are real numbers. So their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because it's saying the imaginary parts are non-zero.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are real. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm, I'm not sure about this yet. Let me think. In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum components don't commute, so knowing that φ is an eigenfunction of Ay doesn't necessarily make it an eigenfunction of A². Wait, but wait. The square of the angular momentum operator, like A², commutes with each component. So, for any direction, the eigenfunctions of A² are simultaneous eigenfunctions of any component.

Wait, but if a state is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². Because A² and Ay commute. So, option C's statement would be incorrect because they can also be eigenfunctions of Az? Or can they?

Wait, wait. The components of angular momentum don't commute. So, for a state that's an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute. But it can be an eigenfunction of A², because A² commutes with all components.

So the correct statement would be that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not necessarily of Az. So option C is saying that, "the eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." That would make sense. So option C is possibly correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure. The eigenfunctions would form a basis for the space, but the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors would form an orthogonal basis. So D might be correct, but let me think more about this.

Wait, but D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, any 2x2 matrix can be diagonalized if it has two linearly independent eigenvectors. So Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it has a basis of eigenvectors, provided the eigenvalues are distinct. Here, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are distinct, so yes, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D could be correct.

Wait, but which option is correct? Let me go back.

The question is which statement is correct. Let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: Im eigenvalue is ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). That's incorrect, because our eigenvalues are real, ±h/(4π). So A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's also incorrect because our eigenvalues are real.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So that's correct. Because A² commutes with Ay so any eigenfunction of Ay is also eigenfunction of A². But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Well, if the matrix is 2x2 and has two eigenvectors, then yes, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options could have more than one correct statement, but the question says which statement is correct. So I need to pick which is correct.

But wait, the problem is about the Y-component, and we're considering a 2x2 matrix. So is this spin-½ system?

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum for a muon (which is a lepton, spin-½) would have S being the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, but in this problem, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, that's the same as the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. So S is σy.

Ok, so the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy. Let's compute h/(4π). Let me remember that ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy.

The eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become ± ħ/2.

Wait a minute, wait. Wait I had earlier found the eigenvalues to be ± h/(4π). Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier I said Ay is [[0, (-i h)/(4π)], [ (i h)/(4π), 0]]. Then, the characteristic equation is λ^2 - (h/(4π))² =0, so λ = ± h/(4π).

But since ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but in terms of the Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So when you multiply by ħ/2, you get ± ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are real, ± ħ/2. So any statements about eigenvalues being complex are wrong.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary and real parts, which is wrong.

Option B: same issue.

Option C: the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². Yes, because A² is S², and in this case, S is spin-½, so S² would be (3ħ²/4) I, since S² for spin-½ is (s(s+1)ħ²), where s=1/2. So s(s+1)= (1/2)(3/2)=3/4. So S² = (3/4)ħ² I. So A² = (ħ/2)^2 S²? Wait, no:

Wait, A = c S, where c = h/(4π) = ħ/2. So A² = c² S². S² is (σy)^2, which is identity matrix (since σy^2 = I). For Pauli matrices, each σ matrix squared is I. So S^2 = I.

So A² = (ħ/2)^2 * I = (ħ²/4) I.

So the eigenvalue of A² is (ħ²/4) for any eigenstate, because the operator is a multiple of identity. So any eigenfunction of Ay is automatically an eigenfunction of A², with the same eigenvalue.

But for Az (the z-component of A), which would be (ħ/2) σz, for example. Since σy and σz don't commute, their eigenfunctions are not the same. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, unless they are simultaneous eigenfunctions, which they aren't in general.

So option C says: "The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." That's correct.

What about option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors would form a basis. So that's correct as well.

But the question is which statement is correct. So both C and D might be correct, but let's check the options.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me read the options again.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space (since Ay is a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues, so it's diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors are a basis). So D is correct.

So both C and D seem correct. But the problem is a multiple-choice question with four options, and I have to choose the correct one. Let's read the options again.

Option C: ... can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the eigenvectors form a basis, which is correct.

Wait, but the question is, during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

Wait, perhaps option D is saying that the eigenvectors form a basis. So indeed, because the matrix is 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues, it's diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D seem correct. But wait, the answer options probably can't have two correct, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps let me reevaluate option D. The statement is: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, I think the phrase "basis functions of the matrix operator" might not make complete sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's saying that the eigenvectors are the basis for the matrix, but that's automatically true for any square matrix that's diagonalizable. So in this case, since the eigenvalues are distinct, the matrix is diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct. So both C and D seem correct based on this analysis. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me double-check my earlier calculation.

Earlier, I set up the matrix Ay as [[0, (-i h) / (4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]]. So when I set up the characteristic equation, the determinant is:

(-λ)(-λ) - [ ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

So let me compute that term: (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the term is (1) * (h²)/(16 π²).

So determinant equation: λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. So λ = ± h/(4 π).

Which is the same as ħ/2, since ħ = h/(2π). So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are out.

So the eigenfunctions are real? No, wait. The matrix is [[0, a], [-a, 0]], where a is real? No, wait, because a is (i h)/(4π), which is imaginary. So the eigenfunctions might be complex. But the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, no. The matrix Ay is [[0, (-i h)/(4π)], [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]].

Let me write that as:

Ay = [ [0, -(i ħ)/2 ], [ (i ħ)/2, 0 ] ]

Because h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

Which is (ħ/2) * σy.

Now, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2.

So for the eigenvectors, let's compute them. Let's find the eigenvectors for λ = ħ/2.

The equation (Ay - (ħ/2) I) φ = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ -ħ/2, (-i ħ)/2 ], [ (i ħ)/2, -ħ/2 ] ]

The first row is -ħ/2, (-i ħ)/2.

We can write the equations:

(-ħ/2) φ1 + (-i ħ/2) φ2 = 0  
( i ħ/2 ) φ1 + (-ħ/2 ) φ2 = 0 

Dividing both equations by (ħ/2), which is non-zero, we get:

-φ1 -i φ2 = 0  
i φ1 - φ2 = 0 

From the first equation: φ1 = (-i) φ2.

Substituting into the second equation: i (-i) φ2 - φ2 = 0.

i*(-i) is (-i^2) = 1. So 1 * φ2 - φ2 = 0 → 0=0. So this is consistent.

So the eigenvector is φ = [ φ1, φ2 ] = [ (-i φ2 ), φ2 ].

We can choose φ2 = 1, so the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ].

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are typically taken as normalized. So the eigenvector for λ = ħ/2 is [ -i, 1 ]^T. Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the eigenvector would be [ i, 1 ]^T.

Wait, but wait. Let me check.

Alternatively, the eigenvectors for σy are [1, i ] and [1, -i ] for eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. But when scaled by (ħ/2), the eigenvectors remain the same (since c is a scalar).

Wait, actually, for σy, the eigenvectors for +1 are [1, i ]^T and for -1 are [1, -i ]^T.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-do this.

Let me compute the eigenvectors for Ay correctly.

Ay = (ħ/2) * σy.

σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its eigenvalues are ±1.

The eigenvectors for σy are:

For λ = +1: [a, b] such that σy [a; b] = [a; b].

So:

0 * a + (-i) * b = a  
i * a + 0 * b = b 

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, for σy, the eigenvalue equation is σy |v> = λ |v>.

So for eigenvalue +1, the equations are:

0 * v1 - i v2 = v1  
i v1 + 0 v2 = v2 

So equation 1: -i v2 = v1  
Equation 2: i v1 = v2.

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2: i (-i v2 ) = v2 → i*(-i) v2 = v2 → ( (-i^2) ) v2 = v2 → ( (1) ) v2 = v2, which holds.

So we can choose v2 = 1, then v1 = -i.

So the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1:

Equation 1: -i v2 = -v1 → v1 = i v2  
Equation 2: i v1 = -v2.

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2: i (i v2) = -v2 → (i^2) v2 = -v2 → (-1) v2 = -v2 → holds.

So choose v2 = 1, then v1 = i.

So the eigenvectors are [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Now, looking at option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I discussed earlier, A² is a multiple of identity, so all eigenvectors are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Since the matrix is 2x2 and has two eigenvalues, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So, both C and D could be correct. But I need to check the options again.

Wait, option D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, I'm not sure what "basis functions" specifically refers to. Do they mean the eigenvectors are the basis for the space? Yes, because any vector can be expressed as a combination of them. So D is correct.

But looking at the options, only one can be correct. Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. So which is correct?

Wait, looking back, the question is: during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct?

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. So this is correct because, as A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions can be the same. But Ay and Az do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the eigenvectors form a basis, which is correct.

But the problem is about which statement is correct. Now, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. So the problem must have only one correct option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which statements are correct. Let me think again.

If I think about option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So the eigenvectors form a basis, correct. So yes, D is correct.

But perhaps the question is about whether the eigenvectors form a complete basis. Since the matrix is 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues, it's diagonalizable, so yes, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But then, both C and D seem correct. That can't be right because the options are supposed to have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option C. Let's think: can the eigenfunctions of Ay also be eigenfunctions of Az?

The Z-component operator Az is (ħ/2) σz. The eigenstates of σz are [1,0] and [0,1], corresponding to eigenvalues ±1. The eigenstates of σy are [ -i,1 ] and [i, 1 ].

Do these states also diagonalize σz? Let me check. Let me compute σz acting on [ -i,1 ].

σz is [[1,0], [0, -1]]. So σz [ -i; 1 ] = [ -i; -1 ].

Which is not a scalar multiple of [ -i; 1 ].

So the eigenvectors of Ay do not diagonalize Az, meaning they are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

So now, I have to choose between C and D being correct.

Looking back, the problem asks which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one is among the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) ... (incorrect)

B) ... (incorrect)

C) ... (correct)

D) ... (correct)

But in the question, only one option is correct. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the statement in option D is incorrect. Because the matrix operator Ay is given, and its basis functions are the eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions form the basis, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is stating that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Which is correct because any diagonalizable matrix has eigenvectors as a basis. So D is correct.

But the problem includes four options, and perhaps I should look for the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and D, but the options list only one.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which statement is correct according to the problem.

Wait, let's think about option D: if the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator, that would mean that the matrix can be written in terms of those basis functions, which is correct. So D is correct.

But let's think about the problem again: the question is, during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D. But earlier I thought option C was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look more carefully at the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A^2 commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A^2. But Az does not commute with Ay, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the vector space (since it's a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues), so this is correct.

But perhaps option D is incorrect because the matrix operator is 2x2, and its basis functions are not necessarily the eigenfunctions. Wait, the matrix operator is defined in terms of its basis, which is the standard basis. But the eigenfunctions are a different basis. So perhaps the statement in D is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is whether the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix operator. The matrix operator is 2x2, but the eigenfunctions are vectors, not functions in a function space. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions (as basis vectors) form a basis for the vector space in which Ay operates. So, yes, they do form a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but the options can't both be correct. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because the question is about the calculation process, which would involve considering whether the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of other operators.

So based on the earlier analysis, the correct statement is C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues \( \lambda \) of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} S \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The characteristic equation is:

\[
\det\left(\begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & \frac{-i h}{4\pi} \\ \frac{i h}{4\pi} & -\lambda \end{bmatrix}\right) = 0.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\lambda^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
\]

Solving this gives the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Since \( \frac{h}{4\pi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), which are real. This eliminates options **A** and **B**, as they incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as complex.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
The eigenvectors are calculated by solving \( (A_y - \lambda I)\phi = 0 \) for each eigenvalue. For \( \lambda = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and for \( \lambda = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). These eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D vector space, making option **D** correct.

### Step 3: Commutativity and Simultaneous Eigenfunctions
The square of the angular momentum operator \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes option **C** correct.

### Step 4: Final Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are real, not complex.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), not \( \pm 1/2 \).
- **Option C**: Correct, as eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
- **Option D**: Correct, as the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D vector space.

Since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, **C** is the most relevant choice, as it directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I should write down what Ay looks like.

First, let's figure out what the matrix S is. S is a 2x2 matrix:

Row 1: 0   -i  
Row 2: i    0

So, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Then, c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/4π) * S. So Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]  
= [[0, (-i h)/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]]

Wait, that's the matrix for Ay. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So the question is about which statement is correct regarding these eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

But before that, the options are A, B, C, D. Let's think about each option as I go along.

The question is multiple-choice, so perhaps I don't need to compute all the eigenvalues, but perhaps I can reason out the correct statement.

First, I should find the eigenvalues of Ay. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Wait, let's represent Ay as a matrix:

Ay = [ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
        [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

So the matrix is [[0, a12], [a21, 0]] where a12 = (-i h)/(4π) and a21 = (i h)/(4π). 

The eigenvalues λ are found by solving det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant equation is:

| (-λ)      (-i h)/(4π)     |
| (i h)/(4π)    -λ      | = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ] = 0.

So determinant = λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, let's compute that term. (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1.

So that term is (1) * (h²)/(16 π²). So the determinant equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So λ^2 = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π).

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4 π). So that's the eigenvalues. Hmm, but looking at the options, let's check.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, but the eigenvalues we found are real. Because λ is h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, so the eigenvalues are real numbers. So their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because it's saying the imaginary parts are non-zero.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are real. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm, I'm not sure about this yet. Let me think. In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum components don't commute, so knowing that φ is an eigenfunction of Ay doesn't necessarily make it an eigenfunction of A². Wait, but wait. The square of the angular momentum operator, like A², commutes with each component. So, for any direction, the eigenfunctions of A² are simultaneous eigenfunctions of any component.

Wait, but if a state is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². Because A² and Ay commute. So, option C's statement would be incorrect because they can also be eigenfunctions of Az? Or can they?

Wait, wait. The components of angular momentum don't commute. So, for a state that's an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute. But it can be an eigenfunction of A², because A² commutes with all components.

So the correct statement would be that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not necessarily of Az. So option C is saying that, "the eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." That would make sense. So option C is possibly correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure. The eigenfunctions would form a basis for the space, but the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors would form an orthogonal basis. So D might be correct, but let me think more about this.

Wait, but D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, any 2x2 matrix can be diagonalized if it has two linearly independent eigenvectors. So Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it has a basis of eigenvectors, provided the eigenvalues are distinct. Here, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are distinct, so yes, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D could be correct.

Wait, but which option is correct? Let me go back.

The question is which statement is correct. Let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: Im eigenvalue is ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). That's incorrect, because our eigenvalues are real, ±h/(4π). So A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's also incorrect because our eigenvalues are real.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So that's correct. Because A² commutes with Ay so any eigenfunction of Ay is also eigenfunction of A². But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Well, if the matrix is 2x2 and has two eigenvectors, then yes, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options could have more than one correct statement, but the question says which statement is correct. So I need to pick which is correct.

But wait, the problem is about the Y-component, and we're considering a 2x2 matrix. So is this spin-½ system?

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum for a muon (which is a lepton, spin-½) would have S being the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, but in this problem, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, that's the same as the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. So S is σy.

Ok, so the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy. Let's compute h/(4π). Let me remember that ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy.

The eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become ± ħ/2.

Wait a minute, wait. Wait I had earlier found the eigenvalues to be ± h/(4π). Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier I said Ay is [[0, (-i h)/(4π)], [ (i h)/(4π), 0]]. Then, the characteristic equation is λ^2 - (h/(4π))² =0, so λ = ± h/(4π).

But since ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but in terms of the Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So when you multiply by ħ/2, you get ± ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are real, ± ħ/2. So any statements about eigenvalues being complex are wrong.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary and real parts, which is wrong.

Option B: same issue.

Option C: the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². Yes, because A² is S², and in this case, S is spin-½, so S² would be (3ħ²/4) I, since S² for spin-½ is (s(s+1)ħ²), where s=1/2. So s(s+1)= (1/2)(3/2)=3/4. So S² = (3/4)ħ² I. So A² = (ħ/2)^2 S²? Wait, no:

Wait, A = c S, where c = h/(4π) = ħ/2. So A² = c² S². S² is (σy)^2, which is identity matrix (since σy^2 = I). For Pauli matrices, each σ matrix squared is I. So S^2 = I.

So A² = (ħ/2)^2 * I = (ħ²/4) I.

So the eigenvalue of A² is (ħ²/4) for any eigenstate, because the operator is a multiple of identity. So any eigenfunction of Ay is automatically an eigenfunction of A², with the same eigenvalue.

But for Az (the z-component of A), which would be (ħ/2) σz, for example. Since σy and σz don't commute, their eigenfunctions are not the same. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, unless they are simultaneous eigenfunctions, which they aren't in general.

So option C says: "The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." That's correct.

What about option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors would form a basis. So that's correct as well.

But the question is which statement is correct. So both C and D might be correct, but let's check the options.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me read the options again.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space (since Ay is a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues, so it's diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors are a basis). So D is correct.

So both C and D seem correct. But the problem is a multiple-choice question with four options, and I have to choose the correct one. Let's read the options again.

Option C: ... can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the eigenvectors form a basis, which is correct.

Wait, but the question is, during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

Wait, perhaps option D is saying that the eigenvectors form a basis. So indeed, because the matrix is 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues, it's diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D seem correct. But wait, the answer options probably can't have two correct, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps let me reevaluate option D. The statement is: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, I think the phrase "basis functions of the matrix operator" might not make complete sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's saying that the eigenvectors are the basis for the matrix, but that's automatically true for any square matrix that's diagonalizable. So in this case, since the eigenvalues are distinct, the matrix is diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct. So both C and D seem correct based on this analysis. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me double-check my earlier calculation.

Earlier, I set up the matrix Ay as [[0, (-i h) / (4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]]. So when I set up the characteristic equation, the determinant is:

(-λ)(-λ) - [ ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

So let me compute that term: (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the term is (1) * (h²)/(16 π²).

So determinant equation: λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. So λ = ± h/(4 π).

Which is the same as ħ/2, since ħ = h/(2π). So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are out.

So the eigenfunctions are real? No, wait. The matrix is [[0, a], [-a, 0]], where a is real? No, wait, because a is (i h)/(4π), which is imaginary. So the eigenfunctions might be complex. But the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, no. The matrix Ay is [[0, (-i h)/(4π)], [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]].

Let me write that as:

Ay = [ [0, -(i ħ)/2 ], [ (i ħ)/2, 0 ] ]

Because h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

Which is (ħ/2) * σy.

Now, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2.

So for the eigenvectors, let's compute them. Let's find the eigenvectors for λ = ħ/2.

The equation (Ay - (ħ/2) I) φ = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ -ħ/2, (-i ħ)/2 ], [ (i ħ)/2, -ħ/2 ] ]

The first row is -ħ/2, (-i ħ)/2.

We can write the equations:

(-ħ/2) φ1 + (-i ħ/2) φ2 = 0  
( i ħ/2 ) φ1 + (-ħ/2 ) φ2 = 0 

Dividing both equations by (ħ/2), which is non-zero, we get:

-φ1 -i φ2 = 0  
i φ1 - φ2 = 0 

From the first equation: φ1 = (-i) φ2.

Substituting into the second equation: i (-i) φ2 - φ2 = 0.

i*(-i) is (-i^2) = 1. So 1 * φ2 - φ2 = 0 → 0=0. So this is consistent.

So the eigenvector is φ = [ φ1, φ2 ] = [ (-i φ2 ), φ2 ].

We can choose φ2 = 1, so the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ].

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are typically taken as normalized. So the eigenvector for λ = ħ/2 is [ -i, 1 ]^T. Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the eigenvector would be [ i, 1 ]^T.

Wait, but wait. Let me check.

Alternatively, the eigenvectors for σy are [1, i ] and [1, -i ] for eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. But when scaled by (ħ/2), the eigenvectors remain the same (since c is a scalar).

Wait, actually, for σy, the eigenvectors for +1 are [1, i ]^T and for -1 are [1, -i ]^T.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-do this.

Let me compute the eigenvectors for Ay correctly.

Ay = (ħ/2) * σy.

σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its eigenvalues are ±1.

The eigenvectors for σy are:

For λ = +1: [a, b] such that σy [a; b] = [a; b].

So:

0 * a + (-i) * b = a  
i * a + 0 * b = b 

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, for σy, the eigenvalue equation is σy |v> = λ |v>.

So for eigenvalue +1, the equations are:

0 * v1 - i v2 = v1  
i v1 + 0 v2 = v2 

So equation 1: -i v2 = v1  
Equation 2: i v1 = v2.

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2: i (-i v2 ) = v2 → i*(-i) v2 = v2 → ( (-i^2) ) v2 = v2 → ( (1) ) v2 = v2, which holds.

So we can choose v2 = 1, then v1 = -i.

So the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1:

Equation 1: -i v2 = -v1 → v1 = i v2  
Equation 2: i v1 = -v2.

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2: i (i v2) = -v2 → (i^2) v2 = -v2 → (-1) v2 = -v2 → holds.

So choose v2 = 1, then v1 = i.

So the eigenvectors are [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Now, looking at option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I discussed earlier, A² is a multiple of identity, so all eigenvectors are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Since the matrix is 2x2 and has two eigenvalues, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So, both C and D could be correct. But I need to check the options again.

Wait, option D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, I'm not sure what "basis functions" specifically refers to. Do they mean the eigenvectors are the basis for the space? Yes, because any vector can be expressed as a combination of them. So D is correct.

But looking at the options, only one can be correct. Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. So which is correct?

Wait, looking back, the question is: during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct?

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. So this is correct because, as A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions can be the same. But Ay and Az do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the eigenvectors form a basis, which is correct.

But the problem is about which statement is correct. Now, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. So the problem must have only one correct option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which statements are correct. Let me think again.

If I think about option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So the eigenvectors form a basis, correct. So yes, D is correct.

But perhaps the question is about whether the eigenvectors form a complete basis. Since the matrix is 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues, it's diagonalizable, so yes, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But then, both C and D seem correct. That can't be right because the options are supposed to have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option C. Let's think: can the eigenfunctions of Ay also be eigenfunctions of Az?

The Z-component operator Az is (ħ/2) σz. The eigenstates of σz are [1,0] and [0,1], corresponding to eigenvalues ±1. The eigenstates of σy are [ -i,1 ] and [i, 1 ].

Do these states also diagonalize σz? Let me check. Let me compute σz acting on [ -i,1 ].

σz is [[1,0], [0, -1]]. So σz [ -i; 1 ] = [ -i; -1 ].

Which is not a scalar multiple of [ -i; 1 ].

So the eigenvectors of Ay do not diagonalize Az, meaning they are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

So now, I have to choose between C and D being correct.

Looking back, the problem asks which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one is among the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) ... (incorrect)

B) ... (incorrect)

C) ... (correct)

D) ... (correct)

But in the question, only one option is correct. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the statement in option D is incorrect. Because the matrix operator Ay is given, and its basis functions are the eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions form the basis, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is stating that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Which is correct because any diagonalizable matrix has eigenvectors as a basis. So D is correct.

But the problem includes four options, and perhaps I should look for the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and D, but the options list only one.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which statement is correct according to the problem.

Wait, let's think about option D: if the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator, that would mean that the matrix can be written in terms of those basis functions, which is correct. So D is correct.

But let's think about the problem again: the question is, during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D. But earlier I thought option C was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look more carefully at the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A^2 commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A^2. But Az does not commute with Ay, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the vector space (since it's a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues), so this is correct.

But perhaps option D is incorrect because the matrix operator is 2x2, and its basis functions are not necessarily the eigenfunctions. Wait, the matrix operator is defined in terms of its basis, which is the standard basis. But the eigenfunctions are a different basis. So perhaps the statement in D is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is whether the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix operator. The matrix operator is 2x2, but the eigenfunctions are vectors, not functions in a function space. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions (as basis vectors) form a basis for the vector space in which Ay operates. So, yes, they do form a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but the options can't both be correct. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because the question is about the calculation process, which would involve considering whether the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of other operators.

So based on the earlier analysis, the correct statement is C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues \( \lambda \) of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} S \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The characteristic equation is:

\[
\det\left(\begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & \frac{-i h}{4\pi} \\ \frac{i h}{4\pi} & -\lambda \end{bmatrix}\right) = 0.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\lambda^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
\]

Solving this gives the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Since \( \frac{h}{4\pi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), which are real. This eliminates options **A** and **B**, as they incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as complex.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
The eigenvectors are calculated by solving \( (A_y - \lambda I)\phi = 0 \) for each eigenvalue. For \( \lambda = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and for \( \lambda = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). These eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D vector space, making option **D** correct.

### Step 3: Commutativity and Simultaneous Eigenfunctions
The square of the angular momentum operator \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes option **C** correct.

### Step 4: Final Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are real, not complex.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), not \( \pm 1/2 \).
- **Option C**: Correct, as eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
- **Option D**: Correct, as the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D vector space.

Since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, **C** is the most relevant choice, as it directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
