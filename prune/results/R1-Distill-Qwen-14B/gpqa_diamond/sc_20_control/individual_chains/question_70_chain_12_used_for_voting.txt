Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about a series of reactions, and I need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are point groups from molecular symmetry.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. So, A + 8B → C. What could this be? Bright red product... Maybe a metal oxide? Or perhaps something like sulfur? Wait, sulfur is bright red when in certain forms. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving a metal and a halogen. Wait, 8 equivalents—so the stoichiometry is 1:8. Hmm.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. E is dangerous, maybe a toxic gas? Or a highly reactive compound.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is a strong acid and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak) or something similar. Or maybe F is HNO3 and G is H3PO4? Not sure yet.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H (1:1). H is a solvent, so maybe something like HCl (but no, HCl is a gas). Wait, maybe H is something like ethanol or water? Wait, D and B are gases, so their reaction would likely form something else, perhaps a liquid. Or maybe H is something like NH3, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is H2O? Wait, but B is a gas reacting with D to form H, a solvent. Another thought: if B is Cl2 and D is NH3, their reaction could form NH2Cl, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else? Wait no, because in the third reaction, C reacts with water to form acids. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to think about the possible compounds. Let me see:

Looking at the first reaction: 1 A +8 B → C. One possibility is that A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2, then Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But the stoichiometry is 1:1 for that. So that doesn't fit 1:8. Alternatively, maybe A is copper (Cu), and B is something else. Hmmm. Alternatively, maybe it's sulfur reacting with something. Wait, sulfur (S) can form various compounds. Another thought: perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2. Fe + O2 → Fe3O4? The formula for iron(II,III) oxide is Fe3O4. Let's see, the reaction Fe + O2 → Fe3O4. The stoichiometry for Fe is 3 atoms, O is 4 ×2 =8, so 3 Fe + (4 × O2) → Fe3O4. Wait, that would be 3 Fe + 4 O2 → Fe3O4. So for 3 moles of Fe, 4 moles of O2 are used. So the ratio is 3:4. Hmm, but in the first reaction, it's 8 equivalents of B. So perhaps not O2.

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic gas like Cl2. Let's say A is aluminum (Al), which reacts with Cl2. Aluminum reacts with Cl2 in combustion to form AlCl3. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So the ratio is 2:3. That's not 8. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe C is a compound that, when reacted with water, gives two different acids. So, for example, if C is a sulfite or something else. Alternatively, when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. So maybe C is something like SO3^2- (sulfite ion), but that's not a product in itself. Wait, but if C is a sulfite salt, perhaps like Na2SO3. When Na2SO3 reacts with water, it would just stay as Na2SO3. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate salt.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. So C is a compound that, upon hydrolysis, produces A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, for example, if C is ammonium sulfite, (NH4)2SO3, upon hydrolysis, it would give NH4OH (which is weak, but wait, NH4OH is weak, but maybe F would be a strong acid; not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, like FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. H2S is a weak acid, but Fe(OH)2 is more of a base. Hmm, but that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate salt. For example, if C is Na2SO4, then upon reacting with water, it would just stay as Na2SO4. No, that doesn't produce acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. CaSO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2SO3. H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, a weak acid. But where's the strong acid? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of something else. Another idea: if C is a metal nitride, like AlN. AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 and NH3. But Al(OH)3 is an amphoteric hydroxide, and NH3 is a weak base. Doesn't fit as F and G being acids.

Wait, maybe C is a mixture of salts, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a bisulfate or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form an acid. Wait, but in that case, perhaps it would form a single acid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: since in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B are used, maybe B is O2. Then, A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2 in a 1:8 ratio. Let's see: if A is Fe, and B is O2. The reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So 4 Fe and 3 O2 per 2 Fe2O3. So per Fe2O3, it's 3 O2, but that's not matching 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe it's Fe3O4, which is a mixture of FeO, Fe2O3. The formula is Fe3O4, which can be written as FeO·Fe2O3. So for 3 Fe atoms and 4 O atoms. So that would be 3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4. So per 3 Fe, 2 O2. So that's a 3:2 ratio, not 1:8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2. Let's think: A reacting with Cl2 in 1:8 ratio. Maybe A is a metal that forms a +3 charge, so each Cl2 provides 2 Cl- per molecule. So for 8 Cl2, that's 16 Cl-. So the formula would be ACl8. Wait, but that's a big number. Most metals form chlorides with lower ratios, like AlCl3, FeCl3, etc. Wait, perhaps A is a +1 cation. So 1 A and 8 Cl2 would give ACl16. That's possible for something like Na or K? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal with a higher oxidation state. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is not a synthesis but a decomposition. Wait, but the question says reaction of A with B forms C. So A is a solid reacting with gas B to form C.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is phosphorous and B is chlorine. P reacts with Cl2 to form PCl5. The reaction is P + 5 Cl2 → PCl5. So that's 1:5 ratio. Not 8, but perhaps if there's more than one equivalent? Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur (S) and B is something else. S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But the stoichiometry for SO3 is 1 S : 3 O2, which is 1:3. Not 8.

Wait, maybe B is hydrogen gas (H2). So A reacts with H2 to form C. If A is a metal, like Fe, and H2 is used in some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon (C), and B is O2. Then, 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. That's a 2:1 ratio. Again, not matching 8.

Wait, perhaps it's a reaction involving a metal and Cl2. Let me think: if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2. The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So that's 2 Na : 1 Cl2. So 2:1 ratio. Not 8.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is a diatomic gas, and 8 equivalents mean 8 molecules. So for example, in the first reaction, A is a metal, and B is Cl2, and the product is a metal chloride with a +3 oxidation state. Let me see: if A is Al, which is +3, then each Cl2 gives 2 Cl-. So how many Cl2 molecules would be needed per Al atom? AlCl3 would require 3 Cl- per Al^3+. So each Cl2 gives 2 Cl-, so 3 Cl- would need 1.5 Cl2 molecules. So for 1 Al, 1.5 Cl2. So for 8 Cl2, that's 8 /1.5 ≈ 5.33 Al atoms. Doesn't fit the 1:8 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about product E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. And E is extremely hazardous. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

So, if D is a gas, and B is a gas, and their reaction forms H, a solvent, perhaps H is something like NH3 (but that's a gas), or maybe H2O (but that's a liquid). Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol), but that's a liquid. Wait, but D and B are both gases reacting to form H, which is a solvent. So perhaps D is H2O (but H2O is a liquid under standard conditions?), wait no, gas. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the possible identity of H. H is a solvent formed from B and D in 1:1 ratio. Solvents that are liquids, maybe. So perhaps H is H2O (water), which is a solvent. But then, B and D would have to react to form H2O. So B + D → H2O. But both B and D are gases. So for example, if B is H2 and D is O2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So that's a 2:1 ratio, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, so maybe B is O2 and D is H2. Then, O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. So 1 O2 : 2 H2. So that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe B and D are NH3 and HCl. They react to form NH4Cl, which is a solid. No, that's not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol, but how would B and D combine to make ethanol? That would probably require more complex reactions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Then, under certain conditions, they might react, but I'm not sure what product that would form. Alternatively, perhaps H is something like CH3Cl, but that's a gas, not a solvent.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Let's think about product E. It's produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. So C + 2 D → E.

If E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's a toxic gas like HCN (hydrogen cyanide), or perhaps Cl2 (but Cl2 is a reactant, so maybe not). Alternatively, maybe E is SO2 or NO2, which are harmful. Or perhaps it's a nerve agent, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, but maybe E is a compound with a certain symmetry. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. So perhaps E is a molecule with a certain point group.

Let me think of possible E candidates and their symmetry.

If E is something like HCN, which is a linear molecule, it would have D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, if E is SO2, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Or perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which has C2 symmetry. Or NO2, which has C2v symmetry. Wait, NO2 has a bent structure, with a central N atom and two O atoms on either side. Its point group is C2v because it has a mirror plane and a C2 axis.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like CO2, which is linear, so D∞h symmetry. But CO2 is a gas, but not extremely hazardous.

Wait, but if E is a product of C and D, and D is a gas, perhaps D is something like O2 or H2. Let's see, if C is a metal oxide, and D is H2, then maybe E is water, but that's not extremely hazardous.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to figure out C first.

C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, for example, if C is a sulfite salt (like Na2SO3), then upon hydrolysis, it would produce NaOH (weak base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But that doesn't give a strong acid. Alternatively, if C is a sulfate (Na2SO4), then hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2SO4. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid. So that could fit: F is H2SO4 (strong acid), G is H2O (but that's not an acid). Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitride. For example, NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate). When it reacts with water, it would just stay as NH4NO3, which dissociates into NH4+ and NO3-; not sure if that produces acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Upon hydrolysis, Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but NaOH is a strong base. So that would produce a base and a weak acid. But the problem says F and G are acids, so that might not fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, like FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. H2S is a weak acid, but Fe(OH)2 is a base. So again, perhaps not.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the possibility that C is a nitrate salt, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would just dissolve into ions, not forming acids. So that doesn't help.

Wait, another angle: if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base, then hydrolysis would produce a strong acid. For example, if C is NH4Cl, which is the salt of HCl (strong acid) and NH3 (weak base). Then, NH4Cl + H2O → NH4OH (weak base) and HCl (strong acid). But in this case, A would be NH4OH, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like AlCl3. AlCl3 is a Lewis acid, and when it reacts with water, it can form HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3. So AlCl3 + 3 H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3 HCl. So here, F would be HCl (strong acid), G would be Al(OH)3, which is an amphoteric hydroxide but not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit because G is supposed to be an acid. So that might not work.

Wait, maybe C is NaHSO4. Sodium bisulfate. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^- ions. HSO4^- can act as an acid (it's a weak acid, as it's a diprotic acid with the second dissociation being weak). So when NaHSO4 reacts with water, it would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NaOH. Wait, no, because NaHSO4 → Na+ + HSO4^-; HSO4^- can donate another H+ to become SO4^2- and H3O+. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is Na2HPO4. Sodium hydrogen phosphate. It can hydrolyze to form H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). So F would be H3PO4 (weak) and G would be NaOH (base), which doesn't fit because F is supposed to be strong and G weak.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe C is a bisulfide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite salt like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it could produce H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak) and NaOH (strong base), but again, F should be strong acid and G weak. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal sulfide that reacts with water to produce H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. For example, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. So F would be H2S (weak acid), but G is Fe(OH)2 (base). Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't straightforward hydrolysis. Maybe C is a more complex salt.

Let me try to think of the first reaction again. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). Bright red could be a clue. So maybe C is a bright red solid. One bright red solid I know is mercury(II) oxide (HgO), but that's red, but HgO is more of a brick red. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not red. Another thought: maybe it's a sulfide. For example, As2S3 is bright red. But that's a solid. So if A is As and B is S? But then the reaction would be As + S → As2S3. Let's see stoichiometry. As is solid, S is solid or gas? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction like 2 As + 3 S → As2S3. But not sure about the stoichiometry or the gases involved.

Wait, another idea: maybe C is a transition metal complex, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. Let me think of metals that form bright red compounds. Maybe copper? Copper(II) sulfate is blue, but maybe some other compound is red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction forming a metal carbonyl, but those are often dark in color.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
- Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1)

If I can figure out what C is, perhaps that will help.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the possible product E. Since E is formed from C and D, and D is a gas, perhaps E is a gas. If E is a gas and is extremely hazardous, maybe it's a gas like chlorine (Cl2), but Cl2 is a reactant in the first reaction. Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve gas or something, but perhaps more likely, it's a common toxic gas like HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which has the formula HCN. HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, E could be SO2 or NO2, which have different symmetries.

Wait, let's consider E as HCN. Then, its point group would be D∞h because it's a linear molecule with two ends being identical (H and C≡N). Wait, no, HCN is a linear molecule with a triple bond between C and N, and H attached to C. So the structure is H–C≡N. The molecule has a center of inversion and a principal axis (C∞), so the point group is D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is NO2, which is a bent molecule with a central N atom and two O atoms. The molecule has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and a mirror plane. So its point group is C2v.

Hmm, but what's the most likely scenario based on the reactions?

Let me try to think about the possible reactions again.

Reaction 4: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D are gases, and their product is a solvent. If H is a liquid, maybe it's something like ethanol (but how would B and D form ethanol?), or maybe H is water (H2O). To form H2O, B and D would have to be O2 and H2. But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. That's a 2:1 ratio, but reaction 4 is 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but in a different stoichiometry. Or perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then 1 H2 + 1 O2 → H2O. But that's not a balanced equation. The balanced equation is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2:1. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I should think of another solvent. Maybe H is NH3 (ammonia), which is a gas under standard conditions but can be a liquid under certain conditions. To form NH3, B and D would be N2 and H2. The reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. So that's a 1:3 ratio, but reaction 4 is 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH4O (methanol). But forming methanol from two gases would require a reaction like CO + H2 → CH3OH, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry or the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like HCl (but it's a gas) or HF (also a gas).

Wait, another idea: Maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O (but both are gases under certain conditions). But their reaction would form something else. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a halogenated solvent, like CCl4, but that's a liquid. To make CCl4, perhaps from CH4 and Cl2 under certain conditions, but that would require more than a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another angle: perhaps C is a sulfate salt. For example, if C is Na2SO4, then reacting with water would just give Na+ and SO4^2-; not producing acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate salt, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^-; not producing acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite like Na2SO3. Upon hydrolysis, Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So F would be H2SO3 (weak acid), and G would be NaOH (base). But the problem says F is strong acid and G is weak. So that's opposite.

Wait, perhaps C is a bisulfate, like NaHSO4. NaHSO4 is a strong acid (HSO4^- is a weak acid). When NaHSO4 reacts with water, it can dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^- ions. HSO4^- can further dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, but in the reaction, C + H2O → A + F + G. If C is NaHSO4, then NaHSO4 + H2O → NaOH (A) + H2SO4 (F, strong acid) + something else? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is NaHSO4 + H2O → Na2SO4 + H2SO4. So F would be H2SO4 (strong acid), G would be Na2SO4 (which is a neutral salt, not an acid). Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate). It reacts with water to stay as NaHCO3. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze (unless in acidic conditions). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let's think about the solvents. H is a solvent formed from B and D in a 1:1 ratio. So if H is H2O, then B and D would have to be H2 and O2. But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3. Then B and D would be N2 and H2, in the reaction N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. Ratio is 1:3, not 1:1.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is CH3OH (methanol). To form CH3OH from two gases, perhaps from CO and H2. The reaction is CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. That's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps H is something else. Wait, maybe H is a halogenated solvent like CCl4, but I don't see how B and D would form that in a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, maybe H is a simple molecule like CH4 (methane), but that's a gas and not a solvent. Hmm.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try to think of a different approach. Let's consider the possible reactions and see if any of them fit known reactions.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

So C must be a salt that, upon hydrolysis, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, but how? Because salts typically produce either strong acids and strong bases, or weak acids and weak bases, depending on their composition.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. For example, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is the salt of HCl (strong acid) and NH3 (weak base). When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to produce HCl (strong acid) and NH4OH (weak base). But in the problem, F and G are both acids, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it can produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, F and G are acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a bisulfate, like HSO4^- as in NaHSO4. When NaHSO4 reacts with water, it can produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NaOH (strong base). So F would be H2SO4 (strong acid), and G would be NaOH. But again, that's a base and an acid, but the problem says F and G are both acids, one strong and one weak.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. For example, something like MgNH4PO4, which is a mixed salt of Mg^2+, NH4^+, and PO4^3-. When it reacts with water, it might produce Mg(OH)2, NH3, and H3PO4. But that would produce a base (NH3) and a weak acid (H3PO4), not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a complex salt. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Upon hydrolysis, it produces NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid). So F could be CO2 (weak acid), G could be NaOH (strong base). But in the problem, F is a strong acid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps C is a nitride salt, like Ca3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (weak base) and Ca(OH)2. Again, not acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me instead consider the possible options for E and their symmetry groups.

The options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

So the possible E molecules could be:

- D∞h: linear molecules like HCN, CO2, etc.

- C2v: bent molecules like H2O, NO2, SO2.

- C2: a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis, like O3 (ozone) or some others.

- D4h: which is a higher symmetry, perhaps something like SO4^2- (but that's a polyatomic ion), or maybe a molecule like CCl2F2, but not sure.

Wait, if E is SO2, its point group is Dhamster h? No, SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2v symmetry. Hmm, yes, SO2 is a trigonal planar molecule with a bent structure, so C2v.

If E is NO2, it's also a bent molecule, C2v.

If E is O3, it's a bent molecule with C2 symmetry, but I think O3 has C2 symmetry because it's a bent O-O-O structure.

Wait, but O3 has a central O with two others attached, and it's bent. It has a C2 axis and a mirror plane, so its point group is Dhamster h? Wait, no, O3 has a structure where the central O is bonded to two O atoms on either side, making a bent structure. It has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation), and two mirror planes. So its point group is Dhamster h. Oh wait, no, because Dhamster h requires a horizontal mirror plane and others. Alternatively, O3 has a C2 axis and two perpendicular mirror planes (each bisecting the bond angles), so its point group is Dhamster h. Hmm, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another way to think: For O3, the point group is Dhamster h. Because it has a C2 axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and two vertical mirror planes. So its symmetry is Dhamster h.

But I'm not completely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which is linear, so Dhamster h symmetry.

Wait, so: if E is HCN, symmetry is Dhamster h (option C). If E is NO2, symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is O3, symmetry is Dhamster h (option C). If E is SO2, symmetry is C2v (option D).

But I need to figure out which one E is based on the reactions.

Let me think about the reactions again.

Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1). Let's say H is H2O. Then, B and D would have to be O2 and H2. But their stoichiometry is 2:1 for H2O. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps H is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2:1, but reaction 4 is 1:1. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. But I don't know what product they would form in a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of B as O2 and D as H2. Then, reaction 4 is O2 + H2 → H2O. But the actual reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that's a 2:1 ratio; doesn't fit. So perhaps B and D are other gases.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O (gas, like steam) and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to make an educated guess.

Based on the reactions, I'm going to assume that E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry (option D). Alternatively, if E is HCN, it's Dhamster h.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if E is O3, which is Dhamster h.

Wait, but let me think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. If D is O2, then C + 2 O2 → E. What could C be? If C is a sulfide, then E would be SO2. So C could be a metal sulfide, like FeS. FeS + 2 O2 → Fe2O3 + SO2. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like CaCO3, then CaCO3 + 2 O2 → CaO + 2 CO2. But then E would be CO2, which is linear (Dhamster h symmetry).

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe in reaction 2, C reacts with D (O2) to form SO2. So C could be a sulfide. For example, CuS + O2 → CuO + SO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, and D is O2. Then, C + 2 O2 → CO2. But CO2 has Dhamster h symmetry.

Wait, but then E would be CO2, which is a linear molecule with Dhamster h symmetry. So the symmetry group would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN. So how would that fit?

If E is HCN, then in reaction 2, C + 2 D → HCN. D would be a gas that, when reacted with C, produces HCN. For example, if D is H2 and C is a cyanide salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a halogen like Cl2, and C is a compound that when reacted with Cl2 produces HCN. Not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to make a best guess based on the possible options.

If I think E is HCN, which is linear, then the symmetry group is Dhamster h (option C).

If E is SO2, symmetry is C2v (option D).

Another angle: extremely hazardous product E. HCN is highly toxic, as is SO2 and NO2. So any of these could fit.

But considering the product of reaction 3, where C reacts with water to produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Let's say F is H2SO4 and G is H2S. Then, C could be a sulfate salt plus a sulfide. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the answer options and what E could be.

The options are:

A) C2: O3 has this.

B) D4h: perhaps something like CH3Cl, but I'm not sure.

C) Dhamster h: HCN, CO2, etc.

D) C2v: H2O, SO2, NO2.

So if E is SO2, the symmetry is C2v (option D).

Alternatively, if E is HCN, symmetry is Dhamster h (option C).

But based on the reactions, I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the reaction C + 2 D → E. If D is O2, then E could be SO2 (from a sulfide C), which has C2v symmetry (option D).

Alternatively, if D is Cl2, then E could be SOCl2, but I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Hmm.

Well, I'm going to have to make a best guess here. Based on the third reaction producing two acids, perhaps C is a sulfite. Then, when it reacts with O2 (D is O2), it would form SO2 (E), which has C2v symmetry. So the answer would be D) C2v.

Wait, but let me double-check. If D is O2, then in reaction 4, B and D (O2 and ?) react in 1:1 ratio to form H. If H is H2O, then B and D would have to be H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio, which doesn't fit. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O. So reaction 4 is B + H2O → H. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like ethanol. But I'm not sure.

I'm running out of time, so I'll make a guess. I think the answer is D) C2v, which would correspond to SO2 or NO2. But earlier, I thought E might be SO2, which has C2v symmetry.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a sulfide or a sulfate salt. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is likely a toxic gas, such as SO₂, NO₂, or HCN. These gases have distinct molecular symmetries:
   - SO₂ and NO₂ are bent molecules with **C₂v** symmetry.
   - HCN is a linear molecule with **D∞h** symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests C could be a sulfite or sulfate salt, as these salts hydrolyze to form acids. For example, Na₂SO₃ hydrolyzes to H₂SO₃ (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but this does not perfectly match the description of F and G.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is water (H₂O), then B and D could be H₂ and O₂, but their reaction (2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O) has a 2:1 ratio, which does not fit the 1:1 requirement. Other possibilities for H, such as NH₃ or CH₃OH, were considered but did not fully align with the given stoichiometry.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:
   - If E is SO₂ or NO₂, both bent molecules, the symmetry group is **C₂v**.
   - If E is HCN, a linear molecule, the symmetry group is **D∞h**.
   - O₃, another candidate for E, has **D∞h** symmetry but is less likely given the reactions.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the hazardous nature of E, SO₂ or NO₂ are plausible candidates, both of which have **C₂v** symmetry. The analysis suggests that E is likely SO₂, with **C₂v** symmetry.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about a series of reactions, and I need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are point groups from molecular symmetry.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. So, A + 8B → C. What could this be? Bright red product... Maybe a metal oxide? Or perhaps something like sulfur? Wait, sulfur is bright red when in certain forms. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving a metal and a halogen. Wait, 8 equivalents—so the stoichiometry is 1:8. Hmm.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. E is dangerous, maybe a toxic gas? Or a highly reactive compound.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is a strong acid and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak) or something similar. Or maybe F is HNO3 and G is H3PO4? Not sure yet.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H (1:1). H is a solvent, so maybe something like HCl (but no, HCl is a gas). Wait, maybe H is something like ethanol or water? Wait, D and B are gases, so their reaction would likely form something else, perhaps a liquid. Or maybe H is something like NH3, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is H2O? Wait, but B is a gas reacting with D to form H, a solvent. Another thought: if B is Cl2 and D is NH3, their reaction could form NH2Cl, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else? Wait no, because in the third reaction, C reacts with water to form acids. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to think about the possible compounds. Let me see:

Looking at the first reaction: 1 A +8 B → C. One possibility is that A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2, then Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But the stoichiometry is 1:1 for that. So that doesn't fit 1:8. Alternatively, maybe A is copper (Cu), and B is something else. Hmmm. Alternatively, maybe it's sulfur reacting with something. Wait, sulfur (S) can form various compounds. Another thought: perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2. Fe + O2 → Fe3O4? The formula for iron(II,III) oxide is Fe3O4. Let's see, the reaction Fe + O2 → Fe3O4. The stoichiometry for Fe is 3 atoms, O is 4 ×2 =8, so 3 Fe + (4 × O2) → Fe3O4. Wait, that would be 3 Fe + 4 O2 → Fe3O4. So for 3 moles of Fe, 4 moles of O2 are used. So the ratio is 3:4. Hmm, but in the first reaction, it's 8 equivalents of B. So perhaps not O2.

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic gas like Cl2. Let's say A is aluminum (Al), which reacts with Cl2. Aluminum reacts with Cl2 in combustion to form AlCl3. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So the ratio is 2:3. That's not 8. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe C is a compound that, when reacted with water, gives two different acids. So, for example, if C is a sulfite or something else. Alternatively, when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. So maybe C is something like SO3^2- (sulfite ion), but that's not a product in itself. Wait, but if C is a sulfite salt, perhaps like Na2SO3. When Na2SO3 reacts with water, it would just stay as Na2SO3. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate salt.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. So C is a compound that, upon hydrolysis, produces A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, for example, if C is ammonium sulfite, (NH4)2SO3, upon hydrolysis, it would give NH4OH (which is weak, but wait, NH4OH is weak, but maybe F would be a strong acid; not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, like FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. H2S is a weak acid, but Fe(OH)2 is more of a base. Hmm, but that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate salt. For example, if C is Na2SO4, then upon reacting with water, it would just stay as Na2SO4. No, that doesn't produce acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. CaSO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2SO3. H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, a weak acid. But where's the strong acid? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of something else. Another idea: if C is a metal nitride, like AlN. AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 and NH3. But Al(OH)3 is an amphoteric hydroxide, and NH3 is a weak base. Doesn't fit as F and G being acids.

Wait, maybe C is a mixture of salts, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a bisulfate or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form an acid. Wait, but in that case, perhaps it would form a single acid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: since in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B are used, maybe B is O2. Then, A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2 in a 1:8 ratio. Let's see: if A is Fe, and B is O2. The reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So 4 Fe and 3 O2 per 2 Fe2O3. So per Fe2O3, it's 3 O2, but that's not matching 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe it's Fe3O4, which is a mixture of FeO, Fe2O3. The formula is Fe3O4, which can be written as FeO·Fe2O3. So for 3 Fe atoms and 4 O atoms. So that would be 3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4. So per 3 Fe, 2 O2. So that's a 3:2 ratio, not 1:8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2. Let's think: A reacting with Cl2 in 1:8 ratio. Maybe A is a metal that forms a +3 charge, so each Cl2 provides 2 Cl- per molecule. So for 8 Cl2, that's 16 Cl-. So the formula would be ACl8. Wait, but that's a big number. Most metals form chlorides with lower ratios, like AlCl3, FeCl3, etc. Wait, perhaps A is a +1 cation. So 1 A and 8 Cl2 would give ACl16. That's possible for something like Na or K? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal with a higher oxidation state. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is not a synthesis but a decomposition. Wait, but the question says reaction of A with B forms C. So A is a solid reacting with gas B to form C.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is phosphorous and B is chlorine. P reacts with Cl2 to form PCl5. The reaction is P + 5 Cl2 → PCl5. So that's 1:5 ratio. Not 8, but perhaps if there's more than one equivalent? Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur (S) and B is something else. S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But the stoichiometry for SO3 is 1 S : 3 O2, which is 1:3. Not 8.

Wait, maybe B is hydrogen gas (H2). So A reacts with H2 to form C. If A is a metal, like Fe, and H2 is used in some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon (C), and B is O2. Then, 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. That's a 2:1 ratio. Again, not matching 8.

Wait, perhaps it's a reaction involving a metal and Cl2. Let me think: if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2. The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So that's 2 Na : 1 Cl2. So 2:1 ratio. Not 8.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is a diatomic gas, and 8 equivalents mean 8 molecules. So for example, in the first reaction, A is a metal, and B is Cl2, and the product is a metal chloride with a +3 oxidation state. Let me see: if A is Al, which is +3, then each Cl2 gives 2 Cl-. So how many Cl2 molecules would be needed per Al atom? AlCl3 would require 3 Cl- per Al^3+. So each Cl2 gives 2 Cl-, so 3 Cl- would need 1.5 Cl2 molecules. So for 1 Al, 1.5 Cl2. So for 8 Cl2, that's 8 /1.5 ≈ 5.33 Al atoms. Doesn't fit the 1:8 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about product E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. And E is extremely hazardous. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

So, if D is a gas, and B is a gas, and their reaction forms H, a solvent, perhaps H is something like NH3 (but that's a gas), or maybe H2O (but that's a liquid). Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol), but that's a liquid. Wait, but D and B are both gases reacting to form H, which is a solvent. So perhaps D is H2O (but H2O is a liquid under standard conditions?), wait no, gas. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the possible identity of H. H is a solvent formed from B and D in 1:1 ratio. Solvents that are liquids, maybe. So perhaps H is H2O (water), which is a solvent. But then, B and D would have to react to form H2O. So B + D → H2O. But both B and D are gases. So for example, if B is H2 and D is O2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So that's a 2:1 ratio, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, so maybe B is O2 and D is H2. Then, O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. So 1 O2 : 2 H2. So that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe B and D are NH3 and HCl. They react to form NH4Cl, which is a solid. No, that's not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol, but how would B and D combine to make ethanol? That would probably require more complex reactions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Then, under certain conditions, they might react, but I'm not sure what product that would form. Alternatively, perhaps H is something like CH3Cl, but that's a gas, not a solvent.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Let's think about product E. It's produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. So C + 2 D → E.

If E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's a toxic gas like HCN (hydrogen cyanide), or perhaps Cl2 (but Cl2 is a reactant, so maybe not). Alternatively, maybe E is SO2 or NO2, which are harmful. Or perhaps it's a nerve agent, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, but maybe E is a compound with a certain symmetry. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. So perhaps E is a molecule with a certain point group.

Let me think of possible E candidates and their symmetry.

If E is something like HCN, which is a linear molecule, it would have D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, if E is SO2, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Or perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which has C2 symmetry. Or NO2, which has C2v symmetry. Wait, NO2 has a bent structure, with a central N atom and two O atoms on either side. Its point group is C2v because it has a mirror plane and a C2 axis.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like CO2, which is linear, so D∞h symmetry. But CO2 is a gas, but not extremely hazardous.

Wait, but if E is a product of C and D, and D is a gas, perhaps D is something like O2 or H2. Let's see, if C is a metal oxide, and D is H2, then maybe E is water, but that's not extremely hazardous.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to figure out C first.

C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, for example, if C is a sulfite salt (like Na2SO3), then upon hydrolysis, it would produce NaOH (weak base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But that doesn't give a strong acid. Alternatively, if C is a sulfate (Na2SO4), then hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2SO4. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid. So that could fit: F is H2SO4 (strong acid), G is H2O (but that's not an acid). Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitride. For example, NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate). When it reacts with water, it would just stay as NH4NO3, which dissociates into NH4+ and NO3-; not sure if that produces acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Upon hydrolysis, Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but NaOH is a strong base. So that would produce a base and a weak acid. But the problem says F and G are acids, so that might not fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, like FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. H2S is a weak acid, but Fe(OH)2 is a base. So again, perhaps not.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the possibility that C is a nitrate salt, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would just dissolve into ions, not forming acids. So that doesn't help.

Wait, another angle: if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base, then hydrolysis would produce a strong acid. For example, if C is NH4Cl, which is the salt of HCl (strong acid) and NH3 (weak base). Then, NH4Cl + H2O → NH4OH (weak base) and HCl (strong acid). But in this case, A would be NH4OH, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like AlCl3. AlCl3 is a Lewis acid, and when it reacts with water, it can form HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3. So AlCl3 + 3 H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3 HCl. So here, F would be HCl (strong acid), G would be Al(OH)3, which is an amphoteric hydroxide but not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit because G is supposed to be an acid. So that might not work.

Wait, maybe C is NaHSO4. Sodium bisulfate. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^- ions. HSO4^- can act as an acid (it's a weak acid, as it's a diprotic acid with the second dissociation being weak). So when NaHSO4 reacts with water, it would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NaOH. Wait, no, because NaHSO4 → Na+ + HSO4^-; HSO4^- can donate another H+ to become SO4^2- and H3O+. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is Na2HPO4. Sodium hydrogen phosphate. It can hydrolyze to form H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). So F would be H3PO4 (weak) and G would be NaOH (base), which doesn't fit because F is supposed to be strong and G weak.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe C is a bisulfide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite salt like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it could produce H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak) and NaOH (strong base), but again, F should be strong acid and G weak. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal sulfide that reacts with water to produce H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. For example, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. So F would be H2S (weak acid), but G is Fe(OH)2 (base). Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't straightforward hydrolysis. Maybe C is a more complex salt.

Let me try to think of the first reaction again. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). Bright red could be a clue. So maybe C is a bright red solid. One bright red solid I know is mercury(II) oxide (HgO), but that's red, but HgO is more of a brick red. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not red. Another thought: maybe it's a sulfide. For example, As2S3 is bright red. But that's a solid. So if A is As and B is S? But then the reaction would be As + S → As2S3. Let's see stoichiometry. As is solid, S is solid or gas? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction like 2 As + 3 S → As2S3. But not sure about the stoichiometry or the gases involved.

Wait, another idea: maybe C is a transition metal complex, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. Let me think of metals that form bright red compounds. Maybe copper? Copper(II) sulfate is blue, but maybe some other compound is red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction forming a metal carbonyl, but those are often dark in color.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
- Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1)

If I can figure out what C is, perhaps that will help.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the possible product E. Since E is formed from C and D, and D is a gas, perhaps E is a gas. If E is a gas and is extremely hazardous, maybe it's a gas like chlorine (Cl2), but Cl2 is a reactant in the first reaction. Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve gas or something, but perhaps more likely, it's a common toxic gas like HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which has the formula HCN. HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, E could be SO2 or NO2, which have different symmetries.

Wait, let's consider E as HCN. Then, its point group would be D∞h because it's a linear molecule with two ends being identical (H and C≡N). Wait, no, HCN is a linear molecule with a triple bond between C and N, and H attached to C. So the structure is H–C≡N. The molecule has a center of inversion and a principal axis (C∞), so the point group is D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is NO2, which is a bent molecule with a central N atom and two O atoms. The molecule has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and a mirror plane. So its point group is C2v.

Hmm, but what's the most likely scenario based on the reactions?

Let me try to think about the possible reactions again.

Reaction 4: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D are gases, and their product is a solvent. If H is a liquid, maybe it's something like ethanol (but how would B and D form ethanol?), or maybe H is water (H2O). To form H2O, B and D would have to be O2 and H2. But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. That's a 2:1 ratio, but reaction 4 is 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but in a different stoichiometry. Or perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then 1 H2 + 1 O2 → H2O. But that's not a balanced equation. The balanced equation is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2:1. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I should think of another solvent. Maybe H is NH3 (ammonia), which is a gas under standard conditions but can be a liquid under certain conditions. To form NH3, B and D would be N2 and H2. The reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. So that's a 1:3 ratio, but reaction 4 is 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH4O (methanol). But forming methanol from two gases would require a reaction like CO + H2 → CH3OH, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry or the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like HCl (but it's a gas) or HF (also a gas).

Wait, another idea: Maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O (but both are gases under certain conditions). But their reaction would form something else. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a halogenated solvent, like CCl4, but that's a liquid. To make CCl4, perhaps from CH4 and Cl2 under certain conditions, but that would require more than a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another angle: perhaps C is a sulfate salt. For example, if C is Na2SO4, then reacting with water would just give Na+ and SO4^2-; not producing acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate salt, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^-; not producing acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite like Na2SO3. Upon hydrolysis, Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So F would be H2SO3 (weak acid), and G would be NaOH (base). But the problem says F is strong acid and G is weak. So that's opposite.

Wait, perhaps C is a bisulfate, like NaHSO4. NaHSO4 is a strong acid (HSO4^- is a weak acid). When NaHSO4 reacts with water, it can dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^- ions. HSO4^- can further dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, but in the reaction, C + H2O → A + F + G. If C is NaHSO4, then NaHSO4 + H2O → NaOH (A) + H2SO4 (F, strong acid) + something else? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is NaHSO4 + H2O → Na2SO4 + H2SO4. So F would be H2SO4 (strong acid), G would be Na2SO4 (which is a neutral salt, not an acid). Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate). It reacts with water to stay as NaHCO3. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze (unless in acidic conditions). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let's think about the solvents. H is a solvent formed from B and D in a 1:1 ratio. So if H is H2O, then B and D would have to be H2 and O2. But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3. Then B and D would be N2 and H2, in the reaction N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. Ratio is 1:3, not 1:1.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is CH3OH (methanol). To form CH3OH from two gases, perhaps from CO and H2. The reaction is CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. That's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps H is something else. Wait, maybe H is a halogenated solvent like CCl4, but I don't see how B and D would form that in a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, maybe H is a simple molecule like CH4 (methane), but that's a gas and not a solvent. Hmm.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try to think of a different approach. Let's consider the possible reactions and see if any of them fit known reactions.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

So C must be a salt that, upon hydrolysis, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, but how? Because salts typically produce either strong acids and strong bases, or weak acids and weak bases, depending on their composition.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. For example, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is the salt of HCl (strong acid) and NH3 (weak base). When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to produce HCl (strong acid) and NH4OH (weak base). But in the problem, F and G are both acids, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it can produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, F and G are acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a bisulfate, like HSO4^- as in NaHSO4. When NaHSO4 reacts with water, it can produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NaOH (strong base). So F would be H2SO4 (strong acid), and G would be NaOH. But again, that's a base and an acid, but the problem says F and G are both acids, one strong and one weak.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. For example, something like MgNH4PO4, which is a mixed salt of Mg^2+, NH4^+, and PO4^3-. When it reacts with water, it might produce Mg(OH)2, NH3, and H3PO4. But that would produce a base (NH3) and a weak acid (H3PO4), not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a complex salt. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Upon hydrolysis, it produces NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid). So F could be CO2 (weak acid), G could be NaOH (strong base). But in the problem, F is a strong acid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps C is a nitride salt, like Ca3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (weak base) and Ca(OH)2. Again, not acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me instead consider the possible options for E and their symmetry groups.

The options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

So the possible E molecules could be:

- D∞h: linear molecules like HCN, CO2, etc.

- C2v: bent molecules like H2O, NO2, SO2.

- C2: a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis, like O3 (ozone) or some others.

- D4h: which is a higher symmetry, perhaps something like SO4^2- (but that's a polyatomic ion), or maybe a molecule like CCl2F2, but not sure.

Wait, if E is SO2, its point group is Dhamster h? No, SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2v symmetry. Hmm, yes, SO2 is a trigonal planar molecule with a bent structure, so C2v.

If E is NO2, it's also a bent molecule, C2v.

If E is O3, it's a bent molecule with C2 symmetry, but I think O3 has C2 symmetry because it's a bent O-O-O structure.

Wait, but O3 has a central O with two others attached, and it's bent. It has a C2 axis and a mirror plane, so its point group is Dhamster h? Wait, no, O3 has a structure where the central O is bonded to two O atoms on either side, making a bent structure. It has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation), and two mirror planes. So its point group is Dhamster h. Oh wait, no, because Dhamster h requires a horizontal mirror plane and others. Alternatively, O3 has a C2 axis and two perpendicular mirror planes (each bisecting the bond angles), so its point group is Dhamster h. Hmm, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another way to think: For O3, the point group is Dhamster h. Because it has a C2 axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and two vertical mirror planes. So its symmetry is Dhamster h.

But I'm not completely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which is linear, so Dhamster h symmetry.

Wait, so: if E is HCN, symmetry is Dhamster h (option C). If E is NO2, symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is O3, symmetry is Dhamster h (option C). If E is SO2, symmetry is C2v (option D).

But I need to figure out which one E is based on the reactions.

Let me think about the reactions again.

Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1). Let's say H is H2O. Then, B and D would have to be O2 and H2. But their stoichiometry is 2:1 for H2O. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps H is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2:1, but reaction 4 is 1:1. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. But I don't know what product they would form in a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of B as O2 and D as H2. Then, reaction 4 is O2 + H2 → H2O. But the actual reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that's a 2:1 ratio; doesn't fit. So perhaps B and D are other gases.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O (gas, like steam) and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to make an educated guess.

Based on the reactions, I'm going to assume that E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry (option D). Alternatively, if E is HCN, it's Dhamster h.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if E is O3, which is Dhamster h.

Wait, but let me think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. If D is O2, then C + 2 O2 → E. What could C be? If C is a sulfide, then E would be SO2. So C could be a metal sulfide, like FeS. FeS + 2 O2 → Fe2O3 + SO2. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like CaCO3, then CaCO3 + 2 O2 → CaO + 2 CO2. But then E would be CO2, which is linear (Dhamster h symmetry).

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe in reaction 2, C reacts with D (O2) to form SO2. So C could be a sulfide. For example, CuS + O2 → CuO + SO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, and D is O2. Then, C + 2 O2 → CO2. But CO2 has Dhamster h symmetry.

Wait, but then E would be CO2, which is a linear molecule with Dhamster h symmetry. So the symmetry group would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN. So how would that fit?

If E is HCN, then in reaction 2, C + 2 D → HCN. D would be a gas that, when reacted with C, produces HCN. For example, if D is H2 and C is a cyanide salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a halogen like Cl2, and C is a compound that when reacted with Cl2 produces HCN. Not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to make a best guess based on the possible options.

If I think E is HCN, which is linear, then the symmetry group is Dhamster h (option C).

If E is SO2, symmetry is C2v (option D).

Another angle: extremely hazardous product E. HCN is highly toxic, as is SO2 and NO2. So any of these could fit.

But considering the product of reaction 3, where C reacts with water to produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Let's say F is H2SO4 and G is H2S. Then, C could be a sulfate salt plus a sulfide. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the answer options and what E could be.

The options are:

A) C2: O3 has this.

B) D4h: perhaps something like CH3Cl, but I'm not sure.

C) Dhamster h: HCN, CO2, etc.

D) C2v: H2O, SO2, NO2.

So if E is SO2, the symmetry is C2v (option D).

Alternatively, if E is HCN, symmetry is Dhamster h (option C).

But based on the reactions, I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the reaction C + 2 D → E. If D is O2, then E could be SO2 (from a sulfide C), which has C2v symmetry (option D).

Alternatively, if D is Cl2, then E could be SOCl2, but I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Hmm.

Well, I'm going to have to make a best guess here. Based on the third reaction producing two acids, perhaps C is a sulfite. Then, when it reacts with O2 (D is O2), it would form SO2 (E), which has C2v symmetry. So the answer would be D) C2v.

Wait, but let me double-check. If D is O2, then in reaction 4, B and D (O2 and ?) react in 1:1 ratio to form H. If H is H2O, then B and D would have to be H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio, which doesn't fit. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O. So reaction 4 is B + H2O → H. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like ethanol. But I'm not sure.

I'm running out of time, so I'll make a guess. I think the answer is D) C2v, which would correspond to SO2 or NO2. But earlier, I thought E might be SO2, which has C2v symmetry.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a sulfide or a sulfate salt. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is likely a toxic gas, such as SO₂, NO₂, or HCN. These gases have distinct molecular symmetries:
   - SO₂ and NO₂ are bent molecules with **C₂v** symmetry.
   - HCN is a linear molecule with **D∞h** symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests C could be a sulfite or sulfate salt, as these salts hydrolyze to form acids. For example, Na₂SO₃ hydrolyzes to H₂SO₃ (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but this does not perfectly match the description of F and G.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is water (H₂O), then B and D could be H₂ and O₂, but their reaction (2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O) has a 2:1 ratio, which does not fit the 1:1 requirement. Other possibilities for H, such as NH₃ or CH₃OH, were considered but did not fully align with the given stoichiometry.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:
   - If E is SO₂ or NO₂, both bent molecules, the symmetry group is **C₂v**.
   - If E is HCN, a linear molecule, the symmetry group is **D∞h**.
   - O₃, another candidate for E, has **D∞h** symmetry but is less likely given the reactions.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the hazardous nature of E, SO₂ or NO₂ are plausible candidates, both of which have **C₂v** symmetry. The analysis suggests that E is likely SO₂, with **C₂v** symmetry.
