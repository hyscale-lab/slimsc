Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components of the operator P, namely P_x, P_y, and P_z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The options are four possibilities for the normalized eigenvector's elements.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the operator in question is the Pauli matrix for spin. Oh right, because the components are given as Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So each component P_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ is the Pauli matrix.

The operator in the direction n is given by the vector operator P · n, right? Because n is a direction vector, so the operator is the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction cosine. So the operator would be P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, that means n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z. Because n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, in spherical coordinates, usually θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, so n_x would be cosθ and n_z = sinθ? Wait, no, n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ. Oh wait, but since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n_y is zero, n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the standard unit vectors. Let me think: if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ is zero. So the unit vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, no, when θ is 0, we're along the z-axis, so n_z is 1, so n_x is zero. So yeah, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P_n is (ħ/2) [n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z]. Wait, no, because P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, and similarly for the others. So it's (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). And since σ matrices are 2x2, the operator is a 2x2 matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector of this operator P_n for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Wait, no: actually, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Because the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector |v> such that when P_n acts on it, it's scaled by ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the eigenstates of a spin-1/2 in an arbitrary direction. The eigenstates are known, right? For a spin along direction n, the eigenstates can be written in terms of the eigenstates of σ_z, which are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The eigenstates along n can be written as |+⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩, and |−⟩ = -e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↑⟩ + cos(θ/2)|↓⟩, where φ is the angle around the z-axis. But wait, in our problem, n is along x-z plane, so φ is zero, right? Because if it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0. So e^{iφ} = 1.

So the eigenvectors become |+⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + sin(θ/2)|↓⟩, and |−⟩ = -sin(θ/2)|↑⟩ + cos(θ/2)|↓⟩. So the components are (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) for the up state, and (-sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2)) for the down state.

But wait, the problem says the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2, so we should take the |+⟩ state. So the vector would have components (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches. Option B is in terms of cos(theta) and sin(theta), but I think that's for the state expressed in the original basis, maybe? Or perhaps not the correct components.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices. So each component is a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P_n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Let's write that out as a matrix.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So P_n would be (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Because σ_x times n_x is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]], and σ_z times n_z is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding them together gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Multiply by ħ/2.

Wait, that's the matrix. So the operator is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Now, to find the eigenvectors, we set up the equation (P_n - (ħ/2) I)|v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (P_n - (ħ/2) I) would be:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - 1] ].

Wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

P_n is (ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]
Subtracting (ħ/2) I gives:
(ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

So the matrix is:

Row 1: [ (n_z - 1), n_x ] multiplied by ħ/2
Row 2: [ n_x, (-n_z -1) ] multiplied by ħ/2

Set this multiplied by the vector [a, b]^T equal to zero:

(ħ/2) [ (n_z -1) a + n_x b ] = 0
(ħ/2) [ n_x a + (-n_z -1) b ] = 0

Since ħ/2 is not zero, we can ignore it:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → equation (1)
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 → equation (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for a:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z -1 )

Substitute into equation (2):

n_x [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1) ) ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Multiply out:

[ -n_x^2 b ] / (n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

b [ -n_x^2/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0

Assuming b is not zero (non-trivial solution), the term in brackets must be zero.

So:

-n_x^2/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

-n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = 0

Compute the second term:

(-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = (-n_z)(n_z) + (-n_z)(-1) + (-1)(n_z) + (-1)(-1)
= -n_z^2 + n_z -n_z + 1
= -n_z^2 + 1

So the equation becomes:

-n_x^2 + (-n_z^2 +1) = 0 → (-n_x^2 -n_z^2 ) + 1 = 0 → -(n_x^2 + n_z^2) +1 =0

But since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So  -(1) +1 =0 → 0=0.

So the equations are dependent, and we have one equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Which we can use to express a in terms of b.

So, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Now, let's express a and b in terms of θ.

Earlier, I thought n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, wait, earlier I was confused about the coordinate system. Let me clarify:

In spherical coordinates, a unit vector n in direction (θ, φ) has components:

n_x = sinθ cosφ

n_y = sinθ sinφ

n_z = cosθ

But since the vector is in the x-z plane, φ = 0. So n_x = sinθ * cos0 = sinθ, and n_z= cosθ.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into a:

a = [ -sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Let me simplify this. Let's factor the denominator:

cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(θ/2) [using the identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2)]

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So:

a = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ] / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) * b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negative signs cancel, and 2 sin(θ/2) cancels with denominator's 2 sin²(theta/2):

= [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / ( 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) * b

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * b

So,

a = [ cot(theta/2) ] b

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b

Let me choose b = sin(theta/2), so that a = cos(theta/2).

Because then, the components would be (a, b) = (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, because:

If b = sin(theta/2), then a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

So the vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But we need to normalize this vector. The norm is sqrt( [cos(theta/2)]^2 + [sin(theta/2)]^2 ) = sqrt(1) =1. So it's already normalized.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)). But why would the vectors have factors of ħ? Because the eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? So this suggests that option D is incorrect in terms of units. The options A and B involve ħ as well. Option A has hbar, which probably isn't correct because the eigenvectors are dimensionless (states are vectors in Hilbert space and should be dimensionless). So options B and C are the only ones without hbar multiplied in, except that option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match what I found.

Wait, no, in option B, the first component is cos(theta), second is e^{i phi} sin(theta), but in our case, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So option B is for a different parameterization.

So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The goal is to determine the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

The operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$, and $\vec{n}$ can be parameterized as $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right),
\]
where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the operator matrix is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]
where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from the operator matrix gives:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ satisfies:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first row of the equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the equation becomes:
\[
-2\sin^2(\theta/2)a + 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)b = 0.
\]

Dividing through by $2\sin(\theta/2)$ (assuming $\sin(\theta/2) \neq 0$):
\[
-\sin(\theta/2)a + \cos(\theta/2)b = 0.
\]

Solving for $a$ in terms of $b$:
\[
a = \cos(\theta/2) \frac{b}{\sin(\theta/2)}.
\]

Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ (to normalize the eigenvector), we find:
\[
a = \cos(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. The other options are incorrect because:
- Option A includes $\hbar$, which is dimensionally inconsistent for an eigenvector.
- Option B uses $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which correspond to a different parameterization.
- Option D introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and incorrect coefficients.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components of the operator P, namely P_x, P_y, and P_z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The options are four possibilities for the normalized eigenvector's elements.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the operator in question is the Pauli matrix for spin. Oh right, because the components are given as Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So each component P_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ is the Pauli matrix.

The operator in the direction n is given by the vector operator P · n, right? Because n is a direction vector, so the operator is the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction cosine. So the operator would be P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, that means n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z. Because n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, in spherical coordinates, usually θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, so n_x would be cosθ and n_z = sinθ? Wait, no, n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ. Oh wait, but since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n_y is zero, n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the standard unit vectors. Let me think: if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ is zero. So the unit vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, no, when θ is 0, we're along the z-axis, so n_z is 1, so n_x is zero. So yeah, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P_n is (ħ/2) [n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z]. Wait, no, because P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, and similarly for the others. So it's (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). And since σ matrices are 2x2, the operator is a 2x2 matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector of this operator P_n for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Wait, no: actually, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Because the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector |v> such that when P_n acts on it, it's scaled by ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the eigenstates of a spin-1/2 in an arbitrary direction. The eigenstates are known, right? For a spin along direction n, the eigenstates can be written in terms of the eigenstates of σ_z, which are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The eigenstates along n can be written as |+⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩, and |−⟩ = -e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↑⟩ + cos(θ/2)|↓⟩, where φ is the angle around the z-axis. But wait, in our problem, n is along x-z plane, so φ is zero, right? Because if it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0. So e^{iφ} = 1.

So the eigenvectors become |+⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + sin(θ/2)|↓⟩, and |−⟩ = -sin(θ/2)|↑⟩ + cos(θ/2)|↓⟩. So the components are (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) for the up state, and (-sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2)) for the down state.

But wait, the problem says the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2, so we should take the |+⟩ state. So the vector would have components (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches. Option B is in terms of cos(theta) and sin(theta), but I think that's for the state expressed in the original basis, maybe? Or perhaps not the correct components.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices. So each component is a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P_n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Let's write that out as a matrix.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So P_n would be (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Because σ_x times n_x is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]], and σ_z times n_z is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding them together gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Multiply by ħ/2.

Wait, that's the matrix. So the operator is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Now, to find the eigenvectors, we set up the equation (P_n - (ħ/2) I)|v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (P_n - (ħ/2) I) would be:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - 1] ].

Wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

P_n is (ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]
Subtracting (ħ/2) I gives:
(ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

So the matrix is:

Row 1: [ (n_z - 1), n_x ] multiplied by ħ/2
Row 2: [ n_x, (-n_z -1) ] multiplied by ħ/2

Set this multiplied by the vector [a, b]^T equal to zero:

(ħ/2) [ (n_z -1) a + n_x b ] = 0
(ħ/2) [ n_x a + (-n_z -1) b ] = 0

Since ħ/2 is not zero, we can ignore it:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → equation (1)
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 → equation (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for a:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z -1 )

Substitute into equation (2):

n_x [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1) ) ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Multiply out:

[ -n_x^2 b ] / (n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

b [ -n_x^2/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0

Assuming b is not zero (non-trivial solution), the term in brackets must be zero.

So:

-n_x^2/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

-n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = 0

Compute the second term:

(-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = (-n_z)(n_z) + (-n_z)(-1) + (-1)(n_z) + (-1)(-1)
= -n_z^2 + n_z -n_z + 1
= -n_z^2 + 1

So the equation becomes:

-n_x^2 + (-n_z^2 +1) = 0 → (-n_x^2 -n_z^2 ) + 1 = 0 → -(n_x^2 + n_z^2) +1 =0

But since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So  -(1) +1 =0 → 0=0.

So the equations are dependent, and we have one equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Which we can use to express a in terms of b.

So, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Now, let's express a and b in terms of θ.

Earlier, I thought n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, wait, earlier I was confused about the coordinate system. Let me clarify:

In spherical coordinates, a unit vector n in direction (θ, φ) has components:

n_x = sinθ cosφ

n_y = sinθ sinφ

n_z = cosθ

But since the vector is in the x-z plane, φ = 0. So n_x = sinθ * cos0 = sinθ, and n_z= cosθ.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into a:

a = [ -sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Let me simplify this. Let's factor the denominator:

cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(θ/2) [using the identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2)]

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So:

a = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ] / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) * b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negative signs cancel, and 2 sin(θ/2) cancels with denominator's 2 sin²(theta/2):

= [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / ( 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) * b

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * b

So,

a = [ cot(theta/2) ] b

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b

Let me choose b = sin(theta/2), so that a = cos(theta/2).

Because then, the components would be (a, b) = (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, because:

If b = sin(theta/2), then a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

So the vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But we need to normalize this vector. The norm is sqrt( [cos(theta/2)]^2 + [sin(theta/2)]^2 ) = sqrt(1) =1. So it's already normalized.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)). But why would the vectors have factors of ħ? Because the eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? So this suggests that option D is incorrect in terms of units. The options A and B involve ħ as well. Option A has hbar, which probably isn't correct because the eigenvectors are dimensionless (states are vectors in Hilbert space and should be dimensionless). So options B and C are the only ones without hbar multiplied in, except that option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match what I found.

Wait, no, in option B, the first component is cos(theta), second is e^{i phi} sin(theta), but in our case, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So option B is for a different parameterization.

So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The goal is to determine the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

The operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$, and $\vec{n}$ can be parameterized as $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right),
\]
where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the operator matrix is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]
where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from the operator matrix gives:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ satisfies:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first row of the equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the equation becomes:
\[
-2\sin^2(\theta/2)a + 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)b = 0.
\]

Dividing through by $2\sin(\theta/2)$ (assuming $\sin(\theta/2) \neq 0$):
\[
-\sin(\theta/2)a + \cos(\theta/2)b = 0.
\]

Solving for $a$ in terms of $b$:
\[
a = \cos(\theta/2) \frac{b}{\sin(\theta/2)}.
\]

Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ (to normalize the eigenvector), we find:
\[
a = \cos(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. The other options are incorrect because:
- Option A includes $\hbar$, which is dimensionally inconsistent for an eigenvector.
- Option B uses $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which correspond to a different parameterization.
- Option D introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and incorrect coefficients.

Answer: C
