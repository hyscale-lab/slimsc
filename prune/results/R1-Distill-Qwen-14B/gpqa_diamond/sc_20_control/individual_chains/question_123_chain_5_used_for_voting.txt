Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me think about this.

Wait, the problem says that both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, inertial frames are non-accelerating, so no acceleration here. So we can probably use classical mechanics or maybe some relativity? Oh wait, the question mentions that 60,000 km/s is the speed. Let me check the speed of light. Oh, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2c, which is pretty fast but not relativistic enough that we can't maybe use the approximation.

Wait, the problem gives the speed as 60,000 km/s towards the center of the Galaxy. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So there's a velocity transformation involved here.

The key here is the time that passes in each frame. Because in relativity, time can differ between frames, but the problem gives us the time in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find out how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame, and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

Wait no, wait. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame during these 50 seconds?

Oh right, time dilation! Because in special relativity, moving clocks run slow. So the proper time (time in the moving frame) is longer or shorter than the coordinate time (time in the stationary frame), depending on the direction.

Wait no, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the events. So if the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving, then from the ejecta's frame (which is the rest frame of the supernova ejecta part), the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the Galaxy's frame is moving relative to the ejecta's frame.

But wait, how to find the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation.

Wait, let me define the frames. Let's say the ejecta is at rest in frame S. The Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v = 60,000 km/s in the negative x-direction (assuming the ejecta is moving towards the center, which is in the positive x-direction from the ejecta's frame? Or maybe I should clarify the directions.

Wait no, in the problem, the ejecta is moving towards the center. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So in the Galaxy's frame (let's say frame S'), the ejecta is moving with velocity v = 60,000 km/s towards the center.

But in the ejecta's frame (frame S), the Galaxy is moving towards it at velocity v = 60,000 km/s.

So, the question is: in the Galaxy's frame, how far does the ejecta travel in the time corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, no: wait, the problem states: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. We need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by the speed (60,000 km/s) to get the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no. Because from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. But we have t' (50 seconds) in the ejecta's frame. So how do we find t?

We can use the time dilation formula. But wait, the time measured in the moving frame (Galaxy's frame) versus the rest frame (ejecta's frame) depends on the velocity between the frames.

If the ejecta is at rest (S frame), and the Galaxy is moving at v relative to S, then from S, the Galaxy's time is dilated. So in S (ejecta's frame), the time for the Galaxy is moving, so they move slower.

Wait, if the Galaxy is moving at v relative to the ejecta, then for events happening on the Galaxy (like moving past a point), the proper time is measured in the Galaxy's frame. So when the ejecta sees the Galaxy moving, the time between two events (like the front and back of the Galaxy passing a point) would be longer in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of Lorentz transformations. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So v is 60,000 km/s. Let's compute that in terms of c. 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c. So v = 0.2c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is about 1.0206. So time dilation factor is gamma.

In the ejecta's frame (S), the Galaxy is moving and its clock runs slow. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame (S')?

Wait, no. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the events. So if the events are happening on the moving object (Galaxy), then the proper time is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

So, if the ejecta's frame (S) measures a time interval t', then the Galaxy's frame (S') measures t = gamma * t'.

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Let me recall the time dilation formula: if an event occurs in the rest frame S, then in frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S, the time is t = gamma (t' + (v x') / c² ). But if the events are at the same place (x' = 0), then t = gamma t'.

Wait, but in this case, the events are the movement of the ejecta. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the proper time is the time in the Galaxy's frame. So if the ejecta's frame measures t', then the Galaxy's frame would measure t = t' * gamma.

Wait, no, maybe I have it reversed. Let me think again.

Time dilation formula: If two events happen at the same place in frame S', then the time between them in frame S is t = gamma * t'.

In this problem, let's say the events are the front and back of the ejecta moving past a specific point in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, no, perhaps it's the movement of the supernova ejecta. Let me define it properly.

In the ejecta's frame, the ejecta is stationary. The Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's frame is moving, and events in the Galaxy are moving. So, the time between events in the Galaxy's frame (t) is measured by someone in the Galaxy, and in the ejecta's frame (t') is longer.

So for example, suppose in the Galaxy's frame, the time between two events is t. Then in the ejecta's frame, the time is t' = gamma * t.

So if the ejecta's frame measures 50 seconds (t'), then the Galaxy's frame has t = t' / gamma.

Wait, no, that's correct. Because if the Galaxy is moving, the events (like the front and back of the Galaxy passing a point) would be spaced in time by t in the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta, moving relative to the Galaxy, would see those events happening longer apart. So t' = gamma * t.

So t = t' / gamma.

So t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

So if the ejecta's frame (t') is 50 seconds, then t = 50 / gamma.

Gamma is 1.0206, so 50 / 1.0206 ≈ 49.0 seconds.

Wait, but then the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is speed (v) multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame (t). So v = 60,000 km/s, t = approx 49.0 s.

So distance = 60,000 * 49 = 2,940,000 km.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2,940,000 km.

But wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Let's calculate 1/sqrt(0.96).

0.96 is (0.98)^2 approximately? No, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is 1.0206.

So t = 50 / 1.0206 = approximate 49.0 seconds.

So distance is 60,000 km/s * 49 s = 2,940,000 km, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the proper time in the Galaxy's frame the t, or is it the other way around? Because the events are the movement of the ejecta.

Wait, perhaps the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But according to the problem, 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = t' / gamma.

So v is 60,000 km/s, t = 50 / 1.0206 ≈ 49.0 s.

So distance is 60,000 * 49 = 2,940,000 km, which is option A.

But wait, another thought. Because the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, the time taken is t = d / v. But d is the distance we're looking for, but that's what we're trying to find.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this with a Lorentz transformation.

In the ejecta's frame (S), the events are:

- The front of the ejecta is at x' = 0 at time t' = 0.

- The front of the ejecta reaches x' = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km at time t' = 50 s.

Wait, no. Because in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So, assuming the ejecta's front is moving towards the Galaxy, but in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the movement. Let me think in terms of the two frames.

In the ejecta's frame (S):

- At t'=0, the front of the ejecta is at x'=0.

- The Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but the problem says the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame (S'), the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.

So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves a distance d = v * t.

But we're given t' (50 s) in the ejecta's frame and need to find d in the Galaxy's frame.

So another approach: find the time t in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame shows t' = 50 s.

Using the Lorentz transformation, t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

But in the ejecta's frame, what is x'?

In the ejecta's frame, the front of the ejecta is at x' = 0 at t'=0. At t' =50 s, the front has moved to x' = v * t' (but wait, no. Wait, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the ejecta is at rest; the Galaxy is moving. So the distance the Galaxy has moved towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame is v * t' = 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km.

So x' would be -3,000,000 km (since the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, which is at x'=0, so the front of the Galaxy would be approaching).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me define the coordinate systems properly.

In the ejecta's frame (S):

- The ejecta is stationary at x' =0.

- The Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta (negative x' direction) at speed v =60,000 km/s.

So, at t'=0, the front of the Galaxy (let's say) is at x'=0.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the relevant event is when the front of the ejecta reaches a certain point in the Galaxy's frame. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper time (the time experienced by the ejecta) is t' =50 s. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' ?

Wait, no, because proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object. So if the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, then the proper time for the ejecta is in its own frame. So from the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer.

Wait, but this is where I get confused. Let me think again.

Proper time is the time measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the events. So, if the ejecta is moving, then a clock in the ejecta's frame measures proper time for events happening on itself.

So, the time t' is the proper time for the ejecta's movement. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time would be longer by a factor of gamma.

Wait, no. Because the events (the movement of the ejecta) are happening in the ejecta's frame. So the proper time is t', and the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' ?

Wait, I think I have it reversed. Suppose two events happen on the ejecta: event 1 at t1, x1, and event 2 at t2, x2.

In the ejecta's frame, the time between is t' = t2 - t1. The distance between is x' = x2 - x1.

In the Galaxy's frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the ejecta, the time between events is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

But in the ejecta's frame, since the ejecta is at rest, x' =0 for both events. So x' =0, so t = gamma * t'.

Wait, that makes sense. So if two events happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame, then in the Galaxy's frame (which is moving relative to the ejecta), the time between events is longer by gamma.

So, for the ejecta's movement, the proper time t' (in the ejecta's frame) is 50 seconds. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, that seems to contradict my earlier approach. Hmm.

Wait, so according to this, in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer than in the ejecta's frame. So the ejecta, moving at 60,000 km/s, would take more time in the Galaxy's frame for the same movement.

Wait, but in this case, the events are the same in the ejecta's frame: they are at rest, so their movement is such that in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer.

So, if the ejecta's frame measures 50 seconds between two events, the Galaxy's frame measures t = gamma *50 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t = 60,000 km/s * gamma *50 s.

Wait, but that would be 60,000 * 1.0206 *50 = 60,000 *51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km, which is close to option D (3,060,000 km). Hmm.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the time in the Galaxy's frame would be shorter. Now I'm getting conflicting results. I need to clarify this.

So, proper time is the shortest time between two events measured in the frame where the events happen at the same place. So, if the ejecta is moving, then the proper time is the ejecta's frame time, and other frames (like the Galaxy's) would see a longer time.

So, if the ejecta moves from point A to point B in their own frame in t' seconds, then in the Galaxy's frame, which sees the ejecta moving, the time taken would be longer.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the movement is such that the Galaxy is approaching. So perhaps the events are the front of the ejecta moving past a certain point in the Galaxy's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the events are the front of the ejecta passing two points in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of a clock on the ejecta. The ejecta's own clock shows 50 seconds passing. How much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame?

Because the Galaxy's frame is moving relative to the ejecta, the Galaxy's clock would have advanced more.

So, the proper time (ejecta's frame) is t' =50 s.

Galaxy's frame time t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 s.

So, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame.

So, the distance the ejecta travels is v * t =60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km, which is approximately 3,060,000 km, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it, so from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy's movement would take less time. But that's perhaps not the case because the events are happening on the ejecta.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's see. Another approach: use the velocity addition formula.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v =60,000 km/s.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at v=60,000 km/s.

So perhaps the time experienced in each frame is different, but the distance is the same in both frames if we account for the time difference.

Wait, but distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But in the ejecta's frame, t' is 50 s. So we need to find t.

So if in the ejecta's frame, t'=50 s, and the distance the ejecta moves in its own frame is zero (because it's stationary), but the Galaxy is moving 3,000,000 km. So the distance the Galaxy covers in ejecta's frame is 3,000,000 km in 50 s.

But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving. So how much time passes?

Wait, perhaps using the Lorentz transformation correctly is the way to go. Let me write down the Lorentz equations.

The Lorentz transformation for time is:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

And for position:

x = gamma (x' + v t' )

In our case, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the events are:

- The front of the ejecta is at x'=0, t'=0.

- After 50 seconds, the front of the ejecta (which is stationary in S') has not moved, but the Galaxy has moved towards it. Wait, no, perhaps I should model the events as the front of the ejecta passing two points.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the same event in both frames. Let's say the event is the front of the ejecta passing a certain point in the Galaxy's frame. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternative plan: compute the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during time t, which is equal to 60,000 km/s * t.

We have to find t, which is the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

So, if the ejecta is at rest in its own frame, and the Galaxy is moving at v, then the time between two events in the ejecta's frame (like the arrival of the front of the ejecta at two points) would be longer in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, let me think about two events: the front of the ejecta reaching a point A in the Galaxy, and then reaching another point B.

In the ejecta's frame, these events happen at different times.

Wait, maybe I should model the events in the ejecta's frame. Let's say event 1 is the front of the ejecta passing point A (x' =0) at t'=0.

Event 2 is the front of the ejecta passing point B (x' = L') at t'= t'.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta is stationary, so L' is the distance between A and B as measured in the ejecta's frame.

But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so L is length contracted.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to use the velocity transformation. The velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given as 60,000 km/s. So the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But what is the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame?

From the earlier approach, using the Lorentz transformation for time:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

In the ejecta's frame, for the event where the front of the ejecta has moved a distance x' in 50 seconds. Wait, no. If the ejecta is stationary, x' doesn't change. So, perhaps the correct approach is to model the movement of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so let me try to approach it from another angle.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in 50 seconds, the Galaxy has moved 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km towards the ejecta.

So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy has moved 3 million km in 50 seconds.

But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the time it takes for the ejecta to cover that distance would be different.

Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the distance is not 3 million km, because of length contraction. Or is it?

Wait, no. Length contraction is in the direction of motion. So in the Galaxy's frame, the distance between two points is shorter.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving, so the distance between points in the Galaxy is length contracted.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the proper length. The proper length is the length measured in the rest frame of the object. So the Galaxy's proper length is measured in the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta, moving relative to the Galaxy, would see this length contracted.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when t' =50 s in the ejecta's frame.

From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy moves 3,000,000 km towards the ejecta in 50 s.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it. So how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame has 50 s.

Using the time dilation formula: t = gamma * t' ?

Because the events (front of the ejecta moving past two points) are at the same place in the ejecta's frame.

So t = gamma *50 = 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 s.

So, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t =60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So that's the closest.

But wait, why earlier I thought the distance was 2,940,000 km? Because I thought t = t' / gamma. But that approach led me to option A.

So I'm getting two different results based on whether I use t = gamma * t' or t = t' / gamma.

Hmm, perhaps I should refer back to the proper time concept. Proper time is the shortest time between two events, measured in the frame where the events occur at the same place.

In this problem, the two events are the front of the ejecta passing two different points in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, these events occur at the same place (because the ejecta is stationary), so the proper time t' is 50 s.

In the Galaxy's frame, these events occur at different places, so the time is longer. So according to the time dilation formula, t = gamma * t'.

So t ≈51.03 s.

So the distance is 60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km.

Which is approximately 3,060,000 km, matching option D.

Wait, but why did I get the opposite result earlier? Because when I thought the time in the Galaxy's frame was shorter, I used t = t' / gamma. But that approach was incorrect because it assumed the events were moving in the frame.

So the correct approach is to use t = gamma * t' for the time in the Galaxy's frame when t' is the proper time.

Therefore, the distance should be 3,060,000 km, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta in two reference frames: the ejecta's frame (S') and the Galaxy's frame (S). The ejecta is stationary in its own frame, while the Galaxy is moving towards it at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Time Dilation**:  
   In special relativity, time intervals measured in different frames are related by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), where:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{60,000}{300,000}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

2. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   Proper time (\( t' \)) is the time measured in the rest frame of the events (the ejecta's frame). The time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related by:  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   Substituting \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) and \( \gamma \approx 1.0206 \):  
   \[
   t \approx 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at a constant speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The distance traveled is:  
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   d \approx 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]

4. **Matching the Options**:  
   The calculated distance \( \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.

**Answer: D**
