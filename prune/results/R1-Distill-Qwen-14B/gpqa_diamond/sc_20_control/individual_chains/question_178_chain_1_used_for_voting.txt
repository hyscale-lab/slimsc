Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu].

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension is important for determining renormalizability. Renormalizable theories have interactions with operators of mass dimension less than or equal to 4, right? Because the dimension of the action is 4 in four spacetime dimensions.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is an interaction term, so the dimension of L should be 4 because the action S = ∫ L d^4x has to be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Let me think about each part of L_int.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ multiplied by F^{μν}.

I need to find the dimensions of each part.

Let's start with the fields. The Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D spacetime, the fields must have certain dimensions to make the kinetic term in the Lagrangian have dimension 4. The kinetic term is like ∂μ ψ̄ γ^μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. Each derivative ∂ has dimension 1. ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2. So [∂μ ψ̄ γ^μ ψ] = 1 + 3/2 + 3/2 = 4. So yeah, ψ has dimension 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices and involves a commutator. But when considering dimensions, the sigma is a tensor constructed from the gamma matrices and derivatives? Wait, no, sigma itself is a product of two gamma matrices. Wait, no, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which is antisymmetric. But since the gamma matrices are dimensionless, σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. Because each gamma matrix is dimensionless (like any matrix, they don't carry mass dimension), so their commutator is also dimensionless.

Now F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for the electromagnetic field, I think. Or maybe for a non-Abelian gauge field. But in any case, F_{μν} is made up of derivatives of the gauge field A and terms involving A squared. For electromagnetism, F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_nu A_mu. So each F has dimension 1 because A has dimension 1. Since derivatives are dimension 1, F is 1.

So putting it all together: L_int = κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Each ψ has 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2 as well. σ is dimensionless, as we said. F is dimension 1.

So the total dimension of the term without κ is [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 1 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 1 is 4. Oh wait, but wait: σ_{μν} is a matrix (so maybe it's traceless? Not sure if that affects the dimension) but regardless, its dimension comes from the gamma matrices which are dimensionless. So yeah, F is dimension 1.

So the term without κ is dimension 4. But wait, the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so κ must have dimension 0? Because 4 = [κ] + 4 → [κ] =0. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have κ as dimension 0.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck. Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. F is 1. So 3 +1 =4. So the product is dimension 4. So κ must have dimension 0 because 0 +4 =4. But looking at the options, none of them have dimension 0. The options are -1, 1, etc.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me think again. Wait, the term is σ_{μν} which is a product of two gammas, but also in tensor notation. But the sigma, as a tensor, is a product of two gamma matrices, but it's part of a term that involves two ψs. Wait, perhaps I should think about the dimensions of the entire term.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each part correctly. Let me think about each object:

- ψ̄: 3/2
- σ_{μν}: dimensionless
- ψ: 3/2
- F^{μν}: dimension 1.

So ψ̄ σ ψ = (3/2) + (0) + (3/2) = 3.

F: 1.

So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F is 3 +1 =4. So the term without κ is dimension 4. Thus, the entire L_int is κ times this, so [L_int] = [κ] +4. But Lagrangian terms must have dimension 4, so [κ] +4 =4 → [κ]=0. Hmm, but all the options for κ have either -1 or 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the dimension of F. Let me think again. For the field strength tensor F, in QED, it's made from derivatives of A and products of A. So A has mass dimension 1 because the kinetic term for A is like ∂μ Aν ∂^μ A^ν, which must have dimension 4. Each derivative is 1, A is 1. So each term in F would be like ∂A, which is 1+1=2. Wait no, F_{μν} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each term in F has dimension [∂] + [A] = 1 +1=2?

Wait, no, wait. The field A in four dimensions has mass dimension 1. Because the term in the Lagrangian is (1/4) F^2. F has dimension 2, because F is ∂A, so F has dimension 1 +1 =2. Then F^2 is (2)^2 =4, which matches the dimension of the Lagrangian (which must be 4). So yes, F has dimension 2. Oh wait, so F^{μν} has dimension 2, not 1. That was my mistake.

So let's redo the calculation.

The term is ψ̄ σ ψ F.

So, [ψ̄] =3/2, [σ]=0, [ψ]=3/2, [F]=2.

So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3/2*2=3, plus 2 is 5. Wait, no. Wait, adding the dimensions, 3/2 +3/2 =3, plus [F]=2, gives 5. So the product is dimension 5.

So the term is κ * (something with dimension 5). The Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So looking at the options, options A and C have [κ]=-1. Now, is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its mass dimension is ≤4. But wait, wait, the coupling constant's dimension determines the renormalizability.

Wait, the interaction Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The coupling κ has dimension -1. To find whether the theory is renormalizable, we check if the dimension of the coupling is ≥ 0.

Wait, another approach: in 4 dimensions, a term with coupling dimension d is renormalizable if d ≥ 0 because the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4 - (d + ...). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence for a Feynman diagram in a theory with coupling constants of mass dimension d is D = 4 - L*d, where L is the number of loops. But perhaps a better approach is to think about the possible divergences.

Alternatively, the general rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because couplings with negative mass dimension would lead to nonrenormalizable interactions, which require an infinite number of counterterms.

Wait, but in this case, the coupling κ has mass dimension -1. So it's negative. So the theory would not be renormalizable because the coupling has dimension less than zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The mass dimension of the coupling in four dimensions must satisfy [κ] ≥ 0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because each vertex in Feynman diagrams would contribute a factor of the coupling, and higher loops would lead to higher powers of the coupling. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, then higher loop diagrams would have higher powers of a dimensionful quantity, leading to potential divergences that can't be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.

So in this case, since [κ]=-1, which is less than zero, the interaction term is nonrenormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, that's option C: [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable.

Wait, let me double-check. The interaction is L=κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Each ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So 3/2 +3/2 +2 =5. The Lagrangian must have dimension 4 → κ must have dimension -1. Correct.

Renormalizability: yes, the coupling dimension is negative → nonrenormalizable. So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for a gauge field has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- The object $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from the gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, which are dimensionless. Thus, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term is proportional to $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$. The total mass dimension of the term without $\kappa$ is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has mass dimension $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable, as it requires an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
