Okay, so I've got a question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember regularization is a technique used to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I'll recall each theory. Regularization is typically needed in quantum field theories because when you calculate loop diagrams, you often end up with divergent integrals. These divergences need to be handled, and one way is through regularization. So, which of these are quantum theories and which might not be?

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's a classical theory, right? Unlike quantum theories, classical theories don't have the same issues with renormalization because they deal with fields and their equations without the quantum fluctuations leading to infinities. So in classical ED, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So maybe D is the answer.

But let me check the others. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) definitely requires regularization. It's a quantum field theory, and when you compute loop corrections, like the electron self-energy, you get divergences. That's why renormalization is necessary. So C) would require regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is another quantum field theory, dealing with the strong force. It involves things like asymptotic freedom and uses techniques like lattice QCD to handle calculations. Regularization is definitely needed here because of loop divergences. So B) requires regularization.

Superstring Theory, option A. I'm a bit hazy on this. Superstring theory is a type of quantum theory that attempts to unify all forces, including gravity. It's a candidate for a theory of everything. Now, in string theories, the fundamental objects are strings rather than point particles. I think that in string theories, the perturbative expansions also have divergences, but perhaps they are handled differently. Wait, but do they need regularization? Or maybe because of the higher-dimensional nature or the way the theory is formulated, the need for regularization is lessened or absent?

Wait, no. I think even in string theory, when you compute loop diagrams (like genus expansion), you still get divergences. So they must use some form of regularization. But wait, I've read that in string theory, these divergences are often tamed or canceled by things like the modular properties of the amplitudes or by the presence of higher-order terms. Or maybe they don't require the same kind of ad-hoc regularization as in QFT because the underlying structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps in superstring theory, certain aspects are automatically regularized because of the way the theory is formulated. For example, in superstring theory, the infinite tower of states from the string's vibrational modes could lead to different behaviors. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's not that they don't need regularization, but that the divergences are handled in a different way, perhaps via the theory's internal consistency.

Wait, but the question is which theory never requires regularization. So perhaps the answer is D) because classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. Let me think: does classical electrodynamics ever have issues with infinities? I know in classical E&M, even though you can have point charges, which have their own issues with self-energy and such, but those are handled through other formalisms, like the method of images or using retarded potentials. But those aren't the same as regularization, which is a quantum field theory technique.

So, putting it all together. The only theory that isn't a quantum field theory is classical electromagnetism (D). So it doesn't require regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory tool. Therefore, the answer should be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze each option:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring theory is a quantum theory that unifies forces, including gravity, and involves strings as fundamental objects. While it deals with divergences, these are often handled differently due to the theory's unique structure, such as modular properties or higher-order terms. However, regularization is still necessary in some form.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is a quantum field theory describing the strong interaction. It involves loop divergences and requires regularization techniques, such as lattice QCD, to handle these issues.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is another quantum field theory, dealing with electromagnetic interactions. It is well-known for requiring regularization due to divergences in loop diagrams, which are addressed through renormalization.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical electrodynamics is a classical theory, not a quantum field theory. It does not involve the same divergences or infinities that quantum theories encounter, and therefore does not require regularization. Techniques like retarded potentials or image charges are used to handle classical problems, but these are not equivalent to regularization.

Since regularization is a tool specific to quantum field theories, the only theory that never requires it is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
