Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that γ matrices are dimensionless, right? So their commutator should also be dimensionless. That makes σ_{μν} dimensionless as well.

Wait, what's the field strength tensor F_{μν}? I think it's made from the partial derivatives of the gauge field A. So F is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ plus some terms with the gauge field itself, but dimension-wise, each derivative ∂μ has mass dimension 1. So F^{μν} must have mass dimension 2, because each derivative adds 1, and F is a tensor built from two derivatives. Or wait, the gauge field A has mass dimension 1, so F, being derivatives of A, would have dimension 2, right.

Now, ψ is a spinor. What's the mass dimension of a Dirac spinor? I recall that in 4 dimensions, a fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the action is dimensionless, the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. So for the Dirac term like i ψ̄ γμ ∂μ ψ, the derivatives contribute 1 each, and ψ has 3/2 each. So 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term i ψ̄ γμ ∂μ ψ has the dimensions of [Mass]^4, because the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4 (since the integral over dx^4 is dimensionless). Let me think again: the term i ψ̄ γμ ∂μ ψ must have dimension 4. ψ̄ and ψ are each dimension 3/2. So 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then ∂μ is dimension 1. So 3 +1 =4, which matches. So ψ has dimension 3/2.

So putting it together in the Lagrangian term L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F. Let's figure out the dimensions. ψ̄ has 3/2, σ_{μν} is dimensionless, ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So the product is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the entire term (without κ) has mass dimension 5. But the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, because it's integrated over four dimensions (each dx is mass^-1, so the Lagrangian density must be mass^4). So κ must have a dimension that when multiplied, brings the total down to 4.

So the product without κ is dimension 5. So κ has to have dimension -1, because 5 + (-1) =4. So [κ]_M = -1. That would make the Lagrangian dimension correct.

Now, the next part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. For a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero. Because in the renormalization process, the interactions with couplings of negative mass dimension are non-renormalizable and lead to higher-order divergences that can't be absorbed by the same counterterms.

In this case, κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable. Because the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the interaction term is relevant or irrelevant? Wait, wait. No, wait: in terms of renormalizability, the condition is that the coupling's dimension must be ≥0. Because the terms in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4. So if the coupling has a negative dimension, the term has higher dimension, making it non-renormalizable.

So the theory is not renormalizable because [κ]_M is -1.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1. Renormalizable? No, because [κ] is -1. So A is wrong.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable. That would be the case if [κ] is positive. But our calculation says -1. So B is wrong.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. That fits.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable. No, if [κ]=1, it's renormalizable, so D is wrong.

So the correct answer is C.

The given Lagrangian is 

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]

where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\). To determine the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the dimensions of each component:

1. **Dimensions of fields and operators**:
   - The spinor field \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\).
   - The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is derived from the gauge field \(A_\mu\), which has mass dimension 1. Since \(F^{\mu\nu}\) involves derivatives of \(A_\mu\), it has mass dimension \([ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 2\).
   - The operator \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is a commutator of \(\gamma\)-matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is also dimensionless: \([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ]_M = 0\).

2. **Dimension of the interaction term**:
   The interaction term \(\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) must have mass dimension 4, as the Lagrangian density in 4 spacetime dimensions has mass dimension 4. The dimensions of the fields are:
   \[
   [ \bar{\psi} ]_M = \frac{3}{2}, \quad [ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}, \quad [ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 2.
   \]
   Adding these gives:
   \[
   [ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
   \]
   To ensure the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4, \(\kappa\) must have mass dimension:
   \[
   [ \kappa ]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
   \]

3. **Renormalizability**:
   A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, \(\kappa\) has mass dimension \(-1\), which is negative. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

4. **Analysis of options**:
   - **Option A**: \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), theory is renormalizable. This is incorrect because the theory is not renormalizable.
   - **Option B**: \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\), theory is renormalizable. This is incorrect because \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), not 1.
   - **Option C**: \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), theory is not renormalizable. This is correct.
   - **Option D**: \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\), theory is not renormalizable. This is incorrect because \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), not 1.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
