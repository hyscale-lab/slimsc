Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me think through this.

The question asks me to arrange the given nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. The options are 5, then 4, etc., but I need to figure out the order.

Wait, the list is:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, I should consider how each nucleophile's structure affects its ability to donate electrons in such a solvent.

In polar protic solvents, the solvent can stabilize ions through solvation. But the more the solvent stabilizes the nucleophile, the less reactive it is because it's less available to attack. So the weaker the base, the more it's stabilized, making it a poorer nucleophile. Wait, or is it the opposite? No, I think stronger bases are actually better nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents but in polar protic, they might be less nucleophilic because they're stabilized (solvated) more.

Wait, let me clarify. In polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity correlates with basicity because they aren't as solvated. But in polar protic solvents, the more polarizable or less solvated nucleophiles are better. So for example, in water, S- nucleophiles are better than O- because S is bigger and less solvated. Like, ethanethiolate (SN-) is a better nucleophile than hydroxide (OH-) in aqueous solution because it's less stabilized by solvation.

So let's look at each compound:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is a conjugate base of an alcohol, so it's a strong base. But wait, cyclohexanolate is an alkoxide. In aqueous solution, it's a good nucleophile but maybe not as good as something less solvated.

2. Hydroxide (OH-): A strong base. In aqueous solution, it's a good nucleophile but maybe not the best because it's highly solvated.

3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-): This is the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base than hydroxide because it's a carboxylate. Wait, carboxylates are weaker bases than alkoxides, so in water, their nucleophilicity is lower. So propionate should be a weaker nucleophile.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): This is a neutral molecule. It's a poor nucleophile because it's not deprotonated. In aqueous solution, alcohols are not strong nucleophiles since they're not charged. So methanol is probably the least reactive here.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS- or CH3CH2S-? Wait, no. Ethanethiolate would be the conjugate base of ethanethiol, which is CH3CH2SH. So the conjugate base is CH3CH2S-. Sulfur is larger than oxygen, so this should be a stronger nucleophile in polar protic solvents because it's less solvated. So ethanethiolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide in aqueous solution.

So, order from most reactive to least reactive:

The best nucleophiles in aqueous solution would be the ones that are less solvated. So, ethanethiolate (5) is the best. Then hydroxide (2). Then comes the cyclohexanolate (1), because it's an alkoxide but maybe less solvated than hydroxide? Wait, no. Wait, I thought that in aqueous solution, ethanethiolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide because S is bigger and less solvated. So 5 > 2.

Then comes 1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is an alkoxide, so it's a good nucleophile but perhaps not as good as hydroxide and ethanethiolate. But wait, is cyclohexanolate a strong enough base but maybe less stabilized than hydroxide? Or maybe because it's a bulky base, does that affect reactivity? Wait, steric effects can hinder, but here we're just talking about nucleophilicity, not reaction rates in substitution. So perhaps the cyclohexanolate is a better nucleophile than propionate but worse than OH- and ethanethiolate.

Wait, propionate is a carboxylate. Carboxylate ions are weaker bases than alkoxides. So their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is lower. So propionate is a poorer nucleophile than hydroxide and ethanethiolate, but how about compared to other oxygen nucleophiles?

Wait, the order of nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents (like water) is generally: RS- > HO- > RO- > (then perhaps other groups). So ethanethiolate (5) is more nucleophilic than OH- (2), which is more than RO- (like cyclohexanolate, which is RO-), and then propionate is another RO- but a weaker base.

Wait, wait, propionate is a carboxylate (RCOO-), which is a weaker base than alcohols. So in aqueous solution, their nucleophilicity order would be: stronger bases (less stabilized by solvation) would be better nucleophiles. So the order should be: 5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol, since it's neutral and the weakest).

Wait, but wait. Wait, cyclohexanolate is RO-, which is a stronger base than propionate (RCOO-). So in aqueous solution, RO- is a better nucleophile than RCOO- because RCOO- is a weaker base. So in the list, 1 is RO-, 3 is RCOO-.

So the order would be 5 (best), 2, 1, 3, and lastly 4 (methanol is a poor nucleophile).

So the order is 5, 2, 1, 3, 4.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 5, 2, 1, 3, 4.

But wait, the options are:

Option D: 5, 2, 1, 3, 4.

Yes. So the correct order would be option D.

Wait, let me double-check.

Ethanethiolate (5) is the best nucleophile because S is less electronegative, larger, so less solvated in water.

Then comes hydroxide (2) because it's a strong base but more solvated than ethanethiolate.

Next is the cyclohexanolate (1), which is RO- but less bulky than hydroxide? Wait, no, cyclohexanolate is an alkoxide, which is a stronger base than propionate but weaker than hydroxide. Wait, isn't hydroxide a stronger base than alkoxides? No, wait. No, hydroxide is a stronger base than alkoxides. For example, alcohols are weaker bases than water. So the conjugate base of an alcohol (like cyclohexanol) is a stronger base than water but weaker than hydroxide? Wait, no. Wait, the order of basicity is: RS- > RO- > HO- > RCOO-.

Wait, no, I think that's not right. Let me think: the basicity order in water is: thiolate (RS-) is a stronger base than alkoxide (RO-), which is stronger than hydroxide (OH-), which is stronger than carboxylate (RCOO-). Wait, no, that can't be. Because in aqueous solution, the conjugate base strength depends on the stability. Thiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide because H2S is a weaker acid than H2O. Wait, H2O has a pKa around 15.5, H2S about 7. So the conjugate base of H2S is the stronger base. So RS- is a stronger base than OH-? Wait, no, because if H2S is a weaker acid (lower pKa), its conjugate base is stronger. Wait, no, wait: the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base.

Wait, H2O has a pKa ~15.5, H2S pKa ~7. So H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. So the conjugate base of H2S (S^(-)) is weaker than the conjugate base of H2O (OH^-). So OH- is a stronger base than S^-. Wait, that can't be right because I remember that in water, RS- is a stronger nucleophile than HO- because it's a weaker base. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. Because nucleophilicity in protic solvents doesn't directly follow basicity. Thiolate ions are bigger and less solvated, so they are better nucleophiles than hydroxide even though they may be weaker bases. For example, in water, the order is RS- > RO- > HO- > RCOO-.

Wait, no. Let me think about pKa values.

The pKa of H2S is about 7, so the conjugate base HS^- has a weaker tendency to accept a proton, but wait, stronger base is better at accepting protons. So HS- would be a stronger base than HO- because H2O has a higher pKa (so its conjugate base is stronger). Wait, no. Wait, the lower the pKa of the acid, the stronger the acid, and the weaker the conjugate base. So for H2O (pKa ~15.5), the base is OH^- (strong base). For H2S (pKa ~7), the base is HS^- (weaker base than OH^-). So OH- is a stronger base than HS^-.

But then why is RS- a better nucleophile in aqueous solution? Because even though it's a weaker base, its larger size and lower charge density make it less solvated, so it's a better nucleophile. So in nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents, the order is: RS- > RO- > HO^- > RCOO^-.

Wait, but RO- is a stronger base than RCOO^- because alcohols are weaker acids than carboxylic acids. So their conjugate bases are stronger. So in the order, after RS-, comes RO- (like cyclohexanolate, which is RO-), then HO-, then RCOO^-.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because in water, the order of nucleophilicity is: RS- > HO- > RO- > RCOO^-.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to find a more accurate way.

In aqueous solution (polar protic), the nucleophilicity order is generally:

- Thiolate (RS⁻) > Hydroxide (OH⁻) > Alkoxide (RO⁻) > Carboxylate (RCOO⁻)

Because hydroxide is more nucleophilic than alkoxides? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. I remember that in water, the order is RS⁻ > RO⁻ > OH⁻. Because alkoxide ions are less solvated than hydroxide? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the smaller the ion, the more it's solvated. Wait, RO⁻ is bigger than OH⁻, so less solvated, more available to attack. Oh wait, that makes sense.

Wait, wait, in the gas phase, where solvation doesn't happen, the order of nucleophilicity follows basicity: stronger bases are better nucleophiles. So in gas phase, RS⁻ > RO⁻ > OH⁻ > RCOO⁻.

But in a polar protic solvent like water, the solvent can stabilize (solvate) the nucleophiles. The more the nucleophile is stabilized, the less reactive it is. So more polarizable and less solvated nucleophiles are better.

So in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is: RS⁻ > RO⁻ > OH⁻ > RCOO⁻.

Because RS⁻ is less solvated than RO⁻, which is less than OH⁻, which is less than RCOO⁻ (which is more stabilized by solvation).

Wait, but wait, I thought that in aqueous solution, the order is RS⁻ > HO⁻ > RO⁻. I'm getting conflicting information.

Another approach: look at pKa values.

The pKa of H2S is about 7. So HS⁻ is the conjugate base. The pKa of an alcohol (like ethanol) is around 19, so ROH has pKa ~19. Its conjugate base RO⁻ is stronger than HS⁻ because the acid (ethanol) is weaker (higher pKa). So RO⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻. But in aqueous solution, which is more nucleophilic?

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity is determined by how well the nucleophile can attack despite being surrounded by solvent molecules.

Thiols (HS⁻) have larger atoms, so they are less solvated than hydroxide ions. So even though RO⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻, in aqueous solution, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than RO⁻.

Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think of specific examples.

In SN2 reactions in water, the nucleophilicity order is often: RS⁻ > OH⁻ > RO⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻.

Wait, no, I think in aqueous solution, the order is RS⁻ > OH⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻, but RO⁻ may be less nucleophilic than OH⁻.

Wait, another approach: in aqueous solution, hydroxide is a good nucleophile, but weaker than thiolate. So the order would be 5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) ?

Wait, no. Because cyclohexanolate is RO⁻, which is more nucleophilic than RCOO⁻, but perhaps less than OH⁻.

Wait, wait, another way. The basicity order in water is: RS⁻ (weaker base than RO⁻?) No, wait, no. The strength of the base depends on the acid. So for HS⁻, the conjugate acid is H2S (pKa ~7). For RO⁻, the conjugate acid is ROH (pKa ~19). Since ROH is a weaker acid than H2S, RO⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻. So RO⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻.

But in aqueous solution, the solvation effect makes HS⁻ a better nucleophile than RO⁻. Because HS⁻ is larger and less solvated, making it a stronger nucleophile despite being a weaker base.

So in aqueous solution, the order is: HS⁻ (ethanethiolate, 5) is the best nucleophile, followed by RO⁻ (cyclohexanolate, 1), then OH⁻ (2), then RCOO⁻ (3), and the worst is the neutral molecule, methanol (4).

Wait, but that would make the order 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.

But that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

The options given are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4

B) 2, 5, 1, 4 and 3

C) 2, 5, 3, 4 and 3

D) 5, 2, 1, 3 and 4

Wait, so according to my latest thought, the order would be 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, but that's not one of the options. Hmm. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me re-examine.

In aqueous solution:

The order of nucleophilicity is: RS⁻ > RO⁻ > HO⁻ > RCOO⁻.

So for the given nucleophiles:

5. Ethanethiolate (RS⁻) — best.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (RO⁻) — next.

2. Hydroxide (HO⁻) — next.

3. Propionate (RCOO⁻) — next.

4. Methanol (neutral) — worst.

So the order is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.

But looking at the options, none of them have that order. The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1, 4 → 5, 2, 3, 1, 4

B) 2, 5, 1, 4, 3 → 2,5,1,4,3

C) 2,5,3,4,3 → Duplicate 3?

D) 5,2,1,3,4 → 5,2,1,3,4.

Wait, so the correct order according to my conclusion is 5,1,2,3,4. But none of the options match that.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I'm wrong in the order. Maybe in aqueous solution, hydroxide is more nucleophilic than RO⁻.

Wait, perhaps I'm incorrect about RO⁻ being a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

Wait, what's the actual order? Let me think about HSAB (Hard Soft Acid Base) theory. Thiolate is a soft base, and in protic solvents, they're better nucleophiles. But for oxygen-based nucleophiles, the order is HO⁻ < RO⁻ < RCOO⁻? No, that can't be. Because in aqueous solution, HO⁻ is more nucleophilic than RO⁻ because RO⁻ is more stabilized.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of specific reactions. For example, in the reaction of alkyl halides with different nucleophiles in aqueous solution.

Consider an SN2 reaction in water. Which is a better nucleophile: HS⁻ or RO⁻?

From what I recall, in aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order is: RS⁻ > RO⁻ > OH⁻.

Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Another approach: the more stabilized the nucleophile is in the solvent, the less reactive it is. So, which is more stabilized?

Hydroxide (OH⁻) is highly solvated in water because it's a small, highly charged ion. RO⁻ is a larger ion, so less solvated than OH⁻. So RO⁻ would be more nucleophilic than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

Wait, that makes sense. So in aqueous solution, the order is: RS⁻ > RO⁻ > OH⁻ > RCOO⁻.

So the order is 5,1,2,3,4.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options given are:

Option D: 5,2,1,3,4.

Which is 5 first, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

If that's the case, then in option D, 2 (hydroxide) comes before 1 (cyclohexanolate). But according to my previous conclusion, RO⁻ should be more nucleophilic than OH⁻.

So why is that? Maybe I'm wrong about RO⁻ being more nucleophilic than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is such that in aqueous solution, hydroxide is more nucleophilic than RO⁻. That would make the order 5,2,1,3,4.

Let me think. For example, in the reaction of 1° alkyl halides with different nucleophiles, in aqueous solution, which is a better nucleophile?

I recall that in SN2 reactions in aqueous solution, OH⁻ is a better nucleophile than RO⁻. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because RO⁻ is a stronger base and should be a better nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent. But in a polar protic solvent, the more stabilized the ion is, the worse the nucleophile.

Wait, then, in aqueous solution, RO⁻ should be a better nucleophile than OH⁻. Because RO⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻, as it's a larger ion.

So, the order would be 5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4.

But none of the options have this.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order in the options is option D, which is 5,2,1,3,4.

So in that case, hydroxide is more nucleophilic than cyclohexanolate.

But that contradicts my previous understanding. So where am I wrong?

Wait, maybe in aqueous solution, the strength of the base isn't the only factor. Solubility and other factors could play a role. Alternatively, perhaps the order of nucleophilicity is determined by the ability to donate electrons, regardless of basicity.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the general order. In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order is: RS⁻ > HO⁻ > RO⁻ > RCOO⁻.

So in that case, 5 (RS⁻) is first, then 2 (HO⁻), then 1 (RO⁻), then 3 (RCOO⁻), then 4 (CH3OH).

Which would make the order 5,2,1,3,4.

Ah, that's option D.

So why is RO⁻ less nucleophilic than HO⁻ in aqueous solution?

Because in aqueous solution, the solvation effect is significant. HO⁻ is more stabilized (solvated) than RO⁻, making it less reactive. But wait, RO⁻ is a larger ion, so maybe it's less solvated than HO⁻, making it more reactive.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this the other way around.

Let me think: the smaller the ion, the more it's solvated. So HO⁻ is small, highly charged, and thus more solvated than RO⁻. Which makes HO⁻ a worse nucleophile than RO⁻ in aqueous solution.

Wait, that would mean in aqueous solution, RO⁻ is a better nucleophile than HO⁻, which would make the order 5>1>2>3>4.

But none of the options have this order. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think of specific reactions. For example, in the reaction between potassium iodide and an alkyl halide in aqueous solution, which nucleophile is better? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the order in aqueous solution is:

Ethanethiolate (5) > Hydroxide (2) > Cyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Which would be option D.

But why? Because in aqueous solution, hydroxide is a better nucleophile than RO⁻. That would suggest that despite RO⁻ being a stronger base, it's less nucleophilic in water because it's more solvated? But that doesn't make sense because RO⁻ is a larger ion.

Wait, maybe because RO⁻ can form hydrogen bonds with water, making them less available as nucleophiles. Hydroxide can form stronger hydrogen bonds, making it less nucleophilic than RO⁻.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for the correct order.

Upon checking, the general order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic) is:

RS⁻ > RO⁻ > HO⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > RCOO⁻.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with what I thought earlier. So according to that, RO⁻ is more nucleophilic than HO⁻ in aqueous solution. So then the order would be 5,1,2,3,4.

But that's not an option. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order for the given nucleophiles is option D.

But I'm not entirely confident. I think I might have to proceed with the best possible answer based on the reasoning that RS⁻ is the best, followed by HO⁻, then RO⁻, then RCOO⁻, then the neutral molecule.

Wait, no. I think the correct order is 5, 2, 1, 3, 4. So option D.

Because, in aqueous solution, the order is RS⁻ (5) is first, then HO⁻ (2), then RO⁻ (1), then RCOO⁻ (3), and the weakest is the neutral methanol (4).

So that's option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of nucleophilicity for the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we must consider the solvent's effects on nucleophilicity. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity is influenced by solvation, polarization, and the ability of the nucleophile to donate electrons. Larger, less solvated ions are generally better nucleophiles in such solvents.

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (RO⁻)**: This is an alkoxide ion, a strong base, and less solvated than hydroxide due to its larger size. It is a good nucleophile in aqueous solution.
2. **Hydroxide (HO⁻)**: A strong base and highly solvated due to its small size and high charge density. Despite this, it is still a good nucleophile in aqueous solution.
3. **Propionate (RCOO⁻)**: A carboxylate ion, which is a weaker base and more stabilized by solvation compared to alkoxides and hydroxide. Thus, it is a poorer nucleophile.
4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule and a poor nucleophile due to the absence of a charge, making it the least reactive.
5. **Ethanethiolate (RS⁻)**: A thiolate ion, which is larger and less solvated than hydroxide. This makes it the most nucleophilic in aqueous solution.

### Order of Nucleophilicity:
In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is determined by the balance between basicity and solvation effects. Larger ions like thiolates are less solvated and more reactive, while smaller ions like hydroxide are more solvated but still reactive. The order is as follows:

**Ethanethiolate (5) > Hydroxide (2) > 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4)**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (5, 2, 3, 1, 4)**: Incorrect, as propionate (3) is less nucleophilic than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1).
- **Option B (2, 5, 1, 4, 3)**: Incorrect, as hydroxide (2) is not more nucleophilic than ethanethiolate (5).
- **Option C (2, 5, 3, 4, 3)**: Incorrect due to duplication and incorrect ordering.
- **Option D (5, 2, 1, 3, 4)**: Correct, as it matches the derived order.

### Final Answer:
The correct order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is **5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
