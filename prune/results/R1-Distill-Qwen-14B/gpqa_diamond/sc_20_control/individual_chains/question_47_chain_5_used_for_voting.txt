Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. I'm given some spectroscopic data: IR and 1H NMR. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So plugging in n=9, m=11, x=2 (O), y=1 (N). Wait, wait, wait. Wait, O is 2 and N is 1. So 2*9 +2 =20. 20 -11 (m) is 9. Then subtract O: 9 -2=7. Subtract N: 7-1=6. Then divided by 2: 6/2=3. So 3 degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, or a ring and a double bond, or maybe two double bonds, etc. Probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 3, since a benzene has three double bonds), so that's one possibility. So the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Now the IR data. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually N-H stretches. The medium to strong intensity suggests either amide or amine groups. Amides typically show N-H stretches around 3300-3500, but they are usually less intense than amines because the N-H in amides is less basic and the hydrogen bonding is stronger. Wait, but sometimes amides can show two peaks, perhaps due to different hydrogen bonding situations. Alternatively, amines would have a broader peak, but maybe here it's a double peak for something else.

Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typical for esters, amides, or perhaps ketones, but less likely. So maybe an ester or amide.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So benzamide has a CONH2 group. Wait, no, benzamide is PhCONH2. So 3-ethoxy would be OCH2CH3 at position 3 on the benzene.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the amide is at the phenyl, so the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3, with the formamide group (HCONH- attached to the ring).

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: That would be PhNH2 with a propionate group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO- attached to something. Wait, the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph? Or maybe it's an ester. Wait, propionate is RCOO-. So 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH-CO-OCH2CH3? Or maybe it's the other way. Wait, no, wait: the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see: phenyl (C6H5), plus a propionate (C3H5O2) group, but if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, perhaps it's PhNH-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, but let me count the carbons: benzene (6) + COO (2) + ethyl (2) from propionate? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so that's 3 carbons. So the substituent would be a propionyl group attached to the amino group. Hmm, maybe.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: That would be benzoate ester. Benzoate is PhCOO-. The 4-aminophenyl group would be PhNH2. So ethyl ester would be PhCOOCH2CH3. Wait, but with an amino group in the para position. So structure is PhNH2 where the COOEt is attached. So the formula would be C8H7NO3 (Ph is 6 carbons, COOEt is 3 carbons: 6+3=9, but wait, wait: benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl ester adds 2 carbons (CH2CH3), so total would be 7+2=9 carbons. The formula would be C9H11NO2? Let me check: Benzoate is PhCOO-. So PhCOOEt is C8H7O2. But wait, plus the amino group? Wait no, the molecule is 4-aminophenyl benzoate? Or the benzoate is at a different position. No, wait the name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So benzoate is the ester group. The benzene has an amino group in the para position relative to the COOEt group. So the structure is PhNH2 with COOEt attached in the para position. So the formula would be C9H10N O2. Wait, because benzoate is C7H5O2, but with an ethyl group, it's C7H5O2 + C2H5 (from ethyl) but wait, the benzoate is C6H5COOEt, so that's 8 carbons (6 from benzene, 2 from COOEt), but wait, COOEt is -O-CO-O-CH2CH3. So the molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2? Let me count: C6H5 is 6 carbons, COOEt is 3 carbons (COO is from the benzoate, but the ethyl is 2 carbons). Wait, no, the benzoate is C6H5COO-, which is 7 carbons. Then the ethyl ester is adding 2 more. So 7+2=9 carbons. The hydrogen count: Benzene (5 H if para-substituted) because the COOEt and amino are on the ring. Wait, let me think: benzene ring has two substituents: NH2 and COOEt. So each substituent takes up one position, so the ring would have four H's. Then, the COOEt group contributes some H's. The ethyl group has 5 H's: the OCH2CH3 has two H's on CH2 and three on CH3, but wait, OCH2CH3 is -OCH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H? Wait, no. The ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the O is attached to CH2, which has two H's, and CH3 has three. So total in ethyl is 2+3=5 H's. So the molecule would have:

Benzene ring: 4 H's (since two substituents)
COOEt: O-C-O and CH2CH3. The carbonyl group has no H, the ester oxygen doesn't add H. The OCH2CH3 contributes 5 H's. The amino group (NH2) has two H's. So total H's: 4 (ring) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) = 11. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Which matches the given formula. So D could be a candidate.

Now looking at the NMR data. Let's go through each option based on the NMR.

The 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is probably a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests two neighboring protons, so likely an ethyl group (OCH2CH3).

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Could be an NH2 group, but it's at 4.0, which is a bit high. Alternatively, it could be an OCH2 group, but OCH2 would typically be around 3.5-4.5, but a broad suggests coupling, but it's a singlet. Alternatively, it could be an amide or amino group. Wait, but the broadness could be from an NH group. However, in D, the NH2 would be on the benzene. But in the NMR, this is a singlet, which is unusual for NH2 protons, which are usually broad or split. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but I'm not sure.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet suggests a coupling of 2 neighboring protons. So perhaps this is a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. So maybe OCH2CH2O, but more likely, this is a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ester group. Wait, in an ester, the structure is O-C-O with the ethyl group. So the ester's oxygen is attached to CH2CH3. So the adjacent CH2 (the one closer to the oxygen) would be split into a quartet because it's next to a CH2CH3 (which has 3H, leading to a quartet). So 4.5 ppm is typical for the CH2 in an ester group, which is adjacent to the oxygen. So that fits with an ester, like OCH2CH3.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. In aromatic regions, this suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets each with 2H indicate that the substituents are in para positions. Because for para substitution, each aromatic proton is equivalent and couples with two protons across the ring, but in the case of a para-disubstituted benzene with two substituents (like amino and carbonyl ester), the ring would have two sets of doublets: the protons ortho to the substituents. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have four protons in two pairs of doublets. For example, in p-substituted benzene, the two protons ortho to substituent A would be one doublet, and the two protons ortho to substituent B would be another doublet. So that fits with the NMR.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would have the benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions. So the ring would have two sets of doublets: the H's ortho to NH2 and the H's ortho to COOEt. That would give the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm signals.

Looking at the NMR:

At 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): could be the protons ortho to the NH2 group. Because NH2 is an activating group, the ortho protons would be deshielded a bit, but I'm not sure about the exact shift. Alternatively, the COOEt group is deactivating, so the ortho protons to that would be more deshielded (higher ppm). So maybe the 8.0 ppm is the H's ortho to COOEt, and the 7.0 is ortho to NH2.

Then, the 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) is the CH2 next to the O in the ester. The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the terminal CH3 in the ethyl group.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a bit tricky. If the molecule had an NH2 group, which is on the benzene, those protons are usually broad singlets. But in D, the NH2 would be attached to the ring. So why is there a peak at 4.0 ppm with 2H? Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps this is the OCH2 group from an ester, but in D, the ester's O is connected to ethyl, not OCH2. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about each option's NMR.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy at position 3) and CONH2. The benzamide would have the NH2 protons as a broad peak, probably around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet (bs, 2H). Wait, but benzamide's NH2 is usually a broad singlet, but that's 2H. In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, but in benzamide, the NH2 is at higher ppm, like around 6-8 maybe? Not sure. Alternatively, the ethoxy group is at 1.20 triplet and 4.0 something. Let me think: the ethoxy group would have OCH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.3, as a quartet. Wait, but in the NMR, there's a triplet at 1.20 (3H), which matches the CH2CH3. Then the quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2 adjacent to the CH3. So, that fits with an ethoxy group.

But wait, in option A, the benzamide would have an NH2 group. So where's the peak for that? The IR has peaks at 3420 and 3325, which would fit the NH2 of the amide. So the NMR should show a peak for the NH2. But the NMR given doesn't have a peak in the 2-4 ppm region for NH2; instead, it has a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). So maybe that's not an amide's NH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an NH group. Wait, in some cases, an amide's NH could appear around 4.0, but I'm not sure. Also, the IR shows 3420 and 3325, which are strong, so maybe two sets of N-H (like in a secondary amide). Wait, secondary amides have two N-H protons, so that would fit the 2H at 4.0. But wait, the 4.0 is a broad singlet. That could be the case for an NH2 group. Hmm.

But wait, in option A, the NH2 is part of the amide group. So the NH2 would be attached to the carbonyl. But amide protons are usually more upfield than free amines. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, which could be the NH2. But then where is the ethoxy group's OCH2?

Wait, the ethoxy group's OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 at around 4.0 as a quartet, but in the NMR, 4.0 is a singlet. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is the OCH2 of ethoxy, and the 4.0 ppm is another group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an NH group. Let me think about each option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the formamide has an NH group attached to the phenyl. The formamide's NH would appear as a singlet, perhaps. The ethoxy group's OCH2CH3 would be around 4.5 ppm as a quartet. The 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH2CH3. Then, the formamide's NH would be where? In formamide, the NH is usually around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak, but that's in the amine region. Alternatively, maybe it's at a lower ppm. Hmm, not sure.

But in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is 2H. So maybe that's the NH group? That doesn't seem right because the NH in formamide is typically a singlet, but 2H would imply two protons. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure could be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's PhNH-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would make it a propionate ester attached to an amino group. Let's see. The propionate ester would have OCH2CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be around 4.5, but the ethyl in the ester would have a CH2CH3 group. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propionamide or something else.

But the given NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H, which suggests a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. So perhaps the ester's OCH2 would be near 4.5. Then the propionate's ethyl would contribute another triplet or quartet elsewhere. I'm a bit confused here.

Looking back, the ethyl group in the ester (like in option D) would have the OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would appear as a quartet at around 4.5 ppm (since it's next to a CH2CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet at 1.20 ppm. That matches the NMR data. So the 4.5 ppm quartet is the OCH2, and the 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH3.

Now, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is confusing. If the structure is option D, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the amino group is on the benzene ring. The amino group's NH2 protons are usually broad, but in the NMR, they don't show up as a peak. Wait, but the NMR given doesn't show a peak for NH2. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the given NMR has a peak at 4.0 ppm for 2H, but option D's amino group would have NH2 protons which are typically broad. But in the NMR, there's no peak around 2-3 ppm for NH2. So maybe this peak is something else.

Alternatively, let me consider the possibility that the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Wait, in which case, that would suggest perhaps an acetal or something else, but I don't see that in the options. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to something else.

Wait, option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let's think about that. The structure would be PhNH-COOCH2CH2CH3. So the propionate ester would have a OCH2CH2CH3 group. The OCH2 would be near 4.5 ppm as a quartet, but wait, the OCH2 would be in a longer chain. Alternatively, the propionate ester's structure is OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. No, wait, the name is 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the propionate is the acid part, so it's PhNH-COOCH2CH2CH3, perhaps. So the ester group would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but in that case, the OCH2CH2CH3 would appear as a triplet at around 1.6 ppm (for the CH2 next to the COO) and quartet around 4.0-4.3 for the OCH2. But in the NMR, the 4.5 is a quartet, and 1.20 is a triplet. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The 1H NMR for option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) would have:

- The ethyl group: triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2CH3).
- The amino group: NH2 protons. But in the NMR provided, the peaks are at 1.20, 4.0, 4.5, 7.0, and 8.0. So where's the NH2? That's a problem.

Alternate possibilities: perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and doesn't show up in the NMR? Or perhaps it's a broad peak that's not visible as a separate peak. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not present because it's a different functional group.

Wait, looking at the IR spectrum: strong bands at 3420 and 3325. Those are two N-H stretches, which suggests an amide (two N-H) or an amine (two N-H), but amides usually have lower frequency for N-H. But the 3420 and 3325 could be from an amine, but the presence of a carbonyl suggests an amide or ester.

Wait, in option D, the NH2 is a primary amine. Primary amines usually have N-H stretches around 3300-3500, which matches the IR data. So the 3420 and 3325 could be the two N-H of the amine. But then, where is the peak in the NMR for those H's?

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2 group. NH2 protons are usually broad, but in the NMR, 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. That would fit with NH2. So, why is it at 4.0? Wait, primary amines' NH2 protons are usually around 1-3 ppm, but sometimes they can be upfield. Alternatively, if the amine is part of a ring or conjugated, the shift could be higher. But 4.0 is a bit high.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of being adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, the NH2 may shift upfield. Wait, in option D, the amino group is para to the carbonyl ester. So perhaps the NH2 is deshielded, appearing at a higher ppm.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me think about the other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the formamide has a NH group (one H). The IR would show a peak around 3300 (for the NH). But the IR has two peaks, which would suggest two N-H groups. So maybe that's not it. Unless it's an amide with two N-H, but formamide has only one N-H. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 (position 3) and CONH2. So the CONH2 would have two N-H protons. So their NMR would show a broad peak for 2H, perhaps around 3.5-4.5 ppm. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, which could fit.

The ethoxy group would have OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm, and the CH3 would be a triplet at 1.20. That matches the NMR data.

So in option A, the NMR should have:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): CH2CH3 of ethoxy.
- 4.5 (q, 2H): OCH2 of ethoxy.
- 4.0 (bs, 2H): NH2 of benzamide.
- The aromatic protons: in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the ethoxy is at position 3, and the CONH2 is at position 1? So the ring would have substitution at positions 1 and 3. That would make the ring a 1,3-disubstituted benzene. The aromatic protons would then be at positions 2,4,5,6. Wait, but in that case, the protons would not be in a para arrangement. So the aromatic signals would not be two doublets each for 2H. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that lead to two doublets, perhaps.

Wait, the 1H NMR for option A would have the aromatic protons as a multiplet, perhaps. But in the given NMR, the aromatic region is two doublets, each 2H. That suggests a para-disubstituted benzene, which is the case for option D, but not for option A.

Wait, that's a problem. So option A is 3-ethoxybenzamide. So the substituents are at positions 1 (CONH2) and 3 (OCH2CH3). So the ring would have substituents at meta positions. The aromatic H's would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Since they're in meta positions, the aromatic protons would not be in pairs of doublets. They might show up as a multiplet. But in the given NMR, the aromatic H's are two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So that would not fit with option A.

So perhaps option D is better, with para substitution. But then, the NH2 would have to have a peak in the NMR. But according to the given NMR, I don't see a peak for the NH2. So maybe the NH2 is deprotonated or not visible? Or perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not the NH2, but something else.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the integration. The NMR has:

1.20 (t, 3H) → CH2CH3 → ethyl group.

4.0 (bs, 2H) → ?

4.5 (q, 2H) → likely the OCH2 of ethyl ester.

7.0 (d, 2H) → aromatic ortho to substituent.

8.0 (d, 2H) → aromatic ortho to another substituent.

So that suggests the benzene ring has two substituents, each causing a pair of doublets. So substituents are in para positions. So the ring is para-disubstituted, which is the case for option D (4-aminobenzoate) and option B (4-ethoxyphenyl formamide, if the substituents are in para).

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would have an ethoxy group at position 4 and a formamide group attached to that phenyl. Wait, no, the formamide is attached to the phenyl. Wait, the name is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is HCONH- attached to the phenyl group which has an ethoxy at position 4. So the benzene has two substituents: OCH2CH3 at position 4, and HCONH- at position 1? No, wait, wait, the formamide is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4? Or perhaps the formamide is at position 4 and the ethoxy at position 1? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure for option B would be: the phenyl group has an ethoxy at position 4, and the formamide group is attached to the same carbon as the ethoxy? No, wait, the formamide is attached to the phenyl ring. So the structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3, with the substituents in para positions. So the ring would have HCONH- at position 1 and OCH2CH3 at position 4. So the ring would be para-disubstituted. Then, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but that would lead to two doublets in the NMR. So the aromatic region would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's what the given NMR shows. So the aromatic H's would be ortho to each substituent. So in this case, the H's ortho to HCONH- and the H's ortho to OCH2CH3 would each be a doublet, as their coupling partners are across the ring.

So in option B, the aromatic NMR would be two doublets, which matches the data. Then, the ethoxy group would have OCH2CH3, giving the triplet at 1.20 and quartet at 4.5. The formamide NH would have protons. But formamide's NH is typically a singlet around 8-9 ppm. But in the given NMR, there's no peak in that region except the aromatic ones. So perhaps this is a problem.

But in the IR data, the strong bands at 3420 and 3325 suggest two N-H groups. For option B, the formamide has only one N-H. So that would only give one N-H stretch. But the IR data has two. So that's a problem for option B.

Wait, then maybe the problem is that I'm considering the wrong options. Let me think again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2 with COOEt in para position. So the ring has two substituents: NH2 and COOEt. Then, the aromatic H's would be ortho to each substituent, leading to two doublets (each 2H). That matches the NMR.

The ethoxy group (COOEt) would give the quartet at 4.5 ppm (the OCH2) and triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3). So that matches.

The NH2 group has two protons, which would have N-H stretches in IR (they do, as per the data). Now, where are these protons in the NMR? They should appear as a broad peak. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm peak is 2H, broad singlet. So that could be the NH2 group.

Wait, but NH2 protons are usually around 1-3 ppm. Why would they appear at 4.0? Maybe because of hydrogen bonding or being part of an amine adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, when the amine is part of an aromatic ring, the NH2 protons can be deshielded and appear downfield. For example, in aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons can be around 4-5 ppm. So in the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is ortho to the carbonyl, which is meta directing, but the NH2 is on the ring. So the NH2 protons could be deshielded and appear around 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. That would fit the 4.0 ppm peak.

So putting it all together:

- IR shows two N-H (from amine) and a carbonyl (ester).
- NMR shows ethoxy group (1.20 triplet, 4.5 quartet).
- Aromatic protons in para substitution (two doublets).
- The 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2.

So this fits option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

But wait, the molecular formula for option D is C9H11NO2. Let me confirm: benzoate (C7H5O2) plus ethyl (C2H5) gives C9H10O2. But the formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, so that would mean an additional N and one more H. Oh wait, because the amino group is NH2, which contributes 2 H and 1 N. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl adds 2 C, 5 H (since OCH2CH3 is 2 C and 5 H: O attached to CH2CH3. Plus the NH2 adds 2 H and 1 N. So total:

C:7 (benzoate) +2 (ethyl) =9 C.

H:5 (benzoate) +5 (ethyl OCH2CH3) + 2 (NH2) =12? Wait, but that doesn't match the formula. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the benzoate is C6H5COOEt. So C6H5 is 6 C, COOEt is 3 C (COO plus ethyl). So total 9 C. H calculation: C6H5 (5 H) + COOEt (O-C-O-CH2CH3). The COOEt group has OCH2CH3 which contributes 5 H (2 from CH2 and 3 from CH3). The NH2 group contributes 2 H. So total H:5 (benzene) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) =12 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H vs 11, discrepancy.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C6H4 (with substituents) attached to COOEt and NH2. So the structure is:

Ph (C6H5) → but with substituents. The benzoate is C6H5COOEt, but with an NH2 replacing one H on the benzene.

So the benzene has two substituents: COOEt and NH2.

So the molecular formula would be: C6H5 (but with two substituents: COOEt and NH2) → so the benzene is C6H4.

So the formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be:

C6H4 (COOEt)(NH2). So C6H4 →6 C, COOEt →3 C (COO and Et), NH2 →0 C. Total C:9.

Hydrogen: C6H4 (4 H) + COOEt (5 H from OCH2CH3) + NH2 (2 H) = 4+5+2=11 H. So formula is C9H11NO2. Which matches.

So that makes sense. So the structure is correct.

So the NMR for option D would have the NH2 as a broad peak at around 4.0 ppm (2H), the ethoxy as triplet at 1.20 and quartet at 4.5, and the aromatic as two doublets. So that fits the given data.

Looking back at the other options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide → would have CONH2 and OCH2CH3 in meta positions. The aromatic would not be two doublets, which doesn't fit NMR.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide → has HCONH- and OCH2CH3 in para positions. The aromatic would fit as two doublets. But the IR needs two N-H, which this option doesn't have (only one in formamide).

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate → would have NH2 and COOEt in para. But the ethyl group would be longer (propionate). The NMR shows 1.20 triplet, suggesting a CH2CH3 group, which would fit ethyl, not propyl. So option C is less likely.

So the correct answer is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

### Analysis of Options
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The aromatic protons would not appear as two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm) because the substituents (CONH2 and OCH2CH3) are in meta positions, leading to a more complex aromatic region. 
- The ethoxy group would produce signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which match the NMR data, but the aromatic region does not fit the observed data.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatch in aromatic region.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.
- The aromatic protons would appear as two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm) due to para substitution (HCONH- and OCH2CH3). 
- The ethoxy group would produce signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which match the NMR data.
- However, the IR data shows two N-H stretches (3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹), which are inconsistent with formamide, as it has only one N-H group.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatch in IR data.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: Aminophenyl group (NH2) with a propionate ester (-COOCH2CH2CH3).
- The ethyl group in the propionate ester would produce signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which match the NMR data.
- However, the propionate ester would have a longer chain (CH2CH2CH3), which would produce additional signals not observed in the NMR data.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatch in NMR data.

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: A benzoate ester (COOCH2CH3) with an NH2 group in the para position on the benzene ring.
- The ethoxy group in the ester produces signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which match the NMR data.
- The NH2 group on the benzene ring explains the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), as NH2 protons can appear downfield due to hydrogen bonding and deshielding.
- The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The IR data matches, as the two N-H stretches correspond to the NH2 group, and the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the ester.
- **Fits all the given data.**

### Conclusion
The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. I'm given some spectroscopic data: IR and 1H NMR. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So plugging in n=9, m=11, x=2 (O), y=1 (N). Wait, wait, wait. Wait, O is 2 and N is 1. So 2*9 +2 =20. 20 -11 (m) is 9. Then subtract O: 9 -2=7. Subtract N: 7-1=6. Then divided by 2: 6/2=3. So 3 degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, or a ring and a double bond, or maybe two double bonds, etc. Probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 3, since a benzene has three double bonds), so that's one possibility. So the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Now the IR data. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually N-H stretches. The medium to strong intensity suggests either amide or amine groups. Amides typically show N-H stretches around 3300-3500, but they are usually less intense than amines because the N-H in amides is less basic and the hydrogen bonding is stronger. Wait, but sometimes amides can show two peaks, perhaps due to different hydrogen bonding situations. Alternatively, amines would have a broader peak, but maybe here it's a double peak for something else.

Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typical for esters, amides, or perhaps ketones, but less likely. So maybe an ester or amide.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So benzamide has a CONH2 group. Wait, no, benzamide is PhCONH2. So 3-ethoxy would be OCH2CH3 at position 3 on the benzene.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the amide is at the phenyl, so the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3, with the formamide group (HCONH- attached to the ring).

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: That would be PhNH2 with a propionate group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO- attached to something. Wait, the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph? Or maybe it's an ester. Wait, propionate is RCOO-. So 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH-CO-OCH2CH3? Or maybe it's the other way. Wait, no, wait: the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see: phenyl (C6H5), plus a propionate (C3H5O2) group, but if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, perhaps it's PhNH-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, but let me count the carbons: benzene (6) + COO (2) + ethyl (2) from propionate? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so that's 3 carbons. So the substituent would be a propionyl group attached to the amino group. Hmm, maybe.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: That would be benzoate ester. Benzoate is PhCOO-. The 4-aminophenyl group would be PhNH2. So ethyl ester would be PhCOOCH2CH3. Wait, but with an amino group in the para position. So structure is PhNH2 where the COOEt is attached. So the formula would be C8H7NO3 (Ph is 6 carbons, COOEt is 3 carbons: 6+3=9, but wait, wait: benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl ester adds 2 carbons (CH2CH3), so total would be 7+2=9 carbons. The formula would be C9H11NO2? Let me check: Benzoate is PhCOO-. So PhCOOEt is C8H7O2. But wait, plus the amino group? Wait no, the molecule is 4-aminophenyl benzoate? Or the benzoate is at a different position. No, wait the name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So benzoate is the ester group. The benzene has an amino group in the para position relative to the COOEt group. So the structure is PhNH2 with COOEt attached in the para position. So the formula would be C9H10N O2. Wait, because benzoate is C7H5O2, but with an ethyl group, it's C7H5O2 + C2H5 (from ethyl) but wait, the benzoate is C6H5COOEt, so that's 8 carbons (6 from benzene, 2 from COOEt), but wait, COOEt is -O-CO-O-CH2CH3. So the molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2? Let me count: C6H5 is 6 carbons, COOEt is 3 carbons (COO is from the benzoate, but the ethyl is 2 carbons). Wait, no, the benzoate is C6H5COO-, which is 7 carbons. Then the ethyl ester is adding 2 more. So 7+2=9 carbons. The hydrogen count: Benzene (5 H if para-substituted) because the COOEt and amino are on the ring. Wait, let me think: benzene ring has two substituents: NH2 and COOEt. So each substituent takes up one position, so the ring would have four H's. Then, the COOEt group contributes some H's. The ethyl group has 5 H's: the OCH2CH3 has two H's on CH2 and three on CH3, but wait, OCH2CH3 is -OCH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H? Wait, no. The ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the O is attached to CH2, which has two H's, and CH3 has three. So total in ethyl is 2+3=5 H's. So the molecule would have:

Benzene ring: 4 H's (since two substituents)
COOEt: O-C-O and CH2CH3. The carbonyl group has no H, the ester oxygen doesn't add H. The OCH2CH3 contributes 5 H's. The amino group (NH2) has two H's. So total H's: 4 (ring) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) = 11. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Which matches the given formula. So D could be a candidate.

Now looking at the NMR data. Let's go through each option based on the NMR.

The 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is probably a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests two neighboring protons, so likely an ethyl group (OCH2CH3).

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Could be an NH2 group, but it's at 4.0, which is a bit high. Alternatively, it could be an OCH2 group, but OCH2 would typically be around 3.5-4.5, but a broad suggests coupling, but it's a singlet. Alternatively, it could be an amide or amino group. Wait, but the broadness could be from an NH group. However, in D, the NH2 would be on the benzene. But in the NMR, this is a singlet, which is unusual for NH2 protons, which are usually broad or split. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but I'm not sure.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet suggests a coupling of 2 neighboring protons. So perhaps this is a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. So maybe OCH2CH2O, but more likely, this is a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ester group. Wait, in an ester, the structure is O-C-O with the ethyl group. So the ester's oxygen is attached to CH2CH3. So the adjacent CH2 (the one closer to the oxygen) would be split into a quartet because it's next to a CH2CH3 (which has 3H, leading to a quartet). So 4.5 ppm is typical for the CH2 in an ester group, which is adjacent to the oxygen. So that fits with an ester, like OCH2CH3.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. In aromatic regions, this suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets each with 2H indicate that the substituents are in para positions. Because for para substitution, each aromatic proton is equivalent and couples with two protons across the ring, but in the case of a para-disubstituted benzene with two substituents (like amino and carbonyl ester), the ring would have two sets of doublets: the protons ortho to the substituents. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have four protons in two pairs of doublets. For example, in p-substituted benzene, the two protons ortho to substituent A would be one doublet, and the two protons ortho to substituent B would be another doublet. So that fits with the NMR.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would have the benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions. So the ring would have two sets of doublets: the H's ortho to NH2 and the H's ortho to COOEt. That would give the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm signals.

Looking at the NMR:

At 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): could be the protons ortho to the NH2 group. Because NH2 is an activating group, the ortho protons would be deshielded a bit, but I'm not sure about the exact shift. Alternatively, the COOEt group is deactivating, so the ortho protons to that would be more deshielded (higher ppm). So maybe the 8.0 ppm is the H's ortho to COOEt, and the 7.0 is ortho to NH2.

Then, the 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) is the CH2 next to the O in the ester. The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the terminal CH3 in the ethyl group.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a bit tricky. If the molecule had an NH2 group, which is on the benzene, those protons are usually broad singlets. But in D, the NH2 would be attached to the ring. So why is there a peak at 4.0 ppm with 2H? Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps this is the OCH2 group from an ester, but in D, the ester's O is connected to ethyl, not OCH2. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about each option's NMR.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy at position 3) and CONH2. The benzamide would have the NH2 protons as a broad peak, probably around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet (bs, 2H). Wait, but benzamide's NH2 is usually a broad singlet, but that's 2H. In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, but in benzamide, the NH2 is at higher ppm, like around 6-8 maybe? Not sure. Alternatively, the ethoxy group is at 1.20 triplet and 4.0 something. Let me think: the ethoxy group would have OCH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.3, as a quartet. Wait, but in the NMR, there's a triplet at 1.20 (3H), which matches the CH2CH3. Then the quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2 adjacent to the CH3. So, that fits with an ethoxy group.

But wait, in option A, the benzamide would have an NH2 group. So where's the peak for that? The IR has peaks at 3420 and 3325, which would fit the NH2 of the amide. So the NMR should show a peak for the NH2. But the NMR given doesn't have a peak in the 2-4 ppm region for NH2; instead, it has a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). So maybe that's not an amide's NH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an NH group. Wait, in some cases, an amide's NH could appear around 4.0, but I'm not sure. Also, the IR shows 3420 and 3325, which are strong, so maybe two sets of N-H (like in a secondary amide). Wait, secondary amides have two N-H protons, so that would fit the 2H at 4.0. But wait, the 4.0 is a broad singlet. That could be the case for an NH2 group. Hmm.

But wait, in option A, the NH2 is part of the amide group. So the NH2 would be attached to the carbonyl. But amide protons are usually more upfield than free amines. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, which could be the NH2. But then where is the ethoxy group's OCH2?

Wait, the ethoxy group's OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 at around 4.0 as a quartet, but in the NMR, 4.0 is a singlet. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is the OCH2 of ethoxy, and the 4.0 ppm is another group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an NH group. Let me think about each option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the formamide has an NH group attached to the phenyl. The formamide's NH would appear as a singlet, perhaps. The ethoxy group's OCH2CH3 would be around 4.5 ppm as a quartet. The 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH2CH3. Then, the formamide's NH would be where? In formamide, the NH is usually around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak, but that's in the amine region. Alternatively, maybe it's at a lower ppm. Hmm, not sure.

But in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is 2H. So maybe that's the NH group? That doesn't seem right because the NH in formamide is typically a singlet, but 2H would imply two protons. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure could be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's PhNH-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would make it a propionate ester attached to an amino group. Let's see. The propionate ester would have OCH2CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be around 4.5, but the ethyl in the ester would have a CH2CH3 group. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propionamide or something else.

But the given NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H, which suggests a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. So perhaps the ester's OCH2 would be near 4.5. Then the propionate's ethyl would contribute another triplet or quartet elsewhere. I'm a bit confused here.

Looking back, the ethyl group in the ester (like in option D) would have the OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would appear as a quartet at around 4.5 ppm (since it's next to a CH2CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet at 1.20 ppm. That matches the NMR data. So the 4.5 ppm quartet is the OCH2, and the 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH3.

Now, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is confusing. If the structure is option D, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the amino group is on the benzene ring. The amino group's NH2 protons are usually broad, but in the NMR, they don't show up as a peak. Wait, but the NMR given doesn't show a peak for NH2. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the given NMR has a peak at 4.0 ppm for 2H, but option D's amino group would have NH2 protons which are typically broad. But in the NMR, there's no peak around 2-3 ppm for NH2. So maybe this peak is something else.

Alternatively, let me consider the possibility that the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Wait, in which case, that would suggest perhaps an acetal or something else, but I don't see that in the options. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to something else.

Wait, option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let's think about that. The structure would be PhNH-COOCH2CH2CH3. So the propionate ester would have a OCH2CH2CH3 group. The OCH2 would be near 4.5 ppm as a quartet, but wait, the OCH2 would be in a longer chain. Alternatively, the propionate ester's structure is OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. No, wait, the name is 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the propionate is the acid part, so it's PhNH-COOCH2CH2CH3, perhaps. So the ester group would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but in that case, the OCH2CH2CH3 would appear as a triplet at around 1.6 ppm (for the CH2 next to the COO) and quartet around 4.0-4.3 for the OCH2. But in the NMR, the 4.5 is a quartet, and 1.20 is a triplet. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The 1H NMR for option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) would have:

- The ethyl group: triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2CH3).
- The amino group: NH2 protons. But in the NMR provided, the peaks are at 1.20, 4.0, 4.5, 7.0, and 8.0. So where's the NH2? That's a problem.

Alternate possibilities: perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and doesn't show up in the NMR? Or perhaps it's a broad peak that's not visible as a separate peak. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not present because it's a different functional group.

Wait, looking at the IR spectrum: strong bands at 3420 and 3325. Those are two N-H stretches, which suggests an amide (two N-H) or an amine (two N-H), but amides usually have lower frequency for N-H. But the 3420 and 3325 could be from an amine, but the presence of a carbonyl suggests an amide or ester.

Wait, in option D, the NH2 is a primary amine. Primary amines usually have N-H stretches around 3300-3500, which matches the IR data. So the 3420 and 3325 could be the two N-H of the amine. But then, where is the peak in the NMR for those H's?

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2 group. NH2 protons are usually broad, but in the NMR, 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. That would fit with NH2. So, why is it at 4.0? Wait, primary amines' NH2 protons are usually around 1-3 ppm, but sometimes they can be upfield. Alternatively, if the amine is part of a ring or conjugated, the shift could be higher. But 4.0 is a bit high.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of being adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, the NH2 may shift upfield. Wait, in option D, the amino group is para to the carbonyl ester. So perhaps the NH2 is deshielded, appearing at a higher ppm.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me think about the other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the formamide has a NH group (one H). The IR would show a peak around 3300 (for the NH). But the IR has two peaks, which would suggest two N-H groups. So maybe that's not it. Unless it's an amide with two N-H, but formamide has only one N-H. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 (position 3) and CONH2. So the CONH2 would have two N-H protons. So their NMR would show a broad peak for 2H, perhaps around 3.5-4.5 ppm. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, which could fit.

The ethoxy group would have OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm, and the CH3 would be a triplet at 1.20. That matches the NMR data.

So in option A, the NMR should have:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): CH2CH3 of ethoxy.
- 4.5 (q, 2H): OCH2 of ethoxy.
- 4.0 (bs, 2H): NH2 of benzamide.
- The aromatic protons: in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the ethoxy is at position 3, and the CONH2 is at position 1? So the ring would have substitution at positions 1 and 3. That would make the ring a 1,3-disubstituted benzene. The aromatic protons would then be at positions 2,4,5,6. Wait, but in that case, the protons would not be in a para arrangement. So the aromatic signals would not be two doublets each for 2H. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that lead to two doublets, perhaps.

Wait, the 1H NMR for option A would have the aromatic protons as a multiplet, perhaps. But in the given NMR, the aromatic region is two doublets, each 2H. That suggests a para-disubstituted benzene, which is the case for option D, but not for option A.

Wait, that's a problem. So option A is 3-ethoxybenzamide. So the substituents are at positions 1 (CONH2) and 3 (OCH2CH3). So the ring would have substituents at meta positions. The aromatic H's would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Since they're in meta positions, the aromatic protons would not be in pairs of doublets. They might show up as a multiplet. But in the given NMR, the aromatic H's are two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So that would not fit with option A.

So perhaps option D is better, with para substitution. But then, the NH2 would have to have a peak in the NMR. But according to the given NMR, I don't see a peak for the NH2. So maybe the NH2 is deprotonated or not visible? Or perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not the NH2, but something else.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the integration. The NMR has:

1.20 (t, 3H) → CH2CH3 → ethyl group.

4.0 (bs, 2H) → ?

4.5 (q, 2H) → likely the OCH2 of ethyl ester.

7.0 (d, 2H) → aromatic ortho to substituent.

8.0 (d, 2H) → aromatic ortho to another substituent.

So that suggests the benzene ring has two substituents, each causing a pair of doublets. So substituents are in para positions. So the ring is para-disubstituted, which is the case for option D (4-aminobenzoate) and option B (4-ethoxyphenyl formamide, if the substituents are in para).

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would have an ethoxy group at position 4 and a formamide group attached to that phenyl. Wait, no, the formamide is attached to the phenyl. Wait, the name is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is HCONH- attached to the phenyl group which has an ethoxy at position 4. So the benzene has two substituents: OCH2CH3 at position 4, and HCONH- at position 1? No, wait, wait, the formamide is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4? Or perhaps the formamide is at position 4 and the ethoxy at position 1? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure for option B would be: the phenyl group has an ethoxy at position 4, and the formamide group is attached to the same carbon as the ethoxy? No, wait, the formamide is attached to the phenyl ring. So the structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3, with the substituents in para positions. So the ring would have HCONH- at position 1 and OCH2CH3 at position 4. So the ring would be para-disubstituted. Then, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but that would lead to two doublets in the NMR. So the aromatic region would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's what the given NMR shows. So the aromatic H's would be ortho to each substituent. So in this case, the H's ortho to HCONH- and the H's ortho to OCH2CH3 would each be a doublet, as their coupling partners are across the ring.

So in option B, the aromatic NMR would be two doublets, which matches the data. Then, the ethoxy group would have OCH2CH3, giving the triplet at 1.20 and quartet at 4.5. The formamide NH would have protons. But formamide's NH is typically a singlet around 8-9 ppm. But in the given NMR, there's no peak in that region except the aromatic ones. So perhaps this is a problem.

But in the IR data, the strong bands at 3420 and 3325 suggest two N-H groups. For option B, the formamide has only one N-H. So that would only give one N-H stretch. But the IR data has two. So that's a problem for option B.

Wait, then maybe the problem is that I'm considering the wrong options. Let me think again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2 with COOEt in para position. So the ring has two substituents: NH2 and COOEt. Then, the aromatic H's would be ortho to each substituent, leading to two doublets (each 2H). That matches the NMR.

The ethoxy group (COOEt) would give the quartet at 4.5 ppm (the OCH2) and triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3). So that matches.

The NH2 group has two protons, which would have N-H stretches in IR (they do, as per the data). Now, where are these protons in the NMR? They should appear as a broad peak. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm peak is 2H, broad singlet. So that could be the NH2 group.

Wait, but NH2 protons are usually around 1-3 ppm. Why would they appear at 4.0? Maybe because of hydrogen bonding or being part of an amine adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, when the amine is part of an aromatic ring, the NH2 protons can be deshielded and appear downfield. For example, in aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons can be around 4-5 ppm. So in the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is ortho to the carbonyl, which is meta directing, but the NH2 is on the ring. So the NH2 protons could be deshielded and appear around 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. That would fit the 4.0 ppm peak.

So putting it all together:

- IR shows two N-H (from amine) and a carbonyl (ester).
- NMR shows ethoxy group (1.20 triplet, 4.5 quartet).
- Aromatic protons in para substitution (two doublets).
- The 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2.

So this fits option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

But wait, the molecular formula for option D is C9H11NO2. Let me confirm: benzoate (C7H5O2) plus ethyl (C2H5) gives C9H10O2. But the formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, so that would mean an additional N and one more H. Oh wait, because the amino group is NH2, which contributes 2 H and 1 N. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl adds 2 C, 5 H (since OCH2CH3 is 2 C and 5 H: O attached to CH2CH3. Plus the NH2 adds 2 H and 1 N. So total:

C:7 (benzoate) +2 (ethyl) =9 C.

H:5 (benzoate) +5 (ethyl OCH2CH3) + 2 (NH2) =12? Wait, but that doesn't match the formula. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the benzoate is C6H5COOEt. So C6H5 is 6 C, COOEt is 3 C (COO plus ethyl). So total 9 C. H calculation: C6H5 (5 H) + COOEt (O-C-O-CH2CH3). The COOEt group has OCH2CH3 which contributes 5 H (2 from CH2 and 3 from CH3). The NH2 group contributes 2 H. So total H:5 (benzene) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) =12 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H vs 11, discrepancy.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C6H4 (with substituents) attached to COOEt and NH2. So the structure is:

Ph (C6H5) → but with substituents. The benzoate is C6H5COOEt, but with an NH2 replacing one H on the benzene.

So the benzene has two substituents: COOEt and NH2.

So the molecular formula would be: C6H5 (but with two substituents: COOEt and NH2) → so the benzene is C6H4.

So the formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be:

C6H4 (COOEt)(NH2). So C6H4 →6 C, COOEt →3 C (COO and Et), NH2 →0 C. Total C:9.

Hydrogen: C6H4 (4 H) + COOEt (5 H from OCH2CH3) + NH2 (2 H) = 4+5+2=11 H. So formula is C9H11NO2. Which matches.

So that makes sense. So the structure is correct.

So the NMR for option D would have the NH2 as a broad peak at around 4.0 ppm (2H), the ethoxy as triplet at 1.20 and quartet at 4.5, and the aromatic as two doublets. So that fits the given data.

Looking back at the other options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide → would have CONH2 and OCH2CH3 in meta positions. The aromatic would not be two doublets, which doesn't fit NMR.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide → has HCONH- and OCH2CH3 in para positions. The aromatic would fit as two doublets. But the IR needs two N-H, which this option doesn't have (only one in formamide).

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate → would have NH2 and COOEt in para. But the ethyl group would be longer (propionate). The NMR shows 1.20 triplet, suggesting a CH2CH3 group, which would fit ethyl, not propyl. So option C is less likely.

So the correct answer is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

### Analysis of Options
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The aromatic protons would not appear as two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm) because the substituents (CONH2 and OCH2CH3) are in meta positions, leading to a more complex aromatic region. 
- The ethoxy group would produce signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which match the NMR data, but the aromatic region does not fit the observed data.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatch in aromatic region.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.
- The aromatic protons would appear as two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm) due to para substitution (HCONH- and OCH2CH3). 
- The ethoxy group would produce signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which match the NMR data.
- However, the IR data shows two N-H stretches (3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹), which are inconsistent with formamide, as it has only one N-H group.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatch in IR data.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: Aminophenyl group (NH2) with a propionate ester (-COOCH2CH2CH3).
- The ethyl group in the propionate ester would produce signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which match the NMR data.
- However, the propionate ester would have a longer chain (CH2CH2CH3), which would produce additional signals not observed in the NMR data.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatch in NMR data.

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: A benzoate ester (COOCH2CH3) with an NH2 group in the para position on the benzene ring.
- The ethoxy group in the ester produces signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which match the NMR data.
- The NH2 group on the benzene ring explains the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), as NH2 protons can appear downfield due to hydrogen bonding and deshielding.
- The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The IR data matches, as the two N-H stretches correspond to the NH2 group, and the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the ester.
- **Fits all the given data.**
