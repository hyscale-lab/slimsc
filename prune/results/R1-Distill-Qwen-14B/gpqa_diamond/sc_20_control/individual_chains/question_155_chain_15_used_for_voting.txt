Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to parse it. So, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I'll need to compute both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared. Then, take the square root of their difference.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Oh right, because the state is given as a column vector which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. So the state is |ψ⟩, and it's a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]

So I can represent this as a vector in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that means the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should make things easier because in this basis, the matrix for P_z is diagonal.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. The matrix for P_z is given as:
P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
          [0, 0, 0],
          [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which are the standard basis vectors here. So the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these eigenvectors, which are |1⟩, |0⟩, |-1⟩ or something like that. So the components of |ψ⟩ are the coefficients of these eigenstates.

So the state |ψ⟩ is a combination of the first, second, and third eigenstates of P_z. So to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, weighted by the square of the coefficients (since the eigenstates are orthonormal).

Wait, but wait, the state is given as a column vector, so the components are the expansion coefficients in the P_z eigenbasis. So |ψ⟩ = c₁|1⟩ + c₂|0⟩ + c₃|-1⟩, where c₁ is -1/2, c₂ is 1/sqrt(2), and c₃ is -1/2.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be |c₁|^2 * ħ + |c₂|^2 * 0 + |c₃|^2 * (-ħ).

Because each eigenstate |1⟩ has eigenvalue ħ, |0⟩ has 0, and |-1⟩ has -ħ.

Let me compute that. |c₁|² is (1/2)² = 1/4. Similarly, |c₃|² is 1/4. And |c₂|² is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) * ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 -1/4) ħ = 0. Oh, so the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, for the expectation value of P_z squared, ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So for the eigenstates, each c_i squared times (eigenvalue)^2.

So P_z squared is [ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
                   [ 0, 0, 0 ],
                   [ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] ] = [ [ ħ², 0, 0 ], [0, 0, 0], [0,0, ħ² ] ]

Wait, no, because (-ħ)^2 is ħ². So each diagonal entry is squared. So the eigenvalues for P_z squared are (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is |c₁|^2*(ħ²) + |c₂|^2*(0) + |c₃|^2*(ħ²).

Plugging the values in, that's (1/4) ħ² + 0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). We already have ⟨P_z⟩ = 0, so it's sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ. Which is ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches what I got.

Wait, let me just double-check the calculations. The state components are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So |c₁|² is (1/2)^2 → wait, no, (-1/2)^2 is 1/4. Similarly for c₃. And c₂ is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

So yes, the calculations seem right. So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2).

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, represented by the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The coefficients of $|\psi\rangle$ in the eigenbasis of $P_z$ are $c_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Calculating the squared coefficients:
\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these into the formula:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal in the same basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the squared coefficients:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
