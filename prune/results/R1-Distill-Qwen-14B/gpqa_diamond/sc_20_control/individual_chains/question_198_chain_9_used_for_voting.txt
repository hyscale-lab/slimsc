Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because I thought stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but here they go up and then down. Hmm, maybe it's about the order of complexes?

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. So I'm guessing blue refers to a specific complex, maybe the one with two SCN- ligands? Because I remember that [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ has different colors based on n. Blue could be the dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So the species would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. 

Stability constants (β) are for the formation of complexes. Each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me recall how stability constants work. The stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For the nth complex, the reaction is Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^2−. Wait, or maybe it's [Co(SCN)_n]^m+? I think the charge depends on the number of ligands. Each SCN- is -1, so for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, the charge would be 2+ because Co is +2 and each SCN- is -1, so 2+ + n*(-1) = charge. So if n=2, the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral. But wait, that's not possible because the complex would need to be in solution, maybe with some counterions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps it's not crucial for calculating the percentages.

The main point is to find the fraction of the Co species that are in the dithiocyanato form, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) perhaps? Wait, maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where m is 2+ minus n times -1. So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ (since 2+ + (-1) = +1). For n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (since 2-2=0). For n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- (2-3=-1). For n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (2-4=-2). Oh, I think that makes sense.

But the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 species. So we're looking for the concentration of this species compared to all the other possible cobalt-containing species.

To find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then sum them up. The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions involved.

The general approach for these problems is to use the stepwise formation constants to calculate the distribution of each species. The fraction f_n of the nth complex is given by (β1β2...βn) * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β1β2[SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1β2...βn[SCN^-]^n + ... )

Wait, no, I think each β is the cumulative stability constant up to that n. Wait, no, the β values given might be the stepwise or the overall constants. Wait, in some textbooks, β1 is the first formation constant, β2 is the second, etc. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for adding the nth ligand.

Alternatively, sometimes β is given as the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands, which is the product of the stepwise constants. So for example, β_total for n=3 would be β1 * β2 * β3.

Wait, the problem states the stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's four constants for complexes with 1,2,3,4 SCN- ligands. So each β is the overall stability constant for that particular complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So each βn corresponds to the complex with n ligands, and the overall β for each is given. So for each complex, the fraction can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over all m of βm [SCN^-]^m )

But wait, that's only if each βm is the cumulative constant up to m ligands. Wait, no, perhaps it's the stepwise approach. Let me think again.

The correct formula for the fraction of a particular complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n )

Because each term in the denominator represents the fraction of the complex with 0,1,2,3,4 ligands. So each term is the product of the βs up to that point multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. For each species [Co(SCN)_m]^k, the fraction is:

f_m = (β1 β2 ... βm) [SCN^-]^m / sum_{i=0}^{n} (β1 β2 ... βi) [SCN^-]^i )

Wait, no. Because for m=0, it's just Co^2+ with no ligands, so the term is 1. For m=1, it's β1 [SCN^-]. For m=2, β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2. So the general term is product from k=1 to m of βk multiplied by [SCN^-]^m, divided by the sum of all such terms from m=0 to m=4.

So our denominator will be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, no. Wait, each βk is the overall constant for the complex with k ligands. So for m=1, β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f_m = (β_m [SCN^-]^m) / denominator, where denominator is sum of (β_m' [SCN^-]^m') for m' from 0 to 4. But that doesn't make sense because β_m is given as the overall constant for m ligands. So for each m, the term in the denominator is β_m [SCN^-]^m.

Wait, but for m=0, the term is 1 because it's just the free ion Co^2+.

So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because β2 is the overall constant for two ligands. Wait, perhaps the correct way is to use the cumulative product for each step.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me recheck. If β1 is the first formation constant (for adding the first SCN-), β2 is the second (adding the second SCN-), etc., then the overall β for m ligands is the product of β1 to βm.

Wait, but the problem states that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So perhaps each β is the stepwise formation constant. So β1 is K1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

Then, the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40= 360.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, it would be β1*β2*β3=9*40*63= 22680.

And for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, it's β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16= let's calculate that: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880.

So each complex's overall stability constant is the product of the stepwise βs up to that point.

So for each complex, the fraction is (β_total [SCN^-]^m) divided by the sum of all such terms for m from 0 to 4.

Wait, but for m=0, it's [Co^2+] which contributes 1 to the denominator. For m=1, it's β1 [SCN^-], for m=2 β1β2 [SCN^-]^2, etc.

So the fraction f_m is (β1β2...βm [SCN^-]^m) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So in this case, the denominator is sum_{m=0}^4 (β_{total,m} [SCN^-]^m ), where β_{total,m}=product_{k=1}^m βk.

So the problem is to compute f_2, which is the fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex.

Given that, let's compute each term in the denominator.

First, let's compute the [SCN^-] which is 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

m=0: term =1

m=1: term= β1 * [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9

m=2: term= β1*β2*[SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

m=3: term=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (22680) * 0.001=22.68

m=4: term=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288

Wait wait, let me compute each step.

Wait, m=0: 1

m=1: β1 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9

m=2: β1*β2 * [SCN]^2 =9*40 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

m=3: β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) * 0.001=22.68

m=4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4= 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. Then (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So the denominator is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me add these up:

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9+3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468.

Now, the term for m=2 is 3.6. So the fraction f_2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that: 3.6 /64.468.

Hmm, 3.6 divided by 64.468. Let me compute this.

64.468 is approximately 64.47.

3.6 /64.47 ≈ 0.05556 (since 64.47 *0.05556 ≈3.6).

Wait, 64.47 *0.05556: 64 *0.05556= approx 3.554, plus 0.47 *0.05556≈0.0261, so total≈3.58. Hmm, but 64.47 *0.05556= (64.47 *5556e-4). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 3.6 /64.468.

Wait, using calculator approach: 3.6 ÷64.468.

64.468 ×0.055 =3.54574.

64.468 ×0.0555= 64.468 ×0.05 =3.2234, 0.0055 ×64.468=0.354574 → total 3.577974.

But 3.577974 is less than 3.6. So 0.0555 →3.5779.

So 3.6 is 0.0555 *64.468 =3.5779. To reach 3.6, we need a little more.

The difference is 3.6 -3.5779=0.0221.

Each 0.0001 increase in the multiplier would add 64.468 *0.0001=0.0064468.

So 0.0221 /0.0064468 ≈3.43 of 0.0001.

So the multiplier is approximately 0.0555 +0.000343=0.055843.

So approximately 0.0558 or 5.58%.

Wait, but let me check this again. 0.0558 *64.468 = ?

0.05 *64.468=3.2234

0.0058 *64.468= approx 0.374.

So total is 3.2234 +0.374≈3.5974. Which is a bit less than 3.6.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute 3.6 ÷64.468.

Let me compute 64.468 ×0.0558 = ?

Compute 64.468 * 0.05 =3.2234

64.468 *0.0058 = 0.374 (approx)

So 3.2234+0.374=3.5974. Still less than 3.6.

The difference is 3.6 -3.5974=0.0026. How much more do I need?

Each 0.0001 is 0.0064468, so 0.0026/0.0064468≈0.403 of 0.0001.

So the total multiplier is 0.0558 +0.000403≈0.0562.

So approximately 0.0562, which is 5.62%.

Wait, but maybe I should just use actual division.

3.6 ÷64.468.

Let me compute this:

64.468 × 0.0562 = ?

0.05 ×64.468 =3.2234

0.0062 ×64.468= 0.400.

So total 3.2234 +0.4=3.6234. That's a bit over 3.6.

So 64.468 *0.0562=3.6234, which is 0.0234 over 3.6.

So perhaps 0.0562 is a bit high. Let me try 0.056.

64.468 ×0.056= ?

0.05 *64.468=3.2234

0.006 *64.468=0.386808

Total 3.2234 +0.386808=3.610208. Still over 3.6.

Hmm, 3.6 is 3.610208-3.6=0.010208 less than 3.6102.

So 0.056 gives 3.6102, which is 0.0102 over. So how much less than 0.056?

Each 0.0001 change would subtract 64.468 *0.0001=0.0064468 from the product.

So how much do I need to subtract from 0.056 to bring the product down to 3.6?

The excess is 0.0102, which requires subtracting 0.0102 /0.0064468 ≈1.582 of 0.0001.

So subtract 0.0001582 from 0.056 → approx 0.0558418.

So 0.0558418 → approximately 0.05584.

So 3.6 ÷64.468 ≈0.05584 → approximately 5.584%.

So the fraction f_2 is approximately 5.584%.

But wait, the options given are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%. None of these are around 5.5%. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a minute, maybe I messed up the calculation of the β for each term. Let me recheck.

Wait, the βs are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

But wait, β4=16 is lower than β3=63. That's unusual because usually the stability constants increase with the number of ligands, but in this case, they don't. Could that affect the distribution?

But perhaps the mistake is in how I'm calculating the terms. Let me re-express the problem.

The problem is about the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the stepwise formation constants, not the overall. Because perhaps βn is the stepwise constant, meaning that β1 is K1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-}), β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-}), etc.

So the overall β for m ligands is the product K1*K2*...*Km.

Wait, but the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So perhaps each β is the stepwise formation constant, not the overall.

So to compute the fraction f_m, which is the fraction of [Co(SCN)_m], we use:

f_m = (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN^-]^m) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βm [SCN^-]^m )

Because each step adds another SCN-.

So for m=2, it's β1 * β2 * [SCN^-]^2.

So let's recalculate the denominator using these stepwise βs.

So for each m, the term is:

m=0: 1

m=1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

m=2: β1*β2 * [SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

m=3: β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

m=4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

So the denominator is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = same as before, 64.468.

The fraction f_2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0558, which is about 5.58%.

But wait, the options are way higher. So what's the problem here?

Ah, wait a second. Maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Perhaps the problem considers only the complexes up to m=4, but the β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 of 63. Maybe the assumption is that higher complexes are less stable, but that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is that I'm considering [Co^2+] as m=0, but perhaps the problem wants me to consider all possible species, including any hydrolysis products or other forms, but that's probably beyond the given data.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the fraction is for the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex, not the neutral one. But that would be m=1. No, because the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is two ligands, so m=2.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the given β values are the overall stability constants. So, for m=1, β1=9 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+.

For m=2, β2=40 is the overall for [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the overall β for m=2 would be (β1 * β2), which would be 9*40=360, as I did earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants given are for the complexes [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, which would have different charges. Let's think about that.

If the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, then the charge is 2+ - n * (-1) = 2+n. Wait, no, that can't be right because SCN- is -1. So [Co^2+ (SCN)_n]^charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 -n.

Wait, but for the complex to have a charge, perhaps the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+n), because each SCN- contributes -1, so 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 -n. So if n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-1. For n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^-2.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), but that's just a charge consideration.

So regardless, the calculation of the fractions is the same as before, using the product of the βs up to m.

But that gives f_2 as around 5.58%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the given β values are the formation constants for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+; that is, each βn is the equilibrium for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^2+.

In that case, the β for each would be different.

Wait, perhaps the given β values are the overall β for each n. So for m=1, β1=9 would be for [CoSCN]^+.

Wait, but that approach would make the calculation different. Let me think again.

If βm is the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_m]^(2+m), but that seems a bit off. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are just the stepwise constants, and the overall β for m is the product.

So perhaps I was correct earlier, but the calculated f_2 is 5.58%, which doesn't match any options. So there must be an error in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the fraction of all the dithiocyanato complexes, which includes both [Co(SCN)_2]^+ and [Co(SCN)_2]^0? No, that doesn't make much sense because each m corresponds to a specific complex.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering all possible forms and each β is the cumulative for that n.

Wait, perhaps I should write the general expression for each species.

Each species is [Co(SCN)_n]^m, where m is the charge. The fraction is calculated as:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{i=0}^4 β_i [SCN^-]^i )

But wait, for n=0, [Co^2+] contributes 1.

For n=1, [CoSCN]^+ contributes β1 [SCN^-].

For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 contributes β2 [SCN^-]^2.

But wait, that would imply that β2 is the overall constant for n=2, which is β1*β2.

But in that case, the denominator would be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but β2 in this case would be the stepwise β for the second ligand addition, not the overall. So I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1=9 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2=40 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3=63 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and β4=16 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^-2.

In that case, each term in the denominator would be βn [SCN^-]^n.

So the denominator is 1 (n=0) + β1 [SCN] (n=1) + β2 [SCN]^2 (n=2) + β3 [SCN]^3 (n=3) + β4 [SCN]^4 (n=4).

So let's compute each term:

n=0: 1

n=1: 9 *0.1=0.9

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

So sum all these:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9+0.4=2.3

2.3+0.063=2.363

2.363+0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 (dithiocyanato) is β2 [SCN]^2 / denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Hmm, that's one of the options, option D.

Wait, but why would β2 be 40 if that's the overall constant for n=2? Because earlier, using the stepwise approach, β2 would be the product of β1 and β2_step, which would be higher than 40 if β1 is 9 and β2_step is 40/9 = ~4.444.

But the problem states the given β's are the stability constants for each complex. So perhaps each βn is the overall constant for that n. So, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 has β2=40, which directly affects the calculation.

So in that case, the denominator becomes 1 + 9*.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the fraction f_2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 or 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, that conflicts with the earlier approach where the overall β for n=2 is 360. But perhaps the problem is using each βn as the overall β for that n, not the product of stepwise βs. That would make sense, given the way the problem is phrased.

So the correct approach is to treat each βn as the overall stability constant for the n-th complex.

So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So with that, the denominator is 2.3646, and the term for n=2 is 0.4.

So 0.4/2.3646= approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%, option D.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue. So if this is 16.9%, that's option D.

But in the options, option D is 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations. The stability constants are given as overall constants for each complex, and the fraction of each species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

Here, \( \beta_m \) represents the stability constant for the complex with \( m \) ligands, and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The species include the free ion (\( m=0 \)) and complexes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 ligands. The denominator is the sum of all terms representing the fractions of all species.

### Step 1: Calculate each term in the denominator
- \( m=0 \): \( 1 \)
- \( m=1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( m=2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( m=3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( m=4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

Summing these terms gives the denominator:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\( m=2 \))
The fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]
