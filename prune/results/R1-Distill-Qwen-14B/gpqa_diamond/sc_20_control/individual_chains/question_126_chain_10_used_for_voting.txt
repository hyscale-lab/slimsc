Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, each starting with different compounds. Then, after the reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

First, I'll break down each reaction to understand the products formed.

**Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.**

Hmm, LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, starting with 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is a ketone at the 3rd position of a six-carbon chain, with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon.

So the structure is: (S)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, no: hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO, so the structure is CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, I might need to write it more accurately.

Wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one has the carbonyl group on carbon 3, and a methoxy group on carbon 5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3

Wait, that's for 3-pentanone, but here it's hexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one would be:

The formula is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, hexane is six carbons. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's five carbons after the CO. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's seven carbons. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3

Wait, that's correct. So the structure is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. So with the methoxy group on carbon 5, which is the fourth carbon from the CO group? Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are on the carbon chain.

Wait, the structure of hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO-CH2CH2CH3. But the actual structure is:

(CH2)2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So it's actually:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. No, that's not right. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)2CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 3; positions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would have a methoxy group (-OCH3) on carbon 5.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, wait. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)
Carbon 6: CH2CH3?

Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? So the molecule is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be seven carbons. Oh wait, no, hexan has six carbons. So perhaps I should write it as:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)
Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, that makes sense. So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So when treated with LAH, the ketone (C=O) is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product from Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait: when you reduce a ketone with LAH, you get a secondary alcohol. So the product would be the corresponding alcohol at the same position. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration. When you reduce the ketone, the configuration at the new stereocenter would depend on the reaction. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically opens the epoxide in a certain way, but in the case of ketone reduction, it's not stereoselective. Wait, no, the ketone is a planar sp2 hybridized carbon, so when you add H- from LAH, you can get either R or S configuration. But wait, in the starting material, the 5-methoxy group is on the same side as the other substituents, but when the ketone is reduced, the new stereocenter is formed.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at which carbon? Because in the starting ketone, the carbonyl is at C3. So the stereogenic center is at C5, which has -OCH3, two CH2 groups, and a CH2-CO group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure. Let me try:

The starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's seven carbons again. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's 7 carbons. Wait, hexane is six carbons. So hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So position 3 is the ketone. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's seven carbons. Wait, no. Oh wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the structure is:

(CH2)2CO-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, that's 2 (from CH2) + 1 (CO) + 3 (CH2CH2CH3) = 6 carbons. So the correct structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's (CH2)2-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

So the five positions:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2

Carbon 5: CH2

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try to think of it as:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the ketone is on C3, and the methoxy is on C5.

So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would be seven carbons. Oh wait, no. Let me count again. Hexan-3-one is six carbons. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons after the ketone. No, hexan-3-one is:

Carbon 3 is the carbonyl. So carbons are:

1: CH3

2: CH2

3: C=O

4: CH2

5: CH2

6: CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, hexane is six carbons in a row. So hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons. So positions 1-6:

1: CH3

2: CH2

3: C=O

4: CH2

5: CH2

6: CH3.

But wait, that would be pentane-3-one, not hexane-3-one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the structure of hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that's seven carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact structure.

So, Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, so it will reduce the ketone to an alcohol. So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait, the starting material has a specific configuration (S) at C5. When the ketone is at C3, and the methoxy at C5, the configuration at C5 is S. When we reduce the ketone at C3, we're adding H to the carbonyl carbon, which is C3. So the product would have an OH group on C3.

So the product of Reaction I is (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol), but with what configuration?

Wait, when a ketone is reduced, the addition of H from the reducing agent occurs from the less hindered side. But since the starting material has an S configuration at C5, that would influence the approach of the hydride. Or wait, actually, the reduction of a ketone with LAH is a non-stereoselective process because the ketone is planar. So the product would be a racemic mixture unless the starting material is chiral and the reaction leads to retention of configuration.

Wait, wait, the starting material is chiral because of the methoxy group on C5. So when the ketone at C3 is reduced, does the configuration at C5 change? No, because the reduction occurs at C3, not C5.

Wait, the methoxy group is on C5 in the starting material. The reduction is on C3. So the C5 remains as is. So the product would have the same configuration as the starting material at C5, and a new stereocenter at C3.

Wait, no. Because the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the stereocenter is at C5, which has groups: two CH2 groups (from C4 and C6?), the CO group on C3, and the OCH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

So the C5 is the stereocenter, with substituents:

- OCH3,

- CH2-C(=O)-CH2-,

- CH2-CH3,

- and another CH2- group?

So when the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the C3 becomes CH(OH), and the stereocenter remains at C5. So the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with the configuration at C5 still being S, and a new stereocenter at C3.

Wait, but when you reduce a ketone, the addition of the hydride occurs from the less substituted side, leading to the formation of a secondary alcohol with a specific configuration. Or, wait, noâ€”LAH is a strong reducing agent that proceeds through a hydride attack, but in the case of a ketone, the hydride can attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture unless the starting material is chiral and the reaction is stereospecific.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is chiral at C5. The reduction occurs at C3, which is not a stereocenter in the starting material. So the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, but the configuration at C3 depends on the approach of the hydride ion. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, perhaps this affects the approach of the hydride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction, leading to a new stereocenter, which could be R or S, but since the reaction is with an achiral reducing agent, it would produce a racemic mixture at C3.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. The reduction at C3 creates a new stereocenter (since the C3 was a ketone, which is sp2, and becomes sp3 after reduction). So the product would be a diastereomer or a new stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the product after reduction would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. However, the configuration at C5 remains S, but the configuration at C3 would be either R or S, depending on the hydride attack. But since the reaction is performed with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it leads to a specific configuration. Or maybe it's a racemic mixture.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think differently. Maybe the product is a secondary alcohol with two stereocenters. But perhaps the reduction leads to retention of configuration at C5 and creation of a new stereocenter at C3, but the configuration at C3 is determined by the reaction conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but the C5 remains as S.

Wait, perhaps I should instead think about the overall structure. So the product of Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with stereocenters at C3 and C5.

But wait, the starting material was (S) at C5. After reduction, does the configuration at C5 change? I don't think so, because the reduction is happening at C3, which is a different carbon. So C5's configuration remains S.

Now, for Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)2CO-CO(CH3)2, but wait, no: pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain.

Wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So pentane-2,4-dione would be:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons, with ketones on C2 and C4.

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons: positions 1 to 5.

So position 1: CH3.

Position 2: C=O.

Position 3: CH2.

Position 4: C=O.

Position 5: CH3.

Wait, no: that would be 2,4-dione in a five-carbon chain, so it's:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's six carbons, which can't be right. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused again. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

(CH3)2C=O - CH2 - C(=O)CH3.

Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Let's think again: pentane has five carbons. So positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Pentane-2,4-dione has ketone groups at positions 2 and 4. So the structure is:

CH2(CO)CH2COCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. It should be:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Ah, that's correct. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So it's a diketone with two ketone groups on positions 2 and 4.

Now, when this is treated with excess NaBH4. NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but in the case of diketones, it will reduce both ketone groups. So, each ketone will be reduced to an alcohol.

So the product would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

But wait, when you reduce a diketone, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. So the product would be HOCH2-C(OH)H-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again.

The starting material is (CH3)2CO-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So when reduced, each C=O becomes CH2OH? Wait, no. Wait, when a ketone is reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So each ketone group (C=O) becomes a -CH(OH)- group.

So the product would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but this is a five-carbon chain with two secondary alcohols at positions 2 and 4. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, the reaction is done with excess NaBH4. How does that affect things? Well, NaBH4 is a good reducing agent for ketones, and it can reduce each ketone group. But in a diketone, both ketones would be reduced. So the product would have two hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but wait: when you reduce a diketone, each ketone is reduced. So in this case, each of the two ketones becomes an alcohol, leading to 2,4-pentanediol.

Now, the next step is to think about the products from both reactions and their possible stereoisomerism.

So Reaction I gives a product that is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's think about the structure again: the OH is on C3, and there's a methoxy group on C5. So the molecule has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material is (S) at C5, and after reduction, we add an OH on C3, which creates a new stereocenter at C3. So the product from Reaction I has two stereocenters: C3 (new) and C5 (original).

Wait, but in the starting material, C5 is a stereocenter because it's connected to four different groups. After reduction, C5 remains the same. So the product from Reaction I would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. So it would have four possible stereoisomers: 2^2 =4.

But wait, does the product have both stereocenters? Because it's formed from a single enantiomer. Let me think: the starting material is (S) at C5, and when the ketone is reduced, the new OH group at C3 can be either R or S, depending on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the hydride would attack from the less hindered side. But since the starting material is chiral, maybe the configuration at C3 is influenced by that. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction at C3 can create a new stereocenter, the product would have two stereocenters. So the product is a diastereomer with OH at C3 and methoxy at C5.

But exactly how many stereoisomers are formed? If the reaction produces a racemic mixture at C3, then we'd have two possible configurations at C3, each combined with the S configuration at C5. So four stereoisomers in total for Reaction I.

But wait, no. Let's think: the product from Reaction I is formed from a single enantiomer of the starting material. So when the ketone is reduced, the C3 becomes a chiral center. The configuration at C3 would be determined by the approach of the hydride. However, since the starting material is chiral, perhaps the product will have a specific configuration at C3, leading to one diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack of the hydride is from the same face, leading to the same configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the possible products.

Assuming that the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and that the reduction leads to the formation of a new stereocenter at C3, which is either R or S. But wait, maybe the hydride attacks from the same face as the methoxy group because of steric factors, leading to a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers for the product.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer, but I think it's more likely to form a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two possible configurations at C3, each with the same configuration at C5.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, the configuration at C5 remains S. The C3 becomes a new stereocenter, which could be R or S, depending on the approach of the hydride. Since LAH is a strong reducing agent and the reaction isn't stereoselective, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3. So the product would be two possible stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S) configurations at C3 and C5, respectively.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. So the product has C5 still as S, and C3 as either R or S. So the product would have two stereoisomers: (C3 R, C5 S) and (C3 S, C5 S).

So Reaction I produces two stereoisomers. But wait, wait. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have two stereoisomers, each with their own configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer. I'm not entirely certain, but I think it's more likely that the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two stereoisomers.

Now, moving on to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione reduced with excess NaBH4 gives 2,4-pentanediol. Each ketone is reduced, so we have two secondary alcohols. The product is 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, can 2,4-pentanediol have stereoisomers?

Yes, because each OH is on a chiral center. So each of the two OHs can be either R or S configuration.

So the product from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which has two stereocenters, C2 and C4.

So the possible stereoisomers are four: (2R,4R), (2R,4S), (2S,4R), (2S,4S).

But wait, when you reduce a diketone with NaBH4, does it form a racemic mixture for each stereocenter? Or does the reduction lead to a specific configuration?

Wait, the reduction of a ketone by NaBH4 typically leads to a racemic mixture because the hydride can attack from either face. But in the case of a diketone, each ketone is reduced independently, so each can form a racemic mixture. So the overall product would be all possible combinations of the two stereocenters.

So, the product from Reaction II is a mixture of four stereoisomers: 2,4-pentanediol with all possible configurations at C2 and C4.

But wait, perhaps the reaction produces a single diastereomer. No, in reality, each reduction would be a racemic mixture. So the product would be a mixture of four stereoisomers.

Wait, but the starting material is a symmetrical diketone. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So it's symmetric around the central CH2 group. So reducing each ketone would give a molecule that is symmetric.

Wait, that's correct. So when reduced, the product would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, which is symmetric. So the two OH groups would be on C2 and C4, which are symmetric positions. Thus, the possible stereoisomers would be limited.

Wait, because the molecule is symmetric, the configurations at C2 and C4 must be the same. So the possible stereoisomers are either both R, both S, or one R and one S, but due to symmetry, the R and S would be the same as each other.

Wait, no. Let me think: the molecule is symmetric, so the configurations at C2 and C4 are the same. So the possible stereoisomers are either both R, both S, or one R and the other S, but due to the symmetry, the molecule would look the same if both are R or both are S, but that's not correct because each OH is on a chiral center.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule is symmetrical, so the only possible stereoisomers are the meso form and the two enantiomers.

Wait, no. Let me consider the structure: 

HOCH2-C(OH)H-CH2-CH(OH)H-CH2-OH? No, wait, no. The correct structure after reduction is:

HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH? No, that's not right. The correct product is HOCH2-C(OH)H-CH2-C(OH)H-CH2-OH?

Wait, no. The correct product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, that's correct. So it's CH3-C(OH)H-CH2-C(OH)H-CH3.

So the molecule is symmetric. The two OH groups are on C2 and C4, which are symmetric positions.

Now, each OH is on a chiral center. So the possible stereoisomers are:

1. Both OHs on the same side (R,R or S,S), which would give a meso compound.

2. The OHs on opposite sides, leading to diastereomers.

Wait, but with the molecule being symmetric, the (R,S) configuration would actually be the same as (S,R), because flipping the molecule would make them identical. So the possible stereoisomers are:

- (R,R) and (S,S), which are enantiomers.

- and (R,S), which is the same as (S,R), so it's a single meso compound.

Wait, no. Let me think: for a molecule with two stereocenters, if the molecule is symmetrical, then the (R,S) configuration is a meso compound, meaning it has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral.

So, the possible stereoisomers are:

1. (R,R) and (S,S) as enantiomers.

2. (R,S), which is the meso form.

So, in total, three stereoisomers: two enantiomers and one meso compound.

Wait, but when you reduce a symmetrical diketone with a reducing agent like NaBH4, which leads to a racemic mixture at each stereocenter, the product would be a mixture of these three possible stereoisomers. But wait, no. Because when you reduce each ketone independently, each could form R or S. So the possible products would be all combinations, but due to the symmetry, some would be identical.

Wait, for each ketone reduction, the product would be a racemic mixture. But since the two ketones are symmetrical, the possible products would be:

- Both R: which would give (R,R), which is a meso compound? No, wait, in a symmetrical molecule, (R,R) would actually be the same as (S,S), because of the plane of symmetry. Or no, perhaps (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. But the key point is that the product from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which can have three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S), where (R,S) is the meso form. So in total, three stereoisomers.

But wait, when you reduce the diketone, each ketone is reduced independently. So each ketone would form a racemic mixture. The overall product would be a mixture of four stereoisomers, but due to the symmetry, two of them would be the same.

Wait, no, because the molecule is symmetrical, so (R,R) and (S,S) would be enantiomers, and (R,S) would be the same as (S,R), which is a meso compound.

So the possible stereoisomers are three: two enantiomers and one meso.

But considering that the reduction is done with excess NaBH4, which would likely lead to full reduction, the product would be a mixture of all possible stereoisomers. So the product from Reaction II is a mixture of three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S) (meso).

Wait, but wait, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture. Because when you reduce each ketone, each can form R or S. So the possible combinations would be:

- Both R: (R,R)

- Both S: (S,S)

- R and S: (R,S) and (S,R), but due to symmetry, (R,S) is the same as (S,R), so it's just one meso form.

So in total, three stereoisomers.

So Reaction II produces three stereoisomers.

Now, combining the products from Reaction I and Reaction II: Reaction I gives a product with two stereocenters (C3 and C5), leading to two stereoisomers (if racemic at C3), and Reaction II gives three stereoisomers.

Wait, but earlier I thought Reaction I gives two stereoisomers, and Reaction II gives three. So the combined products would be 2 + 3 = 5? Or perhaps more because each product from Reaction I and Reaction II could be present in multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, no, no. The products from each reaction are combined. So for each reaction, the product is a mixture of stereoisomers, and when combined, all possible stereoisomers are present.

So, let's think about the combined products.

Product from Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with two stereocenters (C3 and C5). So, it has two configurations at C3 (R and S), each with C5 being S. So two stereoisomers.

Product from Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol, which has three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S) (meso).

So when these are combined, the total number of stereoisomers is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = 5.

But wait, no, because each reaction produces a separate product. So the combined products are two separate molecules: one from Reaction I and one from Reaction II. So the combined mixture would contain both types of products, each with their own stereoisomers.

So, the combined mixture has:

- Two stereoisomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

- Three stereoisomers of 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, no. Because the products are from two separate reactions, the combined mixture would contain all possible stereoisomers from both products. So the total number of stereoisomers in the mixture is 2 + 3 = 5.

Wait, but each product is separate, so perhaps they don't interact, and thus each contributes their own set of stereoisomers.

So the total number of compounds in the mixture is:

- Two from Reaction I (each with two stereocenters).

- Three from Reaction II (each with two stereocenters, but some are meso).

But when running HPLC, the number of peaks corresponds to the number of distinct stereoisomers present.

Wait, but the question states that the products are combined and run on both a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC column.

Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on polarity; it doesn't distinguish between stereoisomers unless there's a significant difference in polarity, which is rare. So, in a normal-phase HPLC, each pair of enantiomers would appear as a single peak because they have the same polarity. Similarly, meso compounds would have the same polarity as their mirror images and would co-elute.

Wait, no, wait: In normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers have the same elution profile because they have the same physical properties (same polarity, same retention time). So, a racemic mixture would give a single peak. Similarly, a meso compound would elute as a single peak because it's not chiral and has internal planes of symmetry.

Chiral HPLC, on the other hand, uses a chiral stationary phase, which can distinguish between enantiomers. So, each enantiomer would elute at a different time, resulting in separate peaks.

So, in the combined product mixture, we have:

From Reaction I: two stereoisomers.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Reaction I's product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters (C3 and C5). The starting material was (S) at C5, and the reduction leads to a new stereocenter at C3. So, the product could have two possible stereoisomers: (C3 R, C5 S) and (C3 S, C5 S).

Wait, no, if the reaction produces a racemic mixture at C3, then the product would be two stereoisomers: one where C3 is R, and another where C3 is S, each with C5 as S.

So, for Reaction I, we have two stereoisomers.

Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol, which has three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S) meso.

So when the two products are combined, the total number of stereoisomers is 2 (from I) + 3 (from II) = 5.

Now, when run on a normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't distinguish between enantiomers or meso compounds, how many peaks would we observe?

For each product, the number of peaks would be the number of non-meso stereoisomers plus the number of meso forms.

Wait, but in normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers and meso compounds would co-elute.

So for Reaction I's product: two stereoisomers, which are enantiomers if C3 is R and S. Wait, no, because C5 is fixed as S. So the two stereoisomers are (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5, respectively. Are these enantiomers?

Wait, no. Because the configuration at C5 is the same (S), and C3 is either R or S. So the two products are diastereomers, not enantiomers. So they would have different physical properties and would elute as separate peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but wait, diastereomers have different physical properties and would elute at different times in normal-phase HPLC.

Similarly, for Reaction II's product: three stereoisomers, two of which are enantiomers ((R,R) and (S,S)), and one meso ((R,S)).

In normal-phase HPLC, the enantiomers would co-elute as a single peak, and the meso compound would elute as another peak. So Reaction II's product would give two peaks in normal-phase HPLC: one for the meso compound and one for the two enantiomers.

Wait, no, because the two enantiomers (R,R) and (S,S) would have the same polarity and elute together as one peak, and the meso compound (R,S) would elute as a single peak.

So for Reaction II, normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks.

So combining both products:

Reaction I (2 peaks in normal-phase) + Reaction II (2 peaks) â†’ total 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but wait: the two Reaction I products are separate from the Reaction II products. So in the combined mixture, each product contributes its own set of peaks.

So Reaction I's product would show 2 peaks in normal-phase (since they are diastereomers), and Reaction II's product would show 2 peaks (meso and the pair of enantiomers). So total 4 peaks.

Now, for chiral HPLC:

Chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers. So for each set of enantiomers, you get separate peaks.

Reaction I's product has two stereoisomers: (C3 R, C5 S) and (C3 S, C5 S). Are these enantiomers?

Well, for two compounds to be enantiomers, all their stereocenters must be opposite. Here, C5 is S in both, and C3 is R and S. So the two are not mirror images. They are diastereomers. So in chiral HPLC, they would elute as two separate peaks.

Reaction II's product has three stereoisomers:

1. (R,R): which is a meso compound? No, wait. (R,R) is a chiral compound, as it lacks a plane of symmetry. Similarly, (S,S) is its enantiomer. The (R,S) is the meso form, which is achiral.

So, in chiral HPLC:

- (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers â†’ two peaks.

- (R,S) is a meso compound â†’ one peak.

So Reaction II's product would show three peaks in chiral HPLC.

But wait, no. Because in chiral HPLC, the meso compound isn't separated from its mirror image because it's the same molecule. Wait, a meso compound is achiral, so it would elute as a single peak.

So Reaction II's product would give three peaks in chiral HPLC: two from the enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and one from the meso (R,S).

Wait, no. Because the meso compound is achiral, but the other two are enantiomers, so they would elute as two separate peaks.

Wait, but in reality, when you have a mixture of (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S) (meso), the (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers and would give two peaks in chiral HPLC, and the (R,S) would give one peak.

So Reaction II's product contributes three peaks in chiral HPLC.

Reaction I's product contributes two peaks in chiral HPLC because the two stereoisomers are diastereomers, not enantiomers.

Wait, but in this case, the two stereoisomers from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they would elute at different times in chiral HPLC.

So the total peaks in chiral HPLC would be:

Reaction I: 2 peaks.

Reaction II: 3 peaks.

Total: 5 peaks.

Wait, but the options don't have an option with 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 in normal-phase. Let's check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

Wait, according to my reasoning, chiral HPLC would show 5 peaks (2 from Reaction I, 3 from Reaction II), and normal-phase would show 4 peaks (2 from Reaction I, 2 from Reaction II).

But looking at the options, option A says 5 peaks in chiral and 4 in normal-phase.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the products from each reaction.

Reaction I's product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The starting material is (S) at C5, and the product has a new stereocenter at C3. So, the product is a diastereomer pair: (C3 R, C5 S) and (C3 S, C5 S). Are these two compounds diastereomers or enantiomers?

Wait, for enantiomers, all stereocenters must be opposite. Here, C5 is S in both, so they can't be enantiomers. So they are diastereomers. Thus, in chiral HPLC, they would elute as two separate peaks.

Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol, which has three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S) (meso).

In chiral HPLC:

- (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers â†’ two peaks.

- (R,S) is meso â†’ one peak.

So Reaction II contributes three peaks in chiral HPLC.

So total chiral HPLC peaks: 2 (Reaction I) + 3 (Reaction II) =5.

In normal-phase HPLC:

Reaction I's two diastereomers would each show as separate peaks â†’ 2 peaks.

Reaction II's three stereoisomers would be grouped as:

- (R,R) and (S,S) â†’ same peak (because they are enantiomers, same physical properties).

- (R,S) â†’ another peak.

So Reaction II contributes 2 peaks in normal-phase.

Total normal-phase peaks: 2 + 2 =4.

So the chromatograms would show 5 peaks on chiral HPLC and 4 peaks on normal-phase HPLC.

Looking at the options, option A says 5 peaks in chiral and 4 in normal-phase.

But looking at the options, option A is:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

But earlier I thought option C is 4 and 2, etc. But according to this, option A would be correct.

Wait, but did I make a mistake in the number of peaks for the Reaction I product in normal-phase HPLC?

Because Reaction I's product has two diastereomers, which would elute as separate peaks in normal-phase. So Reaction I contributes 2 peaks, Reaction II contributes 2 peaks â†’ 4 peaks in total.

So, chiral HPLC:5, normal-phase:4.

Yes, which matches option A.

But wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in considering the Reaction I product. Let me think again.

Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

This product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. The starting material is (S) at C5, and the product's C3 is R or S.

So the two stereoisomers are (C3 R, C5 S) and (C3 S, C5 S).

Are these two stereoisomers diastereomers or enantiomers?

Because C5 is S in both, but C3 is different, they're diastereomers. So in normal-phase HPLC, each would elute as separate peaks. So Reaction I contributes 2 peaks in normal-phase.

Reaction II's product: three stereoisomers â†’ 2 peaks in normal-phase.

So total normal-phase peaks: 2 + 2 =4.

Chiral HPLC would show 5 peaks: 2 from Reaction I and 3 from Reaction II.

So the correct answer would be option A: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is an option. But I'm a bit confused because the initial analysis suggested that Reaction I's product would have two stereoisomers, which could be diastereomers, contributing two peaks in normal-phase.

But in the options, option A is the only one that matches 5 and 4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions and analyzing the products' chromatograms on a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC column. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH
- LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, forming 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
- The product has two stereocenters: C3 (new stereocenter from reduction) and C5 (retains the original S configuration from the starting material).
- The reduction at C3 can produce two stereoisomers: (C3 R, C5 S) and (C3 S, C5 S), which are diastereomers.
- **Normal-phase HPLC:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and elute as separate peaks. Thus, Reaction I contributes **2 peaks**.
- **Chiral HPLC:** Diastereomers are separated, and enantiomers are also separated. Thus, Reaction I contributes **2 peaks**.

### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with NaBH4
- NaBH4 reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol.
- The product has two stereocenters: C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are:
  1. (R,R) and (S,S): Enantiomers.
  2. (R,S): A meso compound (achiral due to internal symmetry).
- **Normal-phase HPLC:** Enantiomers co-elute as a single peak, and the meso compound elutes as another peak. Thus, Reaction II contributes **2 peaks**.
- **Chiral HPLC:** Enantiomers are separated into two peaks, and the meso compound elutes as a single peak. Thus, Reaction II contributes **3 peaks**.

### Combined Products
- **Normal-phase HPLC:** Reaction I contributes 2 peaks, and Reaction II contributes 2 peaks. Total = **4 peaks**.
- **Chiral HPLC:** Reaction I contributes 2 peaks, and Reaction II contributes 3 peaks. Total = **5 peaks**.

### Final Answer
The chromatograms will show **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**.

**Answer: A**
