Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of hyperbolic surface, right? But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I think this is in 2D, so maybe it's the metric for a surface embedded in 3D space or something. Wait, no, pseudospheres are typically constructed using something like the tractricoid, which is a surface with constant negative curvature.

Oh, right! The area element in a metric is found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in 2D, the determinant is just g_{xx} * g_{yy} - (g_{xy})². Looking at this metric, since it's written as (32)/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²), I think that the metric tensor g has diagonal components g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and off-diagonal terms are zero because there's no cross term like dx dy.

So the determinant would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², and the square root of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Now, to find the total area, I need to integrate this area element over the entire surface. But wait, what are the limits of integration? Oh right, because the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), the denominator can't be zero, so 4 - x² - y² must be positive. That means x² + y² <4. So the region of integration is the disk where x² + y² <4, which is a circle of radius 2. Wait, the radius is 2 because sqrt(4) is 2.

Wait, but the area element is 32/(4 - r²) times dx dy, right? Oh, I should probably switch to polar coordinates to make the integration easier. Because x² + y² = r², so in polar coordinates dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the area A would be the integral from r=0 to r=2 (since x²+y² <4 implies r<2), and θ from 0 to 2π.

So, A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me set up the integral: A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Since the integrand doesn't depend on θ, the integral over θ is just 2π. So A = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral. Let me make substitution u=4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = ∫ [32 ( - du/2 ) / u ] = (-16) ∫ (du/u).

The limits: when r=0, u=4 -0=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0. So the integral becomes from u=4 to u=0.

So ∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (-16) (1/u) du ] = (-16) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but the substitution flips the limits. Let me think again:

When r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral is from 4 to 0.

So ∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 * [ ( -1/2 ) ln(4 - r²) ) ] from 0 to 2.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r dr]/(4 - r²).

Let u=4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 * (-du/2) ] / u → -16 ∫ (du/u) → -16 ln |u| + C.

Evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2: u=4 - (2)^2 = 0.

At r=0: u=4.

So the integral is from u=4 to u=0: (-16) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Which is (-16) [ (ln 0) - (ln 4) ) ].

Wait, ln 0 is negative infinity, but wait, let me compute the integral correctly.

Wait, the integral becomes:

∫ from r=0 to 2 [32 r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ du/u from u=4 to u=0.

Because when u=4, r=0, and when u=0, r=2.

So the integral is (-16) [ ln(u) ) ] evaluated from u=4 to u=0.

So,

(-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ].

But ln(0) is ln(0) which approaches -infinity. So this becomes (-16) [ (-infty) - ln(4) ) ].

Hmm, that's making the integral look like it's diverging. Because ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral becomes (-16) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-16) [ -infty ] = +infty.

Wait, but wait. The integral is ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r dr/(4 - r²)].

Let me compute it without substitution.

Let me write it as 32 ∫ [ r dr ]/(4 - r²).

Let me let u = 4 - r^2. Then du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (-16) ∫ du/u.

Integrate from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0):

So ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (-16) * (1/u) du.

Which is (-16) [ ln u ] evaluated from 4 to 0.

So,

(-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ].

But ln(0) is -infinity. So,

(-16) [ (-infty) - ln4 ) ] = (-16) (-infty - some finite number) ) → which is positive infinity, because multiplying negative by negative infinity.

Wait, but let's think about the integral:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

As r approaches 2 from below, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand behaves like 2/(4-4) → which is 2/0 → it's blowing up. So the integral from 0 to 2 is approaching a point where the integrand becomes infinite. So this suggests that the integral diverges to infinity.

If that's the case, then the area would be infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere would be infinite?

Wait, but I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me remember. A pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, is a surface of constant negative curvature. The standard tractricoid has finite area. Hmm, but perhaps in this case, the metric given does not correspond to the standard pseudosphere, or perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the integral.

Wait, another approach. Let me calculate the integral more carefully.

The integral is ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²).

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = (-du)/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 * (-du/2) ] / u.

Which is -16 ∫ (du/u) from u=4 to u=0.

So the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du = -16 [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Which is -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So,

-16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ) ] → -16 * (-infty - finite) → which is +infty.

So the integral diverges to positive infinity. Therefore, the area A is 2π multiplied by infinity, which is infinity.

But wait, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere, but perhaps the radius affects the area. Wait, in the standard pseudosphere, the area is 4π, but perhaps that's when the curvature is normalized differently.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Gaussian curvature. The area of a surface of constant negative curvature K is 4π/(|K|), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is actually finite. The tractricoid has an area of 4π, right? But in this case, the given metric leads to an infinite area. That's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the area element. Let me double-check.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the line element is given in terms of x and y. So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2 → which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2. So sqrt(g) is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Yes, that's correct.

So integrating over x² + y² <4, which is a circle of radius 2, would lead to a divergent integral because near r=2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the area is infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.

But wait, the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2." So perhaps the area is finite. Hmm, this is confusing. Why is the area infinite here?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try another approach for the integral.

Compute ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r dr]/(4 - r²).

Let me set u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So,

32 ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) ) / u ] = -16 ∫ du/u.

The limits when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to 0 of (-16/u) du → which is -16 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

→ -16 [ ln u ] from 4 to 0 → -16 [ ln0 - ln4 ].

Since ln0 is -infinity, this becomes -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → -16 ( -infty ) → +infty.

So yes, the integral is infinite. So the area is infinite.

So the correct answer is D, +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, we first determine the area element \( dA \). For a metric of the form \( ds^2 = g_{ij} \, dx^i \, dx^j \), the area element is \( dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy \). Since the metric is diagonal (\( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) and \( g_{xy} = 0 \)), the determinant is 

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element is 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To find the total area, we integrate \( dA \) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) ensures that \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), meaning the integration is over the disk of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \), so the area simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| + C \), so:

\[
-16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Here, \( \ln(0) \) approaches \( -\infty \), making the integral diverge to \( +\infty \). Thus, the area \( A \) is infinite:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty.
\]

This divergence occurs because the metric becomes singular at \( r = 2 \), where the denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) approaches zero, causing the integrand to blow up. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.
