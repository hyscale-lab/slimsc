Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. The particles are spin-1/2, which means each can have a spin of either up or down. But wait, since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, that says no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

The well has a length L, and each particle is in a state with energy E_n, where E_n is given by E = (pi² ħ² n²)/(2mL²). So each particle's energy depends on their quantum number n. But for identical particles, especially fermions, their overall wavefunction has to be antisymmetric. That includes both the spatial part and the spin part.

Wait, so each particle is in a state with a specific n and a spin state. Since the particles are identical, their combined state must be an antisymmetric combination. But wait, since they are in a 1D infinite well, the spatial part depends on the quantum number n. So the spin part will have to be considered as well.

Since we have four particles, each with spin-1/2, the total spin can vary, but I think for the lowest energy states, the spatial part will be as low as possible. So the ground state will have the particles filled in the lowest possible n's, obeying the Pauli exclusion.

But wait, how does this work with four particles? Let me think. Each single-particle state can hold two particles with opposite spins because spin-up and spin-down are two distinct states. So for each n, you can have two particles.

So the ground state would be the lowest possible n's filled. So let's see: n=1 can have 2 particles, n=2 can have another 2 particles. Wait, but n can't be higher than that because we only have four particles.

Wait, but four particles: two in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2 (each with opposite spins). So the total energy would be the sum of their energies. Each n=1 particle contributes E_1, but wait, E is given as E = pi² ħ²/(2mL²), which is E_1. So E_1 = E, E_2 = (2²)E = 4E, E_3 = 9E, etc.

So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait, no, wait—wait, wait. No, each particle in n=1 has energy E, so two particles contribute 2E. Each particle in n=2 has 4E, so two contribute 8E. Total energy is 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? Hmm.

Wait, but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check. Each of the four particles is in a state, but each state can hold two particles. So in the ground state, n=1 holds two (spin up and down), and n=2 holds the other two. So each n level is filled with two fermions. So the total energy is 2*(E_1 + E_2) = 2*(E + 4E) )= 2*5E=10E. So the ground state is 10E. Hmm, but looking back at the options, option B says 4E, 10E, 50E. Option C says 4E, 10E,15E. Wait, but in the question, it's the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but that's not what I thought. Wait, maybe I messed up. Let me think again. Each particle's energy is E_n = n² E. So for four particles, perhaps I should arrange them in the lowest possible n's, but considering the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, the first particle can be n=1, spin-up. The second can be n=1, spin-down. The third can be n=2, spin-up. The fourth can be n=2, spin-down. So each n level is filled with two particles. So the total energy is (1² + 1² + 2² + 2²) E.

Wait, that would be (1+1 +4+4) E = (10) E. So 10E is the ground state. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but let me think again—could the ground state have lower energy? No, because each n can only hold two particles, so you have to go to n=2 for the third and fourth particles.

So the ground state is 10E. So the options are looking for the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So next, what is the first excited state?

The first excited state would be the next possible configuration. So in the ground state, all four particles are in the lowest possible n's. To get the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles is promoted to a higher n. But how?

Wait, perhaps the ground state has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state could be when one particle from n=2 is promoted to n=3. But wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so each state can have two spins. Let me think: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, but considering the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but each n can hold two particles. So in the ground state, n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. The next possible state could be promoting one from n=2 to n=3. But wait, n=3 is higher, so that would increase the energy.

Wait, but if we have four particles, and in the ground state n=1 has two, n=2 has two. To get the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, but then n=3 can hold two, and n=2 now has one. But wait, the particles are fermions, so each n can have two.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3. But then, we have to arrange the particles in the lowest possible energies. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 1*(E_2) + 1*(E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Wait, that would be the first excited state.

Wait, but let me check, how many particles are in each n level. In the ground state, n=1: 2, n=2: 2. In the first excited state, perhaps n=1: 2, n=2:1, and n=3:1. But wait, that would have one particle in n=2 and one in n=3. But each n can hold two particles. So maybe that's not how it's done. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is moved to n=3, but that would leave n=3 with one, but since each n can hold two, perhaps n=3 can take another.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of filling the lowest possible orbitals with two particles each, but when you promote, you have to consider how much energy it takes.

Wait, in the ground state, all four particles are in n=1 and n=2. The next possible state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but that would require that n=3 now has two particles (since each n can hold two). Wait, that would imply that the first excited state has two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's only four particles. Wait, no—that's four particles. Because 2+1+1=4. But perhaps that's not correct because each n can hold two particles. So maybe moving one from n=2 to n=3, but that's not allowed because each state can have two, but you have to fill them completely.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when n=1 has two, n=2 has one, and n=3 has one. But that leaves some empty spots, which would result in a higher energy than the ground state, but perhaps that's the first excited.

Wait, but in that case, the total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 1*(2²E) + 1*(3²E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. So that's 15E. So that would be the first excited state.

Then the second excited state would be when the next possible arrangement is made. Maybe moving another particle up. So perhaps in the second excited state, n=1 has two, n=2 has none, and n=3 has two. Because that would be the next possible arrangement where all available lower n's are filled. So n=1 has two, n=3 has two. That would mean the total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(3²E) = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E =20E. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 20E. Hmm, maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles are promoted to n=3, but wait, that can't be because n=3 can hold two, but that would require the four particles to be arranged as two in n=1 and two in n=3. So the energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(3²E) = 2E + 18E =20E. But looking at the options, option B gives 50E as the third option, which is (5²) *2? No, wait, 5² is 25, but 2*(5²E) would be 50E.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again about how the particles are arranged. The ground state is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2, giving 2E + 8E =10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and the other remains in n=2. So n=3 would have one, n=2 has one, and n=1 has two. Total energy is 2E +4E +9E = 15E. So that's 15E, which is the first excited state.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps moving another from n=2 to n=3, but that would require n=3 to hold two, so the total would be 2E (n=1), 0E (n=2), and 2*(9E)=18E. So total is 2E+18E=20E. But none of the options have 20E.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering all possibilities correctly. Let me think about the possible arrangements.

Wait, another possibility is that the first excited state replaces a particle in n=2 with one in n=3, but this may not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state has three particles in lower n's and one in a higher.

Wait, let's think of the possible ways to arrange four fermions in the well, considering that each n can hold two.

The possible configurations could be:

1. (n=1, 2 particles) and (n=2, 2 particles) → total energy 10E (ground state).

2. (n=1, 2), (n=2, 1), (n=3, 1) → energy 2E +4E +9E =15E (first excited).

3. (n=1, 2), (n=3, 2) → energy 2E + 18E=20E (second excited).

But looking at the options:

Option A) 30E, 39E,50E → probably not.

Option B)4E,10E,50E → Hmm, 4E is lower than 10E, which is our ground state. Can't be.

Option C)4E,10E,15E → 4E is lower; perhaps if the ground state is 4E, but no.

Option D)10E,15E,18E → That would mean the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the second excited state was 20E, but option D doesn't have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the possible states.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 moves to n=3, but that would leave n=2 empty. Let me think: n=1 has 1 particle, n=2 has 2, and n=3 has 1. Wait, that's 4 particles. The energy would be (1²)E + (2²)*2E + (3²)E = E + 8E +9E=18E. So that's 18E. So that would be the first excited state. Hmm, but then what's the second excited state?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3, making the arrangement n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E. Then the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted to n=3, so n=2:0, n=3:2. So energy is 2E +18E=20E. But again, none of the options have 20E.

Looking back at the options, option D says 10E, 15E, 18E. So if the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. How can that be? What configuration would give 18E? Let me calculate:

If the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 → 2E +4E +9E =15E.

If another configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1 → E + 8E +9E =18E.

Wait, but in that case, the first excited state would have higher energy than the second? That can't be right because the second excited state should have higher energy than the first. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, making the configuration n=1:2, n=3:2. That would give 2E + 2*(9E) =20E. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and the other stays, making n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. That gives 15E as the first excited. Then the second excited state could be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=4, but that would require more energy. Let me calculate:

n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1 → 2E +4E + 16E =22E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when both particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3, making n=1:2, n=3:2. So the energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =20E. But that's higher than the previous possibility.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps I should think in terms of the possible energy levels for the system and how the particles fill them.

Wait, the ground state is 2*(1²) + 2*(2²) = 2*1 + 2*4= 2 +8=10E.

The first excited state could be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, leaving n=2 with one and n=3 with one. So the energy is 2*(1) + 1*(2²) + 1*(3²) = 2 +4 +9=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle in n=2 moves to n=3, making n=2 have zero and n=3 have two. So energy is 2*(1) + 0*(4) + 2*(9)=2 +0 +18=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something about the possible configurations.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to get a lower energy for the first excited state. But if you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, that would require more energy than moving from n=2 to n=3. So no, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but that would require n=3 to have one particle. Then the next possible state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making n=3 have two particles. So that would be the second excited state, giving 20E, which isn't present in the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option D)10E,15E,18E.

Wait, how can we get 18E? Let me compute 18E.

18E would be 2*(9E) + ... Wait, 9E is n=3. If we have two particles in n=3, that's 2*9E=18E. But where are the other two particles? They must be in lower n's. So possible configurations could be:

Two in n=1, two in n=3. So 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20E.

Alternatively, one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3: 1 + 8 +9 =18E.

Wait, but how can one particle be in n=1 and two in n=2? Because each n can hold two particles, so for four particles, that would be possible. Let me see: n=1 has 1 particle, n=2 has two, and n=3 has one. But wait, no, that's four particles: 1+2+1=4. So the energy would be 1² E + 2*(2² E) + 1*(3² E) = E + 8E +9E=18E.

So that configuration would have energy 18E. But this would be a higher energy than the first excited state (15E). So if the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, then the second excited state would be 18E.

Wait, but how does that happen? Because that configuration (n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1) would have higher energy than the first excited state (n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1), which is 15E.

So perhaps the order is:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state:15E (n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1).

Second excited state: 18E (n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1).

But this would mean that the second excited state is higher than the first excited state. Which makes sense because each excited state has higher energy.

But wait, is this possible? Because the first excited state is lower than the second excited state.

In that case, the energies would be 10E, 15E, 18E, which matches option D.

So looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E.

So the correct answer would be option D.

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in the Infinite Well**:  
   The energy of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well is given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   For four particles, the total energy is the sum of the energies of individual particles.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each quantum level \(n\) can hold two particles (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   To minimize the total energy, the particles fill the lowest available quantum levels.  
   - Two particles occupy \(n=1\) (spins up and down).  
   - Two particles occupy \(n=2\) (spins up and down).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle from \(n=2\) is promoted to \(n=3\).  
   - Two particles remain in \(n=1\).  
   - One particle remains in \(n=2\).  
   - One particle moves to \(n=3\).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2E) + (2^2E) + (3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted to \(n=3\), leaving \(n=2\) empty.  
   - Two particles remain in \(n=1\).  
   - Two particles occupy \(n=3\).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
   \]

6. **Matching with Options**:  
   The calculated energies are \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(20E\). However, none of the options include \(20E\). Revisiting the configurations, an alternative arrangement for the second excited state could involve:  
   - One particle in \(n=1\), two particles in \(n=2\), and one particle in \(n=3\).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = (1^2E) + 2(2^2E) + (3^2E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
   \]  
   This matches the energies \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(18E\) provided in **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The ground state energy is \(10E\), the first excited state energy is \(15E\), and the second excited state energy is \(18E\). These values correspond to **Option D**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. The particles are spin-1/2, which means each can have a spin of either up or down. But wait, since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, that says no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

The well has a length L, and each particle is in a state with energy E_n, where E_n is given by E = (pi² ħ² n²)/(2mL²). So each particle's energy depends on their quantum number n. But for identical particles, especially fermions, their overall wavefunction has to be antisymmetric. That includes both the spatial part and the spin part.

Wait, so each particle is in a state with a specific n and a spin state. Since the particles are identical, their combined state must be an antisymmetric combination. But wait, since they are in a 1D infinite well, the spatial part depends on the quantum number n. So the spin part will have to be considered as well.

Since we have four particles, each with spin-1/2, the total spin can vary, but I think for the lowest energy states, the spatial part will be as low as possible. So the ground state will have the particles filled in the lowest possible n's, obeying the Pauli exclusion.

But wait, how does this work with four particles? Let me think. Each single-particle state can hold two particles with opposite spins because spin-up and spin-down are two distinct states. So for each n, you can have two particles.

So the ground state would be the lowest possible n's filled. So let's see: n=1 can have 2 particles, n=2 can have another 2 particles. Wait, but n can't be higher than that because we only have four particles.

Wait, but four particles: two in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2 (each with opposite spins). So the total energy would be the sum of their energies. Each n=1 particle contributes E_1, but wait, E is given as E = pi² ħ²/(2mL²), which is E_1. So E_1 = E, E_2 = (2²)E = 4E, E_3 = 9E, etc.

So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait, no, wait—wait, wait. No, each particle in n=1 has energy E, so two particles contribute 2E. Each particle in n=2 has 4E, so two contribute 8E. Total energy is 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? Hmm.

Wait, but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check. Each of the four particles is in a state, but each state can hold two particles. So in the ground state, n=1 holds two (spin up and down), and n=2 holds the other two. So each n level is filled with two fermions. So the total energy is 2*(E_1 + E_2) = 2*(E + 4E) )= 2*5E=10E. So the ground state is 10E. Hmm, but looking back at the options, option B says 4E, 10E, 50E. Option C says 4E, 10E,15E. Wait, but in the question, it's the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but that's not what I thought. Wait, maybe I messed up. Let me think again. Each particle's energy is E_n = n² E. So for four particles, perhaps I should arrange them in the lowest possible n's, but considering the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, the first particle can be n=1, spin-up. The second can be n=1, spin-down. The third can be n=2, spin-up. The fourth can be n=2, spin-down. So each n level is filled with two particles. So the total energy is (1² + 1² + 2² + 2²) E.

Wait, that would be (1+1 +4+4) E = (10) E. So 10E is the ground state. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but let me think again—could the ground state have lower energy? No, because each n can only hold two particles, so you have to go to n=2 for the third and fourth particles.

So the ground state is 10E. So the options are looking for the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So next, what is the first excited state?

The first excited state would be the next possible configuration. So in the ground state, all four particles are in the lowest possible n's. To get the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles is promoted to a higher n. But how?

Wait, perhaps the ground state has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state could be when one particle from n=2 is promoted to n=3. But wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so each state can have two spins. Let me think: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, but considering the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but each n can hold two particles. So in the ground state, n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. The next possible state could be promoting one from n=2 to n=3. But wait, n=3 is higher, so that would increase the energy.

Wait, but if we have four particles, and in the ground state n=1 has two, n=2 has two. To get the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, but then n=3 can hold two, and n=2 now has one. But wait, the particles are fermions, so each n can have two.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3. But then, we have to arrange the particles in the lowest possible energies. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 1*(E_2) + 1*(E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Wait, that would be the first excited state.

Wait, but let me check, how many particles are in each n level. In the ground state, n=1: 2, n=2: 2. In the first excited state, perhaps n=1: 2, n=2:1, and n=3:1. But wait, that would have one particle in n=2 and one in n=3. But each n can hold two particles. So maybe that's not how it's done. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is moved to n=3, but that would leave n=3 with one, but since each n can hold two, perhaps n=3 can take another.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of filling the lowest possible orbitals with two particles each, but when you promote, you have to consider how much energy it takes.

Wait, in the ground state, all four particles are in n=1 and n=2. The next possible state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but that would require that n=3 now has two particles (since each n can hold two). Wait, that would imply that the first excited state has two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's only four particles. Wait, no—that's four particles. Because 2+1+1=4. But perhaps that's not correct because each n can hold two particles. So maybe moving one from n=2 to n=3, but that's not allowed because each state can have two, but you have to fill them completely.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when n=1 has two, n=2 has one, and n=3 has one. But that leaves some empty spots, which would result in a higher energy than the ground state, but perhaps that's the first excited.

Wait, but in that case, the total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 1*(2²E) + 1*(3²E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. So that's 15E. So that would be the first excited state.

Then the second excited state would be when the next possible arrangement is made. Maybe moving another particle up. So perhaps in the second excited state, n=1 has two, n=2 has none, and n=3 has two. Because that would be the next possible arrangement where all available lower n's are filled. So n=1 has two, n=3 has two. That would mean the total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(3²E) = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E =20E. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 20E. Hmm, maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles are promoted to n=3, but wait, that can't be because n=3 can hold two, but that would require the four particles to be arranged as two in n=1 and two in n=3. So the energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(3²E) = 2E + 18E =20E. But looking at the options, option B gives 50E as the third option, which is (5²) *2? No, wait, 5² is 25, but 2*(5²E) would be 50E.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again about how the particles are arranged. The ground state is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2, giving 2E + 8E =10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and the other remains in n=2. So n=3 would have one, n=2 has one, and n=1 has two. Total energy is 2E +4E +9E = 15E. So that's 15E, which is the first excited state.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps moving another from n=2 to n=3, but that would require n=3 to hold two, so the total would be 2E (n=1), 0E (n=2), and 2*(9E)=18E. So total is 2E+18E=20E. But none of the options have 20E.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering all possibilities correctly. Let me think about the possible arrangements.

Wait, another possibility is that the first excited state replaces a particle in n=2 with one in n=3, but this may not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state has three particles in lower n's and one in a higher.

Wait, let's think of the possible ways to arrange four fermions in the well, considering that each n can hold two.

The possible configurations could be:

1. (n=1, 2 particles) and (n=2, 2 particles) → total energy 10E (ground state).

2. (n=1, 2), (n=2, 1), (n=3, 1) → energy 2E +4E +9E =15E (first excited).

3. (n=1, 2), (n=3, 2) → energy 2E + 18E=20E (second excited).

But looking at the options:

Option A) 30E, 39E,50E → probably not.

Option B)4E,10E,50E → Hmm, 4E is lower than 10E, which is our ground state. Can't be.

Option C)4E,10E,15E → 4E is lower; perhaps if the ground state is 4E, but no.

Option D)10E,15E,18E → That would mean the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the second excited state was 20E, but option D doesn't have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the possible states.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 moves to n=3, but that would leave n=2 empty. Let me think: n=1 has 1 particle, n=2 has 2, and n=3 has 1. Wait, that's 4 particles. The energy would be (1²)E + (2²)*2E + (3²)E = E + 8E +9E=18E. So that's 18E. So that would be the first excited state. Hmm, but then what's the second excited state?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3, making the arrangement n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E. Then the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted to n=3, so n=2:0, n=3:2. So energy is 2E +18E=20E. But again, none of the options have 20E.

Looking back at the options, option D says 10E, 15E, 18E. So if the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. How can that be? What configuration would give 18E? Let me calculate:

If the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 → 2E +4E +9E =15E.

If another configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1 → E + 8E +9E =18E.

Wait, but in that case, the first excited state would have higher energy than the second? That can't be right because the second excited state should have higher energy than the first. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, making the configuration n=1:2, n=3:2. That would give 2E + 2*(9E) =20E. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and the other stays, making n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. That gives 15E as the first excited. Then the second excited state could be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=4, but that would require more energy. Let me calculate:

n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1 → 2E +4E + 16E =22E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when both particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3, making n=1:2, n=3:2. So the energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =20E. But that's higher than the previous possibility.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps I should think in terms of the possible energy levels for the system and how the particles fill them.

Wait, the ground state is 2*(1²) + 2*(2²) = 2*1 + 2*4= 2 +8=10E.

The first excited state could be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, leaving n=2 with one and n=3 with one. So the energy is 2*(1) + 1*(2²) + 1*(3²) = 2 +4 +9=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle in n=2 moves to n=3, making n=2 have zero and n=3 have two. So energy is 2*(1) + 0*(4) + 2*(9)=2 +0 +18=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something about the possible configurations.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to get a lower energy for the first excited state. But if you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, that would require more energy than moving from n=2 to n=3. So no, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but that would require n=3 to have one particle. Then the next possible state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making n=3 have two particles. So that would be the second excited state, giving 20E, which isn't present in the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option D)10E,15E,18E.

Wait, how can we get 18E? Let me compute 18E.

18E would be 2*(9E) + ... Wait, 9E is n=3. If we have two particles in n=3, that's 2*9E=18E. But where are the other two particles? They must be in lower n's. So possible configurations could be:

Two in n=1, two in n=3. So 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20E.

Alternatively, one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3: 1 + 8 +9 =18E.

Wait, but how can one particle be in n=1 and two in n=2? Because each n can hold two particles, so for four particles, that would be possible. Let me see: n=1 has 1 particle, n=2 has two, and n=3 has one. But wait, no, that's four particles: 1+2+1=4. So the energy would be 1² E + 2*(2² E) + 1*(3² E) = E + 8E +9E=18E.

So that configuration would have energy 18E. But this would be a higher energy than the first excited state (15E). So if the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, then the second excited state would be 18E.

Wait, but how does that happen? Because that configuration (n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1) would have higher energy than the first excited state (n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1), which is 15E.

So perhaps the order is:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state:15E (n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1).

Second excited state: 18E (n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1).

But this would mean that the second excited state is higher than the first excited state. Which makes sense because each excited state has higher energy.

But wait, is this possible? Because the first excited state is lower than the second excited state.

In that case, the energies would be 10E, 15E, 18E, which matches option D.

So looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in the Infinite Well**:  
   The energy of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well is given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   For four particles, the total energy is the sum of the energies of individual particles.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each quantum level \(n\) can hold two particles (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   To minimize the total energy, the particles fill the lowest available quantum levels.  
   - Two particles occupy \(n=1\) (spins up and down).  
   - Two particles occupy \(n=2\) (spins up and down).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle from \(n=2\) is promoted to \(n=3\).  
   - Two particles remain in \(n=1\).  
   - One particle remains in \(n=2\).  
   - One particle moves to \(n=3\).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2E) + (2^2E) + (3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted to \(n=3\), leaving \(n=2\) empty.  
   - Two particles remain in \(n=1\).  
   - Two particles occupy \(n=3\).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
   \]

6. **Matching with Options**:  
   The calculated energies are \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(20E\). However, none of the options include \(20E\). Revisiting the configurations, an alternative arrangement for the second excited state could involve:  
   - One particle in \(n=1\), two particles in \(n=2\), and one particle in \(n=3\).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = (1^2E) + 2(2^2E) + (3^2E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
   \]  
   This matches the energies \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(18E\) provided in **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The ground state energy is \(10E\), the first excited state energy is \(15E\), and the second excited state energy is \(18E\). These values correspond to **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
