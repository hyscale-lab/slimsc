Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, determine the equivalence point, and from there figure out the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So, initial step: diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³, and after adding another 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula, M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 1/40 M. Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (NaOH) is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of CH3COOH initially present. So I need to find how much NaOH is needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, but before that, let's think about the volume of the solution after dilution. It's 40 cm³. But when titrating, the NaOH is added in a burette, so the volume of the solution in the flask remains roughly the same as we add drops. But for equivalence, I need the moles of NaOH equal to the moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.04 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence volume is 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the problem asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So, for 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Titration is done by adding NaOH to the acetic acid solution. So the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume is added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of moles. At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid will have been neutralized. So, moles of NaOH added = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.

But wait, let me double-check. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, 25% of that would mean 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate ion.

So, let me handle each part separately.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.

To find the pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH using the Kb of acetate.

So, after equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate will be equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The total volume will be the initial solution plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³, the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Wait, no. Because the initial solution is 40 cm³, and you add 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³.

So concentration of acetate is (0.001 mol) / (0.05 L) )= 0.02 M.

But wait, wait. Sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So, I can calculate Kb using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5.

Kw = 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The reaction for the acetate ion in water is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced, then:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x )

Since Kb is very small (~5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So,

x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

[OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait. The options for equivalence point don't have 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92  

Hmm, none of these have a pH around 9. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. That part is correct.

Wait, but maybe the concentration is not 0.02 M? Let me recheck the calculations.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At equivalence, all of that is converted to acetate. So moles of acetate = 0.001 mol.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate and solve the quadratic.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, which holds because 5.4e-10 * 0.02 is 1.08e-11, so x is about sqrt(1.08e-11) = 1.04e-5. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the approximation is valid. Therefore, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02.

But none of the options have pH around 9. The closest is option D, which has 6.92. But that's way lower. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another thought: maybe the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, but sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte. Wait, no, sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it should hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic, which would have a pH >7.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I messed up the equivalence point calculation.

Wait another thought: Did I miscalculate moles?

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ water, total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence volume is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L (10 cm³). Correct.

So, after adding 10 cm³ NaOH, total solution is 50 cm³, 0.001 mol acetate. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I considered the solution as sodium acetate, but perhaps I should calculate considering it's the acetate ion in solution. Maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10.

Concentration is 0.02 M. So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is [OH^-], then [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have a pH near 9. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is incorrect?

Wait, wait. Another possibility: perhaps I should consider that when you add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acetic acid, the dilution is correct. So 0.025 M is correct.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point isn't 50 cm³. Hmm, no. Because the initial solution is 40 cm³, adding 10 cm³ of NaOH gives 50 cm³. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaOH is 0.1 M, so when you add 10 cm³, the moles are 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. Which matches the moles of acetic acid. So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the mistake is in the way I calculate the pH at equivalence. Let me try another approach. Maybe considering that the solution is a buffer before equivalence. Wait, no, at equivalence, it's the salt.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The formula is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). At equivalence, [A-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is zero. But wait, that's not true because HA is the conjugate acid. Wait, wait, no. The acetate ion (A-) is the conjugate base of the weak acid (acetic acid). So, in the solution, the acetate will hydrolyze to produce some OH- ions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

pH = 14 - pKa' where pKa' is the pKa of the conjugate acid. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, another approach: the hydrolysis of acetate ion.

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is 5.405e-10, as I found earlier. So, in a solution of 0.02 M acetate, the [OH^-] can be found.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it without approximation.

Let me write the equation:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is ~1.04e-5, pOH is ~4.98, pH is ~9.02.

Hmm. But none of the options have this. So maybe I messed up the problem elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the 25% titration. Let's do that part first and see.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

So, moles of acetic acid remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution is initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ NaOH added (25% of 10 cm³) = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since we have a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.735.

So, pH = 4.735 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.735 - 0.477 ≈ 4.258.

Which is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value. But earlier, the equivalence point pH I calculated was 9.02, which isn't among the options.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let's think again. Could the pH at equivalence be 7.00? That would require that the solution is neutral, but that's only possible if the salt is neutral, but sodium acetate is basic. So why would the equivalence pH be 7?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial moles. Let me recheck.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, 0.001 mol of NaOH added, since 0.001 mol of acetic acid is neutralized. So, yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the concentration of acetate is not 0.02 M. Wait, the total volume after adding NaOH is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the Kb is calculated wrong. Let me recalculate Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5. Kw is 1e-14. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value without approximation.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

But let's see if x is significant compared to 0.02.

x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So, 0.02 is 2e-2, which is 2e-2 M. x is 1.04e-5, which is way smaller, so the approximation holds.

So pH should be about 9.02. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, the question says we're titrating the diluted solution. So, perhaps the initial calculation of the diluted acetic acid concentration is wrong.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point considering activity coefficients or something else, but that's beyond my current level. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the solution is not just acetate ion but maybe the initial buffer solution's dilution affects the pH.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I should use the concentration after adding the NaOH at equivalence point. Wait, no, because all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So, the solution is 0.02 M acetate in 0.05 L.

Hmm, maybe the solution at equivalence is not just acetate but some other factors. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer, but wait, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so it's just the salt.

Wait, perhaps the problem was with the initial dilution. Let me think: when you dilute a weak acid, does the degree of ionization change? Yes, but in this case, I think the initial calculation is correct because we're just calculating concentration, not activity.

Wait, maybe I should think about the initial pH before any titration, but the question is about the pH at 25% and equivalence. So, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Looking back, option A is 4.26; 8.52.

I calculated the 25% pH as ~4.26, which matches option A. But the equivalence pH I found is 9.02, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps the problem is that the equivalence is not 9.02 but something else.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I forgot that the solution at equivalence point is not just acetate. Because when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, maybe it affects the solution's pH differently.

Wait, no, NaOH is a strong base and will dissociate completely, but in the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so the solution is just sodium acetate. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to calculate the pH at equivalence using the formula for a salt solution. Let me try that.

For a solution of a salt of a weak acid (e.g., CH3COO^-) and strong base (Na+):

The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

The formula is pH = 14 - (pKa + log([A-]/[HA])) but wait, [HA] is zero here. Hmm, no. Another formula is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]) but in this case, at equivalence, [acid] is zero, but that doesn't apply since it's fully converted to the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak base. So, since acetate is a weak base, Kb is known.

Earlier, I calculated [OH^-] as 1.04e-5, which gives pH ~9.02. But none of the options have this. So perhaps the problem is that I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles are wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.025 M. Correct.

Volume of NaOH needed at equivalence: 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L =10 cm³. Correct.

Total volume at equivalence: 40 +10 =50 cm³. Correct.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So, calculations are correct, but the equivalence point pH doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the equivalence point pH is 7.00, which is option C. But why would that be?

Wait, maybe if the concentration of acetate is such that the solution is neutral. That can't be unless the Kb is 1e-7, but Kb is 5.4e-10, which is much lower. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not 50 cm³ but another volume. Wait, when I add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³, the total is 50 cm³, correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the Kb value. Let me recheck. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the answer is option D, which has 4.57 as the 25% pH and 6.92 at equivalence. But why would the equivalence pH be around 7?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial solution is being titrated, and the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. But perhaps the concentration of the solution at equivalence is 0.02 M, but the pH is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution after equivalence isn't just acetate but maybe some excess OH- from the NaOH. No, because at equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid, so there's no excess OH-.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in the volume. Let me recalculate the volumes.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ acetic acid, 20 cm³ water → 40 cm³. Then, adding 10 cm³ NaOH, total volume 50 cm³. So no, the volume is correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation for the equivalence point.

Equation: Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

So, x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 - x).

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=√(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the concentration of the NaOH is 0.1 M, but when you add it, you're adding 0.1 M NaOH to the 0.025 M acetic acid. But no, the problem is about the equivalence point and 25% titration, which I think I handled correctly.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution was done incorrectly. Let me think again. When you dilute a solution, the moles stay the same, but concentration changes. So yes, initial moles of acetic acid are correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the formula for a buffer, but that's not the case. At equivalence, it's the salt solution, not a buffer.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the solution is not 0.02 M acetate but higher concentration because I made a mistake in the moles? No, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the option where the 25% pH is 4.26 and the equivalence is around 8.5. Option A is 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but I calculated equivalence pH as 9.02, which is higher than 8.52.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me recheck.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. Moles of NaOH is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of acetic acid neutralized: 0.00025. Remaining acetic acid: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate produced: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

[CH3COOH] =0.00075 /0.0425= ~0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] =0.00025/0.0425= ~0.005882 M.

pH=pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.735 + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.735 + log(0.333)≈4.735-0.477=4.258→~4.26.

Which matches option A. So the 25% pH is 4.26. But the equivalence pH in option A is 8.52. But I calculated 9.02. So perhaps there was a mistake in my calculation of equivalence pH.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the exact expression, not the approximation. Let me try that.

Using Kb=5.405e-10 and c=0.02 M.

The equation is x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, the approximation holds, but for thoroughness, let's solve it without approximation.

So x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02)=0.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) ] /2.

Compute discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 ≈ 2.921e-19.

4*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So discriminant is 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.921e-19 is negligible).

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2= 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514.

Ah! That's approximately 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier in assuming that x is negligible. But wait, 3.288e-6 is 0.003288 mM, which is 0.003288 mM. Wait, 3.288e-6 M is 3.288e-6 M. Let me compute 0.02 M compared to 3.288e-6.

0.02 M is 2e-2 M, which is 20,000e-6 M. So x is 3.288e-6 M, which is 0.01644% of 0.02 M. So the approximation holds, but solving without it gives a slightly different result.

So, the exact x is ~3.288e-6 M, which gives [OH^-]=3.288e-6, pOH=5.486, pH=8.514.

So, the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which corresponds to option A's 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got pH ~9.02. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm confusing myself. Let me recalculate the Kb equation.

The equation is Kb = x²/(c -x) where c=0.02.

Kb=5.405e-10= x²/(0.02 -x).

I used the quadratic formula and found x=3.288e-6, which gives [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Wait, but earlier, when I used the approximation, I got [OH^-]=1.04e-5, which is larger than this. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because when I used the approximation, I assumed that x is negligible compared to c, but when I calculated x as 3.288e-6, which is 0.03288 mM, compared to 0.02 M (20 mM), x is 0.1644% of c. So the approximation holds, but why does solving without it give a lower x?

Wait no, I think I made a mistake in the quadratic formula. Let me re-solve the equation.

The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*1*(-1.081e-11).

Calculate each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 → approx 29.21e-20 → 2.921e-19.

4ac =4*1*(-1.081e-11) → -4.324e-11.

So, D = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11.

Wait, 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.921e-19, so D ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 →approx (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So, [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Ah, I see. So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

So, the correct pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and at equivalence it's 8.51, which matches option A.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I thought x was 1.04e-5, which gave a higher pH. But when solving the quadratic, I get a lower x, leading to a lower pH.

So, where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, I think I made a mistake when I first calculated x as 1.04e-5. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, the correct equation is Kb = x²/(c -x), where c=0.02.

So, with Kb=5.405e-10, c=0.02,

x² = Kb * (c -x) → x²=5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

If I approximate c >>x, then x² ≈5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But when I actually solve the quadratic, I get x=3.288e-6, which is about a third of the approximate value.

So why the discrepancy? Because the approximation x<<c may not hold when c is already small, like 0.02 M. In this case, the approximation gives a higher x than the actual solution.

So, the correct pH at equivalence is 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Thus, the correct answer is option A: 4.26;8.52.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M_2 \cdot V = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{M_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) in a total volume of \( 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 \). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is calculated using \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \), where \( K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14} \) and \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
K_b = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{c - x} \), where \( c = 0.02 \, \text{M} \) and \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \), we solve for \( x \). Assuming \( x \ll c \), we approximate:

\[
x^2 \approx K_b \cdot c = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation without approximation gives a slightly lower \( x \), leading to a pH of approximately \( 8.52 \) at the equivalence point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is added, which corresponds to 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = M_{\text{NaOH}} \cdot V = 0.1 \cdot 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.735 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.735 + \log\left(\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\right) = 4.735 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.735 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \).

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, determine the equivalence point, and from there figure out the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So, initial step: diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³, and after adding another 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula, M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 1/40 M. Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (NaOH) is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of CH3COOH initially present. So I need to find how much NaOH is needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, but before that, let's think about the volume of the solution after dilution. It's 40 cm³. But when titrating, the NaOH is added in a burette, so the volume of the solution in the flask remains roughly the same as we add drops. But for equivalence, I need the moles of NaOH equal to the moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.04 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence volume is 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the problem asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So, for 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Titration is done by adding NaOH to the acetic acid solution. So the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume is added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of moles. At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid will have been neutralized. So, moles of NaOH added = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.

But wait, let me double-check. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, 25% of that would mean 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate ion.

So, let me handle each part separately.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.

To find the pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH using the Kb of acetate.

So, after equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate will be equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The total volume will be the initial solution plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³, the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Wait, no. Because the initial solution is 40 cm³, and you add 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³.

So concentration of acetate is (0.001 mol) / (0.05 L) )= 0.02 M.

But wait, wait. Sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So, I can calculate Kb using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5.

Kw = 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The reaction for the acetate ion in water is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced, then:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x )

Since Kb is very small (~5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So,

x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

[OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait. The options for equivalence point don't have 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92  

Hmm, none of these have a pH around 9. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. That part is correct.

Wait, but maybe the concentration is not 0.02 M? Let me recheck the calculations.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At equivalence, all of that is converted to acetate. So moles of acetate = 0.001 mol.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate and solve the quadratic.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, which holds because 5.4e-10 * 0.02 is 1.08e-11, so x is about sqrt(1.08e-11) = 1.04e-5. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the approximation is valid. Therefore, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02.

But none of the options have pH around 9. The closest is option D, which has 6.92. But that's way lower. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another thought: maybe the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, but sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte. Wait, no, sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it should hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic, which would have a pH >7.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I messed up the equivalence point calculation.

Wait another thought: Did I miscalculate moles?

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ water, total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence volume is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L (10 cm³). Correct.

So, after adding 10 cm³ NaOH, total solution is 50 cm³, 0.001 mol acetate. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I considered the solution as sodium acetate, but perhaps I should calculate considering it's the acetate ion in solution. Maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10.

Concentration is 0.02 M. So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is [OH^-], then [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have a pH near 9. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is incorrect?

Wait, wait. Another possibility: perhaps I should consider that when you add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acetic acid, the dilution is correct. So 0.025 M is correct.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point isn't 50 cm³. Hmm, no. Because the initial solution is 40 cm³, adding 10 cm³ of NaOH gives 50 cm³. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaOH is 0.1 M, so when you add 10 cm³, the moles are 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. Which matches the moles of acetic acid. So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the mistake is in the way I calculate the pH at equivalence. Let me try another approach. Maybe considering that the solution is a buffer before equivalence. Wait, no, at equivalence, it's the salt.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The formula is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). At equivalence, [A-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is zero. But wait, that's not true because HA is the conjugate acid. Wait, wait, no. The acetate ion (A-) is the conjugate base of the weak acid (acetic acid). So, in the solution, the acetate will hydrolyze to produce some OH- ions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

pH = 14 - pKa' where pKa' is the pKa of the conjugate acid. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, another approach: the hydrolysis of acetate ion.

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is 5.405e-10, as I found earlier. So, in a solution of 0.02 M acetate, the [OH^-] can be found.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it without approximation.

Let me write the equation:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is ~1.04e-5, pOH is ~4.98, pH is ~9.02.

Hmm. But none of the options have this. So maybe I messed up the problem elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the 25% titration. Let's do that part first and see.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

So, moles of acetic acid remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution is initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ NaOH added (25% of 10 cm³) = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since we have a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.735.

So, pH = 4.735 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.735 - 0.477 ≈ 4.258.

Which is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value. But earlier, the equivalence point pH I calculated was 9.02, which isn't among the options.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let's think again. Could the pH at equivalence be 7.00? That would require that the solution is neutral, but that's only possible if the salt is neutral, but sodium acetate is basic. So why would the equivalence pH be 7?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial moles. Let me recheck.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, 0.001 mol of NaOH added, since 0.001 mol of acetic acid is neutralized. So, yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the concentration of acetate is not 0.02 M. Wait, the total volume after adding NaOH is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the Kb is calculated wrong. Let me recalculate Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5. Kw is 1e-14. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value without approximation.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

But let's see if x is significant compared to 0.02.

x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So, 0.02 is 2e-2, which is 2e-2 M. x is 1.04e-5, which is way smaller, so the approximation holds.

So pH should be about 9.02. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, the question says we're titrating the diluted solution. So, perhaps the initial calculation of the diluted acetic acid concentration is wrong.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point considering activity coefficients or something else, but that's beyond my current level. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the solution is not just acetate ion but maybe the initial buffer solution's dilution affects the pH.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I should use the concentration after adding the NaOH at equivalence point. Wait, no, because all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So, the solution is 0.02 M acetate in 0.05 L.

Hmm, maybe the solution at equivalence is not just acetate but some other factors. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer, but wait, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so it's just the salt.

Wait, perhaps the problem was with the initial dilution. Let me think: when you dilute a weak acid, does the degree of ionization change? Yes, but in this case, I think the initial calculation is correct because we're just calculating concentration, not activity.

Wait, maybe I should think about the initial pH before any titration, but the question is about the pH at 25% and equivalence. So, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Looking back, option A is 4.26; 8.52.

I calculated the 25% pH as ~4.26, which matches option A. But the equivalence pH I found is 9.02, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps the problem is that the equivalence is not 9.02 but something else.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I forgot that the solution at equivalence point is not just acetate. Because when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, maybe it affects the solution's pH differently.

Wait, no, NaOH is a strong base and will dissociate completely, but in the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so the solution is just sodium acetate. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to calculate the pH at equivalence using the formula for a salt solution. Let me try that.

For a solution of a salt of a weak acid (e.g., CH3COO^-) and strong base (Na+):

The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

The formula is pH = 14 - (pKa + log([A-]/[HA])) but wait, [HA] is zero here. Hmm, no. Another formula is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]) but in this case, at equivalence, [acid] is zero, but that doesn't apply since it's fully converted to the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak base. So, since acetate is a weak base, Kb is known.

Earlier, I calculated [OH^-] as 1.04e-5, which gives pH ~9.02. But none of the options have this. So perhaps the problem is that I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles are wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.025 M. Correct.

Volume of NaOH needed at equivalence: 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L =10 cm³. Correct.

Total volume at equivalence: 40 +10 =50 cm³. Correct.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So, calculations are correct, but the equivalence point pH doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the equivalence point pH is 7.00, which is option C. But why would that be?

Wait, maybe if the concentration of acetate is such that the solution is neutral. That can't be unless the Kb is 1e-7, but Kb is 5.4e-10, which is much lower. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not 50 cm³ but another volume. Wait, when I add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³, the total is 50 cm³, correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the Kb value. Let me recheck. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the answer is option D, which has 4.57 as the 25% pH and 6.92 at equivalence. But why would the equivalence pH be around 7?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial solution is being titrated, and the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. But perhaps the concentration of the solution at equivalence is 0.02 M, but the pH is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution after equivalence isn't just acetate but maybe some excess OH- from the NaOH. No, because at equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid, so there's no excess OH-.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in the volume. Let me recalculate the volumes.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ acetic acid, 20 cm³ water → 40 cm³. Then, adding 10 cm³ NaOH, total volume 50 cm³. So no, the volume is correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation for the equivalence point.

Equation: Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

So, x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 - x).

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=√(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the concentration of the NaOH is 0.1 M, but when you add it, you're adding 0.1 M NaOH to the 0.025 M acetic acid. But no, the problem is about the equivalence point and 25% titration, which I think I handled correctly.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution was done incorrectly. Let me think again. When you dilute a solution, the moles stay the same, but concentration changes. So yes, initial moles of acetic acid are correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the formula for a buffer, but that's not the case. At equivalence, it's the salt solution, not a buffer.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the solution is not 0.02 M acetate but higher concentration because I made a mistake in the moles? No, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the option where the 25% pH is 4.26 and the equivalence is around 8.5. Option A is 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but I calculated equivalence pH as 9.02, which is higher than 8.52.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me recheck.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. Moles of NaOH is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of acetic acid neutralized: 0.00025. Remaining acetic acid: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate produced: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

[CH3COOH] =0.00075 /0.0425= ~0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] =0.00025/0.0425= ~0.005882 M.

pH=pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.735 + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.735 + log(0.333)≈4.735-0.477=4.258→~4.26.

Which matches option A. So the 25% pH is 4.26. But the equivalence pH in option A is 8.52. But I calculated 9.02. So perhaps there was a mistake in my calculation of equivalence pH.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the exact expression, not the approximation. Let me try that.

Using Kb=5.405e-10 and c=0.02 M.

The equation is x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, the approximation holds, but for thoroughness, let's solve it without approximation.

So x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02)=0.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) ] /2.

Compute discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 ≈ 2.921e-19.

4*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So discriminant is 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.921e-19 is negligible).

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2= 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514.

Ah! That's approximately 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier in assuming that x is negligible. But wait, 3.288e-6 is 0.003288 mM, which is 0.003288 mM. Wait, 3.288e-6 M is 3.288e-6 M. Let me compute 0.02 M compared to 3.288e-6.

0.02 M is 2e-2 M, which is 20,000e-6 M. So x is 3.288e-6 M, which is 0.01644% of 0.02 M. So the approximation holds, but solving without it gives a slightly different result.

So, the exact x is ~3.288e-6 M, which gives [OH^-]=3.288e-6, pOH=5.486, pH=8.514.

So, the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which corresponds to option A's 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got pH ~9.02. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm confusing myself. Let me recalculate the Kb equation.

The equation is Kb = x²/(c -x) where c=0.02.

Kb=5.405e-10= x²/(0.02 -x).

I used the quadratic formula and found x=3.288e-6, which gives [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Wait, but earlier, when I used the approximation, I got [OH^-]=1.04e-5, which is larger than this. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because when I used the approximation, I assumed that x is negligible compared to c, but when I calculated x as 3.288e-6, which is 0.03288 mM, compared to 0.02 M (20 mM), x is 0.1644% of c. So the approximation holds, but why does solving without it give a lower x?

Wait no, I think I made a mistake in the quadratic formula. Let me re-solve the equation.

The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*1*(-1.081e-11).

Calculate each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 → approx 29.21e-20 → 2.921e-19.

4ac =4*1*(-1.081e-11) → -4.324e-11.

So, D = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11.

Wait, 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.921e-19, so D ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 →approx (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So, [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Ah, I see. So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

So, the correct pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and at equivalence it's 8.51, which matches option A.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I thought x was 1.04e-5, which gave a higher pH. But when solving the quadratic, I get a lower x, leading to a lower pH.

So, where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, I think I made a mistake when I first calculated x as 1.04e-5. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, the correct equation is Kb = x²/(c -x), where c=0.02.

So, with Kb=5.405e-10, c=0.02,

x² = Kb * (c -x) → x²=5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

If I approximate c >>x, then x² ≈5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But when I actually solve the quadratic, I get x=3.288e-6, which is about a third of the approximate value.

So why the discrepancy? Because the approximation x<<c may not hold when c is already small, like 0.02 M. In this case, the approximation gives a higher x than the actual solution.

So, the correct pH at equivalence is 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Thus, the correct answer is option A: 4.26;8.52.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M_2 \cdot V = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{M_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) in a total volume of \( 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 \). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is calculated using \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \), where \( K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14} \) and \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
K_b = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{c - x} \), where \( c = 0.02 \, \text{M} \) and \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \), we solve for \( x \). Assuming \( x \ll c \), we approximate:

\[
x^2 \approx K_b \cdot c = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation without approximation gives a slightly lower \( x \), leading to a pH of approximately \( 8.52 \) at the equivalence point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is added, which corresponds to 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = M_{\text{NaOH}} \cdot V = 0.1 \cdot 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.735 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.735 + \log\left(\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\right) = 4.735 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.735 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \).
