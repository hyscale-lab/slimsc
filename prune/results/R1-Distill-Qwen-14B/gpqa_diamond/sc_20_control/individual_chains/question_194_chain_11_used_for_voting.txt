Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function of a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? So I'll need to figure out all the possible configurations of the three spins and compute the energy for each, then sum up the exponential terms.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them out. Maybe it's easier to write all the possible combinations:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

For each of these, I have to compute E and then calculate e^{-βE}.

The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term step by step.

First, let's compute the terms S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 for each state.

State 1: All spins +1. So S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J * 3 → E = -3J.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait. No: E is -J times (sum). So sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is (-1 +1 -1) = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1 -1 +1) = -1. E= J.

State 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1. S1S2 = -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1 -1 +1)= -1. E= J.

Wait, same as state 4.

Wait, state 5: S1=-1, S2=+1: S1S2= (-1)(+1) = -1. S1S3= (-1)(+1) = -1. S2S3= (+1)(+1)=1. So sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E= -J*(-1)= J.

State 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1 +1 -1)= -1. E= J.

Wait, same as others. Hmm, but wait no: Let me re-calculate.

Wait, S1S2 is (-1)(+1)= -1.

S1S3 is (-1)(-1)=1.

S2S3 is (+1)(-1)= -1.

So sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1. So E = J.

Wait, so same as before.

State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum 1-1-1= -1. E= J.

State 8: All -1. S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum 3. E= -3J.

Wait, so let me summarize the energies.

States 1 and 8 have E = -3J.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7 have E = J.

Wait, that's 2 states with energy -3J and 6 states with energy J.

So Z is the sum of e^{-βE} for each state.

So for each state with E=-3J, e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3Jβ}.

And for each state with E=J, e^{-β*J} = e^{-Jβ}.

So how many of each? 2 states with E=-3J, so 2 * e^{3Jβ}.

And 6 states with E=J, so 6 * e^{-Jβ}.

So the partition function Z is 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Option A is 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}.

Wait, I think that's what I got. So the correct Z is 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

So the answer should be option B.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that the energies are correct. Because sometimes when I get 6 states, it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, states 1 and 8 are all +1 and all -1. So for state 1: S1=S2=S3=+1. So each product is +1, sum is 3. E=-3J.

State 8: all -1. S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1, same for others. Sum 3, E=-3J.

Other states: each has two spins the same and one opposite or something else?

Wait, no. For example, state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. So E= J.

Yes. So each of the 6 other states (states 2-7) have E= J.

So that's correct.

To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by calculating the energy for all possible configurations. The energy is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states, as each spin can independently be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). Listing all states and their corresponding energies:

1. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum = \( 3 \).  
   \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).

2. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum = \( -1 \).  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

3. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum = \( -1 \).  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

4. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum = \( -1 \).  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

5. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum = \( -1 \).  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

6. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum = \( -1 \).  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

7. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum = \( -1 \).  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

8. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum = \( 3 \).  
   \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).

From the above, there are **2 states** with \( E = -3J \) and **6 states** with \( E = J \). The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of \( e^{-\beta E} \) for all states:

\[
Z = 2 e^{-\beta (-3J)} + 6 e^{-\beta J}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Option B: \( Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta} \).**

Answer: B
