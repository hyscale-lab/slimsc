Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but let's think it through step by step. The question involves two reactions and then looking at the products using HPLC. 

First, let's break down Reaction I and Reaction II.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So hexan-3-one is a ketone at the 3rd carbon. When reduced, it should become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5 because of the methoxy group. Hmm, but when you reduce the ketone, the configuration might change because it's a new chiral center.

Wait, wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: hexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But when there's a methoxy at position 5, that's the fifth carbon. So the structure is: 

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-something? Wait, let me draw it. Hexan-3-one is six carbons, with the ketone on C3. So, positions 1 through 6. The 5th position has a methoxy group. So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3-CH3. So, the carbonyl is on C3. The 5th carbon is the third CH2 after CO. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2CH3. But wait, the methoxy is on the fifth carbon, which is the fourth carbon after the ketone? Hmm, maybe I should number it properly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is: 
Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH2-
Carbon 6: CH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, correct structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. So, the 5th carbon is the third carbon after the ketone. So, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as: 

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons with the ketone on carbon 3. So, structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me number it correctly.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3

Wait, no, this would give 3-pentanone, not hexan-3-one. Oops, hexan-3-one is (CH2)4-CO-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one should have 6 carbons in total, with the ketone on C3.

So it's:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait: 

Wait, hexan-3-one is 3-pentanone? No, no. Let me think: butyraldehyde is pentanal, butyric acid is pentanoic acid. So, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3-CH3.

So structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but the 5th carbon is the fourth carbon after the ketone (since the ketone is at C3). So 5-methoxy group would be on the fifth carbon, which is the fourth carbon after the ketone.

So, in the starting material, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think that in hexan-3-one, the carbonyl is at position 3. So positions 1, 2, 3 (C=O), 4, 5, 6.

So, the 5-methoxy group is at position 5, which is the next to the end. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's five carbons after the ketone. Hmm, maybe the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2CH3. So the 5th carbon has a methoxy group on it.

When you reduce this with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride), which is a strong reducing agent, the ketone (C=O) group is reduced to an alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. 

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration at the 5th carbon. So when the ketone is reduced, the new hydroxyl group is added to the same carbon as the ketone, which was C3. So the product is (S) configuration at C5, but the C3 becomes a new chiral center because it's now -CH(OH)-.

Wait, wait a minute. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the methoxy is on C5. The C3 is the carbonyl carbon. When we reduce the ketone, the C3 becomes a CH-OH group. So, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5 because of the methoxy group. Let me clarify the structure. Let's imagine the structure: 

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

The structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try drawing it properly.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH2CH3.

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, that can't be. Oh, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2CH2)2CO, but wait no. Let me think about the structure again. Let's number from the end. Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would have six carbons: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH3). So, the 5th carbon is the fifth from the start, which is CH2.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the key point is that when a ketone is reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product is a diastereomer, but the existing chiral center at C5 (from the methoxy) remains.

Wait, but in Reaction I, the starting material is (S)-configured at C5. So after reduction, C3 becomes a chiral center. So the product now has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in the starting material, the C3 is a carbonyl group, which is not a chiral center. So after reduction, C3 becomes a CH-OH group, which is a new chiral center. The C5 has a methoxy group and is already a chiral center. So the product from Reaction I is (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) with two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

But wait, the configuration of C3 may be determined by the reduction. Since the ketone is a planar group, the reduction with LAH would add two hydrogens: one from the same side and one from the opposite. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to retention of configuration if the starting ketone is a planar sp² center. So, the reduction of a ketone would produce a secondary alcohol with the hydroxyl group in the same configuration as the ketone. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, ketones are symmetric, so the reduction can lead to a racemic mixture of the new chiral center. But wait, in this case, the starting material is (S)-configured at C5, but the C3 is a ketone and not a chiral center. So when you reduce it, the new hydroxyl group can be added in either R or S configuration, unless there's some other factor influencing the stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent but doesn't typically induce any specific stereochemistry in the product because the ketone is symmetric. So the product from Reaction I would be a racemic mixture of the new chiral center at C3. So, the product would be a mixture of R and S configurations at C3, but the C5 remains as the original S configuration.

Wait, or does the configuration of C5 influence the reduction? Hmm. No, because the C3 is a separate carbon. So, the product would actually have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. Since C3 is a new chiral center and the reduction doesn't control the stereochemistry, it would form a racemic mixture at C3, so leading to two diastereomers. Wait, but the C5 is fixed as S. So, the product would have two possible configurations at C3: R and S, leading to two diastereomers. But wait, when you have two chiral centers, each with two possible configurations, there are four possible stereoisomers. But wait, no, because C5 is fixed as S. So for each configuration at C3, you have one stereoisomer. So if C3 is R, you have one; if C3 is S, another. So in total, two stereoisomers.

Wait, but no, since the C3 is a new chiral center. So the product would have two stereoisomers, each with a specific configuration at C3. But LAH is a strong reducing agent and doesn't control the stereochemistry, leading to a racemic mixture at C3. So the product would be a racemic mixture of the two possible stereoisomers at C3. But wait, but that's only if the starting material is a single enantiomer. Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5, and the C3 is a ketone, so it's not a chiral center. So upon reduction, the C3 becomes a chiral center. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a mixture of stereoisomers at C3.

Wait, but no, the process of reduction of a ketone with LAH tends to produce a racemic mixture because the ketone is planar, so the hydride can attack from either face equally. So the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two enantiomers. But since the C5 is a fixed S configuration, each of these would have a different diastereomer based on the configuration at C3. So overall, the product from Reaction I would be a mixture of two diastereomers: one where C3 is R, and the other where C3 is S. So that's two diastereomers, but each is a pair of enantiomers if considering both C3 and C5. Wait, no, because C5 is fixed, so each diastereomer is a single enantiomer. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the reduction of the ketone doesn't produce any new chiral centers because the two hydrogens add to the same face? No, that's not right. The ketone is planar, so when the hydride attacks, it can add from either face, leading to both R and S configurations at C3. So the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, but since C5 is fixed, the product would consist of two enantiomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5. Wait, no, because the configuration at C5 is fixed as S, and the configuration at C3 is either R or S.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me move on and think about Reaction II.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2, right? So it's a diketone. NaBH4 is a reducing agent, but it's a weaker agent than LAH. However, in this case, it's used in excess, so it should reduce both ketone groups. Wait, but NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce esters or amides. Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone, so both carbonyl groups can be reduced.

So, when NaBH4 reduces pentane-2,4-dione, both ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols. So the product would be 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, let me think. The structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3. After reduction, each C=O becomes CH(OH). So the product is HOCH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Let me structure it properly: the molecule is:

O
||
CH2-C-O-C-O-CH2?

No, wait: pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH3. So, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Upon reduction with NaBH4, both ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols. So the product is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

But wait, this is a diol with two adjacent chiral centers? No, because the two OH groups are on C2 and C4. Let me see: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the two OH groups are on C2 and C4. Each of these carbons is a chiral center because each has four different substituents.

Wait, C2: attached to CH3, OH, CH2CH(OH)CH3, and the next carbon. Wait, no, let me think about the substituents on each carbon.

For C2: attached groups are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- CH2 group (which connects to C3 and C4)
- The next carbon, which is C3 (CH2).

Wait, no, C2 in the product is CH(OH) attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and the OH. Wait, no—each carbon is connected as follows.

So the structure after reduction is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, looking at C2: it's connected to:

1. CH3 (from C1)
2. OH
3. CH2 (which leads to C3)
4. The adjacent carbon is C3 (CH2-CH(OH)-CH3).

Wait, but wait, C2 is CH(OH) connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two H's? No, wait, no, in the reduced molecule, each of the ketone carbons becomes a CH(OH) group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me think: each C=O in pentane-2,4-dione is at C2 and C4. When reduced, each becomes a CH(OH) group. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, each of the C2 and C4 carbons has four substituents: 

At C2: CH3, OH, CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, and another CH2 (leading to C1? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, for C2:

- Two CH2 groups (one leading to C1, which is CH3, and the other leading to C3, which is CH2-CH(OH)-CH3).
- OH.
- And the remaining is a hydrogen?

Wait, no, wait. Each of the carbons C2 and C4 have the structure CH(OH)-. So, each has:

- Two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3 for C2, and from C3 and C5 for C4).
- An OH group.
- And perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but in that case, each C2 and C4 would have four substituents: two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. So each of these carbons is a chiral center.

So, the product from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which has two chiral centers, C2 and C4. Each can be R or S. Now, when you reduce a diketone with NaBH4, which is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both ketones, you get a diol. But the configuration of the OH groups depends on the reduction.

Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric, right? The molecule is symmetric around the central CH2 group. So, when you reduce it, the OH groups on C2 and C4 can be either both R, both S, or one R and the other S, but due to the symmetry, these configurations are either the same or enantiomers.

Wait, but NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent, and when it reduces a ketone, it does so without any preference for stereochemistry, leading to a racemic mixture for each chiral center. But in this case, since the molecule is symmetric, the reduction of each ketone would lead to the same configuration. So, the product would be a single diastereomer, but with both OH groups either R or S. Wait, no, because the two carbonyl groups are identical and the molecule is symmetric, so the reduction would lead to both OH groups having the same configuration. So, the product would be either (R,R) or (S,S), but which one?

Wait, no, wait. The reduction of each ketone would proceed independently, but because the molecule is symmetric, the outcome would be that the two OH groups are either both R or both S, but because the reduction doesn't induce any specific stereochemistry, each ketone would form a racemic mixture. However, due to the symmetry, the two ketones would form the same configurations, leading to a single product. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound. Because the molecule is symmetric, even if each OH is R, the molecule as a whole would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, the product would be a meso diol. So, the two OH groups have opposite configurations, leading to an internal plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral. 

Wait, yes! Because the molecule is symmetric, the OH groups on C2 and C4 must be mirror images of each other for the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. So the product would be a meso compound, meaning that the molecule is not chiral despite having two chiral centers. So, the product from Reaction II is meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound, not a mixture of enantiomers.

Wait, but when you reduce a molecule with two identical ketones, each ketone would be reduced to an alcohol. Since the molecule is symmetric, the diastereomers would be the same. So, the product would be a single compound, not a mixture.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So, only one product is formed, which is the meso form. So Reaction II gives a single product, which is a meso compound with two chiral centers but no net chirality.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the actual process. When you reduce each ketone in the symmetric diketone, each reduction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. But because the molecule is symmetric, the two ketones' reductions are linked. So, if one ketone is reduced to R, the other must be reduced to S (because of the symmetry), leading to a meso compound. So the product is a single compound, which is the meso form. Thus, Reaction II gives a single product.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about this. I might have to look this up, but since I can't do that, I'll proceed with the assumption that Reaction II yields a single meso compound.

Now, combining the products from both reactions.

Reaction I gives a racemic mixture at C3 (since the reduction leads to a 50:50 mixture of R and S configurations at C3), while C5 remains as S. So, the product from Reaction I has two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S) configurations at C3 and C5. Wait, but wait, C5 is fixed as S, so for each configuration at C3, the product would be a pair of enantiomers if considering both centers. Wait, no, the C3 configuration would vary, but C5 is fixed, so each would be a diastereomer, not an enantiomer.

Wait, this is getting complicated again. Let me think: Reaction I's product has two chiral centers, C3 and C5. The starting material is (S) at C5, so the product's C5 remains S. The C3 is a new chiral center that could be R or S, leading to two possible diastereomers. Since the reduction is racemic, the product is a racemic mixture of the two diastereomers. Wait, no, because C5 is fixed, each diastereomer is a single enantiomer. Or perhaps they're enantiomers? No, because enantiomers have opposite configurations in all chiral centers. But here, C5 is fixed as S. So if C3 is R, the molecule is (R,S), and if C3 is S, it's (S,S). These are diastereomers, not enantiomers.

Wait, but if the product is a racemic mixture at C3, then you have equal amounts of (R,S) and (S,S) diastereomers. Wait, but the (S,S) configuration would be a different diastereomer than (R,S). So the product from Reaction I is a mixture of two diastereomers, each of which is a single enantiomer because the other chiral center is fixed. So, in total, the product is two diastereomers, each present in equal amounts.

Wait, but no. Let's clarify: the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, C3 and C5. The starting material is (S) at C5. Upon reduction, C3 becomes a new chiral center, which can be R or S. So the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but C5 remains S. So the product has two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S). These are diastereomers, not enantiomers, because they differ in configuration at one chiral center. So the product is a 50:50 mixture of these two diastereomers.

So Reaction I gives 2 diastereomers.

Reaction II gives a single product, the meso compound.

Now, when the products from both reactions are combined, what do we have?

From Reaction I: two diastereomers (each is a pair of enantiomers, but since they're each a single enantiomer because C5 is fixed, perhaps I'm getting this wrong). Wait, no. I think I'm mixing up enantiomers and diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of stereoisomers in each product.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → after reduction, product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Because C5 is fixed as S, the possible configurations are:

- C3: R → (R,S)
- C3: S → (S,S)

Since the reduction is racemic, both are present in equal amounts. So two diastereomers, each with a single enantiomer because the other center is fixed.

So Reaction I gives two diastereomers, each present as a single enantiomer.

Reaction II: gives a single meso compound, which is not chiral, so it's a single product.

So when the products are combined, what's the total number of stereoisomers?

Reaction I gives two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S).

Reaction II gives one product: the meso compound (which is 2,4-pentanediol).

So the combined products are three stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

But wait, wait. Let me think again: the product from Reaction II is a single compound, which is a meso form. So it's not chiral, but it's a single molecule.

So the combined products are:

- From Reaction I: two diastereomers (each present as a racemic mixture? Or as single enantiomers?)

Wait, no. The product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each present as a racemic mixture? Or perhaps each is a single enantiomer?

Wait, no. Let me think again: the starting material is (S)-configured at C5. When you reduce the ketone at C3, you get two possible configurations at C3 (R and S), each in equal amounts. So the product from Reaction I is a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S). So these are two diastereomers.

Now, when you combine the products from both reactions, you have:

- (R,S) and (S,S) from Reaction I (each is a diastereomer, each present as a single enantiomer)
- (meso compound) from Reaction II (single product, not chiral)

So the total number of stereoisomers in the mixture is 3: two from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

But wait, the meso compound is a single stereoisomer, but it's a diastereomer with the others. Hmm, no, the meso compound is a single molecule, so when combined, the three stereoisomers would be:

1. (R,S) 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
2. (S,S) 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
3. meso-2,4-pentanediol

So three stereoisomers in total.

Now, when these are run on an HPLC column, how many peaks would each method show?

First, on a normal-phase HPLC. Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on their polarity, but it's not chiral. So any enantiomers or diastereomers that have different polarities would elute at different times. But wait, if the compounds are diastereomers, they would have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times. But if they are enantiomers, they would have the same physical properties except for chirality, so in normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers would co-elute.

Wait, but in our case, the products are diastereomers and a meso compound, which is not chiral. The meso compound would elute as a single peak. The diastereomers from Reaction I would elute as separate peaks because they are different in terms of physical properties. So in the normal-phase HPLC, we would see three peaks: two from the diastereomers and one from the meso compound.

Wait, but wait. The diastereomers (R,S) and (S,S) are two different compounds, so they'd elute separately. The meso compound is another, so three peaks in total on normal-phase HPLC.

But wait, looking at the options, the options don't have three peaks in normal-phase. Let me look.

Options:

A) 5 and 4
B)3 and 2
C)4 and 2
D)3 and 3.

Wait, the options for normal-phase are 4, 2, 2, 3.

Wait, but according to my analysis, the normal-phase would show three peaks: two from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

But looking at the options, option D says 3 peaks in both columns, which would mean three peaks in normal-phase and three in chiral. But let me think about the chiral HPLC.

Chiral HPLC columns are designed to separate enantiomers. So, any enantiomers present would elute at different times, showing separate peaks. So, let's see:

From Reaction I: the product is a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) diastereomers. Wait, but wait, are these diastereomers or enantiomers? Let me think.

Each diastereomer is a distinct compound because they have different configurations at C3 and C5. So, (R,S) and (S,S) are diastereomers, not enantiomers. Therefore, on a chiral HPLC column, would they elute as separate peaks? Yes, because they are different compounds. The meso compound, being a single compound, would elute as a single peak.

Wait, but wait. Wait, (R,S) and (S,S) are diastereomers, so they would have different retention times on a chiral column. The meso compound is a single molecule, so it's one peak. So on a chiral HPLC, you would see three peaks.

Wait, but the meso compound is from Reaction II, which is a single product. So the combined products would have three stereoisomers: two diastereomers and one meso. So on a normal-phase HPLC, they would show three peaks, and on a chiral HPLC, they would also show three peaks.

But looking at the options, option D says 3 in both. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

B)3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

C)4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

D)3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

So according to this, option D would have three peaks in both. But earlier I thought that Reaction I gives two diastereomers and Reaction II gives one, so three in total. So in normal-phase, three peaks; in chiral, three peaks.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about Reaction I's product.

Reaction I's product is (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol), which has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Because the starting material is (S) at C5, the product's C5 remains S. The C3 is a new chiral center, which is racemic (R and S configurations). So the product is a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S).

These are two diastereomers. So in the mixture from Reaction I, you have two diastereomers, each as a racemic mixture? Or each as a single enantiomer?

Wait, no. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer (S) at C5, and the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, the product is a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S). These are two diastereomers.

So when you combine Reaction I and Reaction II, you have:

From I: (R,S) and (S,S) → two diastereomers.

From II: meso-2,4-pentanediol → one compound.

So three stereoisomers in total.

On normal-phase HPLC, each would be a separate peak because they have different physical properties. So three peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, enantiomers would separate, but for diastereomers, they would also separate. So the three would each elute as separate peaks. So three peaks in both columns.

Which would correspond to option D: 3 peaks in both.

But looking back at the options, option D says 3 peaks in both. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, from Reaction I, the product is a mixture of two diastereomers, each present as a racemic mixture. Wait, no, each diastereomer is a single enantiomer. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction leads to a racemic mixture of the new chiral center. So for each configuration at C3, you have a single enantiomer with C5 fixed as S.

So, the two diastereomers are (R,S) and (S,S), each present as a single enantiomer. So when you have a racemic mixture at C3, you get a 50:50 mixture of these two diastereomers.

So, when you run on HPLC, in normal-phase, each diastereomer would be a separate peak. So two peaks from Reaction I and one from Reaction II → three peaks.

On a chiral column, each diastereomer would be a separate peak, but would enantiomers be separated?

Wait, no. Because on a chiral column, enantiomers would be separated, but diastereomers would also be separated. So all three would be separate peaks.

Wait, but the two diastereomers are (R,S) and (S,S), which are different compounds. So on a chiral column, they would elute at different times.

The meso compound would be a single peak.

So in total, three peaks on chiral HPLC and three on normal-phase.

So the answer would be D) 3 peaks in both.

But wait, looking at the options, option D says 3 in both. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the count. Let me think again.

Reaction I's product: two diastereomers, each a single enantiomer. So when combined, you have two peaks on normal-phase (because diastereomers elute separately) and two on chiral (because each is a single enantiomer, but wait, no, the chiral column separates enantiomers, but diastereomers are already separated on normal-phase.

Wait, no: on a chiral column, any enantiomeric pairs would elute separately. But diastereomers that are not enantiomers would also elute separately because they're different compounds.

Wait, so in Reaction I: you have two diastereomers, each a single enantiomer. So when run on a chiral column, each would be a separate peak, but since they're diastereomers, not enantiomers, they would elute at different times. So Reaction I contributes two peaks on chiral column.

Reaction II contributes one peak.

So total in chiral HPLC: three peaks.

In normal-phase: same as chiral, three peaks.

So option D.

But looking at the options again, option D is "3 peaks in both".

So the answer should be D.

To determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, we analyze the products of the two reactions and their behavior on both normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns.

### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH
1. **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a chiral center at C5 (S-configuration) and a ketone at C3.
2. **Reaction**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, introducing a new chiral center at C3. The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
3. **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the ketone at C3 produces a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers:
   - (R,S): C3 = R, C5 = S
   - (S,S): C3 = S, C5 = S
4. **Result**: Reaction I yields a mixture of two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S).

### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4
1. **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric diketone.
2. **Reaction**: NaBH4 reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol.
3. **Stereochemistry**: Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the product is a meso compound. The two chiral centers (C2 and C4) have opposite configurations, resulting in an internal plane of symmetry. Thus, the product is a single achiral compound: meso-2,4-pentanediol.
4. **Result**: Reaction II yields a single meso compound.

### Combined Products
1. **From Reaction I**: Two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S).
2. **From Reaction II**: One meso compound: meso-2,4-pentanediol.
3. **Total Stereoisomers**: Three distinct compounds are present in the mixture:
   - (R,S) 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
   - (S,S) 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
   - meso-2,4-pentanediol

### Behavior on HPLC Columns
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**: This column separates compounds based on polarity. Diastereomers and the meso compound have different physical properties and will elute as separate peaks. Thus, three peaks are observed.
2. **Chiral HPLC**: This column separates enantiomers. However, diastereomers like (R,S) and (S,S) are also separated because they are distinct compounds. The meso compound, being achiral, will elute as a single peak. Thus, three peaks are observed.

### Final Answer
The chemist observes **3 peaks** in both the normal-phase HPLC and the chiral HPLC chromatograms.
