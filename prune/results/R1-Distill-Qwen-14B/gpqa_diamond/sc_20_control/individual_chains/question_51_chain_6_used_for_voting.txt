Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, right. Grounded conducting sphere... I remember that when a conductor is grounded, it's connected to the Earth, which means it can lose or gain charges as needed. 

So the setup is: a charge q is outside a conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so it can have induced charges. But wait, how does that affect the potential energy of the system?

Potential energy between charges, right? I think the potential energy of the system depends on the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so maybe the potential on the sphere is zero? Because being grounded means the potential is the same as Earth's, which is taken as zero.

Wait, but the charge q is outside the sphere. So when q is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges will adjust such that the sphere's potential is zero. So the charges on the sphere will rearrange until the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Let me think about this. The charge q induces a charge on the sphere. Because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges will be on the surface. The sphere is initially neutral, I think. Because it's grounded, when we bring q near, the sphere will have induced charges: opposite to q on the near side and same as q on the far side. But wait, since it's grounded, any excess charge would flow away. So does that mean the sphere ends up with zero net charge? Hmm, no. Wait, no, the induced charges might still be present, but the net charge could be zero because any excess would go to ground. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. If I have a conducting sphere, and I bring a charge q near it, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere is zero. But since the sphere is grounded, any net charge would flow away. So the sphere's total charge would be zero? Because if it had a net charge, that would change the ground's potential, which we can't have. So the sphere remains neutral overall, but the induced charges are on the surface.

Wait, but that's conflicting. Because if the sphere remains neutral, how does the induced charge affect the system's potential energy? Oh, but the induced charges are on the surface, so they might have a distribution that depends on the position of q.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated considering the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to the point d away, and the work done in reconfiguring the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, maybe the induced charges don't contribute to the net potential energy because their potential is zero.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the method to calculate the potential energy. When you have a charge near a conductor, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to its position, taking into account the induced charges on the conductor.

But since the conductor is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential at any point is due to external charges plus the induced charges. But since the induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential on the sphere is zero, maybe the potential at the point where q is placed is just due to the induced charges.

Wait, no. The potential energy of the system would be the work done in assembling the charges. So when you bring the charge q near the sphere, you're doing work against the electric field created by the induced charges. But the sphere being grounded complicates things because it allows charges to flow in or out.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's potential is grounded to zero, so the potential at the location of q is just due to the induced charges.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of image charges. I remember that for a grounded sphere, the image method can be used. When a charge is outside a grounded sphere, the image charge is inside the sphere. Wait, no, the image method for a grounded sphere: when a charge q is placed outside, the image charge would be inside the sphere. Or wait, the image charge method is for a conducting sphere at potential V, not necessarily grounded. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the potential on the sphere. The sphere is at zero potential because it's grounded. So the potential at the center of the sphere is zero. The potential at a point outside the sphere would be due to all the charges, including the induced ones.

Wait, let me recap. The sphere is conducting, so the induced charges will be on the surface. The charge q is outside the sphere, at a distance d from the center. So the sphere's radius is R, and d > R.

The sphere is neutral (since it's grounded, any excess charge would leave, but when you bring a charge q near it, the sphere will have induced surface charges. The system's potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to distance d, plus the work done in reconfiguring the induced charges on the sphere.

But because the sphere is grounded, the induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Wait, no. The sphere's surface is at the same potential as the ground, which is zero. So the potential on the sphere is zero.

So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the potential at that point is the sum of the potential due to the induced charges. Let me denote the induced charge on the sphere as Q. Wait, no, it's not a single charge but a distribution. But for a conducting sphere, the induced charge distribution can be considered as if it were a point charge at the center, because the sphere's potential is spherically symmetric.

So maybe we can model the induced charge as a charge Q located at the center of the sphere. Then, the potential at the point where q is placed (distance d from the center) would be the potential due to Q.

Wait, but wait. The sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. The potential at the center is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * Q/(R), because the surface is at zero potential. Wait, no, because for a sphere, the potential inside is the same as on the surface. Wait, no, that's for a uniformly charged sphere. Oh, but if the sphere is conducting, the potential is the same everywhere on the surface, but inside, it's a constant potential as well. So the potential at the center is the same as on the surface. But since the sphere is grounded, the surface potential is zero. So the potential at the center is zero.

But then, the potential at the point where q is located (distance d from the center) would be due to the induced charge configuration. Since the sphere is conducting, the induced charge distribution is such that it's equivalent to a point charge inside the sphere.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the induced charge as a point charge inside the sphere, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The conducting sphere, when placed in the electric field of charge q, will have induced charges. The induced charge distribution will be such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is equal to the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the surface is zero. So the potential due to all charges (external and induced) on the sphere's surface is zero.

So the potential on the surface is V = (k q)/(d) + (k Q_induced)/(R) = 0, because at the surface, the distance from the induced charges (if considered as a point charge) would be R, and the distance from q is d.

Wait, but Q_induced is a point charge at the center, so the potential on the surface is k q/(d) + k Q/(R) = 0.

So Q = - (q R ) / d.

Wait, that makes sense. So the induced charge on the sphere will be Q = - (q R)/d.

But wait, let me double-check the math. The potential on the surface is zero, so:

k q/(d) + k Q/(R) = 0.

So solving for Q gives Q = - (q R)/d.

So the induced charge on the sphere is Q = - (q R)/d.

But wait, I thought the sphere is neutral. Oh no, no, wait. The sphere is grounded, so any induced charges can leave. But in this case, the induced charges are such that the potential on the surface is zero. So the sphere's surface is at zero potential, which is the same as the ground. So the total charge on the sphere would be whatever is needed to make the surface potential zero. So Q is the induced charge on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere's own charge plus the induced charge... Hmm, no, wait. Maybe the sphere is initially neutral, but when we bring the charge q near, the sphere's surface develops a charge Q such that the potential on the surface is zero.

So the sphere's induced charge is Q = - (q R)/d, as we found earlier.

But wait, does the sphere have any net charge? Since it's grounded, any excess charge would flow away. But in this case, the induced charge is necessary to make the surface potential zero. So the sphere's net charge is Q, which is - (q R)/d. But wait, that would make the sphere have a net charge. But if the sphere is grounded, any net charge would flow to the ground, so the sphere remains neutral. Hmm, that's a conflict.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The sphere being grounded allows it to have a net charge, but in this case, the charge on the sphere is induced by the external charge q. But since the sphere is connected to ground, the induced charges can flow into the ground, making the sphere neutral again. So perhaps the sphere remains neutral, and the image charge concept applies.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach this using the method of images. For a conducting sphere not at a potential, the image charge approach is used. But when the sphere is grounded, the image charge concept might change.

In the method of images, for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the sphere can be replaced with an image charge inside the sphere such that the potential on the sphere is the same as if the sphere were conducting. But when the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero, which simplifies things.

So, for a grounded sphere, the image charge q' would be inside the sphere, and the potential on the sphere is zero. The image charge is such that the potential at any point on the sphere is zero.

Wait, but how does that help me find the potential energy?

The potential energy U of the system is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the image charge. Since the sphere is at zero potential, the potential at the point where q is placed would be due to the image charge.

Wait, maybe the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charges. So when bringing q from infinity, you're moving against the electric field created by the image charge.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is equal to the work done in assembling the system, which includes the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is part of the system, and because it's grounded, maybe the induced charges are part of the system. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the potential energy could be calculated as the work done in bringing the charge q to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere, plus the work done in creating the induced charges.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which might simplify the calculation.

Wait, another approach: when you place a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges create a potential at the location of q. The potential energy is the product of the charge q and this potential.

So, the potential at the location of q is V = (k Q)/(d - R) + (k (-Q'))/(d + R), but that's probably not correct because the induced charges are on the sphere. Alternatively, maybe I should model the induced charge as a point charge at the center.

Wait, let me think. The induced charge on the sphere is Q_induced = - (q R)/d, as I found earlier. Then, the potential at q's position is due to this induced charge.

Wait, but q is at a distance d from the center of the sphere. The induced charge Q is located at the center, so the distance between q and Q is d.

So the potential at q's position due to Q is V = k Q / d.

So the potential energy U is q * V = q * (k Q / d).

Substituting Q = -(q R)/d, we get:

U = q * [k (-q R)/(d^2)] = - (k q^2 R) / d^2.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see this expression. So maybe I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the work done in assembling both the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the work done to bring the charge q from infinity (against the field created by the sphere) plus the work done in creating the induced charges on the sphere.

But the induced charges are on the sphere, which is part of the system. But since the sphere is grounded, perhaps the work done in creating the induced charges is zero because the charges are supplied by the earth. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy U of the system is equal to the work done to assemble the charges q and Q_induced, considering their mutual potential.

So U = (1/2) k (q * Q_induced) * (1/d) ), since the distance between them is d.

Wait, but the induced charge Q is - (q R)/d, as before.

So substituting Q,

U = (1/2) k ( q * (-q R/d) ) / d )

= (1/2) k (- q^2 R) / d²

= - (1/2) k q^2 R / d².

Hmm, that's another expression. But again, looking at the options, none of them match this exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the system's potential energy as the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced image charge, taking into account the potential each creates on the other.

But the sphere is a conductor, so the potential on the sphere is zero. The potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The induced charge on the sphere is Q, which creates a potential V = k Q / d at the location of q.

So the potential energy U is q * V = q * (k Q/d).

But since Q is the induced charge, which is - (q R)/d, as found earlier.

So:

U = q * [k (- q R/d) / d ]

= - k q^2 R / d².

But again, none of the options match this exactly.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A) U= - (1/2)k q^2 d/(d² + R²)

Option C) U= - (1/2)k q² R²/(d² - R²)

Hmm, my result is -k q² R /d², which isn't among any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the induced charge.

Wait, perhaps the induced charge is not Q = - q R/d. Let me re-examine that step.

The potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The potential is due to the external charge q and the induced charge Q.

Wait, the potential on the sphere's surface is the sum of the potential due to q and the potential due to Q.

So,

V_surface = k q / R' + k Q / R,

where R' is the distance from q to the sphere's surface. Wait, no. Wait, the charge q is at a distance d from the center. The sphere's radius is R, so the distance from q to the surface of the sphere (the point on the sphere closest to q) is d - R.

Wait, no, because if the sphere's radius is R, and the charge q is at distance d from the center, then the distance from q to the surface (the closest point) is d - R. So the potential at the surface due to q is k q / (d - R). Wait, but for a sphere, the potential outside is as if all the charge were at the center. So the potential on the sphere's surface due to q is k q/(d), since d is the distance from the center of the sphere to q. Because for a sphere, the potential at a point outside is the same as if the charge were at the center.

So, the potential on the sphere's surface is k q/(d) + k Q/(R) = 0.

Because the sphere is conducting, the potential at any point on the surface is the same. So the potential is zero, so:

k q/(d) + k Q/(R) = 0.

So solving for Q:

Q = - (q R) / d.

Hmm, same as before.

So, the induced charge is Q = -(q R)/d.

But wait, if the sphere is grounded, any induced charge on it would flow away, leaving the sphere neutral. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain charges to maintain its potential at zero. So when we bring the charge q near, the sphere's induced charges would adjust so that the potential on the surface is zero.

But if the sphere is neutral, the induced charges would have to be such that the sum is zero, but that doesn't make sense because bringing a charge near would induce opposite charges on the near side and same on the far side. But if the sphere is neutral overall, then the induced charges would cancel out, which would mean no net induced charge.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because in reality, the presence of the external charge q would induce a redistribution of charges on the sphere. So the sphere would have induced charges on its surface, but the total charge would be zero because it's neutral.

Wait, but that would mean that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero due to the induced charges, but the presence of q would affect it. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential on the sphere's surface is due to all the charges in the system. Since the sphere is grounded, V=0 on the surface.

So the potential on the sphere is V = V_q + V_induced = 0.

But V_q is the potential due to charge q at the sphere's surface. Since the sphere is a conductor, the potential on its surface due to external charges is the same as if the charge were at the center.

So V_q = k q / d, because d is the distance from the center to q.

The induced charges on the sphere create a potential V_induced. Since the induced charges are on the sphere's surface, their potential at the center is zero. Wait, no, because for a sphere, the potential inside is constant and equal to the potential on the surface. So if the induced charges are Q, then the potential at the center due to Q is k Q / R. But the sphere is grounded, so the potential on the surface is zero. So the potential at the center is also zero.

Wait, so the potential at the center due to the induced charges is zero, because the sphere is conducting and the induced charges are on the surface. So the potential inside the sphere is the same as on the surface, which is zero.

So, the potential on the surface of the sphere is the sum of the potential due to q and the potential due to the induced charges. But since the sphere is conducting and the induced charges are on the surface, the potential on the surface is zero. So:

k q / d + (potential due to induced charges on the surface) = 0.

But the potential on the surface due to the induced charges is zero because the sphere's surface is at zero potential. Hmm, that can't be right. Because then, the potential due to the induced charges would have to be -k q/d, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere's surface is zero because the sphere is a conductor. Because inside a conductor, the electric field is zero, and the potential is the same everywhere. So the induced charges don't contribute to the potential on the surface of the sphere because their potential is zero.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The induced charges would create a potential outside the sphere, but on the surface, the potential due to the induced charges would be the same as the potential on the surface. But since the sphere is at zero potential, the sum of the potentials due to all charges is zero.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another way to think about this: the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges don't contribute to the potential energy because they can move freely. Or perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges. Let me denote the induced charge as Q. Then, the potential at that point is V = k Q / d.

The potential energy U is q * V.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at the surface due to Q is zero. Wait, but the potential on the surface is zero, which is V = k Q / R = 0. So Q = 0?

But that can't be right because Q is the induced charge due to q.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look up the formula for the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere.

Wait, I remember that for a conducting sphere of radius R, when a charge q is placed at a distance d from its center, the potential energy of the system is U = - (k q^2 R) / (2 d^2).

Wait, but that's not one of the options either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is U = - (k q^2 R^2)/(2 (d^2 - R^2)).

Wait, that's option C. But how?

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. The system includes the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

The induced charge Q on the sphere can be found by considering that the sphere is grounded, so the potential on the surface is zero. The potential at the surface is due to the external charge q and the induced charge Q.

So:

V_surface = (k q)/(d) + (k Q)/(R) = 0.

So, Q = - (q R)/d.

Now, the potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential at that point due to the induced charge Q.

So the potential at the location of q is V = (k Q)/(d) = (k (- q R/d )) / d = - k q R / d².

So the potential energy U is q * V = q (-k q R / d²) = - (k q² R) / d².

But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2. Because when considering the potential energy between two charges, you take into account the work done in assembling them, which is ½ k q1 q2 / r.

So maybe the potential energy U is (1/2) * (k q Q) / d.

Since Q is - q R / d,

U = (1/2) * k q * (- q R / d ) / d.

= - (1/2) k q^2 R / d².

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d² + R²).

Option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²).

Hmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I should model the potential energy as the work done in assembling the charge q and the image charge. For a conducting sphere, the image charge method can be used. The image charge q' is located inside the sphere, at a distance of (R^2)/d from the center, along the line connecting the charge q and the center of the sphere.

Wait, right! The method of images states that the potential outside a conducting sphere can be found by replacing the sphere with an image charge. So the image charge q' is located at a distance of (R^2)/d from the center, opposite the direction of q.

So, the image charge q' is inside the sphere, at a distance d' = R² / d from the center.

The total potential energy U of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between the charge q and the image charge q', and between the image charge and the sphere.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the details. Let me think.

In the method of images, the potential energy of the system is the same as if the sphere were replaced by the image charge. So the potential energy U is the potential energy between q and q', plus any other contributions.

But the sphere is conducting and grounded, so the image charge's presence effectively accounts for the induced charges. So the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy due to the two charges: q and q'.

The image charge q' is inside the sphere, so it's at distance d' = R²/d from the center. So the distance between q and q' is d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, no, because q is at distance d from the center, and the image charge is at distance d' from the center in the opposite direction. So the distance between q and q' is d + d' = d + (R²/d) = (d² + R²)/d.

Wait, that's correct. So the distance between q and q' is (d² + R²)/(d) = d + (R²/d).

So the potential energy between q and q' is U = (1/2) * k * (q) * (-q) / ( (d² + R²)/d )

= (1/2) * k * (-q²) * d / (d² + R²)

= - (1/2) k q² d / (d² + R²).

Hmm, this matches option A.

Wait, but why is the image charge negative? Because the image charge has a sign opposite to q. Because the sphere is grounded, the image charge q' is inside the sphere and has the opposite sign of q.

So the potential energy is between q and q', which are opposite charges. So the energy is negative, which makes sense.

So the correct answer is option A: U = - (1/2) k q² d / (d² + R²).

But wait, why did this approach work? Because the image charge method effectively accounts for the induced charges on the sphere, and the potential energy is calculated based on the interaction between q and q', plus any other contributions. But in this case, since the sphere is a conductor, the image charge accounts for all the induced effects, making the calculation straightforward.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \) and a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere. The sphere being grounded ensures that its surface potential is zero. The presence of \( q \) induces charges on the sphere's surface, and the system's potential energy arises from the interaction between \( q \) and these induced charges.

Using the method of images, the conducting sphere can be replaced by an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere. The image charge is located at a distance \( d' = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center, along the line connecting \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The total potential energy of the system is then determined by the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \). Since the sphere is grounded, the image charge \( q' \) has a magnitude \( \frac{R^2}{d} q \) and an opposite sign to \( q \).

The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is:

\[
r = d + d' = d + \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 + R^2}{d}.
\]

The potential energy \( U \) of the system is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \cdot (-q)}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} k \frac{q^2}{r}.
\]

Substituting \( r = \frac{d^2 + R^2}{d} \), we find:

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} k \frac{q^2 d}{d^2 + R^2}.
\]

This matches option A. The other options do not align with the correct calculation of the potential energy using the method of images and the properties of a grounded conducting sphere.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, right. Grounded conducting sphere... I remember that when a conductor is grounded, it's connected to the Earth, which means it can lose or gain charges as needed. 

So the setup is: a charge q is outside a conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so it can have induced charges. But wait, how does that affect the potential energy of the system?

Potential energy between charges, right? I think the potential energy of the system depends on the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so maybe the potential on the sphere is zero? Because being grounded means the potential is the same as Earth's, which is taken as zero.

Wait, but the charge q is outside the sphere. So when q is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges will adjust such that the sphere's potential is zero. So the charges on the sphere will rearrange until the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Let me think about this. The charge q induces a charge on the sphere. Because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges will be on the surface. The sphere is initially neutral, I think. Because it's grounded, when we bring q near, the sphere will have induced charges: opposite to q on the near side and same as q on the far side. But wait, since it's grounded, any excess charge would flow away. So does that mean the sphere ends up with zero net charge? Hmm, no. Wait, no, the induced charges might still be present, but the net charge could be zero because any excess would go to ground. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. If I have a conducting sphere, and I bring a charge q near it, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere is zero. But since the sphere is grounded, any net charge would flow away. So the sphere's total charge would be zero? Because if it had a net charge, that would change the ground's potential, which we can't have. So the sphere remains neutral overall, but the induced charges are on the surface.

Wait, but that's conflicting. Because if the sphere remains neutral, how does the induced charge affect the system's potential energy? Oh, but the induced charges are on the surface, so they might have a distribution that depends on the position of q.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated considering the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to the point d away, and the work done in reconfiguring the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, maybe the induced charges don't contribute to the net potential energy because their potential is zero.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the method to calculate the potential energy. When you have a charge near a conductor, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to its position, taking into account the induced charges on the conductor.

But since the conductor is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential at any point is due to external charges plus the induced charges. But since the induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential on the sphere is zero, maybe the potential at the point where q is placed is just due to the induced charges.

Wait, no. The potential energy of the system would be the work done in assembling the charges. So when you bring the charge q near the sphere, you're doing work against the electric field created by the induced charges. But the sphere being grounded complicates things because it allows charges to flow in or out.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's potential is grounded to zero, so the potential at the location of q is just due to the induced charges.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of image charges. I remember that for a grounded sphere, the image method can be used. When a charge is outside a grounded sphere, the image charge is inside the sphere. Wait, no, the image method for a grounded sphere: when a charge q is placed outside, the image charge would be inside the sphere. Or wait, the image charge method is for a conducting sphere at potential V, not necessarily grounded. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the potential on the sphere. The sphere is at zero potential because it's grounded. So the potential at the center of the sphere is zero. The potential at a point outside the sphere would be due to all the charges, including the induced ones.

Wait, let me recap. The sphere is conducting, so the induced charges will be on the surface. The charge q is outside the sphere, at a distance d from the center. So the sphere's radius is R, and d > R.

The sphere is neutral (since it's grounded, any excess charge would leave, but when you bring a charge q near it, the sphere will have induced surface charges. The system's potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to distance d, plus the work done in reconfiguring the induced charges on the sphere.

But because the sphere is grounded, the induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Wait, no. The sphere's surface is at the same potential as the ground, which is zero. So the potential on the sphere is zero.

So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the potential at that point is the sum of the potential due to the induced charges. Let me denote the induced charge on the sphere as Q. Wait, no, it's not a single charge but a distribution. But for a conducting sphere, the induced charge distribution can be considered as if it were a point charge at the center, because the sphere's potential is spherically symmetric.

So maybe we can model the induced charge as a charge Q located at the center of the sphere. Then, the potential at the point where q is placed (distance d from the center) would be the potential due to Q.

Wait, but wait. The sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. The potential at the center is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * Q/(R), because the surface is at zero potential. Wait, no, because for a sphere, the potential inside is the same as on the surface. Wait, no, that's for a uniformly charged sphere. Oh, but if the sphere is conducting, the potential is the same everywhere on the surface, but inside, it's a constant potential as well. So the potential at the center is the same as on the surface. But since the sphere is grounded, the surface potential is zero. So the potential at the center is zero.

But then, the potential at the point where q is located (distance d from the center) would be due to the induced charge configuration. Since the sphere is conducting, the induced charge distribution is such that it's equivalent to a point charge inside the sphere.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the induced charge as a point charge inside the sphere, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The conducting sphere, when placed in the electric field of charge q, will have induced charges. The induced charge distribution will be such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is equal to the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the surface is zero. So the potential due to all charges (external and induced) on the sphere's surface is zero.

So the potential on the surface is V = (k q)/(d) + (k Q_induced)/(R) = 0, because at the surface, the distance from the induced charges (if considered as a point charge) would be R, and the distance from q is d.

Wait, but Q_induced is a point charge at the center, so the potential on the surface is k q/(d) + k Q/(R) = 0.

So Q = - (q R ) / d.

Wait, that makes sense. So the induced charge on the sphere will be Q = - (q R)/d.

But wait, let me double-check the math. The potential on the surface is zero, so:

k q/(d) + k Q/(R) = 0.

So solving for Q gives Q = - (q R)/d.

So the induced charge on the sphere is Q = - (q R)/d.

But wait, I thought the sphere is neutral. Oh no, no, wait. The sphere is grounded, so any induced charges can leave. But in this case, the induced charges are such that the potential on the surface is zero. So the sphere's surface is at zero potential, which is the same as the ground. So the total charge on the sphere would be whatever is needed to make the surface potential zero. So Q is the induced charge on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere's own charge plus the induced charge... Hmm, no, wait. Maybe the sphere is initially neutral, but when we bring the charge q near, the sphere's surface develops a charge Q such that the potential on the surface is zero.

So the sphere's induced charge is Q = - (q R)/d, as we found earlier.

But wait, does the sphere have any net charge? Since it's grounded, any excess charge would flow away. But in this case, the induced charge is necessary to make the surface potential zero. So the sphere's net charge is Q, which is - (q R)/d. But wait, that would make the sphere have a net charge. But if the sphere is grounded, any net charge would flow to the ground, so the sphere remains neutral. Hmm, that's a conflict.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The sphere being grounded allows it to have a net charge, but in this case, the charge on the sphere is induced by the external charge q. But since the sphere is connected to ground, the induced charges can flow into the ground, making the sphere neutral again. So perhaps the sphere remains neutral, and the image charge concept applies.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach this using the method of images. For a conducting sphere not at a potential, the image charge approach is used. But when the sphere is grounded, the image charge concept might change.

In the method of images, for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the sphere can be replaced with an image charge inside the sphere such that the potential on the sphere is the same as if the sphere were conducting. But when the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero, which simplifies things.

So, for a grounded sphere, the image charge q' would be inside the sphere, and the potential on the sphere is zero. The image charge is such that the potential at any point on the sphere is zero.

Wait, but how does that help me find the potential energy?

The potential energy U of the system is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the image charge. Since the sphere is at zero potential, the potential at the point where q is placed would be due to the image charge.

Wait, maybe the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charges. So when bringing q from infinity, you're moving against the electric field created by the image charge.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is equal to the work done in assembling the system, which includes the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is part of the system, and because it's grounded, maybe the induced charges are part of the system. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the potential energy could be calculated as the work done in bringing the charge q to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere, plus the work done in creating the induced charges.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which might simplify the calculation.

Wait, another approach: when you place a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges create a potential at the location of q. The potential energy is the product of the charge q and this potential.

So, the potential at the location of q is V = (k Q)/(d - R) + (k (-Q'))/(d + R), but that's probably not correct because the induced charges are on the sphere. Alternatively, maybe I should model the induced charge as a point charge at the center.

Wait, let me think. The induced charge on the sphere is Q_induced = - (q R)/d, as I found earlier. Then, the potential at q's position is due to this induced charge.

Wait, but q is at a distance d from the center of the sphere. The induced charge Q is located at the center, so the distance between q and Q is d.

So the potential at q's position due to Q is V = k Q / d.

So the potential energy U is q * V = q * (k Q / d).

Substituting Q = -(q R)/d, we get:

U = q * [k (-q R)/(d^2)] = - (k q^2 R) / d^2.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see this expression. So maybe I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the work done in assembling both the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the work done to bring the charge q from infinity (against the field created by the sphere) plus the work done in creating the induced charges on the sphere.

But the induced charges are on the sphere, which is part of the system. But since the sphere is grounded, perhaps the work done in creating the induced charges is zero because the charges are supplied by the earth. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy U of the system is equal to the work done to assemble the charges q and Q_induced, considering their mutual potential.

So U = (1/2) k (q * Q_induced) * (1/d) ), since the distance between them is d.

Wait, but the induced charge Q is - (q R)/d, as before.

So substituting Q,

U = (1/2) k ( q * (-q R/d) ) / d )

= (1/2) k (- q^2 R) / d²

= - (1/2) k q^2 R / d².

Hmm, that's another expression. But again, looking at the options, none of them match this exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the system's potential energy as the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced image charge, taking into account the potential each creates on the other.

But the sphere is a conductor, so the potential on the sphere is zero. The potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The induced charge on the sphere is Q, which creates a potential V = k Q / d at the location of q.

So the potential energy U is q * V = q * (k Q/d).

But since Q is the induced charge, which is - (q R)/d, as found earlier.

So:

U = q * [k (- q R/d) / d ]

= - k q^2 R / d².

But again, none of the options match this exactly.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A) U= - (1/2)k q^2 d/(d² + R²)

Option C) U= - (1/2)k q² R²/(d² - R²)

Hmm, my result is -k q² R /d², which isn't among any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the induced charge.

Wait, perhaps the induced charge is not Q = - q R/d. Let me re-examine that step.

The potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The potential is due to the external charge q and the induced charge Q.

Wait, the potential on the sphere's surface is the sum of the potential due to q and the potential due to Q.

So,

V_surface = k q / R' + k Q / R,

where R' is the distance from q to the sphere's surface. Wait, no. Wait, the charge q is at a distance d from the center. The sphere's radius is R, so the distance from q to the surface of the sphere (the point on the sphere closest to q) is d - R.

Wait, no, because if the sphere's radius is R, and the charge q is at distance d from the center, then the distance from q to the surface (the closest point) is d - R. So the potential at the surface due to q is k q / (d - R). Wait, but for a sphere, the potential outside is as if all the charge were at the center. So the potential on the sphere's surface due to q is k q/(d), since d is the distance from the center of the sphere to q. Because for a sphere, the potential at a point outside is the same as if the charge were at the center.

So, the potential on the sphere's surface is k q/(d) + k Q/(R) = 0.

Because the sphere is conducting, the potential at any point on the surface is the same. So the potential is zero, so:

k q/(d) + k Q/(R) = 0.

So solving for Q:

Q = - (q R) / d.

Hmm, same as before.

So, the induced charge is Q = -(q R)/d.

But wait, if the sphere is grounded, any induced charge on it would flow away, leaving the sphere neutral. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain charges to maintain its potential at zero. So when we bring the charge q near, the sphere's induced charges would adjust so that the potential on the surface is zero.

But if the sphere is neutral, the induced charges would have to be such that the sum is zero, but that doesn't make sense because bringing a charge near would induce opposite charges on the near side and same on the far side. But if the sphere is neutral overall, then the induced charges would cancel out, which would mean no net induced charge.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because in reality, the presence of the external charge q would induce a redistribution of charges on the sphere. So the sphere would have induced charges on its surface, but the total charge would be zero because it's neutral.

Wait, but that would mean that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero due to the induced charges, but the presence of q would affect it. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential on the sphere's surface is due to all the charges in the system. Since the sphere is grounded, V=0 on the surface.

So the potential on the sphere is V = V_q + V_induced = 0.

But V_q is the potential due to charge q at the sphere's surface. Since the sphere is a conductor, the potential on its surface due to external charges is the same as if the charge were at the center.

So V_q = k q / d, because d is the distance from the center to q.

The induced charges on the sphere create a potential V_induced. Since the induced charges are on the sphere's surface, their potential at the center is zero. Wait, no, because for a sphere, the potential inside is constant and equal to the potential on the surface. So if the induced charges are Q, then the potential at the center due to Q is k Q / R. But the sphere is grounded, so the potential on the surface is zero. So the potential at the center is also zero.

Wait, so the potential at the center due to the induced charges is zero, because the sphere is conducting and the induced charges are on the surface. So the potential inside the sphere is the same as on the surface, which is zero.

So, the potential on the surface of the sphere is the sum of the potential due to q and the potential due to the induced charges. But since the sphere is conducting and the induced charges are on the surface, the potential on the surface is zero. So:

k q / d + (potential due to induced charges on the surface) = 0.

But the potential on the surface due to the induced charges is zero because the sphere's surface is at zero potential. Hmm, that can't be right. Because then, the potential due to the induced charges would have to be -k q/d, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere's surface is zero because the sphere is a conductor. Because inside a conductor, the electric field is zero, and the potential is the same everywhere. So the induced charges don't contribute to the potential on the surface of the sphere because their potential is zero.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The induced charges would create a potential outside the sphere, but on the surface, the potential due to the induced charges would be the same as the potential on the surface. But since the sphere is at zero potential, the sum of the potentials due to all charges is zero.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another way to think about this: the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges don't contribute to the potential energy because they can move freely. Or perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges. Let me denote the induced charge as Q. Then, the potential at that point is V = k Q / d.

The potential energy U is q * V.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at the surface due to Q is zero. Wait, but the potential on the surface is zero, which is V = k Q / R = 0. So Q = 0?

But that can't be right because Q is the induced charge due to q.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look up the formula for the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere.

Wait, I remember that for a conducting sphere of radius R, when a charge q is placed at a distance d from its center, the potential energy of the system is U = - (k q^2 R) / (2 d^2).

Wait, but that's not one of the options either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is U = - (k q^2 R^2)/(2 (d^2 - R^2)).

Wait, that's option C. But how?

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. The system includes the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

The induced charge Q on the sphere can be found by considering that the sphere is grounded, so the potential on the surface is zero. The potential at the surface is due to the external charge q and the induced charge Q.

So:

V_surface = (k q)/(d) + (k Q)/(R) = 0.

So, Q = - (q R)/d.

Now, the potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential at that point due to the induced charge Q.

So the potential at the location of q is V = (k Q)/(d) = (k (- q R/d )) / d = - k q R / d².

So the potential energy U is q * V = q (-k q R / d²) = - (k q² R) / d².

But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2. Because when considering the potential energy between two charges, you take into account the work done in assembling them, which is ½ k q1 q2 / r.

So maybe the potential energy U is (1/2) * (k q Q) / d.

Since Q is - q R / d,

U = (1/2) * k q * (- q R / d ) / d.

= - (1/2) k q^2 R / d².

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d² + R²).

Option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²).

Hmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I should model the potential energy as the work done in assembling the charge q and the image charge. For a conducting sphere, the image charge method can be used. The image charge q' is located inside the sphere, at a distance of (R^2)/d from the center, along the line connecting the charge q and the center of the sphere.

Wait, right! The method of images states that the potential outside a conducting sphere can be found by replacing the sphere with an image charge. So the image charge q' is located at a distance of (R^2)/d from the center, opposite the direction of q.

So, the image charge q' is inside the sphere, at a distance d' = R² / d from the center.

The total potential energy U of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between the charge q and the image charge q', and between the image charge and the sphere.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the details. Let me think.

In the method of images, the potential energy of the system is the same as if the sphere were replaced by the image charge. So the potential energy U is the potential energy between q and q', plus any other contributions.

But the sphere is conducting and grounded, so the image charge's presence effectively accounts for the induced charges. So the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy due to the two charges: q and q'.

The image charge q' is inside the sphere, so it's at distance d' = R²/d from the center. So the distance between q and q' is d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, no, because q is at distance d from the center, and the image charge is at distance d' from the center in the opposite direction. So the distance between q and q' is d + d' = d + (R²/d) = (d² + R²)/d.

Wait, that's correct. So the distance between q and q' is (d² + R²)/(d) = d + (R²/d).

So the potential energy between q and q' is U = (1/2) * k * (q) * (-q) / ( (d² + R²)/d )

= (1/2) * k * (-q²) * d / (d² + R²)

= - (1/2) k q² d / (d² + R²).

Hmm, this matches option A.

Wait, but why is the image charge negative? Because the image charge has a sign opposite to q. Because the sphere is grounded, the image charge q' is inside the sphere and has the opposite sign of q.

So the potential energy is between q and q', which are opposite charges. So the energy is negative, which makes sense.

So the correct answer is option A: U = - (1/2) k q² d / (d² + R²).

But wait, why did this approach work? Because the image charge method effectively accounts for the induced charges on the sphere, and the potential energy is calculated based on the interaction between q and q', plus any other contributions. But in this case, since the sphere is a conductor, the image charge accounts for all the induced effects, making the calculation straightforward.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \) and a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere. The sphere being grounded ensures that its surface potential is zero. The presence of \( q \) induces charges on the sphere's surface, and the system's potential energy arises from the interaction between \( q \) and these induced charges.

Using the method of images, the conducting sphere can be replaced by an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere. The image charge is located at a distance \( d' = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center, along the line connecting \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The total potential energy of the system is then determined by the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \). Since the sphere is grounded, the image charge \( q' \) has a magnitude \( \frac{R^2}{d} q \) and an opposite sign to \( q \).

The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is:

\[
r = d + d' = d + \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 + R^2}{d}.
\]

The potential energy \( U \) of the system is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \cdot (-q)}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} k \frac{q^2}{r}.
\]

Substituting \( r = \frac{d^2 + R^2}{d} \), we find:

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} k \frac{q^2 d}{d^2 + R^2}.
\]

This matches option A. The other options do not align with the correct calculation of the potential energy using the method of images and the properties of a grounded conducting sphere.

**Answer: A**
