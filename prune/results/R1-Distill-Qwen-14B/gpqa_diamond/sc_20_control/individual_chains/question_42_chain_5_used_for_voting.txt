Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through. The question is about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods. Hmm.

So, the setup is that there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, Planet3. Their orbits are circular, and they were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe it's just context.

The given data: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is approximately 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is T = T_star * ( L / (16πσd²) )^(1/4) or something like that. But more accurately, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_eff * ( (R_star / (2a)) )^{-α} }, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me recall. The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by the formula:

T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + epsilon) )^(1/4)

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the formula is T = (L * (1 - a) )^(1/4) / (16 * π * sigma * d² )^(1/4) * (something else). Hmm. Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature should relate to the distance from the star. Because for a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital period, but wait, no, Kepler's third law relates the period to the semi-major axis (which is the same as radius for circular orbits).

Wait, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), right? So P² ∝ a³. So P ∝ a^(3/2). So if I can find the ratio of a for each planet, I can find the ratio of their periods.

But the problem is, how do the equilibrium temperatures relate to the semi-major axis? Let's think about the equilibrium temperature formula. The planet's equilibrium temperature (T) is given by:

T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (16 * ε) )^(1/4) * ( R_star / (2a) )^(1/2)

Wait, maybe I should look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't. So I have to proceed from memory.

Alternatively, I remember that the equilibrium temperature scales with (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance (semi-major axis). So T ∝ sqrt( L ) / d^(1/2). But wait, the star's luminosity L is related to its effective temperature T_star and radius R_star: L = 4π R_star² σ T_star^4. So substituting that in, T_planet ∝ ( R_star² T_star^4 )^(1/2) / d^(1/2) ) → T_planet ∝ R_star T_star² / d^(1/2).

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the ratio of temperatures between the planets. Since all three planets are orbiting the same star, the L and σ are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature T of each planet depends inversely on the square root of the distance from the star, and directly on the star's T_eff and radius.

Wait, but in this problem, the albedo (a) is given as 0.3 for all three planets. So the albedo is the same, so we can ignore that factor. So the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). But since L = 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4, substituting that in:

T = ( (4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4) / (16 π σ a^2) )^(1/4 )

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

= ( ( R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / (4 a^2 ) )^(1/4 )

= ( R_star^2 )^(1/4) * ( T_star^4 )^(1/4 ) * (4 a^2 )^(-1/4 )

= R_star^(1/2) * T_star * (4 a^2 )^(-1/4 )

= R_star^(1/2) T_star / (4 a^2 )^(1/4 )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. But perhaps, since all planets orbit the same star, the R_star and T_star are the same for all. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to (a)^(1/2). Because 4^(1/4) is sqrt(2), but a^(2) to the 1/4 is a^(1/2). So yes, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).

So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). Therefore, a ∝ 1 / T². Wait, no, wait: since T is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a), then sqrt(a) is proportional to 1/T. So a is proportional to 1/T².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio. Let's say for Planet1 and Planet2:

T1 / T2 = (sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1)) ) [because T1 = (1/sqrt(a1)) * const, T2= (1/sqrt(a2)) * const ]

Wait, wait, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Ah, so T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Similarly, T2/T3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Wait, wait, wait. Let me define it correctly. Let's think: T ∝ 1/sqrt(a) → T = C / sqrt(a), where C is a constant for the star (since L and R depend on the star, which is the same for all planets). So for Planet1 and Planet2,

T1 = C / sqrt(a1)
T2 = C / sqrt(a2)
So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1)

So, if the ratio T1/T2 is given as 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Square both sides: (1.4)^2 = a2/a1 → 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 a1

Hmm, that's interesting. So Planet2 is further away than Planet1 by a factor of about 1.96.

Similarly, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So:

T2/T3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

So 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Square both sides: 5.29 = a3/a2 → a3 = 5.29 a2

So a3 = 5.29 * a2 = 5.29 * 1.96 a1 ≈ let's calculate that.

1.96 *5.29, let me compute that.

1.96 *5 is 9.8, 1.96 *0.29 is about 0.5684. So total is about 10.3684. So a3 ≈ 10.3684 a1.

So the semi-major axes are a1, a2≈1.96 a1, a3≈10.3684 a1.

Now, since the orbital period P is related to a via Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³.

So the ratio of P3 to P1 is (a3/a1)^(3/2) → (10.3684)^(3/2).

Compute 10.3684^(3/2). Let's think.

10.3684^(1/2) is approx sqrt(10) is about 3.16, but 10.3684 is a bit more than 10. So sqrt(10.3684) is about 3.22.

Then 3.22^3 is 3.22 * 3.22 = about 10.3684, then 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ 33.36. So the cube of 3.22 is about 33.36.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.36.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~33.4, which matches.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because that's a big number.

So, to recap:

T1/T2 = 1.4 → a2 = (1.4)^2 a1 = 1.96 a1.

T2/T3 =2.3 → a3 = (2.3)^2 a2 =5.29 * a2=5.29 *1.96 a1= approx 10.3684 a1.

Kepler's law: P² proportional to a³, so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Compute 10.3684^(3/2) = (sqrt(10.3684))^3.

sqrt(10.3684) is approximately 3.22. 3.22^3 is 3.22 *3.22=10.3684, 10.3684 *3.22.

10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22≈1.186. So total is 32.2 +1.186≈33.386. So approximately 33.4.

So option D is ~33.4.

But looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier in the T ratio. Wait, because when T1/T2 is 1.4, which is sqrt(a2/a1), that implies a2/a1 = (1.4)^2=1.96. That's correct. So a2 is larger than a1, which makes sense.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 → sqrt(a3/a2)=2.3 → a3/a2=5.29 → a3=5.29*a2=5.29 *1.96 a1= approx 10.3684 a1.

Wait, so I think that's correct.

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and use the relationships between equilibrium temperature, semi-major axis, and orbital period.

### Key Relationships:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature and Semi-Major Axis**:  
   The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis \( a \):  
   \[
   T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
   \]  
   For two planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
   \]

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:  
   The orbital period \( P \) of a planet is related to its semi-major axis \( a \) by:  
   \[
   P^2 \propto a^3
   \]  
   Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]

### Given Data:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \)
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \)
- Albedo is the same for all planets.

### Step 1: Determine the semi-major axis ratios
From the equilibrium temperature ratios:  
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
\]  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_3}\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
\]  
Thus,  
\[
\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \cdot \frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \approx 10.3684
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the orbital period ratio
Using Kepler's Third Law:  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]  
Substitute \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \approx 10.3684 \):  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]  
First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \). Then,  
\[
(3.22)^3 \approx 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \approx 33.386
\]  
Thus,  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx 33.4
\]

### Final Answer:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

= ( ( R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / (4 a^2 ) )^(1/4 )

= ( R_star^2 )^(1/4) * ( T_star^4 )^(1/4 ) * (4 a^2 )^(-1/4 )

= R_star^(1/2) * T_star * (4 a^2 )^(-1/4 )

= R_star^(1/2) T_star / (4 a^2 )^(1/4 )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. But perhaps, since all planets orbit the same star, the R_star and T_star are the same for all. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to (a)^(1/2). Because 4^(1/4) is sqrt(2), but a^(2) to the 1/4 is a^(1/2). So yes, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).

So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). Therefore, a ∝ 1 / T². Wait, no, wait: since T is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a), then sqrt(a) is proportional to 1/T. So a is proportional to 1/T².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio. Let's say for Planet1 and Planet2:

T1 / T2 = (sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1)) ) [because T1 = (1/sqrt(a1)) * const, T2= (1/sqrt(a2)) * const ]

Wait, wait, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Ah, so T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Similarly, T2/T3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Wait, wait, wait. Let me define it correctly. Let's think: T ∝ 1/sqrt(a) → T = C / sqrt(a), where C is a constant for the star (since L and R depend on the star, which is the same for all planets). So for Planet1 and Planet2,

T1 = C / sqrt(a1)
T2 = C / sqrt(a2)
So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1)

So, if the ratio T1/T2 is given as 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Square both sides: (1.4)^2 = a2/a1 → 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 a1

Hmm, that's interesting. So Planet2 is further away than Planet1 by a factor of about 1.96.

Similarly, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So:

T2/T3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

So 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Square both sides: 5.29 = a3/a2 → a3 = 5.29 a2

So a3 = 5.29 * a2 = 5.29 * 1.96 a1 ≈ let's calculate that.

1.96 *5.29, let me compute that.

1.96 *5 is 9.8, 1.96 *0.29 is about 0.5684. So total is about 10.3684. So a3 ≈ 10.3684 a1.

Compute 10.3684^(3/2) = (sqrt(10.3684))^3.

sqrt(10.3684) is approximately 3.22. 3.22^3 is 3.22 *3.22=10.3684, 10.3684 *3.22.

10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22≈1.186. So total is 32.2 +1.186≈33.386. So approximately 33.4.

So option D is ~33.4.

But looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait, so I think that's correct.

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. So the answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and use the relationships between equilibrium temperature, semi-major axis, and orbital period.

### Key Relationships:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature and Semi-Major Axis**:  
   The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis \( a \):  
   \[
   T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
   \]  
   For two planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
   \]

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:  
   The orbital period \( P \) of a planet is related to its semi-major axis \( a \) by:  
   \[
   P^2 \propto a^3
   \]  
   Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]

### Given Data:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \)
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \)
- Albedo is the same for all planets.

### Step 1: Determine the semi-major axis ratios
From the equilibrium temperature ratios:  
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
\]  
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_3}\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
\]  
Thus,  
\[
\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \cdot \frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \approx 10.3684
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the orbital period ratio
Using Kepler's Third Law:  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]  
Substitute \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \approx 10.3684 \):  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]  
First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \). Then,  
\[
(3.22)^3 \approx 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \approx 33.386
\]  
Thus,  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx 33.4
\]

### Final Answer:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.
