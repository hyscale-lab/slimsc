Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the z-component of the total angular momentum.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z (the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron) and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. So each L_z measurement gives -ħ. What's the probability of both happening?

I remember that for angular momentum coupling, the state is a combination of states where the individual angular momenta are combined to give a total. The state given is |1,1,2,-1>, which I think is a product state when considering each electron's angular momentum. But wait, no, when you couple two angular momenta, the states are usually combinations of different possible states. But in this case, it's given as a specific |l₁, l₂, l, m> state, so maybe it's already in a coupled basis.

Wait a second, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where each electron has l=1, and the total l is 2, with m=-1. So the total angular momentum is 2ħ, and the z-component is -ħ.

Now, when we measure L₁z and L₂z, each of them can have values m₁ħ and m₂ħ, respectively. But the question is about getting m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1, so each L_z measurement gives -ħ.

But wait, in the coupled state, the individual m's are not fixed. Because the total m is the sum of the individual m's. So for the total m to be -1, the sum of m₁ and m₂ must be -1.

So m₁ + m₂ = -1. The product state where m₁ is -1 and m₂ is 0 would sum to -1, but that's not the case we want. We want both to be -1. So m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1. Their sum would be -2, but that's not equal to the total m of -1. So that's impossible.

Wait, this can't happen. Because in the coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m>, the total m is fixed. So the sum of the individual m's must be equal to the total m. Here, the total m is -1. So in any state, the sum of m₁ and m₂ is -1.

So if we are to have m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1, that would sum to -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1. Therefore, it's impossible to have both m₁ and m₂ be -1.

So the probability of this happening is zero. Because the state is such that the sum can't be anything else than -1. So any measurement where their sum isn't -1 is impossible. So getting both -1 would require a sum of -2, which is impossible in this state. So the probability is zero.

Looking at the options, option D is 0. So the answer should be D.

To determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for the given coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$, we analyze the situation as follows:

The state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ represents a system where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l_1 = l_2 = 1$, the total angular momentum quantum number is $l = 2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum is $m = -1$. In such a coupled state, the sum of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $m_1 + m_2$, must equal the total $m$ of the system, which is $-1$.

The question asks for the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. If both $m_1$ and $m_2$ were $-1$, their sum would be $-2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$. Since the total $m$ is fixed in the given state, it is impossible for both $m_1$ and $m_2$ to independently be $-1$. Therefore, the probability of this outcome is zero.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

Answer: D

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the z-component of the total angular momentum.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z (the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron) and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. So each L_z measurement gives -ħ. What's the probability of both happening?

I remember that for angular momentum coupling, the state is a combination of states where the individual angular momenta are combined to give a total. The state given is |1,1,2,-1>, which I think is a product state when considering each electron's angular momentum. But wait, no, when you couple two angular momenta, the states are usually combinations of different possible states. But in this case, it's given as a specific |l₁, l₂, l, m> state, so maybe it's already in a coupled basis.

Wait a second, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where each electron has l=1, and the total l is 2, with m=-1. So the total angular momentum is 2ħ, and the z-component is -ħ.

Now, when we measure L₁z and L₂z, each of them can have values m₁ħ and m₂ħ, respectively. But the question is about getting m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1, so each L_z measurement gives -ħ.

But wait, in the coupled state, the individual m's are not fixed. Because the total m is the sum of the individual m's. So for the total m to be -1, the sum of m₁ and m₂ must be -1.

So m₁ + m₂ = -1. The product state where m₁ is -1 and m₂ is 0 would sum to -1, but that's not the case we want. We want both to be -1. So m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1. Their sum would be -2, but that's not equal to the total m of -1. So that's impossible.

Wait, this can't happen. Because in the coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m>, the total m is fixed. So the sum of the individual m's must be equal to the total m. Here, the total m is -1. So in any state, the sum of m₁ and m₂ is -1.

So if we are to have m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1, that would sum to -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1. Therefore, it's impossible to have both m₁ and m₂ be -1.

So the probability of this happening is zero. Because the state is such that the sum can't be anything else than -1. So any measurement where their sum isn't -1 is impossible. So getting both -1 would require a sum of -2, which is impossible in this state. So the probability is zero.

Looking at the options, option D is 0. So the answer should be D.


To determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for the given coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$, we analyze the situation as follows:

The state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ represents a system where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l_1 = l_2 = 1$, the total angular momentum quantum number is $l = 2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum is $m = -1$. In such a coupled state, the sum of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $m_1 + m_2$, must equal the total $m$ of the system, which is $-1$.

The question asks for the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. If both $m_1$ and $m_2$ were $-1$, their sum would be $-2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$. Since the total $m$ is fixed in the given state, it is impossible for both $m_1$ and $m_2$ to independently be $-1$. Therefore, the probability of this outcome is zero.

From the given options, the correct answer is:
