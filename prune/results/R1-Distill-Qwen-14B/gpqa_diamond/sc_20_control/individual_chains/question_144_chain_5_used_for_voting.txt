Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data is the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in terms of meters, so I need to calculate the distance the meson travels before decaying.

I remember that the mean decay distance (or lifetime) is related to the particle's lifetime, which is connected to its width. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula I think is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait. I also need to find the velocity of the meson because the mean decay distance is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime, right? So the distance L = v * τ. Or wait, is it velocity times lifetime? Or maybe it's the speed multiplied by the lifetime. Yeah, that makes sense because distance is velocity times time.

So first, I need to find the lifetime τ. Then find the velocity v of the meson, and multiply them to get L.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Calculate the velocity v of the meson using relativistic formulas.
3. Multiply v and τ to get the mean decay distance L.

Wait, but how do I find the velocity? The meson is produced with energy E_X, but I need to find its velocity based on its mass and energy. So I should probably use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The momentum p is γ m v, where v is the velocity. Maybe I can find v from E and m.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the velocity from the energy and mass. Let's see.

The energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E - m c², but since E is given in GeV and m is also in GeV, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1. But I'm not sure. Wait, no, because we need to convert into meters and seconds, so I probably can't assume c=1 for all parts.

Let me structure this.

First, calculate the velocity v.

The total energy E = γ m c².

We can find γ as E / (m c²). So γ = E / (m c²).

But wait, E is 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²) → 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV c²) * c²? Wait, perhaps units are tricky here.

Alternative approach: Let's compute the velocity.

The meson's total energy is E, mass m. The relativistic equation is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c.

But I need to compute p, then velocity v can be found from p = γ m v.

Alternatively, velocity can be found using v = c * sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2). Oh right, that's a formula I remember. Because v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)}.

So let's compute that. Let me compute (m c²/E). Wait, but all in the same units.

Wait, but E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c². Let me think about units. So m c² = (1.2 GeV/c²) * c² = 1.2 GeV. So m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So (m c²) / E = 1.2 / 8 = 0.15.

So v = c * sqrt( 1 - (0.15)^2 ) = c * sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = c * sqrt(0.9775). What's sqrt(0.9775)? Let me approximate. 0.98875^2 is about 0.9775, because 0.9887^2 is approximately (approx 0.988 * 0.988) → 0.976, which is a bit low, maybe 0.9887^2 is 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. So about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

But more accurately, perhaps I can compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me think, 0.9887 squared is (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087². 0.98² is 0.9604. 2*0.98*0.0087 is about 0.0172. 0.0087² is about 0.000075. So total is 0.9604 + 0.0172 = 0.9776, plus 0.000075 is 0.977675. Which is a bit over 0.9775, so maybe sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9886 or so. So v ≈ 0.9886 c.

But maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me think: let x = sqrt(0.9775). So x² = 0.9775. Let me approximate x as 0.9886, as I did.

Now, the lifetime τ. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV. But wait, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, right? So ħ = h/(2π). The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, but when we use natural units and convert to GeV and seconds, it's 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me confirm that. Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s. To convert h to GeV·s, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1.602e-10 J. So h = 6.626e-34 J·s. So in GeV·s: h = 6.626e-34 / (1.602e-10) ) GeV·s. Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 / 1.602e-10 = (6.626 / 1.602) ) * 1e-24 ≈ roughly 4.136 * 1e-24 GeV·s. So h ≈ 4.136e-24 GeV·s.

Wait, but ħ is h/(2pi). So ħ ≈ (4.136e-24 GeV·s) / (6.2832) ≈ approximately 6.58e-25 GeV·s. Which matches what I thought earlier. So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 320 MeV. Wait, converting Γ to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. v is approximately 0.9886 c. So c is about 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.9886 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

Multiply 0.9886 * 3e8 → approx 2.9658e8 m/s.

Multiply this by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.9658e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Calculating the exponent: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

Now the coefficients: 2.9658 * 2.056875 ≈ let me compute that.

2.9658 * 2 is 5.9316.

2.9658 * 0.056875 ≈ approx 0.1687.

Adding together: 5.9316 + 0.1687 ≈ 6.1003.

So total is approximately 6.1003e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6e-16. The options are around 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, 5e-16.

Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the velocity. Let me double-check the velocity calculation.

Earlier, I thought (m c²)/E = 1.2 GeV / 8 GeV = 0.15. So v = c * sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = c * sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9886 c. That seems correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the velocity should be calculated using the relativistic momentum and energy. So E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

E = 8 GeV, mc² = 1.2 GeV.

So p c = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Then, p = γ m v.

So γ m v = 7.91 GeV / c.

But γ m c² = E =8 GeV → γ m = 8 GeV/(c²).

So substituting γ m =8 GeV/(c²) into the equation:

(8 GeV/(c²)) v = 7.91 GeV/(c).

Multiply both sides by c²:

8 GeV v = 7.91 GeV c.

Divide both sides by 8 GeV:

v = (7.91 c) / 8 ≈ 0.98875 c, which matches the earlier calculation. So velocity is correct.

So the calculation of v is right.

Then, back to the lifetime. Gamma is 0.32 GeV, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s. So tau is ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.0568e-24 seconds.

Then L = v * tau = 0.9886 c * 2.0568e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.9886 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Wait, 3e8 is 3*1e8.

Multiply 3e8 by 2.0568e-24: 3 * 2.0568 = 6.1704; 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So 6.1704e-16.

Multiply by 0.9886: 6.1704e-16 * 0.9886 ≈ 6.11e-16 meters.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. The options are:

A) 5.0223 *10^-16 m

B)4.0655 *10^-15 m 

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m 

D)4.0655 *10^-16 m

So I'm getting approx 6e-16 m, but the options don't have that. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the mean lifetime. Because the width Γ is given in MeV, but perhaps I should have converted it correctly to GeV.

Wait, the given Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the total decay width in a different way. Or perhaps I should have used the reduced width or something else?

Wait, another thought: The mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ, but when Γ is given in energy units (like GeV), ħ must be in the same units. Since ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, dividing by Γ in GeV gives τ in seconds. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the meson's lifetime is the proper time, and the time observed is the lab frame time which is longer due to time dilation. Wait no, because tau is the lifetime in the rest frame. So when calculating the decay length, it's the lab frame velocity multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is tau multiplied by gamma. Wait, but no, because the proper lifetime is tau. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So the mean decay length would be v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is v * gamma * tau.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

The lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor of gamma. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.

But tau_rest is the proper lifetime, which is tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, so I might have made a mistake here. Earlier, I used tau = ħ / Γ, which is the proper time. But the actual lifetime observed in the lab is longer. So the total decay length would be v * gamma * tau_rest.

Wait, but earlier I thought L = v * tau, but that's incorrect because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer by gamma. So the correct formula should be L = v * gamma * tau.

Ah, so I forgot to include the Lorentz factor gamma in the decay length calculation. That's probably where I went wrong.

So let me correct that.

First, compute tau_rest = ħ / Γ.

Then, compute gamma = E/(m c²) because E = gamma m c².

So gamma is E/(m c²) → 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 6.666666..., so gamma = 6.666... = 20/3.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest = gamma * ( ħ / Γ ).

Wait, let me compute this.

tau_lab = (E/(m c²)) * ( ħ / Γ )

So substituting the values:

E =8 GeV,

m c² =1.2 GeV,

Γ =0.32 GeV,

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

So tau_lab = (8/1.2) * (6.582e-25 / 0.32 )

Compute 8/1.2 = 6.666... = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

6.6667 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) → let's compute the division first: 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24.

Then multiply by 6.6667: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-23 seconds.

So tau_lab ≈1.37125e-23 s.

Now, the velocity is v = 0.9886 c.

So L = v * tau_lab = 0.9886 * 3e8 m/s *1.37125e-23 s.

Compute this:

0.9886 *3e8 = 2.9658e8 m/s.

Multiply by 1.37125e-23 s: 2.9658e8 * 1.37125e-23 = ?

The exponents: 1e8 * 1e-23 =1e-15.

Coefficients: 2.9658 *1.37125 ≈ Let me compute:

2 *1.37125 = 2.7425,

0.9658 *1.37125 ≈ Let's compute 0.9 *1.37125 =1.2341, 0.0658*1.37125≈0.0904. So total ≈1.2341 + 0.0904=1.3245. So total 2.7425 +1.3245=4.067.

So L ≈4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 *10^-15 m, option C is 5e-15. So option B is very close to 4.067e-15. So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, why did I get a different result when I included the gamma factor?

Because earlier I forgot to multiply by gamma, which increased the lifetime in the lab frame, thereby increasing the decay length. So the correct calculation uses v multiplied by gamma * tau_rest, which gives a longer distance.

So the steps are:

1. Compute gamma: E/(m c²) =8/1.2=6.6667.

2. Compute tau_rest: ħ/Γ =6.582e-25 /0.32=2.056875e-24 s.

3. Compute tau_lab: gamma * tau_rest =6.6667 *2.056875e-24 ≈1.37125e-23 s.

4. Compute velocity v =0.9886 c.

5. Compute L = v * tau_lab =0.9886 *3e8 *1.37125e-23 = approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

So the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me compute the exact value of gamma and ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Gamma = E/(m c²) =8 GeV /1.2 GeV =6.666..., exactly 20/3.

So gamma is exactly 20/3.

So, tau_lab = (20/3) * (6.582e-25 /0.32 )

Compute 6.582e-25 /0.32 =2.056875e-24.

Multiply by 20/3: (20/3)*2.056875e-24 = (20 *2.056875e-24 ) /3 =41.1375e-24 /3 =13.7125e-24 s =1.37125e-23 s.

Then L = v * tau_lab.

v = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ) c = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) c = sqrt(1 -0.15^2 ) c = sqrt(0.9775) c.

Which is approximately 0.9886 c.

So L =0.9886 c *1.37125e-23 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So:

0.9886 *3e8 =2.9658e8 m/s.

Multiply by 1.37125e-23 s: 2.9658e8 *1.37125e-23 = (2.9658 *1.37125 )e-15.

Compute 2.9658 *1.37125.

Let me calculate this precisely:

1.37125 *2 = 2.7425,

1.37125 *0.9 =1.234125,

1.37125 *0.0658 ≈0.09034.

Adding together:2.7425 +1.234125=3.976625 +0.09034=4.066965.

So 2.9658 *1.37125 ≈4.066965.

So L≈4.066965e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close enough, considering rounding during the calculations.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The mean decay distance \( L \) is calculated as:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the meson, and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is the lifetime of the meson in the lab frame. The proper lifetime \( \tau_{\text{rest}} \) is related to the decay width by \( \tau_{\text{rest}} = \hbar / \Gamma \), and the lab frame lifetime is \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{rest}} \), where \( \gamma = E / (m c^2) \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \tau_{\text{rest}} \)
The reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \). Using \( \tau_{\text{rest}} = \hbar / \Gamma \):
\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{20}{3} \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:
\[
v = c \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m c^2}{E}\right)^2}
\]
Substituting \( m c^2 / E = 1.2 / 8 = 0.15 \):
\[
v = c \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0.15^2} = c \cdot \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9886 \cdot c
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The speed of light \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = 0.9886 \cdot c \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]
Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.9886 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

**Answer: B**
