Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are a bit different.

Let me think. The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I shouldn't stop here.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I need to consider the relativistic kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, but how does that fit with the potential energy in this system?

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, potential and kinetic energies are related, but in relativity, the energy expressions change. So perhaps I should look at the total energy of the oscillator. The total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², I think, because Hooke's law is F = -kx, and the potential is the integral of F, which gives (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So at maximum displacement (x = A), the oscillator has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. At the equilibrium position (x=0), it has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential. So in the relativistic case, the total energy E should be the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

Wait, but wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of potential at maximum displacement. So in the relativistic case, when x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is zero. But the total energy should also equal the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) plus kinetic energy when x=0.

Wait, no. Wait, the oscillator's total mechanical energy in the classical case is (1/2)kA². In the relativistic case, perhaps the total energy is higher because of gamma factors.

Hmm, perhaps the total mechanical energy E is still (1/2)kA², but when the oscillator is at x=0, all of that energy is kinetic, which is relativistic.

Wait, no, because relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², which depends on velocity v. So the total energy E would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But how does that tie into the potential energy?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about energy conservation. At maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. But in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So at x=A, the total energy is mc² + 0 (since kinetic energy is zero). Wait, that can't be right, because then when it's at x=0, all energy is kinetic, which would be (gamma -1) mc², but the potential is zero there. So the total energy would be (gamma -1) mc², but that must equal the mc² from when x=A. So that would imply gamma -1 = 0, which only happens when v=0, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I must be making a mistake here. Let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy would include the rest mass energy plus kinetic. So perhaps the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA². Because at x=A, the potential is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic is zero. But wait, the rest mass energy is mc². So the total energy should be mc² plus the potential energy, which is (1/2)kA². So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point x=0, the potential is zero. The kinetic energy is the relativistic one, which is (gamma -1) mc². So the total energy should also be (gamma -1) mc² + 0 (potential). Setting this equal to E_total gives (gamma -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but that would lead me to (gamma-1) = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²). Wait, that can't be right because gamma is always >=1, and the right-hand side might be greater than 1. Let me see:

Wait, so (gamma -1) mc² = E_total, which is mc² + (1/2)kA². So,

gamma - 1 = [mc² + (1/2)kA²]/(mc²)
=> gamma -1 = 1 + [ (k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]

So,

gamma = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1/(1 - (v²/c²)) = [2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]^2

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let’s call it B for a moment. Then,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (2 + B)^2

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(2 + B)^2

=> v²/c² = 1 - 1/(2 + B)^2

=> v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(2 + B)^2 ]

Hmm, but B is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So substituting back,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Let me compute the denominator. Let's write 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) as ( (4 m c² ) + k A² ) / (2 m c² ) )

Wait, wait: Let me compute 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) as (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² )

Wait, yes: 2 is 4 m c²/(2 m c²), so adding (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ), gives (4 m c² + k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So 2 + B = (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² )

So 2 + B = [4 m c² + k A² ]/( 2 m c² )

Then 1/(2 + B )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 )/(4 m c² + k A^2 ) ]^2

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ]/(4 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Hmm, simplifying this expression. Let me compute numerator and denominator:

The term inside the brackets is 1 minus [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / (4 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Let me factor out (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 from the denominator:

1 = [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2)^2 ] / (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ) / (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

The numerator is [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ]

Let me expand that:

(4 m c^2)^2 + 2*(4 m c^2)(k A^2) + (k A^2)^2 - (2 m c^2)^2

= (16 m² c^4) + 8 m c^2 k A^2 + k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4

= (12 m² c^4) + 8 m c^2 k A^2 + k² A^4

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic expression for the oscillator's energy.

Wait, another approach: In an ordinary harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies are equal on average, but at maximum displacement, all energy is potential. So in the relativistic case, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when the kinetic energy is maximum, which is when the potential is zero.

Wait, but perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E_total = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2

When the oscillator is at x = 0, all that energy is in kinetic, which is relativistic.

So, Kinetic energy KE = E_total - mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2

But relativistic KE is (gamma -1) mc^2.

So,

(gamma -1) mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2

=> gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so:

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Now, solving for v.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )]^2

So,

1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )]^2

=> (v^2/c^2) = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

Hmm, let me compute this expression.

Let me first compute the denominator. Let me call (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as D for simplicity.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + D )^2 ]

= [ (1 + D )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D )^2

Expanding (1 + D )^2 = 1 + 2D + D^2.

So,

numerator is (1 + 2 D + D^2 ) - 1 = 2 D + D^2.

Thus,

v^2/c^2 = (2 D + D^2) / (1 + D )^2

= D (2 + D ) / (1 + D )^2

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this more. Let me write D = (k A²)/(2m c² )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D )^2

= c^2 * [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2

This looks complicated, but perhaps I can simplify.

Let me write numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (k A²/(2 m c² )) * (2 + k A²/(2 m c² )) = (k A²/(2 m c² )) * [ (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ) ]

Wait, 2 can be written as (4 m c² )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

Numerator becomes:

(k A²/(2 m c² )) * (4 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 )

Denominator is [1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2

So,

v² = c^2 * [ numerator ] / denominator

= c^2 * [ [k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 ) ] divided by [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

c^2 * [k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the expression for gamma again. Let's go back.

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

We can write this as:

gamma = [ 2 m c² + k A^2 ] / (2 m c² )

So,

gamma = (2 m c² + k A^2 ) / (2 m c² )

But gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v²/c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Squaring both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

= [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Expand numerator:

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4

(2 m c^2 )^2 =4 m² c^4

So numerator becomes:

4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 -4 m² c^4 = 4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4

So,

v^2/c^2 = [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Factor numerator:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 4 m c^2 +k A^2 as (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Hmm, perhaps I can write 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) +k A^2 ?

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator as:

k A^2 (2 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Wait, that's the same as k A^2*(2m c^2 (1) + 2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor denominator as (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = (2 m c^2 )^2 + 2*(2 m c^2)(k A^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2

But I don't think that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression for v as:

v = c * sqrt( [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

= c * [ sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

= c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, not getting much progress.

Let me think about the answer options.

Option A: v_max= c sqrt(1 + 1/(1- (k A^2)/(2m ))^2 )

Wait, but our expressions don't have a 2m in the denominator. It's 2 m c^2, so perhaps that's not it.

Option B: v_max= c sqrt(1 +1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, the expression seems to have 1/(1 - something )

Wait, let's compute 1 + 1/(1 - x ) where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

But in our expression, v^2/c^2 is [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Hmm, perhaps I can factor that as:

[ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

= k A^2 [ (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

= k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

= k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

= k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 4 m c^2 +k A^2 as (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

= [k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out 4 m c^2 from the numerator and denominator.

Wait, 4 m c^2 + k A^2 =4 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 ) )

And denominator is (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = (2 m c^2 )^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ k A^2 *4 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ] / [ (2 m c^2 )^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 4 m c^2 *k A^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) 

Denominator: 4 m² c^4 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 

So,

v²/c² = [4 m c² k A² (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ] / [4 m² c^4 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

= [ (k A²) (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ] / [ m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v²/c² = (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) * [ (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Still complicated. Maybe I should look for an approximation or another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which I'll call D again.

So D = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

v^2/c^2 = [2 m c^2 * D * (2 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 D ) ] / (2 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 D )^2

Wait, perhaps substituting D in terms of itself.

Wait, D = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

Numerator is [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] = 2 m c^2 D (4 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 (2 D) )

Wait, 4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ), which is 2*( (2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, 4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 )

So,

4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 4 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 D * 2

Wait, perhaps I'm getting nowhere. Maybe I should plug in the expression for v in terms of D.

Wait, earlier we had v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 

Which becomes:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1 / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

= 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

Hmm, that's another way to write it.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + D )^2 ]

Where D = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + D )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D )^2

= [ 1 + 2 D + D^2 -1 ] / (1 + D )^2 

= [ 2 D + D^2 ] / (1 + D )^2 

Factor numerator: D(2 + D )

Denominator: (1 + D )^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = D (2 + D ) / (1 + D )^2 

Hmm, and D is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 

Hmm, perhaps this can be written as:

Let me let x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

v^2/c^2 = [ x (2 + x ) ] / (1 + x )^2

= [ x (2 + x ) ] / ( (1 + x )^2 )

Hmm, maybe this can be simplified.

Let me write 2 +x = (1 +x ) +1

So,

[ x ( (1 +x ) +1 ) ] / (1 +x )^2 

= x [ (1 + x ) +1 ] / (1+x )^2 

= x [ (2 +x ) ] / (1+x )^2 

Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor:

(x (2 +x )) / (1 +x )^2 = [ x (2 +x ) ] / (1 +x )^2 

I don't see an obvious way to factor this further. Maybe I can write it as:

[ x (2 + x ) ] / (1 +x )^2 = [ x ( (1 + x ) + 1 ) ] / (1 +x )^2 

= [ x (1 +x ) + x ] / (1 +x )^2 

= [x (1 +x ) ]/(1 +x )^2 + x/(1 +x )^2 

= x/(1 +x ) + x/(1 +x )^2 

Hmm, but I don't think that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this expression as:

[ x (2 + x ) ] / (1 +x )^2 = [ x (2 +x ) ] / (1 +x )^2 

= [ 2x + x^2 ] / (1 + 2x +x² )

Hmm, not clear.

Wait, perhaps I can write v^2 as:

v^2 = c^2 * [ x (2 + x ) ] / (1 +x )^2 

Where x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

But I'm not seeing a way to match this with the answer choices. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: v_max= c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, denominator is 1 - [k A²/(2m) ]

Hmm, in our case, denominator has 1 - [k A²/(2 m c² ) ]

Option B: v_max= c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, inside the sqrt, it's 1 + [ 1/(1 - x ) ] where x is k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, 1 + [1/(1-x)] = (1 -x +1 )/(1 - x ) ) = (2 - x )/(1 -x )

So, option B would have v_max = c * sqrt( (2 -x )/(1 -x ) ) where x is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, but our expression is v^2/c^2 = [ x (2 +x ) ]/(1 +x )^2 , which is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to equate the total energy to the sum of rest energy and potential energy.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is sqrt( k A^2 / m ), which is option C. But in the relativistic case, this would be less than c. So if the answer option C is correct, then it's the non-relativistic limit. But the question is relativistic, so the correct answer must be one of the others.

Wait, another approach: in the relativistic case, the equation of motion is more complex. The relativistic harmonic oscillator's equation of motion is (d/dt)(gamma m v) = -k x.

But that might complicate things further. Maybe I can't use the energy approach here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of velocity as a function of displacement and use the virial theorem or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when the kinetic energy is maximum, which is when x=0, and the potential energy is zero. So, the total energy is E = mc^2 + KE.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So, E = mc^2 + KE.

At x=0, KE is (gamma -1 ) mc^2.

So,

(gamma -1 ) mc^2 = E - mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which gives:

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me rearrange this:

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [2 m c^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ]

Squaring both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = [4 m^2 c^4 ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [4 m^2 c^4 ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

= [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 -4 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

Expanding numerator:

(2 m c^2 )^2 + (2)(2 m c^2)(k A^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2 - 4 m^2 c^4

= 4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 -4 m^2 c^4

= 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 

So,

v^2/c^2 = [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2 (2 m c^2) +k A^2

But I'm not seeing a clear way to factor this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out k A^2 from numerator and denominator:

v² = c² * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= c² * [k A^2 (2 m c^2 (2) +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can write 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = (2 m c^2)(2) +k A^2.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as k A² (2 m c^2 +k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

= k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 

So,

v²/c² = [ k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= [ (k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= [k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / denominator

= [ k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ] / denominator

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / denominator, which brings me back.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) from numerator and denominator.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ) / denominator

= k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

Hmm, perhaps this can be written as:

= k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ) + k A^2 [2 m c^2 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= [k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + [ 2 m c^2 k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

But this doesn't seem to help.

Perhaps it's time to give up and compare with the options.

Wait, let me compute the expression:

v^2/c^2 = [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 4 m c^2 +k A^2 as (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= [k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= [k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ]/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 + [ 2 m c^2 k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= [ k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + [ 2 m c^2 k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator as:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) = k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ]

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 

= [k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / denominator 

= [k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ]/(denominator) ) +  [ 2 m c^2 k A^2 ]/(denominator )

Hmm, but I'm not seeing a way to make this into any of the given options.

Option D: v_max= c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let's see.

Compute the expression inside the sqrt of option D:

1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 = [ (1 +x )^2 -1 ]/(1 +x )^2 

= [ 1 +2x +x^2 -1 ]/(1 +x )^2 

= (2 x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 

Which is exactly what we have for v^2/c^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 = [x (2 +x ) ]/(1 +x )^2 

Which is exactly what I found earlier, where x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 ) ) = c * sqrt( (x (2 +x ) )/(1 +x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

But in option D, the expression is sqrt(1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 ) * c, where x is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 = (2 x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 

Which is exactly what we have for v^2/c^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 x + x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 )

= c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, no:

Wait, option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly what we have.

So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but let me confirm.

Because in our derivation, v^2/c^2 is (2 x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2, which is the same as 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2. So sqrt of that would be v/c.

So option D gives v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ), which is correct.

Yes, so option D is the correct answer.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we use energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement, given by:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the relativistic kinetic energy is:

\[
KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]

Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Thus, the maximum speed is:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because they either use the non-relativistic expression for kinetic energy (Option C) or have incorrect forms involving \( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} \) or similar terms, which do not align with the derived relativistic expression.
