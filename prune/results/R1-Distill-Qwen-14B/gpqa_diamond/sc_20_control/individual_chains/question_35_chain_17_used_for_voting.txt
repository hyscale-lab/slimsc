Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y for a muon. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c = h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0].

Hmm, so first, I think I should figure out what the matrix representation of A_y looks like. Since c is a scalar, it should multiply each element of S. Let's compute that.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So multiplying by c, A_y becomes:

c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Which is [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]. So the matrix looks like that.

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

The matrix A_y - λI is:

[ -λ   (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

So that's λ² - [ ( (-i)*(i) ) * (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1)=1. So the term becomes (1) * (h²)/(16 π²).

So the determinant equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait. Because λ is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). But wait, wait. Let me check the units here. Hmm, in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvalues in units of ħ, and ħ is h/(2π). So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in the problem statement, c is given as h/(4π). So if A_y = c S, and S is the Pauli matrix σ_y, then the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A_y would be c*(±1) → ± c = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. Is S the Pauli matrix? The matrix given for S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is indeed the Pauli sigma y matrix. Yes. So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues become ±c.

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not imaginary. Wait, but looking at the options, some suggest that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts.

Looking at the options: Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which seems way too big. Option B talks about eigenvalues of ½ and 1, but let's think... No, because the eigenvalues of A_y are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, so the eigenvalues a are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have an imaginary part must be incorrect.

Looking back at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are +2πh or –2πh; that can't be right because our calculation shows the eigenvalues are real. So option A is wrong.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±½, but again, our eigenvalues are real. So B is also incorrect.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm. Let me think. In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum components generally don't commute, so eigenfunctions of different components (like Ay and Az) are not the same. However, the square of the angular momentum, A², commutes with all components, so the eigenfunctions of A² and Ay would be the same. Wait, is that the case?

Wait, A² is the operator for the square of the magnitude of angular momentum. The components Ay, Az, etc., don't commute with each other. So the eigenfunctions of A² are the same for all components, but the eigenfunctions of Ay are different from those of Az.

So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, then phi is also an eigenfunction of A². Because A² commutes with Ay. So statement C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. And it also says they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct because Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenvectors are different. So option C seems correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions phi of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what "basis functions of the operator" means. But eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, so any operator's eigenvectors (if they form a complete set) can serve as a basis. So perhaps D is correct in stating that.

Wait, but all the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis if they are linearly independent. For 2x2 matrix, two eigenvectors, which are orthogonal, so yes, they form a basis. So statement D is correct as well.

Wait, but let's think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, let's look at each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Let's think: A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay. So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's also an eigenfunction of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct, because Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenvectors are different.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix A_y is a 2x2 matrix, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. So D could be correct.

Wait, but the statement is a bit ambiguous. "Basis functions of the matrix operator". I'm not sure if that's the right phrasing. But for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D could be correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But I have to choose one.

Wait, but let me think again about the options. Let me recheck the calculations.

The eigenvalues of A_y are ± h/(4π), which are real, so options A and B are incorrect because they mention imaginary parts. So only C and D are in consideration.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As I thought, since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So the first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Correct, because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something, so they don't commute, so their eigenvectors are different. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the operator's matrix is in a certain basis. The eigenvectors of the operator form a basis for the space, so any operator's eigenvectors (if they are a complete set) can serve as a basis. So for a 2x2 operator, the two eigenvectors (assuming they are not degenerate) would form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement will you consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (so D is correct), but perhaps the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², so C could be correct.

Wait, but let me think again: the eigenfunctions of Ay are a set of vectors that form a basis for the space, so they are a basis for the operator, so D is correct.

So now I'm a bit confused because both C and D might be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, perhaps D is incorrect because the operator's eigenfunctions are not necessarily the basis functions of the operator. Wait, the matrix operator is expressed in the standard basis (like position basis, etc.), but the eigenvectors are specific to that basis. Hmm, perhaps the statement is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, so any operator's eigenvectors (if they are a complete set) are a basis.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The question is about which statements are correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A².

So let me reevaluate the options:

Which statements are true?

Option C says: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Since A² and Ay commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So the first part is correct.

As for Az, because Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So the second part is correct.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So perhaps that's correct, but I'm not as confident.

Wait, the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, so the eigenfunctions are eigenvectors that form a basis. So yes, they are the basis functions.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused between C and D. Let me think about the context of the question.

The question is about what you will consider correct during the calculation.

If during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So yes, they are the basis functions.

But perhaps the statement is incorrect because the basis functions refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal, but the operator might not necessarily be diagonal in the eigenbasis. Wait, no: any operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis.

Wait, but in this case, the operator A_y is represented in a certain basis. The eigenvectors are the basis vectors for A_y, meaning that in that basis, A_y is diagonal. So the statement D is correct.

Wait, but in the problem, the matrix S is given in the standard basis, so the eigenvectors are the basis functions in that same basis.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck between C and D.

Let me recheck the options. The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think this is correct because the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis for the space in which the operator acts.

But wait, in the calculation, when you find the eigenvectors, you're finding the basis for the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but in this case, the operator is 2x2. So its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But since the options are exclusive, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because in the context of angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az, but they are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option C is about the eigenfunctions of Ay and whether they can be eigenfunctions of A² and not Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part is correct. And since Az doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenfunctions are different, so the second part is correct. So C is correct.

D is about the basis functions. So I'm not sure if it's correct. Because the basis functions are the same as the eigenvectors, so D states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think this is correct, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the word 'basis functions' in option D is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, which is true. Because any operator's eigenvectors (if they form a complete set) form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

So now I'm torn between C and D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation, and C's statement is a fact about the properties of the eigenfunctions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, since the eigenfunctions are the basis.

Wait, but in reality, the eigenvectors of A_y form an orthonormal basis for the space. So D is correct.

But in the context of the question, which is about the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the correct statement would be that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but I need to make a decision.

So, the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). So options A and B are wrong because they have imaginary parts.

So that leaves options C and D.

Between C and D, which is correct?

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's also correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because both C and D seem correct.

Wait, another approach: think about what the eigenfunctions look like.

The matrix S is the Pauli sigma y matrix. Its eigenvalues are 1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A_y are c*(1) and c*(-1), so ± h/(4π).

The eigenvectors of S (sigma y) are the same as the eigenvectors of A_y because c is a scalar. The eigenvectors of sigma y are (1, i) and (1, -i), up to normalization.

So the eigenvectors are [1; i] and [1; -i], or any scalar multiples.

Now, the statement in option C: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

A² is the square of the angular momentum, which for a spin-½ particle is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * 3 * I, where I is the identity matrix. So A² has eigenvalues (3/4) ħ².

Wait, wait. Let me compute A^2. A is the angular momentum operator, which here is A_y = c S, so A² = (c S)^2 = c² S^2.

S is sigma y, so S^2 is identity matrix. So A² = c² I. So its eigenvalues are c² and c². So any eigenfunction of A_y is also an eigenfunction of A², since A² is a multiple of identity. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of C is correct.

And since Az is another component, which doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenfunctions are different. So the second part of C is correct. So C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but what about D? The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct as well. But the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have both.

Wait, no, because the options are mutually exclusive. So in the problem, only one option is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the options. Let me read them again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator is represented in the standard basis, perhaps. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form a basis. So yes, they are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but in this case, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure which of C or D is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions are the same for A², but not for Az.

So I think the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), which are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting imaginary parts in the eigenvalues is incorrect.

### Step 2: Analysis of Options
#### **Option A**: Suggests the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

#### **Option B**: Suggests the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \pm 1 \).

#### **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because:
- \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).
- \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

#### **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional space in which \( A_y \) acts.

### Step 3: Final Decision
Both options C and D are correct, but the question asks for the statement that is "considered correct during the calculation." Option C is more relevant to the context of the calculation, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is central to understanding the properties of the eigenfunctions. Therefore, the best answer is **C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y for a muon. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c = h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0].

Hmm, so first, I think I should figure out what the matrix representation of A_y looks like. Since c is a scalar, it should multiply each element of S. Let's compute that.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So multiplying by c, A_y becomes:

c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Which is [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]. So the matrix looks like that.

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

The matrix A_y - λI is:

[ -λ   (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

So that's λ² - [ ( (-i)*(i) ) * (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1)=1. So the term becomes (1) * (h²)/(16 π²).

So the determinant equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait. Because λ is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). But wait, wait. Let me check the units here. Hmm, in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvalues in units of ħ, and ħ is h/(2π). So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in the problem statement, c is given as h/(4π). So if A_y = c S, and S is the Pauli matrix σ_y, then the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A_y would be c*(±1) → ± c = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. Is S the Pauli matrix? The matrix given for S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is indeed the Pauli sigma y matrix. Yes. So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues become ±c.

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not imaginary. Wait, but looking at the options, some suggest that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts.

Looking at the options: Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which seems way too big. Option B talks about eigenvalues of ½ and 1, but let's think... No, because the eigenvalues of A_y are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, so the eigenvalues a are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have an imaginary part must be incorrect.

Looking back at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are +2πh or –2πh; that can't be right because our calculation shows the eigenvalues are real. So option A is wrong.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±½, but again, our eigenvalues are real. So B is also incorrect.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm. Let me think. In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum components generally don't commute, so eigenfunctions of different components (like Ay and Az) are not the same. However, the square of the angular momentum, A², commutes with all components, so the eigenfunctions of A² and Ay would be the same. Wait, is that the case?

Wait, A² is the operator for the square of the magnitude of angular momentum. The components Ay, Az, etc., don't commute with each other. So the eigenfunctions of A² are the same for all components, but the eigenfunctions of Ay are different from those of Az.

So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, then phi is also an eigenfunction of A². Because A² commutes with Ay. So statement C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. And it also says they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct because Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenvectors are different. So option C seems correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions phi of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what "basis functions of the operator" means. But eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, so any operator's eigenvectors (if they form a complete set) can serve as a basis. So perhaps D is correct in stating that.

Wait, but all the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis if they are linearly independent. For 2x2 matrix, two eigenvectors, which are orthogonal, so yes, they form a basis. So statement D is correct as well.

Wait, but let's think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Let's think: A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay. So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's also an eigenfunction of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix A_y is a 2x2 matrix, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. So D could be correct.

Wait, but the statement is a bit ambiguous. "Basis functions of the matrix operator". I'm not sure if that's the right phrasing. But for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D could be correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But I have to choose one.

Wait, but let me think again about the options. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the question is about which statement will you consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (so D is correct), but perhaps the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², so C could be correct.

Wait, but let me think again: the eigenfunctions of Ay are a set of vectors that form a basis for the space, so they are a basis for the operator, so D is correct.

So now I'm a bit confused because both C and D might be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, perhaps D is incorrect because the operator's eigenfunctions are not necessarily the basis functions of the operator. Wait, the matrix operator is expressed in the standard basis (like position basis, etc.), but the eigenvectors are specific to that basis. Hmm, perhaps the statement is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, so any operator's eigenvectors (if they are a complete set) are a basis.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The question is about which statements are correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A².

So let me reevaluate the options:

Which statements are true?

Option C says: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Since A² and Ay commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So the first part is correct.

As for Az, because Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So the second part is correct.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So perhaps that's correct, but I'm not as confident.

Wait, the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, so the eigenfunctions are eigenvectors that form a basis. So yes, they are the basis functions.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused between C and D. Let me think about the context of the question.

The question is about what you will consider correct during the calculation.

If during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So yes, they are the basis functions.

But perhaps the statement is incorrect because the basis functions refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal, but the operator might not necessarily be diagonal in the eigenbasis. Wait, no: any operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis.

Wait, but in this case, the operator A_y is represented in a certain basis. The eigenvectors are the basis vectors for A_y, meaning that in that basis, A_y is diagonal. So the statement D is correct.

Wait, but in the problem, the matrix S is given in the standard basis, so the eigenvectors are the basis functions in that same basis.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck between C and D.

Let me recheck the options. The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think this is correct because the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis for the space in which the operator acts.

But wait, in the calculation, when you find the eigenvectors, you're finding the basis for the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but in this case, the operator is 2x2. So its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But since the options are exclusive, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because in the context of angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az, but they are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option C is about the eigenfunctions of Ay and whether they can be eigenfunctions of A² and not Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part is correct. And since Az doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenfunctions are different, so the second part is correct. So C is correct.

D is about the basis functions. So I'm not sure if it's correct. Because the basis functions are the same as the eigenvectors, so D states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think this is correct, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the word 'basis functions' in option D is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, which is true. Because any operator's eigenvectors (if they form a complete set) form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

So now I'm torn between C and D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation, and C's statement is a fact about the properties of the eigenfunctions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, since the eigenfunctions are the basis.

Wait, but in reality, the eigenvectors of A_y form an orthonormal basis for the space. So D is correct.

But in the context of the question, which is about the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the correct statement would be that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but I need to make a decision.

So, the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). So options A and B are wrong because they have imaginary parts.

So that leaves options C and D.

Between C and D, which is correct?

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's also correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because both C and D seem correct.

Wait, another approach: think about what the eigenfunctions look like.

The matrix S is the Pauli sigma y matrix. Its eigenvalues are 1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A_y are c*(1) and c*(-1), so ± h/(4π).

The eigenvectors of S (sigma y) are the same as the eigenvectors of A_y because c is a scalar. The eigenvectors of sigma y are (1, i) and (1, -i), up to normalization.

So the eigenvectors are [1; i] and [1; -i], or any scalar multiples.

Now, the statement in option C: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

A² is the square of the angular momentum, which for a spin-½ particle is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * 3 * I, where I is the identity matrix. So A² has eigenvalues (3/4) ħ².

Wait, wait. Let me compute A^2. A is the angular momentum operator, which here is A_y = c S, so A² = (c S)^2 = c² S^2.

S is sigma y, so S^2 is identity matrix. So A² = c² I. So its eigenvalues are c² and c². So any eigenfunction of A_y is also an eigenfunction of A², since A² is a multiple of identity. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of C is correct.

And since Az is another component, which doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenfunctions are different. So the second part of C is correct. So C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but what about D? The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct as well. But the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have both.

Wait, no, because the options are mutually exclusive. So in the problem, only one option is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the options. Let me read them again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator is represented in the standard basis, perhaps. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form a basis. So yes, they are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but in this case, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure which of C or D is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions are the same for A², but not for Az.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), which are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting imaginary parts in the eigenvalues is incorrect.

### Step 2: Analysis of Options
#### **Option A**: Suggests the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

#### **Option B**: Suggests the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \pm 1 \).

#### **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because:
- \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).
- \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

#### **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional space in which \( A_y \) acts.

### Step 3: Final Decision
Both options C and D are correct, but the question asks for the statement that is "considered correct during the calculation." Option C is more relevant to the context of the calculation, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is central to understanding the properties of the eigenfunctions. Therefore, the best answer is **C**.
