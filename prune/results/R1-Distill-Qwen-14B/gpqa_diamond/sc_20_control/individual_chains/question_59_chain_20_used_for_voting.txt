Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because pH calculations can be a bit tricky, especially when mixing different acids and bases. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider neutralization reactions. So let me break it down step by step.

First, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because volume and concentration multiplied give moles, right?

Starting with CH3COOH. It's a weak acid, but for initial neutralization, I can consider it as an acid contributing H+ ions. Its volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Concentration is 0.1 M. So moles = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate. Its volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 L. Concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.4 L * 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions. Each formula unit gives two OH⁻ ions. So the volume is 300 mL, 0.3 L. Concentration 0.3 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. But since each mole gives 2 OH⁻, total OH⁻ is 0.18 mol.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they react. So I need to find out if there's excess acid or base after the reaction.

So, the total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl. The total OH⁻ comes from Ba(OH)2.

So total H+ = moles from CH3COOH + moles from HCl. Wait, but wait: CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. Oh, but wait, when considering neutralization, I think we can treat the CH3COOH as contributing H+ in a neutralization reaction, but maybe not. Hmm, this is where I might get confused.

Wait, no. Because when you mix an acid and a base, the strong acid and strong base will react first, and then any remaining will react with the weak acid. Or perhaps all of them contribute to H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ from all acids and the total OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. It doesn't fully dissociate, so the initial H+ from it is not as much as a strong acid. So maybe it's better to consider the reaction between the strong acid and strong base first, and then the weak acid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Wait, let's think: the strong acid (HCl) will dissociate completely, contributing H+. The strong base (Ba(OH)2) will dissociate completely, providing OH-.

CH3COOH is a weak acid; in the presence of a strong base, it might not contribute much, as the strong base would neutralize any available H+.

Wait, but the HCl is a strong acid and will donate H+ completely. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol. So when we mix them, they will react in a neutralization reaction.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. OH- is 0.18.

So, after reaction, moles of H+ left = 0.08 - 0.18 = negative, which means all H+ is neutralized, and excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol. So the excess OH- is 0.10 mol.

But wait, what about the CH3COOH? Because CH3COOH is an acid, it can donate H+ as well, but in the presence of a strong base, OH- will react with any H+ available, including that from CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid and doesn't dissociate completely, so in the solution, the H+ from CH3COOH is less than its concentration. Hmm.

Wait, but when you mix all three solutions, the H+ from HCl (0.08 mol) and the weak acid (which may contribute some H+) will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18 mol).

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate all the H+ and OH- in the mixture, including from the weak acid and strong base.

Wait, but the weak acid will not contribute much H+ because it's weak. So perhaps the initial approach is correct: the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol.

So the reaction would proceed as follows:

H+ (from HCl) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

So H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So after reaction, OH- left is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol. And any excess OH- will determine the pH.

Additionally, the CH3COOH will have some H+ that can react with the OH- as well. But wait, because CH3COOH is a weak acid, it doesn't release a lot of H+ at once. So in the presence of excess OH-, the CH3COOH will react, but how much?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

First, calculate the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. So, H+ (0.08) will neutralize 0.08 mol of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH-.

So, the excess OH- is 0.10 mol.

But wait, the CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. It's a weak acid, so it can donate H+ in solution. The excess OH- will react with any H+ available.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in solution, it dissociates as CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

But when you have excess OH- present, the H+ from CH3COOH will react with OH-: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH. But since the OH- is in excess, it will react with all the H+ that CH3COOH can donate.

Wait, but the amount of H+ that CH3COOH can donate is not the same as its moles because it's a weak acid. So, we need to find the concentration of H+ from CH3COOH in the presence of excess OH-.

Wait, but since the solution is highly basic (due to excess OH-), the CH3COOH will be deprotonated by the OH-.

So, the reaction would be:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of CH3COOH.

But the OH- remaining after neutralizing HCl is 0.10 mol. The CH3COOH is 0.05 mol.

So, 0.05 mol of OH- would react with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol of acetate ions and water.

So, after this reaction, all the CH3COOH would be neutralized, and the remaining OH- would be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the initial excess OH- is 0.10 mol. The CH3COOH can donate 0.05 mol of H+ (since it's 0.05 mol). So the OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH, which is 0.05 mol.

After that, the OH- remaining would be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So the total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait. Because the H+ from CH3COOH is less than the OH- available, so all the H+ from CH3COOH is neutralized, leaving some OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the main point is that the total OH- is 0.05 mol in the solution.

Wait, but wait, let me recalculate.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles after reaction: OH- remains 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Then, the CH3COOH provides H+. The OH- will react with that H+.

CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, so it can donate up to 0.05 mol of H+.

So, OH- will take 0.05 mol of H+, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH-.

So the total OH- is 0.05 mol in the solution.

Wait, but wait, that's not correct. Because the OH- isn't just reacting with the H+ from CH3COOH; it's possible that some of the OH- is present before considering CH3COOH, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of reactions doesn't matter. Let's think in terms of equivalents.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl gives 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH gives some H+, but as a weak acid, the actual H+ is less than 0.05 mol. But in the presence of OH-, which is a strong base, it will deprotonate the CH3COOH.

So, when mixing all solutions, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with all available H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) until it is all used up or until all H+ is neutralized.

So, the OH- is 0.18 mol.

The H+ from HCl is 0.08, and from CH3COOH, let's say it's x. But in the presence of excess OH-, the CH3COOH will donate H+. So the OH- will consume all the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so its H+ is completely available. So the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl (0.08), then the H+ from CH3COOH (0.05). So OH- used would be 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 mol.

But the OH- available is 0.18. So after neutralizing all H+ (0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13), the OH- left is 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol.

So the total solution now has 0.05 mol of OH-.

Wait, that makes sense. So the solution is basic because there's excess OH-.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L. Let me compute that.

Molarity of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667). Let's calculate that.

Log(0.0416667) is approximately log(4.16667e-2). Let me compute:

Log(4.16667) is about 0.6198, so 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. So pOH is 1.3802.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the formula is pOH = -log[OH-].

So 0.0416667 is 4.16667e-2.

Log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

So pOH ≈ 1.3802. Then pH is 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So the pH should be approximately 12.62.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in considering the H+ from CH3COOH. Because in reality, when you have a weak acid in a solution with excess base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid, producing its conjugate base and water.

So, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. But how much H+ can CH3COOH donate?

In pure water, CH3COOH with 0.05 mol in 1.2 L would have a certain [H+], but when OH- is present, it will neutralize that H+.

So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH as follows: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the amount of CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. The OH- is 0.18 mol.

First, OH- neutralizes HCl's H+ (0.08 mol), leaving 0.10 mol of OH-.

Then, this OH- neutralizes CH3COOH's H+. But CH3COOH can donate up to 0.05 mol of H+.

So the remaining OH- after this is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So total OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L.

So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

So pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the answer is option A) 12.62.

Wait, but let me think again: when you have a weak acid and a strong base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid completely if there's enough base.

In this case, after neutralizing HCl, there's 0.10 mol of OH- left. The weak acid is 0.05 mol. So the OH- can neutralize all of it, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH-.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. So the pH is about 12.62, which is option A.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (CH₃COOH and HCl) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ contributions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     CH₃COOH can donate up to 0.05 mol of H⁺, but its contribution is reduced due to being weak.
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - The strong acid HCl contributes 0.08 mol of H⁺, which reacts completely with 0.08 mol of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂.  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - The weak acid CH₃COOH can donate 0.05 mol of H⁺. The remaining 0.10 mol of OH⁻ reacts with this H⁺, neutralizing all 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH.  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Calculate [OH⁻] in the final solution:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
     Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

5. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
     \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because pH calculations can be a bit tricky, especially when mixing different acids and bases. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider neutralization reactions. So let me break it down step by step.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate. Its volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 L. Concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.4 L * 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions. Each formula unit gives two OH⁻ ions. So the volume is 300 mL, 0.3 L. Concentration 0.3 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. But since each mole gives 2 OH⁻, total OH⁻ is 0.18 mol.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they react. So I need to find out if there's excess acid or base after the reaction.

So, the total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl. The total OH⁻ comes from Ba(OH)2.

So total H+ = moles from CH3COOH + moles from HCl. Wait, but wait: CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. Oh, but wait, when considering neutralization, I think we can treat the CH3COOH as contributing H+ in a neutralization reaction, but maybe not. Hmm, this is where I might get confused.

Wait, no. Because when you mix an acid and a base, the strong acid and strong base will react first, and then any remaining will react with the weak acid. Or perhaps all of them contribute to H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ from all acids and the total OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. It doesn't fully dissociate, so the initial H+ from it is not as much as a strong acid. So maybe it's better to consider the reaction between the strong acid and strong base first, and then the weak acid.

CH3COOH is a weak acid; in the presence of a strong base, it might not contribute much, as the strong base would neutralize any available H+.

Wait, but the HCl is a strong acid and will donate H+ completely. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol. So when we mix them, they will react in a neutralization reaction.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. OH- is 0.18.

So, after reaction, moles of H+ left = 0.08 - 0.18 = negative, which means all H+ is neutralized, and excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol. So the excess OH- is 0.10 mol.

But wait, what about the CH3COOH? Because CH3COOH is an acid, it can donate H+ as well, but in the presence of a strong base, OH- will react with any H+ available, including that from CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid and doesn't dissociate completely, so in the solution, the H+ from CH3COOH is less than its concentration. Hmm.

Wait, but when you mix all three solutions, the H+ from HCl (0.08 mol) and the weak acid (which may contribute some H+) will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18 mol).

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate all the H+ and OH- in the mixture, including from the weak acid and strong base.

Wait, but the weak acid will not contribute much H+ because it's weak. So perhaps the initial approach is correct: the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol.

So H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So after reaction, OH- left is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol. And any excess OH- will determine the pH.

Additionally, the CH3COOH will have some H+ that can react with the OH- as well. But wait, because CH3COOH is a weak acid, it doesn't release a lot of H+ at once. So in the presence of excess OH-, the CH3COOH will react, but how much?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

First, calculate the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. So, H+ (0.08) will neutralize 0.08 mol of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH-.

So, the excess OH- is 0.10 mol.

But wait, the CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. It's a weak acid, so it can donate H+ in solution. The excess OH- will react with any H+ available.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in solution, it dissociates as CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

So, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH. But since the OH- is in excess, it will react with all the H+ that CH3COOH can donate.

Wait, but the amount of H+ that CH3COOH can donate is not the same as its moles because it's a weak acid. So, we need to find the concentration of H+ from CH3COOH in the presence of excess OH-.

Wait, but since the solution is highly basic (due to excess OH-), the CH3COOH will be deprotonated by the OH-.

So, the reaction would be:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of CH3COOH.

But the OH- remaining after neutralizing HCl is 0.10 mol. The CH3COOH is 0.05 mol.

So, 0.05 mol of OH- would react with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol of acetate ions and water.

So, after this reaction, all the CH3COOH would be neutralized, and the remaining OH- would be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the initial excess OH- is 0.10 mol. The CH3COOH can donate 0.05 mol of H+ (since it's 0.05 mol). So the OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH, which is 0.05 mol.

After that, the OH- remaining would be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So the total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait. Because the H+ from CH3COOH is less than the OH- available, so all the H+ from CH3COOH is neutralized, leaving some OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the main point is that the total OH- is 0.05 mol in the solution.

Wait, but wait, let me recalculate.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles after reaction: OH- remains 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Then, the CH3COOH provides H+. The OH- will react with that H+.

Wait, but wait, that's not correct. Because the OH- isn't just reacting with the H+ from CH3COOH; it's possible that some of the OH- is present before considering CH3COOH, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of reactions doesn't matter. Let's think in terms of equivalents.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl gives 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH gives some H+, but as a weak acid, the actual H+ is less than 0.05 mol. But in the presence of OH-, which is a strong base, it will deprotonate the CH3COOH.

So, when mixing all solutions, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with all available H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) until it is all used up or until all H+ is neutralized.

So, the OH- is 0.18 mol.

The H+ from HCl is 0.08, and from CH3COOH, let's say it's x. But in the presence of excess OH-, the CH3COOH will donate H+. So the OH- will consume all the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so its H+ is completely available. So the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl (0.08), then the H+ from CH3COOH (0.05). So OH- used would be 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 mol.

But the OH- available is 0.18. So after neutralizing all H+ (0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13), the OH- left is 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol.

So the total solution now has 0.05 mol of OH-.

Wait, that makes sense. So the solution is basic because there's excess OH-.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L. Let me compute that.

Molarity of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667). Let's calculate that.

Log(0.0416667) is approximately log(4.16667e-2). Let me compute:

Log(4.16667) is about 0.6198, so 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. So pOH is 1.3802.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the formula is pOH = -log[OH-].

So 0.0416667 is 4.16667e-2.

Log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

So pOH ≈ 1.3802. Then pH is 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So the pH should be approximately 12.62.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in considering the H+ from CH3COOH. Because in reality, when you have a weak acid in a solution with excess base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid, producing its conjugate base and water.

So, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. But how much H+ can CH3COOH donate?

In pure water, CH3COOH with 0.05 mol in 1.2 L would have a certain [H+], but when OH- is present, it will neutralize that H+.

So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH as follows: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the amount of CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. The OH- is 0.18 mol.

First, OH- neutralizes HCl's H+ (0.08 mol), leaving 0.10 mol of OH-.

Then, this OH- neutralizes CH3COOH's H+. But CH3COOH can donate up to 0.05 mol of H+.

So the remaining OH- after this is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So total OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L.

So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

So pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the answer is option A) 12.62.

Wait, but let me think again: when you have a weak acid and a strong base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid completely if there's enough base.

In this case, after neutralizing HCl, there's 0.10 mol of OH- left. The weak acid is 0.05 mol. So the OH- can neutralize all of it, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH-.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. So the pH is about 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (CH₃COOH and HCl) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ contributions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     CH₃COOH can donate up to 0.05 mol of H⁺, but its contribution is reduced due to being weak.
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - The strong acid HCl contributes 0.08 mol of H⁺, which reacts completely with 0.08 mol of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂.  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - The weak acid CH₃COOH can donate 0.05 mol of H⁺. The remaining 0.10 mol of OH⁻ reacts with this H⁺, neutralizing all 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH.  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Calculate [OH⁻] in the final solution:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
     Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

5. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
     \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
