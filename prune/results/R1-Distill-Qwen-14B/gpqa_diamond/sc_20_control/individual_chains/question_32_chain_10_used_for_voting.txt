Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light (c). X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy needed for a particle in a collider is calculated using the relativistic energy formulas. Since the speed is given as a fraction of c, I think I should use the gamma factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because gamma accounts for the time dilation and energy increase at high velocities.

So the speed v is 0.96c. Let me compute gamma. Plugging in v = 0.96c into the gamma formula:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Calculating (0.96)^2, that's 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So 1/0.28 is about 3.5714. Hmm, maybe more accurately, I'll calculate it precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps using exact fractions. Let's compute 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 is 24/25, so (24/25)^2 is (576/625) = 0.9216. So 1 - 576/625 = 49/625. So sqrt(49/625) is 7/25 = 0.28. So yes, gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the nucleus is gamma times the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy E_rest is m*c². But I need to find the rest mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy (mass defect). But for this problem, perhaps they expect me to use the atomic mass as the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept that the rest energy is the mass of the nucleus in atomic mass units (u) converted to GeV. I remember that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So for Li-6, what's its atomic mass?

Lithium-6 has an atomic number Z=3, so 3 protons and 6-3=3 neutrons. The atomic mass would be the sum of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. But wait, that's probably not precise because each proton and neutron has a rest mass, and the total would be higher than the actual nucleus mass due to binding energy.

Wait, but in particle physics, especially when dealing with high-energy particles, the rest mass of the nucleus is often approximated as the sum of the rest masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. Because the binding energy (mass defect) is usually small compared to the total mass. But wait, let's see.

The mass of a proton is about 938.3 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 3*(938.3 +939.565)/2? Wait, no. Wait, each proton is ~938.3, each neutron ~939.565. So 3*(938.3) + 3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3 * 938.3 = 2814.9 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total = 2814.9 + 2818.695 = 5633.595 MeV

That's about 5.633595 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 atomic mass units. Because the natural isotope is Li-7, but Li-6 is lighter. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the constituent nucleons. Because in relativistic calculations, sometimes the rest mass is approximated as the sum of the protons and neutrons' masses. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think differently. The problem might just use the mass of the nucleus as m = A * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is approximately 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, A=6, so m = 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but what's the actual mass of Li-6? Let me recall. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0173 atomic mass units. Since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV, so 6.0173 u is 6.0173 * 931.5 MeV. Let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV
0.0173 * 931.5 ≈ 16.11 MeV
Total ≈ 5589 +16.11 = 5605.11 MeV, which is 5.605 GeV.

Wait, that's a bit different from the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the actual atomic mass, which would be the rest mass of the nucleus.

So using the atomic mass of Li-6, which is about 6.0173 u, that's about 6.0173 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.0173 *931.5 ≈ Let me compute that accurately.

6.0173 * 931.5:

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV
0.0173 *931.5 = 0.0173 * 900 = 15.57, 0.0173 *31.5=0.54555, so total 16.1155 MeV.
Adding to 5589, that gives 5605.1155 MeV, or ≈5.605 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the sum of protons and neutrons, I got about 5.633 GeV. So there's a difference because the actual mass is less than the sum due to binding energy. So which one do I use?

The problem says "the energy of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". Hmm, but wait, the energy in the collider is the total relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². So I need to use the correct rest mass m of the nucleus.

So I think the correct approach is to use the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is about 6.0173 u, so 6.0173 *931.5 MeV ≈ 5.605 GeV.

Wait, but let me confirm the value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a nucleon (like protons and neutrons) as 938 MeV/c², and since Li-6 has 6 nucleons, m =6 *938 MeV/c² =5628 MeV ≈5.628 GeV.

Given that the options are around 20 GeV, I think I should proceed with the correct approach.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this methodically.

The steps are:

1. Find the rest mass energy of the nucleus X (Li-6).
2. Calculate gamma for v=0.96c.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.

So step 1: Find m c² for Li-6.

Li-6's atomic mass is about 6.0173 atomic mass units (u). 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c².

So m c² = 6.0173 * 931.5 MeV.

Compute that: 6 *931.5 =5589, 0.0173*931.5≈16.115. So total is 5605.115 MeV =5.605115 GeV.

So m c² ≈5.605 GeV.

Alternatively, if I were to use m=6 *938 MeV, m c²=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

But which is correct? Well, in reality, the rest mass of Li-6 is about 5.605 GeV as calculated from the atomic mass. So perhaps that's the approach.

So step 2: Compute gamma.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So gamma ≈3.5714.

Now, the total energy E = gamma * m c².

So E = 3.5714 *5.605 GeV ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.605.

Compute 3 *5.605 =16.815

0.5714 *5.605.

Compute 0.5 *5.605 =2.8025

0.0714 *5.605 ≈0.4012.

So 0.5714 *5.605 ≈ 2.8025 +0.4012=3.2037.

So total E ≈16.815 +3.2037=20.0187 GeV.

Hmm, approximately 20.019 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So the closest is option C)20.132 GeV. But wait, my calculation was 20.019, which is about 20.02 GeV, but none of the options exactly match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes m is the mass of a single nucleon, but multiplied by the number of nucleons. Let me check that.

Alternative approach: Take the mass of the nucleus as 6 * 938 MeV/c² =5.628 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.628 ≈ ?

3 *5.628=16.884

0.5714*5.628: Let's compute 0.5 *5.628=2.814, 0.0714 *5.628≈0.403.

So 0.5714 *5.628≈3.217.

Total E≈16.884 +3.217=20.101 GeV.

That's about 20.10 GeV, which is very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

So with that approach, the answer would be C.

But wait, why the discrepancy in which mass I use. Using the actual Li-6 mass gives around 20.02 GeV, whereas using the sum of nucleon masses gives about 20.10 GeV.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

0.0784 is 49/625. So sqrt(49/625)=7/25=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So that's precise.

Now, let's recompute the energy using the accurate mass.

If I take the mass as 6.0173 u.

6.0173 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6.0173 * 931.5.

Let's compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.0173 *931.5:

0.01 *931.5=9.315

0.0073 *931.5= 6.79245

So total 9.315 +6.79245=16.10745.

So 6.0173 *931.5=5589 +16.10745=5605.10745 MeV=5.60510745 GeV.

So m c²=5.60510745 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.60510745.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.60510745.

Let me compute it step by step.

3 *5.6051 =16.8153

0.57142857 *5.6051.

Compute 0.5 *5.6051 =2.80255

0.07142857 *5.6051.

What's 0.07 *5.6051=0.392357.

0.00142857 *5.6051≈0.008.

So 0.07142857 *5.6051≈0.392357 +0.008=0.400357.

So 0.5*5=2.80255 +0.400357=3.202907.

So the total is 16.8153 +3.202907=20.0182 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.0182 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.018 GeV. The options are C)20.132 GeV and another close option.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the exact calculation.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60510745.

We can do this precisely:

3.57142857 *5.60510745.

Let me use a calculator approach.

3.57142857 ×5.60510745.

First, let's compute 3.5 ×5.6 = 19.6.

But let's compute the exact multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more accurate method.

But perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of nucleon masses, which would give about 20.10 GeV, which is closer to option C.

But wait, the options don't have an exact match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the nucleus's mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the nucleus is treated as a single particle with mass equal to the sum of its nucleons. So for Li-6, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Each proton mass: 938.272 MeV/c².

Each neutron: 939.565 MeV/c².

So m = 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * mc² =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511≈0.405 (exact: 5.633511 *0.07142857).

Wait, 5.633511 * (7/98) because 0.07142857≈7/98 (since 1/14≈0.0714, but 7/98=1/14=0.07142857).

Wait, 5.633511 * (7/100) would be 0.394345, but 7/98 is 1/14.

Wait, perhaps better to compute:

5.633511 * 0.07142857 ≈ (5 *0.07142857) + (0.633511 *0.07142857)

5 *0.07142857 ≈0.35714285.

0.633511 *0.07142857 ≈ approx 0.04514.

So total is about 0.35714 +0.04514=0.40228.

So 0.57142857 *5.633511 ≈2.8167555 +0.40228≈3.2190355.

Adding to the 16.900533 gives 16.900533 +3.2190355 ≈20.1195685 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, that's very close. So perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, but why the discrepancy between using the actual Li-6 mass and the sum of nucleon masses? Because the actual mass includes binding energy, which is a small fraction, but in high-energy physics, sometimes they approximate the nucleus's rest mass as the sum of its constituent nucleons, especially when dealing with high energies where binding energy is negligible compared to the kinetic energy. So perhaps in this problem, that's the assumption.

So using the sum of the nucleon masses gives about 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the charge or something else.

Wait, another thought: The problem says the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy, but wait no, the question asks for the total energy of the nucleus, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Because in relativity, the total energy is gamma m c².

So I think the approach is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required for the nucleus X (Li-6) to reach a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \) as follows:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The nucleus X is Li-6, which has an atomic mass of approximately \( 6.0173 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting this to energy:

\[
m c^2 = 6.0173 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5605.115 \, \text{MeV} = 5.605 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), we substitute \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m c^2 \approx 5.605 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.605 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.019 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify alternative approach
If the problem assumes the rest mass of Li-6 is the sum of its nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), where each proton and neutron has a rest mass of approximately \( 938.3 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), respectively, the total rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 3 \times 938.3 + 3 \times 939.565 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5633.595 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Using this value, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.12 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The calculated energy using the sum of nucleon masses is approximately \( 20.12 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light (c). X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy needed for a particle in a collider is calculated using the relativistic energy formulas. Since the speed is given as a fraction of c, I think I should use the gamma factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because gamma accounts for the time dilation and energy increase at high velocities.

So the speed v is 0.96c. Let me compute gamma. Plugging in v = 0.96c into the gamma formula:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Calculating (0.96)^2, that's 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So 1/0.28 is about 3.5714. Hmm, maybe more accurately, I'll calculate it precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps using exact fractions. Let's compute 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 is 24/25, so (24/25)^2 is (576/625) = 0.9216. So 1 - 576/625 = 49/625. So sqrt(49/625) is 7/25 = 0.28. So yes, gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the nucleus is gamma times the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy E_rest is m*c². But I need to find the rest mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy (mass defect). But for this problem, perhaps they expect me to use the atomic mass as the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept that the rest energy is the mass of the nucleus in atomic mass units (u) converted to GeV. I remember that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So for Li-6, what's its atomic mass?

Lithium-6 has an atomic number Z=3, so 3 protons and 6-3=3 neutrons. The atomic mass would be the sum of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. But wait, that's probably not precise because each proton and neutron has a rest mass, and the total would be higher than the actual nucleus mass due to binding energy.

Wait, but in particle physics, especially when dealing with high-energy particles, the rest mass of the nucleus is often approximated as the sum of the rest masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. Because the binding energy (mass defect) is usually small compared to the total mass. But wait, let's see.

The mass of a proton is about 938.3 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 3*(938.3 +939.565)/2? Wait, no. Wait, each proton is ~938.3, each neutron ~939.565. So 3*(938.3) + 3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3 * 938.3 = 2814.9 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total = 2814.9 + 2818.695 = 5633.595 MeV

That's about 5.633595 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 atomic mass units. Because the natural isotope is Li-7, but Li-6 is lighter. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the constituent nucleons. Because in relativistic calculations, sometimes the rest mass is approximated as the sum of the protons and neutrons' masses. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think differently. The problem might just use the mass of the nucleus as m = A * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is approximately 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, A=6, so m = 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but what's the actual mass of Li-6? Let me recall. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0173 atomic mass units. Since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV, so 6.0173 u is 6.0173 * 931.5 MeV. Let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV
0.0173 * 931.5 ≈ 16.11 MeV
Total ≈ 5589 +16.11 = 5605.11 MeV, which is 5.605 GeV.

Wait, that's a bit different from the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the actual atomic mass, which would be the rest mass of the nucleus.

So using the atomic mass of Li-6, which is about 6.0173 u, that's about 6.0173 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.0173 *931.5 ≈ Let me compute that accurately.

6.0173 * 931.5:

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV
0.0173 *931.5 = 0.0173 * 900 = 15.57, 0.0173 *31.5=0.54555, so total 16.1155 MeV.
Adding to 5589, that gives 5605.1155 MeV, or ≈5.605 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the sum of protons and neutrons, I got about 5.633 GeV. So there's a difference because the actual mass is less than the sum due to binding energy. So which one do I use?

The problem says "the energy of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". Hmm, but wait, the energy in the collider is the total relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². So I need to use the correct rest mass m of the nucleus.

So I think the correct approach is to use the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is about 6.0173 u, so 6.0173 *931.5 MeV ≈ 5.605 GeV.

Wait, but let me confirm the value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a nucleon (like protons and neutrons) as 938 MeV/c², and since Li-6 has 6 nucleons, m =6 *938 MeV/c² =5628 MeV ≈5.628 GeV.

Given that the options are around 20 GeV, I think I should proceed with the correct approach.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this methodically.

The steps are:

1. Find the rest mass energy of the nucleus X (Li-6).
2. Calculate gamma for v=0.96c.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.

So step 1: Find m c² for Li-6.

Li-6's atomic mass is about 6.0173 atomic mass units (u). 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c².

So m c² = 6.0173 * 931.5 MeV.

Compute that: 6 *931.5 =5589, 0.0173*931.5≈16.115. So total is 5605.115 MeV =5.605115 GeV.

So m c² ≈5.605 GeV.

Alternatively, if I were to use m=6 *938 MeV, m c²=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

But which is correct? Well, in reality, the rest mass of Li-6 is about 5.605 GeV as calculated from the atomic mass. So perhaps that's the approach.

So step 2: Compute gamma.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So gamma ≈3.5714.

Now, the total energy E = gamma * m c².

So E = 3.5714 *5.605 GeV ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.605.

Compute 3 *5.605 =16.815

0.5714 *5.605.

Compute 0.5 *5.605 =2.8025

0.0714 *5.605 ≈0.4012.

So 0.5714 *5.605 ≈ 2.8025 +0.4012=3.2037.

So total E ≈16.815 +3.2037=20.0187 GeV.

Hmm, approximately 20.019 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So the closest is option C)20.132 GeV. But wait, my calculation was 20.019, which is about 20.02 GeV, but none of the options exactly match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes m is the mass of a single nucleon, but multiplied by the number of nucleons. Let me check that.

Alternative approach: Take the mass of the nucleus as 6 * 938 MeV/c² =5.628 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.628 ≈ ?

3 *5.628=16.884

0.5714*5.628: Let's compute 0.5 *5.628=2.814, 0.0714 *5.628≈0.403.

So 0.5714 *5.628≈3.217.

Total E≈16.884 +3.217=20.101 GeV.

That's about 20.10 GeV, which is very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

So with that approach, the answer would be C.

But wait, why the discrepancy in which mass I use. Using the actual Li-6 mass gives around 20.02 GeV, whereas using the sum of nucleon masses gives about 20.10 GeV.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

0.0784 is 49/625. So sqrt(49/625)=7/25=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So that's precise.

Now, let's recompute the energy using the accurate mass.

If I take the mass as 6.0173 u.

6.0173 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6.0173 * 931.5.

Let's compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.0173 *931.5:

0.01 *931.5=9.315

0.0073 *931.5= 6.79245

So total 9.315 +6.79245=16.10745.

So 6.0173 *931.5=5589 +16.10745=5605.10745 MeV=5.60510745 GeV.

So m c²=5.60510745 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.60510745.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.60510745.

Let me compute it step by step.

3 *5.6051 =16.8153

0.57142857 *5.6051.

Compute 0.5 *5.6051 =2.80255

0.07142857 *5.6051.

What's 0.07 *5.6051=0.392357.

0.00142857 *5.6051≈0.008.

So 0.07142857 *5.6051≈0.392357 +0.008=0.400357.

So 0.5*5=2.80255 +0.400357=3.202907.

So the total is 16.8153 +3.202907=20.0182 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.0182 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.018 GeV. The options are C)20.132 GeV and another close option.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the exact calculation.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60510745.

We can do this precisely:

3.57142857 *5.60510745.

Let me use a calculator approach.

3.57142857 ×5.60510745.

First, let's compute 3.5 ×5.6 = 19.6.

But let's compute the exact multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more accurate method.

But perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of nucleon masses, which would give about 20.10 GeV, which is closer to option C.

But wait, the options don't have an exact match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the nucleus's mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the nucleus is treated as a single particle with mass equal to the sum of its nucleons. So for Li-6, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Each proton mass: 938.272 MeV/c².

Each neutron: 939.565 MeV/c².

So m = 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * mc² =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511≈0.405 (exact: 5.633511 *0.07142857).

Wait, 5.633511 * (7/98) because 0.07142857≈7/98 (since 1/14≈0.0714, but 7/98=1/14=0.07142857).

Wait, 5.633511 * (7/100) would be 0.394345, but 7/98 is 1/14.

Wait, perhaps better to compute:

5.633511 * 0.07142857 ≈ (5 *0.07142857) + (0.633511 *0.07142857)

5 *0.07142857 ≈0.35714285.

0.633511 *0.07142857 ≈ approx 0.04514.

So total is about 0.35714 +0.04514=0.40228.

So 0.57142857 *5.633511 ≈2.8167555 +0.40228≈3.2190355.

Adding to the 16.900533 gives 16.900533 +3.2190355 ≈20.1195685 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, that's very close. So perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, but why the discrepancy between using the actual Li-6 mass and the sum of nucleon masses? Because the actual mass includes binding energy, which is a small fraction, but in high-energy physics, sometimes they approximate the nucleus's rest mass as the sum of its constituent nucleons, especially when dealing with high energies where binding energy is negligible compared to the kinetic energy. So perhaps in this problem, that's the assumption.

So using the sum of the nucleon masses gives about 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the charge or something else.

Wait, another thought: The problem says the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy, but wait no, the question asks for the total energy of the nucleus, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Because in relativity, the total energy is gamma m c².

So I think the approach is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required for the nucleus X (Li-6) to reach a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \) as follows:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The nucleus X is Li-6, which has an atomic mass of approximately \( 6.0173 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting this to energy:

\[
m c^2 = 6.0173 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5605.115 \, \text{MeV} = 5.605 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), we substitute \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m c^2 \approx 5.605 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.605 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.019 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify alternative approach
If the problem assumes the rest mass of Li-6 is the sum of its nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), where each proton and neutron has a rest mass of approximately \( 938.3 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), respectively, the total rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 3 \times 938.3 + 3 \times 939.565 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5633.595 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Using this value, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.12 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The calculated energy using the sum of nucleon masses is approximately \( 20.12 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
