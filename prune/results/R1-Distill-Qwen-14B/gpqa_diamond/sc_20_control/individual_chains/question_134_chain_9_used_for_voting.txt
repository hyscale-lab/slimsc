Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The formula is usually something like q = n * ΔH, where ΔH is the enthalpy per mole of reaction.

Wait, the problem says we mix HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh right, I should probably write down the reactions first to see what's happening here. So, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

I think I need to figure out the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Because when they mix, the H+ will react with OH- to form water.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

For HCl: it's 0.2 M and 500 mL. So moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, giving 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4 is 0.3 M and 300 mL. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In aq solution, the first dissociation is complete, giving 2 H+ per molecule? Or wait, no: actually, the first dissociation is complete, giving H+ and HSO4^-; the second is also strong? Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is also pretty strong in aqueous solution. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M and 200 mL. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when H+ and OH- react, the neutralization depends on the limiting reagent. Let's see which is less: 0.28 H+ vs 0.2 OH-.

OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, ΔH is usually about -57 kJ/mol, but wait, wait—the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). Since the reaction is exothermic, the value is negative.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles. So the heat released would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Do I need to consider the stoichiometry of the reactions between the specific acids and bases?

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see how much neutralization occurs.

H+ total: 0.28 mol. OH-: 0.2 mol.

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol of H+; the remaining H+ is 0.08 mol.

But wait, the enthalpy is released per mole of H+ neutralized. So the total q is 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. Which is -11,400 J or -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is close but not kJ.

Wait, the question asks for enthalpy in what unit? The options are a mix. Let me check the units in the options.

Options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, so the question says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization', which is usually in kJ. So the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ. But none of the options is exactly that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is way off.

Wait, did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, maybe I should think about the neutralization in a different way. Perhaps the reaction is looking for the total heat. Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy per mole of reaction is per mole of H2O formed.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat per mole of H+ or OH- neutralized. So in this case, 0.2 moles of OH- neutralize 0.2 moles of H+, releasing 0.2 * 57 kJ (but negative because exothermic).

Wait, but 57 kJ is per mole of H+ or OH-? Or per mole of H2O? Let me get this straight.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually defined as the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form one mole of water. So it's per mole of H+ or OH-.

So, each mole of H+ (or OH-) gives a ΔH of approximately -57 kJ/mol (since it's exothermic, the value is negative).

So, the amount of heat released would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. So the answer should be -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, perhaps I should convert kJ to kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, how much is 11.4 kJ in kcal?

11.4 kJ / 4.184 ≈ 2.727 kcal. But that's positive, but the answer is negative. So, -2.727 kcal would be approximately -2.73 kcal, which is option A? No, option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about 48.6 kJ.

Wait, maybe I should check the calculation again. Another approach: perhaps the problem uses a different ΔH value, like -3.80 kJ per mole of H+? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem thinks that H2SO4 contributes only one H+.

Wait, no, that can't be right. H2SO4 is a strong acid in both dissociations, so in solution, it would contribute 2 H+ per molecule.

Wait another thought: perhaps Ba(OH)2 is a strong base but in solution, it dissociates into Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH^-.

Wait, so I've correctly accounted for that.

So, back to the calculations.

H+ total: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

OH-: 0.2 mol.

So, 0.2 mol OH- reacts with 0.2 mol H+.

The total heat is 0.2 * (-57000 J/mol) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ. Which is option D? No, option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the moles calculation.

Let me recheck the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct.

Ah, wait, maybe the problem is that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the second dissociation, it's not 100% ionized. But I think in aqueous solution, H2SO4 is considered to completely dissociate both protons. Or wait, is that accurate?

Wait, the first dissociation of H2SO4 is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait no, wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, giving H+ and HSO4^-.

The second dissociation is HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-. I think the second dissociation is not as strong. Wait, the first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), no, wait, no. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid but it's diprotic.

In aqueous solution, the first proton is completely ionized, so H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no, wait. Actually, no. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is not correct.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. The correct dissociation for sulfuric acid in water is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- only in the case where it is a strong acid in both steps. But actually, the first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), no, wait, no. Wait, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- occurs only in concentrated solutions? No, no, no, I'm confusing this.

Wait, correct me. First, in the first dissociation, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is incorrect. The correct dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second is not as strong.

Wait, no, no, I'm getting confused. Let's think: when H2SO4 is dissolved in water, the first H+ dissociates completely. So H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is incorrect because that would mean two H+ are released in one step. Actually, no. The first step is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-.

Wait, no. H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation: it completely dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-? Or just one H+?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about it. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is 100%: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, that can't be right because that would imply it's a triprotic acid, but wait, no. H2SO4 is diprotic, so the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no, wait, no. Each mole of H2SO4 gives one H+ in the first step, and another in the second.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct dissociation steps are:

H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, that's not correct. When H2SO4 is in water, it dissociates first into H+ and HSO4^-.

H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (completely).

Then, HSO4^- dissociates into H+ and SO4^2-.

HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- (also completely in aqueous solution).

So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

So in the initial calculation, 0.09 mol of H2SO4 would indeed give 0.18 mol of H+.

So that's correct.

Hmm, so the heat released is 0.2 mol * 57 kJ/mol (but negative), so -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. Wait, option D is -16 kJ. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I should look at the data again. Oh, wait, the question says 'enthalpy of neutralization when ... are mixed.' So perhaps the overall reaction is different.

Wait, maybe the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2. Let me write the possible reactions.

HCl is a strong acid, so it would react with OH- to form water. Similarly, H2SO4 would react with OH-.

Wait, but when you mix all three solutions, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 would react with both H+ from HCl and H2SO4.

So the neutralization is between the acids and the base. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So, the reaction is: 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- combine to form 0.2 moles of water.

The enthalpy would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option D) -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ but maybe the heat per mole is different? Or is the Ba(OH)2 contributing 2 OH- per mole?

Wait, no, I think I accounted for that correctly.

Another thought: Could the enthalpy per mole of reaction be different? For example, perhaps the problem uses the molar heat of neutralization as -3.80 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 3.80 kcal is about 15.9 kJ. Wait, 3.80 kcal ≈ 15.9 kJ. So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * (-15.9) = -3.18 kJ. That's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy is given per mole of reaction in terms of the acid or base.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ total: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28

OH-: 0.2

So reaction is 0.2 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O.

The heat released is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So then perhaps the answer is not among the options, but if I have to choose the closest, perhaps option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as -11.4 kJ.

Wait, no, because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So that's option A, which is -2.72 kcal. But wait, our calculation is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which would be about -11.4 kJ. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is option D is -16.0 kJ, but that isn't close. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, so the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me double-check the units in the options. Options A, B, C are in kcal, D is in kJ.

So the problem asks to calculate the enthalpy, but the options mix units. So perhaps the correct answer is -11.4 kJ if the units are kJ, but that's not an option. Or, is it?

Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is quite a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moles calculation. Let me recheck.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So that's correct. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

So enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) → -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this, but option D is -16.0 kJ. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the concentration of H+ and OH- as from all the solutions. Another approach: perhaps the total solution's volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL = 1 L.

Wait, but when calculating moles, it doesn't matter about the mixing, just the initial moles.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy is per mole of reaction, but including the stoichiometric coefficients.

Wait, perhaps the neutralization is for each acid separately.

Wait, perhaps the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when it's reacting with a base, each H+ contributes to the neutralization.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2.

But maybe the way it's being calculated is per mole of acid.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the moles of acid and base and see which is in excess.

Wait, another approach: the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The stoichiometry is 1 mole H2SO4 reacting with 1 mole Ba(OH)2 to produce 1 mole BaSO4 and 2 moles H2O (which gives 2 moles of water, so 2 * 57 kJ? No, per mole of H+.

Wait, no, each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 H+; each mole Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 OH-.

So in the reaction, each mole of H2SO4 would need 2 moles of OH- (since it's diprotic), but Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per mole.

So 1 mole H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole Ba(OH)2.

Similarly, HCl reacts with OH-.

So in this problem, how much reacts?

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles, which would require 0.18 moles OH-.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles, which provides 0.2 moles OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2, which is more than enough to neutralize H2SO4 (0.18 needed) and HCl (0.1 needed).

Wait, wait, the H+ from HCl is 0.1, from H2SO4 is 0.18.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 moles OH-.

So OH- will neutralize 0.2 H+.

Thus, the remaining H+ is 0.08 moles.

So the enthalpy released is 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ.

But why would the problem present the options in kcal and kJ?

Wait, the problem says 'calculate the enthalpy' but gives options in different units. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate in kJ, which would be -11.4 kJ, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D, but that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in how the H+ and OH- are neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- and see what's the neutralization.

H+ = 0.28 moles.

OH- = 0.2 moles.

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles H+, leaving 0.08 moles H+.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is calculated based on the moles of H+ (or OH-) that are neutralized. So the total q is 0.2 * (-57000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects to use the molar enthalpy as -3.80 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 3.80 kcal is about 15.9 kJ.

Wait, but 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * (-15.9) → -3.18 kJ, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is considered per mole of acid or base, not per mole of H+.

Wait, but that's probably not the case. For example, for HCl, which is monoprotic, one mole gives one mole of H+.

But H2SO4 is diprotic, so one mole gives two H+.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of one mole of H2SO4 would require two moles of OH-.

So, in that case, perhaps the neutralization is calculated per mole of H2SO4.

So, moles of H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

Each mole of H2SO4 requires one mole of Ba(OH)2.

So, 0.09 moles H2SO4 would require 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. We have 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, so all H2SO4 would be neutralized, leaving 0.01 moles Ba(OH)2 to react with HCl.

HCl has 0.1 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 left: 0.01 moles → 0.02 moles OH-.

So, H+ from HCl: 0.1.

OH- left: 0.02.

So, 0.02 moles of H+ would be neutralized, releasing 0.02 * 57 kJ = 1.14 kJ.

Then, the remaining H+ is 0.08 moles.

Wait, but this approach complicates things, and I'm not sure it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy is calculated as the sum of each neutralization reaction.

So, first, the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reacting.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1.

So H2SO4 is limiting. All 0.09 moles react, requiring 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

The enthalpy for this reaction would be 0.09 moles * 2 * 57 kJ (since two H+ are neutralized). So 0.09 * 2 * 57 = 10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles, which gives 0.02 moles OH-.

HCl has 0.1 moles H+.

So the OH- (0.02 moles) will react with H+ from HCl, releasing 0.02 *57 = 1.14 kJ.

Total enthalpy is 10.26 +1.14 = 11.4 kJ. Again, same as before.

So the total is -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is not present. But since the options have B) -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ, perhaps the correct answer is B, but that's in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal. So, if the problem's answer is in kcal, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is 11.4 kJ.

But that seems off because the reaction releases 11.4 kJ, which is approximately 2.7 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, this doesn't match with any of the options as D is -16 kJ. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in kJ, but the closest is not present. But looking at the options, the only option with a value around 11.4 is option B, but it's in kcal, and that would be about 48.6 kJ.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the overall reaction involves the formation of water from all H+ and OH- available, but since OH- is limited, only 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, leading to 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer should be -11.4 kJ, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended correct option is option D, but I don't see how that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be based on per liter or per some other volume.

Wait, perhaps I should sum the volumes to find the concentration after mixing, but that doesn't affect the moles, just the concentration.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, if H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but only the first H+ is strong, and the second is weak. So perhaps the second H+ doesn't completely dissociate. So in that case, the H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18, but if the second H+ isn't fully dissociated, then the total H+ would be less.

Wait, but in aqueous solution, H2SO4 is considered a strong acid and completely dissociates both protons. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy per mole of acid-base reaction, considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes two H+.

Wait, but I think the initial calculation is correct.

Given all that, perhaps the intended answer is option B) -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ, but that requires converting kJ to kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So option A would be -2.72 kcal, which is 11.4 kJ in kcal. But that's the opposite sign.

Wait, but in the calculation, the enthalpy is negative because it's exothermic. So the correct value is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is option A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why would the problem give some options in kcal and others in kJ? It's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, such as -3.80 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, 0.2 * (-3.80 kJ) = -0.76 kJ, which is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the value in kJ per mole of reaction, but considering that H2SO4 is diprotic and HCl is monoprotic.

Wait, maybe the approach should be to find the total equivalents of acid and base.

Equivalents of H+ = 0.1 + (0.09 * 2) = 0.28.

Equivalents of OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2.

So the neutralization is limited by OH- to 0.2 equivalents, releasing 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ.

So again, the same result.

Hmm. I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on the calculations, the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ. Since none of the options match, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as -11.4 kJ, I think the intended answer is option B. But why would it be in kcal?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use different ΔH values. Maybe the enthalpy per mole of acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 as 2 * (-57 kJ) because it's diprotic.

So, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. The neutralization is 0.2.

So enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kilocalories, so converting 11.4 kJ to kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why would the problem present the answer in kcal if the standard is kJ? I'm a bit confused, but I think that option A is the intended choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     H₂SO₄ is diprotic and fully dissociates in aqueous solution, contributing \( 2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, contributing \( 2 \times 0.1 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total \( \text{OH}^- = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
     OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it will neutralize \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of \( \text{H}^+ \) or \( \text{OH}^- \).  
     Heat released = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -11.4 \times 0.239 \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value in kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Does not match the calculated value.  

The correct answer is **-2.72 kcal**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
