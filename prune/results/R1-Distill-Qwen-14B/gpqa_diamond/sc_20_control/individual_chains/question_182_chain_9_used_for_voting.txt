Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation, which I remember is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid. The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²)/(L³). I remember that this equation describes the dark current in the space-charge-limited current regime.

Wait, what's the SCLC regime again? Oh right, in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, the current is limited by the build-up of charge in the device, creating a space charge that opposes further current flow. This is usually when the electric field is so strong that it's in the non-Ohmic, non-linear region.

So the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the current is dominated by this space-charge effect. Now, the question is about the validity conditions. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Hmm. So traps would interfere because they can cause carrier trapping, which might complicate the current behavior. If it's trap-free, that's better for the equation to hold. Ohmic contacts imply that the barrier for carriers is zero, so they can move freely. But wait, how does that affect the equation? Also, negligible drift current... Wait, in the SCLC regime, drift is important, right? Because drift is the movement due to electric field. If drift is negligible, maybe that's a different regime. Or perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Another thought: the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under certain assumptions. I think one of the assumptions is that the device is single-carrier, meaning either electrons or holes, but not both. Also, the presence of traps would complicate things, so trap-free makes sense. Ohmic contact might mean that the carrier injection is efficient, so that's okay. But why would drift current be negligible?

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. Oh, no carrier injection barrier. That would mean Ohmic contact, I think. So this is similar to option A in some ways. But this option says negligible diffusion current. Wait, in the SCLC regime, I thought that the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. Because in space-charge-limited conditions, the electric field is strong, so drift is more significant. But if diffusion is negligible, does that fit? Hmm. Let me think about the derivation. The Mott-Gurney equation comes from the case where the space charge is built up, leading to a potential drop. The derivation typically assumes that the current is due to drift, and the space charge affects the electric field in such a way that the current is proportional to V squared. So if diffusion is negligible, that makes sense because diffusion would be more relevant at lower fields. So option B says no carrier injection barrier, which is the same as Ohmic contact. So B says trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (so same as Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current. That could be possible.

Option C: Single-carrier device with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts have a barrier, so that might cause some injection problems. But wait, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the injection is complete, right? Because if there's a barrier, you might have incomplete injection, which would lead to different behavior. So a Schottky contact would imply some barrier, which would make the device have a higher turn-on voltage. But the equation is for the dark current in the SCLC, so maybe the Schottky barrier isn't a big issue here? Or does the presence of a Schottky contact affect the validity? Also, negligible diffusion current, which I think I've considered before.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Two-carrier devices have both electrons and holes contributing. But the Mott-Gurney equation is for single-carrier devices, I believe. Because in a two-carrier scenario, the space charge would involve both carriers, which complicates the analysis. So D might not be correct because it's a two-carrier device.

So, let's go back. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, so we can eliminate options that mention two-carrier (option D). So between options A, B, and C.

The equation also requires that the space-charge limited conditions be met, which generally implies that the current is dominated by the space charge effect, not by other factors like series resistance or traps. So the device should be trap-free, as traps would lead to additional current loss through trapping and detrapping, which isn't accounted for in the Mott-Gurney equation.

Now, looking at the contacts. Ohmic contacts have no barrier, so all carriers can move freely. But wait, for the Mott-Gurney equation, the assumption is that the carriers can move freely, so that the current is only limited by the space charge, not by the contact. So having an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier) is favorable. So options A and B have this (since B says no carrier injection barrier, which is same as Ohmic).

Now, regarding drift vs. diffusion. The SCLC is when the space charge is built up, and the electric field is so strong that drift is dominant. So if the equation assumes negligible diffusion current, that would be correct because drift is the main contributor.

Option B says negligible diffusion current, which aligns with the conditions required for Mott-Gurney.

Wait, but option A says negligible drift current. That doesn't make sense because in SCLC, drift is the main thing. So option A can't be right because it says negligible drift. So option A is incorrect.

Option C says Schottky contact, which implies a barrier. If there's a barrier, the injection isn't ideal, so the current might not follow the Mott-Gurney equation. Because the equation assumes that the carriers are fully injected and that the space charge is the main effect. So option C is likely incorrect.

So, the correct option is B: trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic) and negligible diffusion current.

The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. It assumes that the current is dominated by the space charge effect, which occurs when the electric field is strong enough to create a potential drop that limits the current. The equation is valid under specific conditions, and the question asks which of the given options correctly identifies these conditions.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: This states that the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, in the SCLC regime, drift current is the dominant mechanism, not diffusion. If drift current were negligible, the SCLC regime would not apply. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: This states that the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (i.e., Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the conditions for the SCLC regime, where the current is dominated by drift, and diffusion is negligible. The absence of traps ensures that the current is not affected by carrier trapping or detrapping, which would complicate the behavior. This option is consistent with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation.

3. **Option C**: This states that the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a barrier, which can lead to incomplete carrier injection. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes that carriers are fully injected and that the space charge is the primary limiting factor. Therefore, the presence of a Schottky contact makes this option incorrect.

4. **Option D**: This states that the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, as the analysis assumes that only one type of carrier contributes to the current. In a two-carrier device, the behavior would be more complex due to the interaction of both electrons and holes. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This is best described by **Option B**.
