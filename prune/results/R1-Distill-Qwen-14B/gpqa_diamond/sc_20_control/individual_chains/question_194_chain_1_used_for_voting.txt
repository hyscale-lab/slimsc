Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's see. The spins are S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Right. So each state is a combination of the three spins, each being +1 or -1. So there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

But wait, calculating each state's energy might be time-consuming, but maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the energy and how many states correspond to each energy.

Let me think about the energy expression. E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i is either +1 or -1, the product S_i S_j is also either +1 or -1.

So S1S2 can be +1 or -1. Same for S1S3 and S2S3. Let me denote each term as a, b, c. So a = S1S2, b = S1S3, c = S2S3. Then E = -J(a + b + c). But wait a, b, c are each ±1.

Wait, but these a, b, c are not independent because they are related through the spins. For example, a * b = (S1S2)(S1S3) = S2 S3 = c. So a*b = c. So that's a constraint.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to find all possible values of (a + b + c) given that a*b = c. Let me try that.

Let me think about possible cases. Let a, b be either +1 or -1.

Case 1: a=+1, b=+1. Then c = a*b = +1. So sum is 1+1+1=3.

Case 2: a=+1, b=-1. c = (1)(-1) = -1. Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

Case 3: a=-1, b=+1. c= (-1)(+1)= -1. Sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.

Case 4: a=-1, b=-1. c= ( -1 )*( -1 )= +1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

Wait, so the possible sums are 3 and -1, but wait:

Wait, let me recount:

Wait in case 1:
a=+1, b=+1 → c=+1 → sum=3.

In case 2:
a=+1, b=-1 → c=-1 → sum= (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

Case3: a=-1, b=+1 → c= -1 → sum= (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.

Case4: a=-1, b=-1 → c= (+1) → sum= (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

So the sum is either 3 or -1.

Wait, but wait: what about the cases where a and b are... Wait, are a, b, c independent? No, because of the relation a*b = c. So the possible sums are limited.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at the possible values of the sum S = a + b + c, given that a*b = c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of S.

Wait, let me think about this. Since c = a*b, S becomes a + b + a*b.

So S = a + b + ab.

Hmm, let's compute this for all possible a and b.

a can be ±1, same for b.

Case 1: a=1, b=1 → S=1 +1 +1*1=3.

Case 2: a=1, b=-1 → S=1 + (-1) + (1*(-1))= 1-1-1= -1.

Case 3: a=-1, b=1 → S= (-1) +1 + (-1)(1)= (-1)+1-1= -1.

Case4: a=-1, b=-1 → S= (-1) + (-1) + ( (-1)(-1) )= -2 +1 = -1.

So the sum can be 3 or -1.

So the sum a + b + c can be 3 or -1.

Wait, but wait: that's only considering a and b, but when you have three spins, each triplet gives a particular combination. But perhaps the sum S can be more than just 3 and -1? Or maybe not?

Wait, another approach: each spin triplet S1, S2, S3 can give a particular value of the sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me compute H for all possible 8 states.

Let me list all possible spin configurations:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

Compute each product:
S1S2=1*1=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So sum = 1+1+1=3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Products: 1, (-1), (-1). Sum= 1-1-1= -1.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

Products: (-1), (1), (-1). Sum= -1 +1 -1= -1.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

Products: (-1), (-1), (1). Sum= -1 -1 +1= -1.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

Products: (-1), (-1), (1). Sum= -1 -1 +1= -1.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Products: (-1), (1), (-1). Sum= -1 +1 -1= -1.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

Products: (1), (-1), (-1). Sum= 1 -1 -1= -1.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

Products: (1), (1), (1). Sum=1+1+1=3.

So now I see that in the 8 states, two of them have H=3 (cases 1 and 8), and the remaining six have H=-1.

So for each state, the energy E is -J * H. So E can be either -J * 3 or -J * (-1).

So E can be -3J or J.

Wait, no: E = -J * H. So when H=3, E= -J*3 = -3J. When H=-1, E= -J*(-1) = J.

So each state has E either -3J or J.

Now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -β E ).

Each state contributes either exp(3J β) because when E=-3J, the exponent is -β*(-3J) = 3J β.

Wait, wait: because E is the energy, Z is sum_{states} exp( -β E ). So for E = -3J, the term is exp(3J β). For E = J, the term is exp( - J β ), since E=J, so -β E is -β J.

So how many states have E=-3J? Only 2: the all +1 and all -1 states.

And how many have E=J? The remaining 6.

So Z = 2 * exp(3J β) +6 * exp(- J β).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → no, because the first term is e^{-3Jβ} which is for E=3J, which is not the case.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → yes, this matches.

Option C: 2e^{2Jb} +6e^{-2Jb} → exponents differ.

Option D: 6e^{2Jb} +2e^{-2Jb} → same, exponents wrong.

Wait, but let me double-check. So in our calculation, E can be -3J or J.

So for each state, the term in Z is exp( -β E ). So when E= -3J, exp(3 J β). When E= J, exp( - J β).

Number of states for E=-3J is 2. So 2 * e^{3 J β}.

Number of states for E= J is 6. So 6 * e^{- J β}.

Thus, Z=2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- J β}.

Looking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- J β}.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Energy Levels**:  
   The energy depends on the interaction terms \( S_1S_2, S_1S_3, S_2S_3 \), which can each be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The total sum \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can take the values \( H = 3 \) (when all products are \( +1 \)) or \( H = -1 \) (in all other cases). Thus, the energy levels are:  
   - \( E = -3J \) when \( H = 3 \),  
   - \( E = J \) when \( H = -1 \).

2. **Number of States**:  
   - There are 2 states where \( H = 3 \) (all spins aligned, either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)).  
   - There are 6 states where \( H = -1 \) (all other combinations of spins).  

3. **Partition Function**:  
   The partition function is given by \( Z = \sum_{\text{states}} \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).  
   - For \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( 2 \exp(3J\beta) \).  
   - For \( E = J \), the contribution is \( 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).  
   Thus, \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing with the given options:  
   - **Option A**: \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \) (incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed).  
   - **Option B**: \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \) (correct, matches the derived expression).  
   - **Option C**: \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \) (incorrect, exponents are wrong).  
   - **Option D**: \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) (incorrect, exponents and coefficients are wrong).  

The correct answer is **Option B**.
