Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c? X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li is Lithium. So, Li with 3 neutrons would be Lithium-6, right? Because the atomic number for Li is 3 (so 3 protons), and if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6.

The options given are four different energies in GeV. I need to calculate the total energy the nucleus has when moving at 0.96c.

I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic. The formula I'm thinking of is the total energy E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in. So v squared is (0.96c)², which is 0.9216 c squared. Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28? Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

But wait, what's the mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus? I think I need that to calculate the total energy. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but wait, actually, when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum because of the binding energy (mass defect). But for heavy ions, sometimes they approximate using the rest mass of the nucleus, which is given by m = A * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is roughly the mass of a proton or neutron. Wait, but the exact mass might vary a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as m = M(X), which would be the atomic mass. So Lithium-6 has a certain atomic mass. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6. Hmm, I don't remember the exact value, but maybe it's given as 6 atomic mass units (u) approximately. Wait, but wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u. Because for each proton and neutron, the mass is about 1.0033 u, but the exact value would require checking. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to treat the mass as approximately 6 u.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass of Lithium-6. Let me recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So using m = 6.013 u, but I need that in kilograms to compute energy in GeV. Alternatively, I can use the conversion factor for mass in GeV/c². Since 1 u is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So m0 = 6.013 u * 0.9315 GeV/c² per u.

Let me calculate that: 6.013 * 0.9315 ≈ let's compute 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589, and 0.013 * 0.9315 is about 0.0121. So total m0 c² is approximately 5.589 + 0.0121 = 5.6011 GeV. Wait, but actually, the rest mass energy is m0 c², so it's approximately 5.6 GeV for Li-6.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options are up to about 23 GeV. Wait, no, the options are about 18 to 23 GeV, which is the total energy. Because the kinetic energy would be E - m0 c², but the total energy is gamma times m0 c², which would be higher.

Wait, but let's proceed step by step.

First, compute gamma. v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) 

v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = approx 3.5714286.

Now, the rest mass energy E_rest = m0 c². m0 is the mass of Lithium-6, which is 6.013 u.

Each u is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So m0 c² = 6.013 * 0.9315 GeV.

Let me compute that:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.013 * 0.9315 = approx 0.0121.

Adding them gives 5.589 + 0.0121 = 5.6011 GeV.

So E_rest = 5.6011 GeV.

Total energy E = gamma * E_rest = 3.5714286 * 5.6011 GeV.

Compute 3.5714 * 5.6011.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 3 * 5.6011 = 16.8033.

0.5714 * 5.6011: Let's compute 0.5 * 5.6011 = 2.80055. 

0.0714 * 5.6011 ≈ 0.0714 *5=0.357, 0.0714*0.6011≈0.0429, so total ≈ 0.357 + 0.0429 = 0.3999.

So 0.5714 *5.6011 ≈ 2.80055 + 0.3999 ≈ 3.1999.

So total E ≈ 16.8033 + 3.2 ≈ 20.0033 GeV.

Wait, but wait, 3.5714 is approximately 25/7, which is about 3.5714. Let me compute 5.6011 * 3.5714.

Another approach: 3.5714 *5.6011.

Let me compute 5.6011 * 3 = 16.8033.

5.6011 *0.5=2.80055.

5.6011 *0.07 = 0.392077.

5.6011 *0.0014= approx 0.0078415.

Add them up:

3: 16.8033

0.5: 2.80055 → 16.8033 + 2.80055 = 19.60385.

0.07: 0.392077 → 19.60385 + 0.392077 = 19.995927.

0.0014: 0.0078415 → 19.995927 + 0.0078415 = approx 20.0037685 GeV.

So about 20.0038 GeV. Hmm, so looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close, but option D is 21.419, which is higher. Option B is 23.069, which is way higher. Option A is 18.475.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because 3.5714 *5.6011 is roughly 20 GeV, but perhaps I miscalculated the rest mass energy.

Wait, let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Lithium-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.013 atomic mass units.

Each atomic mass unit is 1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. And 1 u is approximately 0.931494 GeV/c². Wait, more precisely, 1 u is about 0.931494 GeV/c². So m0 c² for Li-6 is 6.013 * 0.931494 ≈ ?

Let me compute that more accurately:

6.013 * 0.931494.

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.013 *0.931494 = 0.0121094.

Adding these gives 5.588964 + 0.0121094 = 5.6010734 GeV.

So E_rest is approximately 5.6010734 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma (3.5714286):

5.6010734 * 3.5714286.

Let me compute this precisely.

Alternatively, 3.5714286 is 25/7 (since 25 ÷7 ≈3.5714286).

So 5.6010734 * 25 /7.

Compute 5.6010734 *25 = ?

5 *25 =125, 0.6010734 *25 =15.026835. So total is 125 +15.026835 = 140.026835.

Now divide by 7: 140.026835 /7 =20.00383357 GeV.

So approximately 20.0038 GeV. So the total energy is around 20.0038 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation or the mass.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6 u but the sum of the mass of protons and neutrons. Because the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum due to binding energy. However, sometimes in these problems, they approximate the mass as the sum.

Wait, wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008664 u.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m = 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008664) = 3*(2.01594) = 6.04782 u.

Wait, but the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.013 u. So that's about 0.03482 u less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Which makes sense because of mass defect due to binding energy.

So if the problem expects me to use the exact atomic mass, then m is 6.013 u, leading to E_rest =6.013 *0.931494 ≈5.60107 GeV.

So the total energy is about 20.0038 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma. Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.5714285714...

Alternatively, perhaps the more precise calculation would use more decimal places. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approx 3.57142857.

Hmm, precise enough. So, gamma is 3.57142857.

So, the calculation should be correct. So E =3.57142857 *5.6010734 GeV.

Wait, let me compute that again:

3.57142857 *5.6010734.

Let me compute 5.6010734 multiplied by 3.57142857.

Another way: 5.6010734 *3 =16.8032202.

5.6010734 *0.5=2.8005367.

5.6010734 *0.07142857≈ 5.6010734 * 0.07 =0.39207514; 5.6010734 *0.00142857≈0.00800000 approximately. So 0.39207514 + 0.0080000=0.40007514.

Adding all together: 16.8032202 + 2.8005367 =19.6037569. Then 19.6037569 + 0.40007514 =20.003832 GeV.

So about 20.0038 GeV.

But the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of the options exactly matches 20.0038. The closest is C) 20.132 GeV. Which is about 0.13 GeV higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass energy. Let me recheck:

Li-6 has an atomic mass of 6.013 u. 1 u is 0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.013 * 0.931494 = ?

6 *0.931494=5.588964

0.013 *0.931494=0.0121094

Total:5.588964 +0.0121094=5.6010734 GeV.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about kinetic energy instead of total energy? No, the question says the energy of the RHIC, which would be the total energy imparted to the nucleus, i.e., the total energy, not just kinetic.

So, the calculation seems correct. So perhaps the intended answer is approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have 20 GeV; option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of neutrons. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li's atomic number is 3, so with 3 neutrons, the mass number is 6. So yes, X is Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the molar mass or other factors? Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron and not the exact atomic mass.

Wait, let me try that approach. Let's compute the mass as 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Mass of proton, m_p ≈ 1.007276 u.

Mass of neutron, m_n ≈1.008664 u.

So m =3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) =3*(2.01594) =6.04782 u.

Then, m0 c² =6.04782 *0.931494 = let me compute that.

6*0.931494 =5.588964.

0.04782 *0.931494 ≈0.04461.

Total E_rest =5.588964 +0.04461 =5.633574 GeV.

Hmm, now gamma is 3.5714, so E=3.5714 *5.633574.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5.633574.

Well, 5 *3.5714=17.857.

0.633574 *3.5714≈?

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.033574 *3.5714≈0.1194.

So total for 0.633574 is 2.14284 +0.1194 ≈2.26224.

So E≈17.857 + 2.26224 ≈20.1192 GeV.

So about 20.119 GeV. That's close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the intended approach was to compute the mass as 3 protons + 3 neutrons, not the exact atomic mass.

But wait, the actual atomic mass includes binding energy. So why would the problem expect using the sum of individual nucleon masses?

Hmm, perhaps the problem is assuming that the nucleus is a collection of free nucleons, which would be an approximation. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach.

Wait, let me compute 20.119 GeV. That's close to option C (20.132) but not exactly. But perhaps more precise calculations would bring it closer.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute v =0.96c.

v = 0.96c → v² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857...

Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation of gamma would affect the result. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more precisely.

Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma is 25/7, which is exactly 3.57142857...

So, using m =6.04782 u, m0 c²=5.63357 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.63357 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.63357.

Let me compute 5.63357 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.63357 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.03357 *3.57142857 ≈0.03357 *3.5714 ≈0.1194.

So 0.63357 *3.5714 ≈2.14285714 +0.1194 =2.262257.

So total E ≈17.85714285 +2.262257=20.1194 GeV.

Hmm, that's 20.1194 GeV, which is about 20.1194. Option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I should compute the exact product.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m0 c².

Wait, m =3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) =3*(2.01594) =6.04782 u.

m0 c²=6.04782 *0.931494= ?

Let me compute 6.04782 *0.931494.

6.04782 * 0.9 =5.443038.

6.04782 *0.031494= ?

6.04782 *0.03=0.1814346.

6.04782 *0.001494= approx 0.009026.

Adding: 0.1814346 +0.009026=0.1904606.

So total m0 c²=5.443038 +0.1904606=5.6334986 GeV.

So, E=gamma * m0 c²=3.57142857 *5.6334986.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.6334986.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Let me split 5.6334986 into 5 +0.6334986.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6334986.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0334986.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.03=0.107142857.

3.57142857 *0.0034986= approximately 0.012610.

So 0.0334986 *3.57142857 ≈0.107142857 + 0.012610 =0.119752857.

So, 3.57142857 *0.6334986≈2.142857142 +0.119752857≈2.26261.

So E =17.85714285 +2.26261 =20.11975 GeV.

So approximately 20.11975 GeV. Which is about 20.12 GeV.

Looking back, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps during the calculation, more precise decimal places would bring it up to 20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6334986 exactly.

Calculate 3.57142857 × 5.6334986:

Let me use a calculator approach.

3.57142857 ×5.6334986.

First, multiply 3.57142857 by 5.6334986.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6334986 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.0334986 ≈0.11975286.

So total for 0.6334986 is 2.142857142 +0.11975286≈2.26261.

So total energy is 17.85714285 +2.26261=20.11975 GeV.

Hmm, still about 20.11975, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. Option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher, but perhaps the problem expects rounding to four decimal places.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Since v=0.96c, let's compute gamma precisely.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

But 0.0784 is 196/2500 or 49/625. Wait, 49/625 is 0.0784.

So sqrt(49/625)=7/25=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 25/7 =3.5714285714...

So, no error there.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c or for the mass of the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be in the rest mass plus kinetic energy, but that would be E = gamma m c², which is what we've been calculating.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Wait, another way to compute the total energy is E = gamma m c².

But maybe I should compute the kinetic energy and then add the rest mass, but that's the same as what I've done.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the velocity as a fraction of c, but maybe I should compute beta = v/c =0.96, and then compute gamma correctly.

Wait, another approach: use the exact formula for gamma.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1 / sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28= 3.57142857...

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I used the sum of protons and neutrons, but the correct approach is to use the exact atomic mass.

Wait, when using the exact atomic mass, E was about 20.0038 GeV, but using the sum of nucleon masses, it's about 20.1197 GeV. The problem statement says "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So X is Li-6, whose exact mass is about 6.013 u.

So which approach should I take? The problem specifies X as Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. Its exact mass is 6.013 u.

So perhaps the correct calculation is 20.0038 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have 20 exactly. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.13 GeV higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations.

Wait, let me compute 6.013 *0.931494 GeV exactly.

6.013 × 0.931494.

= (6 +0.013) ×0.931494 

=6×0.931494 +0.013×0.931494 

=5.588964 +0.0121094 

=5.6010734 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857...

So E =3.57142857 *5.6010734 = ?

Let me compute this more precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.6010734.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6010734 = ?

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.0010734= approx 0.003833.

So 0.6010734 is 0.6 +0.0010734.

So 3.57142857 ×0.6010734 ≈2.142857142 +0.003833 =2.14669.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.14669 =20.00383 GeV.

So about 20.0038 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.13 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for the Lorentz factor?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic energy including the rest mass correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy is calculated as the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Kinetic energy would be E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c².

So with gamma=3.5714, E_kinetic = (3.5714 -1)*5.6010734 = 2.5714 *5.6010734.

Compute that: 2*5.6010734=11.2021468.

0.5714 *5.6010734 ≈3.19995.

So E_kinetic ≈11.2021468 +3.19995 ≈14.402 GeV.

But the question is about the total energy, not the kinetic. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. The calculation seems to point to approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use m_p + m_n for each nucleon, which would lead to a higher energy.

Wait, let me compute using the sum of protons and neutrons.

m =3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) =6.04782 u.

m0 c²=6.04782 *0.931494 =5.63357 GeV.

Then, E =gamma *5.63357 =3.5714 *5.63357≈20.1197 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.12 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps that's the intended approach, using the sum of the individual masses, even though the actual mass is a bit less.

So, the correct answer would be approximately 20.12 GeV, which matches option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is the option 20.132? Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.63357 exactly.

3.57142857 *5.63357 = ?

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

5.63357 ×3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

5.63357 ×3 =16.90071.

5.63357 ×0.57142857 ≈5.63357 ×0.5=2.816785.

5.63357 ×0.07142857≈0.4033 (approx).

So 0.57142857 part is 2.816785 +0.4033=3.220085.

So total E=16.90071 +3.220085=20.120795 GeV.

That's about 20.1208 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.63357 ×3.57142857 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact multiplication:

3.57142857 ×5.63357 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.63357.

Using a calculator approach:

3.57142857 ×5.63357 = ?

Let me write it as:

3.57142857 ×5.63357.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.63357 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.03357 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.03 =0.1071428571.

3.57142857 ×0.00357= approximately 0.01279.

So 0.03357 ×3.57142857 ≈0.1071428571 +0.01279=0.1199328571.

So 0.63357 ×3.57142857 =2.142857142 +0.1199328571=2.26279.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.26279=20.12 GeV.

So, approximately 20.12 GeV, so option C is 20.132, which is very close.

In that case, the answer must be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required for a Lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) to reach a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus is Lithium-6 (Li-6), which has a mass of approximately \( 6.013 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.013 \times 0.931494 \approx 5.6011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 \approx 5.6011 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6011 \approx 20.0038 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation using the sum of nucleon masses
The problem may expect the use of the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons for the nucleus. For Li-6 (3 protons and 3 neutrons):

\[
m_{\text{proton}} = 1.007276 \, \text{u}, \quad m_{\text{neutron}} = 1.008664 \, \text{u}
\]
\[
m = 3 \times m_{\text{proton}} + 3 \times m_{\text{neutron}} = 3 \times 1.007276 + 3 \times 1.008664 = 6.04782 \, \text{u}
\]

The rest mass energy is then:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.04782 \times 0.931494 \approx 5.6336 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Using this value, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6336 \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The closest option to the calculated value of \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \) is **C) 20.132 GeV**. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or slight differences in the approximations used.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC required for the Li-6 nucleus to reach \( v = 0.96c \) is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c? X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li is Lithium. So, Li with 3 neutrons would be Lithium-6, right? Because the atomic number for Li is 3 (so 3 protons), and if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6.

The options given are four different energies in GeV. I need to calculate the total energy the nucleus has when moving at 0.96c.

I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic. The formula I'm thinking of is the total energy E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in. So v squared is (0.96c)², which is 0.9216 c squared. Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28? Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

But wait, what's the mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus? I think I need that to calculate the total energy. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but wait, actually, when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum because of the binding energy (mass defect). But for heavy ions, sometimes they approximate using the rest mass of the nucleus, which is given by m = A * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is roughly the mass of a proton or neutron. Wait, but the exact mass might vary a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as m = M(X), which would be the atomic mass. So Lithium-6 has a certain atomic mass. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6. Hmm, I don't remember the exact value, but maybe it's given as 6 atomic mass units (u) approximately. Wait, but wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u. Because for each proton and neutron, the mass is about 1.0033 u, but the exact value would require checking. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to treat the mass as approximately 6 u.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass of Lithium-6. Let me recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So using m = 6.013 u, but I need that in kilograms to compute energy in GeV. Alternatively, I can use the conversion factor for mass in GeV/c². Since 1 u is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So m0 = 6.013 u * 0.9315 GeV/c² per u.

Let me calculate that: 6.013 * 0.9315 ≈ let's compute 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589, and 0.013 * 0.9315 is about 0.0121. So total m0 c² is approximately 5.589 + 0.0121 = 5.6011 GeV. Wait, but actually, the rest mass energy is m0 c², so it's approximately 5.6 GeV for Li-6.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options are up to about 23 GeV. Wait, no, the options are about 18 to 23 GeV, which is the total energy. Because the kinetic energy would be E - m0 c², but the total energy is gamma times m0 c², which would be higher.

Wait, but let's proceed step by step.

First, compute gamma. v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) 

v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = approx 3.5714286.

Now, the rest mass energy E_rest = m0 c². m0 is the mass of Lithium-6, which is 6.013 u.

Each u is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So m0 c² = 6.013 * 0.9315 GeV.

Let me compute that:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.013 * 0.9315 = approx 0.0121.

Adding them gives 5.589 + 0.0121 = 5.6011 GeV.

So E_rest = 5.6011 GeV.

Total energy E = gamma * E_rest = 3.5714286 * 5.6011 GeV.

Compute 3.5714 * 5.6011.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 3 * 5.6011 = 16.8033.

0.5714 * 5.6011: Let's compute 0.5 * 5.6011 = 2.80055. 

0.0714 * 5.6011 ≈ 0.0714 *5=0.357, 0.0714*0.6011≈0.0429, so total ≈ 0.357 + 0.0429 = 0.3999.

So 0.5714 *5.6011 ≈ 2.80055 + 0.3999 ≈ 3.1999.

So total E ≈ 16.8033 + 3.2 ≈ 20.0033 GeV.

Wait, but wait, 3.5714 is approximately 25/7, which is about 3.5714. Let me compute 5.6011 * 3.5714.

Another approach: 3.5714 *5.6011.

Let me compute 5.6011 * 3 = 16.8033.

5.6011 *0.5=2.80055.

5.6011 *0.07 = 0.392077.

5.6011 *0.0014= approx 0.0078415.

Add them up:

3: 16.8033

0.5: 2.80055 → 16.8033 + 2.80055 = 19.60385.

0.07: 0.392077 → 19.60385 + 0.392077 = 19.995927.

0.0014: 0.0078415 → 19.995927 + 0.0078415 = approx 20.0037685 GeV.

So about 20.0038 GeV. Hmm, so looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close, but option D is 21.419, which is higher. Option B is 23.069, which is way higher. Option A is 18.475.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because 3.5714 *5.6011 is roughly 20 GeV, but perhaps I miscalculated the rest mass energy.

Wait, let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Lithium-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.013 atomic mass units.

Each atomic mass unit is 1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. And 1 u is approximately 0.931494 GeV/c². Wait, more precisely, 1 u is about 0.931494 GeV/c². So m0 c² for Li-6 is 6.013 * 0.931494 ≈ ?

Let me compute that more accurately:

6.013 * 0.931494.

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.013 *0.931494 = 0.0121094.

Adding these gives 5.588964 + 0.0121094 = 5.6010734 GeV.

So E_rest is approximately 5.6010734 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma (3.5714286):

5.6010734 * 3.5714286.

Let me compute this precisely.

Alternatively, 3.5714286 is 25/7 (since 25 ÷7 ≈3.5714286).

So 5.6010734 * 25 /7.

Compute 5.6010734 *25 = ?

5 *25 =125, 0.6010734 *25 =15.026835. So total is 125 +15.026835 = 140.026835.

Now divide by 7: 140.026835 /7 =20.00383357 GeV.

So approximately 20.0038 GeV. So the total energy is around 20.0038 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation or the mass.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6 u but the sum of the mass of protons and neutrons. Because the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum due to binding energy. However, sometimes in these problems, they approximate the mass as the sum.

Wait, wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008664 u.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m = 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008664) = 3*(2.01594) = 6.04782 u.

Wait, but the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.013 u. So that's about 0.03482 u less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Which makes sense because of mass defect due to binding energy.

So if the problem expects me to use the exact atomic mass, then m is 6.013 u, leading to E_rest =6.013 *0.931494 ≈5.60107 GeV.

So the total energy is about 20.0038 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma. Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.5714285714...

Alternatively, perhaps the more precise calculation would use more decimal places. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approx 3.57142857.

Hmm, precise enough. So, gamma is 3.57142857.

So, the calculation should be correct. So E =3.57142857 *5.6010734 GeV.

Wait, let me compute that again:

3.57142857 *5.6010734.

Let me compute 5.6010734 multiplied by 3.57142857.

Another way: 5.6010734 *3 =16.8032202.

5.6010734 *0.5=2.8005367.

5.6010734 *0.07142857≈ 5.6010734 * 0.07 =0.39207514; 5.6010734 *0.00142857≈0.00800000 approximately. So 0.39207514 + 0.0080000=0.40007514.

Adding all together: 16.8032202 + 2.8005367 =19.6037569. Then 19.6037569 + 0.40007514 =20.003832 GeV.

So about 20.0038 GeV.

But the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of the options exactly matches 20.0038. The closest is C) 20.132 GeV. Which is about 0.13 GeV higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass energy. Let me recheck:

Li-6 has an atomic mass of 6.013 u. 1 u is 0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.013 * 0.931494 = ?

6 *0.931494=5.588964

0.013 *0.931494=0.0121094

Total:5.588964 +0.0121094=5.6010734 GeV.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about kinetic energy instead of total energy? No, the question says the energy of the RHIC, which would be the total energy imparted to the nucleus, i.e., the total energy, not just kinetic.

So, the calculation seems correct. So perhaps the intended answer is approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have 20 GeV; option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of neutrons. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li's atomic number is 3, so with 3 neutrons, the mass number is 6. So yes, X is Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the molar mass or other factors? Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron and not the exact atomic mass.

Wait, let me try that approach. Let's compute the mass as 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Mass of proton, m_p ≈ 1.007276 u.

Mass of neutron, m_n ≈1.008664 u.

So m =3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) =3*(2.01594) =6.04782 u.

Then, m0 c² =6.04782 *0.931494 = let me compute that.

6*0.931494 =5.588964.

0.04782 *0.931494 ≈0.04461.

Total E_rest =5.588964 +0.04461 =5.633574 GeV.

Hmm, now gamma is 3.5714, so E=3.5714 *5.633574.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5.633574.

Well, 5 *3.5714=17.857.

0.633574 *3.5714≈?

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.033574 *3.5714≈0.1194.

So total for 0.633574 is 2.14284 +0.1194 ≈2.26224.

So E≈17.857 + 2.26224 ≈20.1192 GeV.

So about 20.119 GeV. That's close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the intended approach was to compute the mass as 3 protons + 3 neutrons, not the exact atomic mass.

But wait, the actual atomic mass includes binding energy. So why would the problem expect using the sum of individual nucleon masses?

Hmm, perhaps the problem is assuming that the nucleus is a collection of free nucleons, which would be an approximation. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach.

Wait, let me compute 20.119 GeV. That's close to option C (20.132) but not exactly. But perhaps more precise calculations would bring it closer.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute v =0.96c.

v = 0.96c → v² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857...

Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation of gamma would affect the result. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more precisely.

Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma is 25/7, which is exactly 3.57142857...

So, using m =6.04782 u, m0 c²=5.63357 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.63357 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.63357.

Let me compute 5.63357 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.63357 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.03357 *3.57142857 ≈0.03357 *3.5714 ≈0.1194.

So 0.63357 *3.5714 ≈2.14285714 +0.1194 =2.262257.

So total E ≈17.85714285 +2.262257=20.1194 GeV.

Hmm, that's 20.1194 GeV, which is about 20.1194. Option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I should compute the exact product.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m0 c².

Wait, m =3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) =3*(2.01594) =6.04782 u.

m0 c²=6.04782 *0.931494= ?

Let me compute 6.04782 *0.931494.

6.04782 * 0.9 =5.443038.

6.04782 *0.031494= ?

6.04782 *0.03=0.1814346.

6.04782 *0.001494= approx 0.009026.

Adding: 0.1814346 +0.009026=0.1904606.

So total m0 c²=5.443038 +0.1904606=5.6334986 GeV.

So, E=gamma * m0 c²=3.57142857 *5.6334986.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.6334986.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Let me split 5.6334986 into 5 +0.6334986.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6334986.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0334986.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.03=0.107142857.

3.57142857 *0.0034986= approximately 0.012610.

So 0.0334986 *3.57142857 ≈0.107142857 + 0.012610 =0.119752857.

So, 3.57142857 *0.6334986≈2.142857142 +0.119752857≈2.26261.

So E =17.85714285 +2.26261 =20.11975 GeV.

So approximately 20.11975 GeV. Which is about 20.12 GeV.

Looking back, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps during the calculation, more precise decimal places would bring it up to 20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6334986 exactly.

Calculate 3.57142857 × 5.6334986:

Let me use a calculator approach.

3.57142857 ×5.6334986.

First, multiply 3.57142857 by 5.6334986.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6334986 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.0334986 ≈0.11975286.

So total for 0.6334986 is 2.142857142 +0.11975286≈2.26261.

So total energy is 17.85714285 +2.26261=20.11975 GeV.

Hmm, still about 20.11975, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. Option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher, but perhaps the problem expects rounding to four decimal places.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Since v=0.96c, let's compute gamma precisely.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

But 0.0784 is 196/2500 or 49/625. Wait, 49/625 is 0.0784.

So sqrt(49/625)=7/25=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 25/7 =3.5714285714...

So, no error there.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c or for the mass of the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be in the rest mass plus kinetic energy, but that would be E = gamma m c², which is what we've been calculating.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Wait, another way to compute the total energy is E = gamma m c².

But maybe I should compute the kinetic energy and then add the rest mass, but that's the same as what I've done.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the velocity as a fraction of c, but maybe I should compute beta = v/c =0.96, and then compute gamma correctly.

Wait, another approach: use the exact formula for gamma.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1 / sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28= 3.57142857...

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I used the sum of protons and neutrons, but the correct approach is to use the exact atomic mass.

Wait, when using the exact atomic mass, E was about 20.0038 GeV, but using the sum of nucleon masses, it's about 20.1197 GeV. The problem statement says "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So X is Li-6, whose exact mass is about 6.013 u.

So which approach should I take? The problem specifies X as Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. Its exact mass is 6.013 u.

So perhaps the correct calculation is 20.0038 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have 20 exactly. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.13 GeV higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations.

Wait, let me compute 6.013 *0.931494 GeV exactly.

6.013 × 0.931494.

= (6 +0.013) ×0.931494 

=6×0.931494 +0.013×0.931494 

=5.588964 +0.0121094 

=5.6010734 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857...

So E =3.57142857 *5.6010734 = ?

Let me compute this more precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.6010734.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6010734 = ?

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.0010734= approx 0.003833.

So 0.6010734 is 0.6 +0.0010734.

So 3.57142857 ×0.6010734 ≈2.142857142 +0.003833 =2.14669.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.14669 =20.00383 GeV.

So about 20.0038 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.13 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for the Lorentz factor?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic energy including the rest mass correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy is calculated as the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Kinetic energy would be E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c².

So with gamma=3.5714, E_kinetic = (3.5714 -1)*5.6010734 = 2.5714 *5.6010734.

Compute that: 2*5.6010734=11.2021468.

0.5714 *5.6010734 ≈3.19995.

So E_kinetic ≈11.2021468 +3.19995 ≈14.402 GeV.

But the question is about the total energy, not the kinetic. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. The calculation seems to point to approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use m_p + m_n for each nucleon, which would lead to a higher energy.

Wait, let me compute using the sum of protons and neutrons.

m =3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) =6.04782 u.

m0 c²=6.04782 *0.931494 =5.63357 GeV.

Then, E =gamma *5.63357 =3.5714 *5.63357≈20.1197 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.12 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps that's the intended approach, using the sum of the individual masses, even though the actual mass is a bit less.

So, the correct answer would be approximately 20.12 GeV, which matches option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is the option 20.132? Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.63357 exactly.

3.57142857 *5.63357 = ?

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

5.63357 ×3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

5.63357 ×3 =16.90071.

5.63357 ×0.57142857 ≈5.63357 ×0.5=2.816785.

5.63357 ×0.07142857≈0.4033 (approx).

So 0.57142857 part is 2.816785 +0.4033=3.220085.

So total E=16.90071 +3.220085=20.120795 GeV.

That's about 20.1208 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.63357 ×3.57142857 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact multiplication:

3.57142857 ×5.63357 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.63357.

Using a calculator approach:

3.57142857 ×5.63357 = ?

Let me write it as:

3.57142857 ×5.63357.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.63357 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.03357 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.03 =0.1071428571.

3.57142857 ×0.00357= approximately 0.01279.

So 0.03357 ×3.57142857 ≈0.1071428571 +0.01279=0.1199328571.

So 0.63357 ×3.57142857 =2.142857142 +0.1199328571=2.26279.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.26279=20.12 GeV.

So, approximately 20.12 GeV, so option C is 20.132, which is very close.

In that case, the answer must be option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required for a Lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) to reach a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus is Lithium-6 (Li-6), which has a mass of approximately \( 6.013 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.013 \times 0.931494 \approx 5.6011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 \approx 5.6011 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6011 \approx 20.0038 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation using the sum of nucleon masses
The problem may expect the use of the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons for the nucleus. For Li-6 (3 protons and 3 neutrons):

\[
m_{\text{proton}} = 1.007276 \, \text{u}, \quad m_{\text{neutron}} = 1.008664 \, \text{u}
\]
\[
m = 3 \times m_{\text{proton}} + 3 \times m_{\text{neutron}} = 3 \times 1.007276 + 3 \times 1.008664 = 6.04782 \, \text{u}
\]

The rest mass energy is then:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.04782 \times 0.931494 \approx 5.6336 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Using this value, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6336 \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The closest option to the calculated value of \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \) is **C) 20.132 GeV**. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or slight differences in the approximations used.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC required for the Li-6 nucleus to reach \( v = 0.96c \) is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

**Answer: C**
