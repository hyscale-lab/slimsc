Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

Oh wait, the main thing the question is about is the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Right, so I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of particles in levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio is n1/n2, or perhaps the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the temperature is lower, the ratio goes down. Let me think about what that implies.

Wait, the observed ratio is the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2. Let's denote this ratio as R = (n1)/(n2). According to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, R is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but E2 is higher than E1 because the transition is from a lower to higher energy or higher to lower? The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near-infrared. I think Ti lines are often in the UV or optical, but maybe this transition is specific. But for the purposes of this problem, I don't think the exact wavelength is too critical beyond calculating the energy difference.

So, the energy difference ΔE between the two levels can be found using the wavelength λ of the emitted photon. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

So, let's compute ΔE. Wait, but wait: when the transition occurs from level 2 to level 1, the photon emitted has energy E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So, ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/(λ)

But in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is positive when E2 > E1, which would make the ratio R increase if temperature increases, but wait, let me check:

Wait, in the Boltzmann factor:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So, when T increases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases because the denominator kT is larger, so the exponential becomes smaller. Wait no, because as T increases, the exponent (-ΔE/(k T)) becomes less negative, which makes the exponential larger. Hmm. Let me think: for a higher T, the exponential increases because the denominator's magnitude is smaller, making the negative number less negative. So higher T leads to higher n2/n1 ratio. 

But in our problem, when the star has spots, the overall temperature (T_eff) is lower. So when the star has spots, T is 5500 K instead of 6000 K. So, what happens to the ratio R = n1/n2?

From the equation, R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, higher T would cause the exponent (ΔE / (k T)) to be smaller, so exp (ΔE/(kT)) would be smaller. So R would decrease as T increases. Wait, no. Wait, if T increases, (ΔE/(k T)) decreases because denominator is bigger. So exp of a smaller number approaches 1. So, if T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases, so R = (g1/g2) * [something that decreases], so R would decrease. 

Wait, but when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K). So for that scenario, the exponent is larger. So R would be bigger when T is lower. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that seems contradictory. 

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup. Let me clarify: the transition is between two levels. Let me denote level 1 as the lower energy and level 2 as the higher. So, when an atom is in level 2, it can emit a photon of wavelength 1448 Å to go to level 1. So, E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

In the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of n2 to n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So, when T is higher, this exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. So, higher T would make more atoms in the higher energy level, which means the ratio n1/n2 would be smaller.

So, when the star has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K). So, the ratio n1/n2 in that case would be higher than when T_eff is 6000 K. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. Hmm, that's confusing. 

Wait, no. The problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, R = n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, a lower T would lead to a higher R. So this is a contradiction. So perhaps I got the levels mixed up. Maybe the transition is from level 1 to level 2, meaning level 2 is higher in energy. So when the temperature is lower, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher because the numerator is more populated. 

But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that suggests that the ratio is actually lower when T is lower. Which would only happen if the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2. Wait, let me reread the question.

The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So the ratio is lower when T is lower. That seems counterintuitive, because according to the Boltzmann equation, n1 should be more populated than n2 when T is lower. Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating the effect.

Wait, let's consider the ratio R = n1/n2. According to Boltzmann,

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( +ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T increases, +ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp of that decreases, so R decreases. So, higher T leads to lower R. Lower T leads to higher R.

In the problem, when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so R should be higher. But the problem says that R decreases when the star has spots. So, this implies that when the star has spots, R is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, that's the opposite of our expectation based on the Boltzmann equation. So, this suggests that perhaps the way the ratio is presented is the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the ratio is defined.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. Let me check the question again. The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" and that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases.

Wait, in that case, if the ratio is n2/n1, then a lower T would imply higher n2/n1 ratio. Because when T is lower, the term exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) becomes larger, so n2/n1 increases.

So, if when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n2/n1 is higher, but the question says the ratio decreases. Hmm, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the ratio is indeed n1/n2, and that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, that would mean that exp(ΔE/(k T)) is lower when T is lower, which can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the energy levels. Maybe the transition is from a higher energy level to a lower one, so the photon emitted is of wavelength 1448 Å, which is longer than visible light. That would mean that the energy difference ΔE is smaller. But regardless, the sign of the exponent depends on the direction of the transition.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy difference first.

Given the wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-6 meters.

The energy per photon is E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant: approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-6) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-6) ≈ approx 1.372e-19 J per photon.

But to get this in terms of eV, since k is often expressed in eV/K units. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J.

So, E ≈ 1.372e-19 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 0.856 eV.

So, ΔE = 0.856 eV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute that precisely.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value).

c = 299792458 m/s.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

E = (h * c) / λ = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / 1.448e-7 

Let me compute numerator first: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ approximately 8.56 eV.

Wait, wait a second, that can't be right. Because 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J is about 8.56 eV. Because 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 = approx 8.57.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Ti has atomic transitions but 8.5 eV is way too high. Wait, perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

E = (h * c ) / λ.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So, h*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 = approx 8.57 eV.

Hmm, 8.57 eV is like about 1000 times the ionization energy of Ti. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the ionization potential of Ti is about 6.9 eV, so 8.5 eV would be sufficient to ionize Ti. But wait, the problem states that we're dealing with neutral atoms, so perhaps the transition is between two excited states. Well, perhaps it's a mistake, but perhaps I should proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference can also be calculated using E = hc/(λ), but perhaps I should use the Rydberg constant or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the energy in terms of the temperature in the exponent.

Wait, but regardless, perhaps I can relate the temperature to the ratio. Let's proceed.

So, the ratio R = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But wait, E2 is higher than E1, so E2 - E1 = ΔE.

So, R = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is R_no_spots / R_spots.

So, factor = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T_no)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T_spots)) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so factor = exp( ΔE/(k T_no) - ΔE/(k T_spots) )

Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/T_no - 1/T_spots] )

Wait, but wait: ΔE is in J, k is Boltzmann constant in J/K. So, the exponent would be unitless.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using the ratio in terms of the temperatures.

Alternatively, let me compute this using the ratio:

The factor = exp( (ΔE/k) [ (1/T_no) - (1/T_spots) ] )

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That is, R_spots = R_no_spots * factor, where factor is less than 1. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, no, the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots. So, if R decreases when the star has spots, then R_spots < R_no_spots, so factor > 1.

So, the factor is how many times bigger R is when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

So, we need to compute this factor.

But let's compute the required exponent.

First, compute ΔE/(k) in terms of 1/T.

Given:

T_no = 6000 K

T_spots = 5500 K

ΔE = 8.56 eV.

Wait, but k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So, k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approximately 99355 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

8.56 / 8.617e-5 = 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ let's see:

0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

So, 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = approximately 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.56 * (1 / 0.00008617) ≈ 8.56 * 11604.2 ≈ 8.56 * 11604 ≈ let me compute 8 * 11604 = 92832, 0.56 * 11604 ≈ 6500, so total approx 99332 K.

Hmm, so ΔE/(k) ≈ 99332 K.

Now, compute [1/T_no - 1/T_spots] = (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

So, 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.

So, the exponent is (99332 K) * (0.000015151 K^-1) = approx 99332 * 0.000015151 ≈ let's compute:

99332 * 0.000015 = 1.49 (approx). Let's compute exact:

0.000015151 = 1.5151e-5.

99332 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 99332 * 1.5151e-5.

Compute 99332 * 1.5151e-5:

99332 ≈ 9.9332e4.

Multiply by 1.5151e-5: 9.9332e4 * 1.5151e-5 = 9.9332 * 1.5151e-1 ≈ (approx 15) * (0.1) = 1.5.

Wait, 9.9332 * 1.5151 is about 15.03. So 15.03e-1 is 1.503.

So, the exponent is approx 1.503.

So, the factor is exp(1.503) ≈ e^1.503.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648, so e^1.5 is approx 4.48.

But wait, 1.503 is very close to 1.5, so e^1.503 is about ~4.5.

So, the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So, the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by:

\[
R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{R_{\text{no spots}}}{R_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy difference \(\Delta E\)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), the energy of the photon is:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the factor
The temperatures are \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The Boltzmann constant in eV/K is \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). The term \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\) is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99332 \, \text{K}.
\]

The difference in inverse temperatures is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right) = (99332)(0.0001515) \approx 1.503.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.503) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

Oh wait, the main thing the question is about is the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Right, so I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of particles in levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio is n1/n2, or perhaps the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the temperature is lower, the ratio goes down. Let me think about what that implies.

Wait, the observed ratio is the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2. Let's denote this ratio as R = (n1)/(n2). According to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, R is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but E2 is higher than E1 because the transition is from a lower to higher energy or higher to lower? The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near-infrared. I think Ti lines are often in the UV or optical, but maybe this transition is specific. But for the purposes of this problem, I don't think the exact wavelength is too critical beyond calculating the energy difference.

So, the energy difference ΔE between the two levels can be found using the wavelength λ of the emitted photon. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

So, let's compute ΔE. Wait, but wait: when the transition occurs from level 2 to level 1, the photon emitted has energy E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So, ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/(λ)

But in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is positive when E2 > E1, which would make the ratio R increase if temperature increases, but wait, let me check:

Wait, in the Boltzmann factor:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So, when T increases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases because the denominator kT is larger, so the exponential becomes smaller. Wait no, because as T increases, the exponent (-ΔE/(k T)) becomes less negative, which makes the exponential larger. Hmm. Let me think: for a higher T, the exponential increases because the denominator's magnitude is smaller, making the negative number less negative. So higher T leads to higher n2/n1 ratio. 

But in our problem, when the star has spots, the overall temperature (T_eff) is lower. So when the star has spots, T is 5500 K instead of 6000 K. So, what happens to the ratio R = n1/n2?

From the equation, R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, higher T would cause the exponent (ΔE / (k T)) to be smaller, so exp (ΔE/(kT)) would be smaller. So R would decrease as T increases. Wait, no. Wait, if T increases, (ΔE/(k T)) decreases because denominator is bigger. So exp of a smaller number approaches 1. So, if T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases, so R = (g1/g2) * [something that decreases], so R would decrease. 

Wait, but when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K). So for that scenario, the exponent is larger. So R would be bigger when T is lower. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that seems contradictory. 

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup. Let me clarify: the transition is between two levels. Let me denote level 1 as the lower energy and level 2 as the higher. So, when an atom is in level 2, it can emit a photon of wavelength 1448 Å to go to level 1. So, E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

In the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of n2 to n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So, when T is higher, this exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. So, higher T would make more atoms in the higher energy level, which means the ratio n1/n2 would be smaller.

So, when the star has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K). So, the ratio n1/n2 in that case would be higher than when T_eff is 6000 K. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. Hmm, that's confusing. 

Wait, no. The problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, R = n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, a lower T would lead to a higher R. So this is a contradiction. So perhaps I got the levels mixed up. Maybe the transition is from level 1 to level 2, meaning level 2 is higher in energy. So when the temperature is lower, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher because the numerator is more populated. 

But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that suggests that the ratio is actually lower when T is lower. Which would only happen if the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2. Wait, let me reread the question.

The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So the ratio is lower when T is lower. That seems counterintuitive, because according to the Boltzmann equation, n1 should be more populated than n2 when T is lower. Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating the effect.

Wait, let's consider the ratio R = n1/n2. According to Boltzmann,

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( +ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T increases, +ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp of that decreases, so R decreases. So, higher T leads to lower R. Lower T leads to higher R.

In the problem, when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so R should be higher. But the problem says that R decreases when the star has spots. So, this implies that when the star has spots, R is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, that's the opposite of our expectation based on the Boltzmann equation. So, this suggests that perhaps the way the ratio is presented is the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the ratio is defined.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. Let me check the question again. The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" and that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases.

Wait, in that case, if the ratio is n2/n1, then a lower T would imply higher n2/n1 ratio. Because when T is lower, the term exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) becomes larger, so n2/n1 increases.

So, if when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n2/n1 is higher, but the question says the ratio decreases. Hmm, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the ratio is indeed n1/n2, and that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, that would mean that exp(ΔE/(k T)) is lower when T is lower, which can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the energy levels. Maybe the transition is from a higher energy level to a lower one, so the photon emitted is of wavelength 1448 Å, which is longer than visible light. That would mean that the energy difference ΔE is smaller. But regardless, the sign of the exponent depends on the direction of the transition.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy difference first.

Given the wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-6 meters.

The energy per photon is E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant: approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-6) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-6) ≈ approx 1.372e-19 J per photon.

But to get this in terms of eV, since k is often expressed in eV/K units. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J.

So, E ≈ 1.372e-19 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 0.856 eV.

So, ΔE = 0.856 eV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute that precisely.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value).

c = 299792458 m/s.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

E = (h * c) / λ = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / 1.448e-7 

Let me compute numerator first: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ approximately 8.56 eV.

Wait, wait a second, that can't be right. Because 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J is about 8.56 eV. Because 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 = approx 8.57.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Ti has atomic transitions but 8.5 eV is way too high. Wait, perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

E = (h * c ) / λ.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So, h*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 = approx 8.57 eV.

Hmm, 8.57 eV is like about 1000 times the ionization energy of Ti. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the ionization potential of Ti is about 6.9 eV, so 8.5 eV would be sufficient to ionize Ti. But wait, the problem states that we're dealing with neutral atoms, so perhaps the transition is between two excited states. Well, perhaps it's a mistake, but perhaps I should proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference can also be calculated using E = hc/(λ), but perhaps I should use the Rydberg constant or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the energy in terms of the temperature in the exponent.

Wait, but regardless, perhaps I can relate the temperature to the ratio. Let's proceed.

So, the ratio R = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But wait, E2 is higher than E1, so E2 - E1 = ΔE.

So, R = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is R_no_spots / R_spots.

So, factor = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T_no)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T_spots)) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so factor = exp( ΔE/(k T_no) - ΔE/(k T_spots) )

Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/T_no - 1/T_spots] )

Wait, but wait: ΔE is in J, k is Boltzmann constant in J/K. So, the exponent would be unitless.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using the ratio in terms of the temperatures.

Alternatively, let me compute this using the ratio:

The factor = exp( (ΔE/k) [ (1/T_no) - (1/T_spots) ] )

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That is, R_spots = R_no_spots * factor, where factor is less than 1. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, no, the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots. So, if R decreases when the star has spots, then R_spots < R_no_spots, so factor > 1.

So, the factor is how many times bigger R is when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

So, we need to compute this factor.

But let's compute the required exponent.

First, compute ΔE/(k) in terms of 1/T.

Given:

T_no = 6000 K

T_spots = 5500 K

ΔE = 8.56 eV.

Wait, but k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So, k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approximately 99355 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

8.56 / 8.617e-5 = 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ let's see:

0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

So, 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = approximately 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.56 * (1 / 0.00008617) ≈ 8.56 * 11604.2 ≈ 8.56 * 11604 ≈ let me compute 8 * 11604 = 92832, 0.56 * 11604 ≈ 6500, so total approx 99332 K.

Hmm, so ΔE/(k) ≈ 99332 K.

Now, compute [1/T_no - 1/T_spots] = (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

So, 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.

So, the exponent is (99332 K) * (0.000015151 K^-1) = approx 99332 * 0.000015151 ≈ let's compute:

99332 * 0.000015 = 1.49 (approx). Let's compute exact:

0.000015151 = 1.5151e-5.

99332 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 99332 * 1.5151e-5.

Compute 99332 * 1.5151e-5:

99332 ≈ 9.9332e4.

Multiply by 1.5151e-5: 9.9332e4 * 1.5151e-5 = 9.9332 * 1.5151e-1 ≈ (approx 15) * (0.1) = 1.5.

Wait, 9.9332 * 1.5151 is about 15.03. So 15.03e-1 is 1.503.

So, the exponent is approx 1.503.

So, the factor is exp(1.503) ≈ e^1.503.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648, so e^1.5 is approx 4.48.

But wait, 1.503 is very close to 1.5, so e^1.503 is about ~4.5.

So, the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So, the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by:

\[
R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{R_{\text{no spots}}}{R_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy difference \(\Delta E\)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), the energy of the photon is:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the factor
The temperatures are \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The Boltzmann constant in eV/K is \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). The term \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\) is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99332 \, \text{K}.
\]

The difference in inverse temperatures is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right) = (99332)(0.0001515) \approx 1.503.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.503) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
