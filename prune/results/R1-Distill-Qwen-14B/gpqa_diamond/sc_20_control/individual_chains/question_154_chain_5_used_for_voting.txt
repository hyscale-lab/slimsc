Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again.

The chemist found a white solid, and they've provided some spectral data. I need to determine which structure fits based on the given information.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%). Then there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, molecular weight is around 156. Let me think about the possible structures in the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let me calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Then substituting with Cl and OH... Let's see. Benzaldehyde is 122 g/mol (12*7 + 1*6 + 16*1 = 84 +6 +16=106? Wait, maybe I should calculate it correctly. Benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO. So C7H6O. Yeah, 7 carbons. 12*7=84, H6 is 6, O is 16. So 84+6+16=106. But with substituents: Cl is 35.5, OH is 17.

So if it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate: C7 is 84, H5 is 5, Cl 35.5, O2 is 32. So 84+5=89, plus 35.5 is 124.5, plus 32 is 156.5. So molecular weight around 156.5. Close enough to 156. 

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as option A? No, wait. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Wait, let me compute. Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. So molecular formula is C7H6O2. If it's 4-chloro, then substituting Cl for H, so it becomes C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O2=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So same as A.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The formula is C6H5CO-OCl. So that's C8H5ClO2. Let's see: 8*12=96, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O2=32. 96+5=101 +35.5=136.5 +32=168.5. So molecular weight would be about 168.5, which doesn't match the 156. So option C's molecular weight is higher than observed. But the molecular ion is at 156, so this might not be correct. Unless the data is different. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156. So option C's M is 168.5, which is higher. So perhaps option C is out.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula as B, just substitution on a different position. So same molecular weight as B: 156.5.

So all except C have molecular weight around 156. The molecular ion is 156, but wait, the m/z of 158 is another peak. Let's see. The molecular ion is at 156, and a peak at 158 is 32%. What could cause a peak at m/z 158? Maybe a Cl isotope? Chlorine has two main isotopes: 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So the molecular ion would primarily be at 156 (if the molecule has one Cl). Then, the isotopic pattern would have peaks at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). So the molecular ion would have a 3:1 ratio approximately (since 75% 35Cl, 25% 37Cl). So the molecular ion would appear as a doublet: 156 and 158. 

But in the data, the molecular ion is at 156 (100%) and a peak at 158 (32%). Wait, that's a problem. Because normally, the molecular ion would reflect the isotopic abundance. So if the molecule has one Cl atom, the M peak (35Cl) is at 156, and the next peak (37Cl) is at 158, with a ratio of 3:1. So the intensity of 156 should be about 75%, and 158 about 25% of the total. But in the given data, 156 is 100% and 158 is 32%. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Because if the M is 156, and the molecular formula includes one Cl, then the M+2 would be 158, and their ratio should be about 3:1. So the percentage for 156 would be 75% of the base peak, but wait, how is the data presented? The question says the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), so perhaps the data is normalized. So the 158 peak would be at 33% (since 25% of 156's 100% would be 25, but I'm not sure how the percentages are calculated. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has two Cl atoms. Then, the molecular ion would have more peaks. But in the options, only some have Cl: A, B, C (maybe), and D.

Wait, option C: phenyl chloroformate. Its molecular formula is C8H5ClO2. So one Cl. So M is 168.5. So the mass spec data of 156 is too low, so option C is out.

Looking back, options A, B, D have molecular weight around 156.5. So the molecular ion at 156 would correspond to the [M]^+ ion. But considering the Cl isotope, so the molecular ion would have a peak at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl) with a ratio of 3:1. But in the data, the 158 peak is at 32%, which is roughly a third. Wait, 32% is approximately 1/3, which is about 33%. So if the molecule has one Cl, then the ratio should be about 3:1. So the molecular ion peak at 156 (100%) would actually be a sum of the peaks; but wait, when you have isotopic peaks, the base peak is the most abundant. So the molecular ion would be the sum of both isotopes. So perhaps the molecular ion is a combination of 156 and 158, but the question says the molecular ion is at 156 (100%). Hmm. Maybe the way the data is presented is that 156 is the molecular ion (M) and 158 is M+2. So the intensity of 158 would be about 25% of M. Since 25% of 100% would be 25, but the data shows 32% at 158, which is a bit more than 25. So that's a bit confusing. But perhaps the molecular ion is 156, and the M+2 is 158. So the presence of Cl is supported.

Now looking at the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR are usually due to O-H stretching. So that suggests the presence of an hydroxyl group. But wait, the peak is broad and from 3500-2700. Wait, 3500-2700 is a large range. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde or ketone or something else. Wait, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. So that could be a carboxylic acid (but O-H would be broad), a ketone, aldehyde, or ester.

Wait, but the 1720 cm^-1 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid, which usually has a peak around 1700-1725. Wait, if the peak is at 1720, that supports a carboxylic acid. Also, if there's an O-H from a carboxylic acid, it would be a broad peak. Let me think: in the IR, the broad peak could be the O-H of a carboxylic acid. But wait, the problem says the IR has a broad peak from 3500 to 2700, which is a pretty wide range. That makes me think of an O-H stretch, but maybe it's from an alcohol or phenol. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide N-H, but that's less likely here.

Wait, another thought: O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid is usually very broad and around 2500-3300 cm^-1. So the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Wait, that's lower than usual for O-H. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde's O-H? No, aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, perhaps the peak is due to an alcohol or phenol group.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's a peak at 11.0 ppm, which is a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a very deshielded proton. That's usually indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), which typically appears around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but 11 is a bit higher. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. So that makes more sense. If the peak is at 11.0 ppm as a singlet, that suggests a carboxylic acid proton, as in a COOH group. Because in a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is usually a broad peak, but in the NMR, it appears as a singlet around 10-12 ppm, integrating for one H. 

So in the 1H NMR, the 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) suggests a carboxylic acid proton. That would align with options B and D, which are benzoic acids. Option A is a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group, so it would have an aldehyde proton at around 9-10 ppm. So if the NMR peak is at 11, it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is likely the COOH proton. Then, the other peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). These are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. These are likely aromatic protons. The coupling between the two doublets suggests they are in a para-substituted benzene ring.

So let's think about each option:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is Cl on carbon 3, OH on 2, and aldehyde on 1 (assuming numbering). So the aromatic protons would be in positions 4, 5, and 6. Wait, but the aldehyde is on position 1. So the benzaldehyde group is at position 1, Cl at 3, OH at 2. So the ring would have substituents at 1, 2, and 3. So the remaining protons are at positions 4,5,6. Wait, but that might not give a simple doublet pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene, you get two doublets, each integrating for two H. So if the substituents are in positions 2 and 5 (for example), but our structures have substituents in different positions.

Wait, considering the NMR data: two sets of doublets. Each has 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. So substituents in positions 1 and 3 would not give para substitution. Alternatively, substituents at positions 1 and 4 would be para. Wait, maybe the substituents are in positions where the aromatic ring is split into two doublets, each being two H.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure would be a benzoic acid with Cl at position 4. So the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. Then the remaining H are at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but how would that split the NMR? Let me draw it mentally. The COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. Then, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH. Positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl. So the H at 2 and 6 would be deshielded due to the COOH, while H at 3 and 5 would be deshielded due to Cl. But in benzoic acid, the protons ortho and para to COOH are deshielded. Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is at position 4, so it's para to COOH. So in the ring, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the H at 2,3,5,6. Let's see, the H at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, H at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. 

In such a scenario, the ortho protons to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would typically be deshielded, as the COOH is electron-withdrawing. The para to Cl (position 4) would have similar effects. Wait, but in the NMR data, there are two doublets. So perhaps the H at 2 and 6 are a doublet each, but that would require coupling. Alternatively, maybe they are split into two sets of doublets.

Wait, another approach: in para-substituted benzene rings, you often get two sets of doublets. For example, in para-substituted rings, the protons are split into two groups of two, each showing as a doublet. So maybe the substituents are in the para positions. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that create this pattern.

Wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are not para to each other. COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. So they are para. So the ring has substituents at 1 and 4, which are para. So then, the H in positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The H at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

But how would that affect the NMR? The H at 2 and 6 would be on either side of the COOH group. The H at 3 and 5 would be on either side of the Cl. So each pair would be equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. Therefore, the H at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the H at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So in the NMR, each pair would show as a doublet. So in the given data, the two doublets correspond to these two sets of protons.

So in the NMR, the 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) would correspond to the H ortho to COOH and the H ortho to Cl, respectively. The ortho protons to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like COOH) are deshielded and appear downfield. Cl is a weaker EWG, so the H ortho to Cl would be less downfield.

Wait, but COOH is a strong EWG, so the H at positions 2 and 6 would be more downfield than those at 3 and 5. So the higher ppm value (8.02) would correspond to H ortho to COOH, and the lower (7.72) to H ortho to Cl. 

So 8.02 would be H at 2 and 6, and 7.72 would be H at 3 and 5. That makes sense.

Now, looking at the IR data: the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Since this is a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be broad and around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But the given IR shows a broad peak from 3500 to 2700, which is a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps the peak is the O-H stretch. Maybe it's a broad peak centered around 3000 cm^-1, but the range is from 3500 down. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is not O-H but something else. Wait, another possibility: the broad peak could be an aldehyde's C-H stretch. Wait, no, aldehydes have a peak around 2800-2700 cm^-1, but that's not a broad peak. Alternatively, the 3500-2700 could be an amide N-H stretch, but that's unlikely here.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 could be an O-H from a phenol. Because phenol O-H is also broad, but usually around 3300 cm^-1. So if the molecule has a phenolic -OH, that would fit. But in the options, the only one with an -OH is option A (3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) and options B and D (which have COOH).

So if the structure is a carboxylic acid (like B or D), the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500, which might correspond to the given 3500-2700. Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination of O-H and other stretches. Hmm.

Now, the 1H NMR has a peak at 11.0 ppm, which is a singlet, 1H. That's consistent with a carboxylic acid, so moving towards options B and D.

Now, the molecular ion and the M+2 peak. For B and D, which have Cl and molecular weight 156.5, the molecular ion would be at 156 (M is 156 for 35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). The intensity ratio is about 3:1. So in the mass spec, the peak at 158 would be about 25% of the M peak. In the data, it's 32%, which is a bit higher than expected. Maybe it's an approximation, or maybe the instrument's detection isn't perfect. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has more than one Cl, but in this case, options B and D have one Cl each.

So taking that into account, which structure is more likely?

Looking at the NMR data for substituents. The 11.0 ppm is the COOH, so let's think about the other substituents.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The H at 2,6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl, and H at 3,5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option D), the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). Then, the H at 3,6 would be ortho to Cl, and H at 4,5 would be meta to Cl.

Wait, let's model the NMR shifts for each.

In para-substituted benzoic acids (like 4-chlorobenzoic acid), the ortho protons (to COOH) are more deshielded than meta. So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more downfield than the H ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). So in the NMR, the H at 2 and 6 would appear as a doublet at higher ppm (like 8.02), and H at 3 and 5 as a doublet at lower ppm (like 7.72). That matches the given data.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option D), the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). Then, H at 3 and 6 are ortho to Cl. H at 4 and 5 are meta to Cl and para to COOH. Wait, but in this case, the H at 3 and 6 would be ortho to Cl. Since Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, the ortho H would be deshielded. The H at 4 and 5 would be meta to Cl and para to COOH. But wait, the COOH is in position 1, so the H at 4 would be para to COOH, which is a strong EWG. Para protons to COOH are usually deshielded. So in this structure, the H at 4 (para to COOH) would be more downfield than H at 3 (ortho to Cl). So in the NMR, H at 4 would be a doublet at higher ppm, and H at 3 would be a doublet at lower ppm than that. But the given data shows two doublets: one at 8.02 and another at 7.72. So if in option D, the H at 4 (para to COOH) is more downfield than H at 3 (ortho to Cl), that would correspond to a higher ppm than the H at 3. But what about the coupling between these protons?

Alternatively, perhaps in option D, the H at 3 and 6 (ortho to Cl) are more deshielded than the H at 4 and 5 (para to COOH and meta to Cl). Because Cl is an EWG, the ortho H would be more downfield. So H at 3 and 6 would appear at higher ppm than H at 4 and 5.

Wait, in the NMR data, the higher ppm is 8.02, which would correspond to the more deshielded H. So if in option D, H at 3 and 6 are ortho to Cl, they would be more downfield (higher ppm) than the H at 4 and 5 (para to COOH). So the NMR would show a doublet at higher ppm (8.02) for H at 3 and 6, and a lower ppm (7.72) for H at 4 and 5. That also aligns with the given data.

So both options B and D fit the NMR data. How to distinguish between them?

Looking at the IR data again: the peak at 1720 cm^-1. In carboxylic acids, the carbonyl (C=O) stretch is typically around 1700-1725 cm^-1. So 1720 is a good match.

But wait, in the case of chloroformate (option C), which is not an option anymore due to molecular weight, the carbonyl would be from an ester group. Chloroformate esters have carbonyl peaks around 1750-1780 cm^-1. So if the carbonyl peak were higher, it might indicate an ester or acid chloride. Since the peak is at 1720, it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

So now, considering options B and D, which have the same molecular weight and similar spectral data, but different substitution patterns.

The 1H NMR shows two doublets. Let's think about the coupling. In a para-substituted benzene, the protons are equivalent in pairs and each has coupling to their adjacent protons. But in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the H at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and the H at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl. Each of these protons would be coupled with their adjacent H, leading to doublets.

In option D, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, substituents are at 1 and 2. The H at 3 and 6 would be ortho to Cl, and H at 4 and 5 would be para to COOH and meta to Cl. So each pair would be equivalent and would couple with adjacent H, leading to doublets.

But in both cases, the NMR would have two doublets. So how to distinguish between B and D?

Looking at the chemical shifts. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B), the H at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, which is a strong EWG. So these protons would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than the H at 3 and 5, which are ortho to Cl. So in the NMR, the higher ppm (8.02) would correspond to the H ortho to COOH, and the lower ppm (7.72) to the H ortho to Cl.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid (D), the H at 3 and 6 are ortho to Cl, which is an EWG. The H at 4 and 5 are para to COOH and meta to Cl. Para to COOH would make the H at 4 more deshielded than H at 3. So in this case, the H at 4 would appear at a higher ppm than H at 3. But the given data shows two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72, each integrating for 2H. So if option D is correct, the H at 4 and 5 (which are para to COOH and meta to Cl) would be split into a doublet at 8.02, and H at 3 and 6 (ortho to Cl) would be at 7.72. But that might not make sense because the para to COOH H would be more downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the H at 4 and 5 are affected differently. Let me think. COOH is at position 1, Cl at 2. So H at 3 is adjacent to Cl, and H at 4 is adjacent to nothing but para to COOH. H at 5 is adjacent to H at 4 and across from Cl. Hmmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the downfield shift is larger for the H ortho to Cl than the H para to COOH. Wait, Cl is a weaker EWG compared to COOH. So the H ortho to Cl would be deshielded but not as much as those ortho to COOH. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B), the H ortho to COOH (2 and 6) are more downfield than H ortho to Cl (3 and 5). So the NMR would show a higher ppm for 2 and 6, lower for 3 and 5. So the given data has 8.02 and 7.72, which fits this scenario.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid (D), the H ortho to Cl (3 and 6) would be more downfield than H para to COOH (4 and 5). So the NMR would show H 3 and 6 at higher ppm than H 4 and 5. But in the data, the higher ppm is 8.02, which would correspond to H 3 and 6. Thus, the lower ppm (7.72) would be H 4 and 5. But how would the shifts compare between ortho to Cl and para to COOH? COOH is a stronger EWG, so H para to COOH (position 4) would be more downfield than H ortho to Cl (position 3). So in option D, H 4 would be more downfield than H 3. So the NMR would have H 4 at higher ppm than H 3. But the data has the two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72, which are both higher ppm than those in option B.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should compare the expected NMR shifts for each structure.

Looking for benzoic acid derivatives:

In para-substituted benzoic acids, the H ortho to COOH are typically more downfield than the H meta to COOH. For example, in benzoic acid itself, the ortho H are around 8.0-8.1 ppm, and the meta H around 7.5-7.6 ppm.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is para to COOH. The H ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than the H meta to COOH (positions 3 and 5), but the Cl substituent would also influence the H at positions 3 and 5.

Alternatively, perhaps in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would be more downfield than the H at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because Cl is a weaker EWG than COOH. So the H ortho to Cl would be more deshielded than H meta to Cl but less than H ortho to COOH.

Wait, let me think of an example. In chlorobenzoic acids, the substituent effects can be a bit complex. For instance, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl at the para position to COOH would have a de-shielding effect on the H at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl), but the COOH group would have a stronger de-shielding effect on H at 2 and 6.

So in this case, the H at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be more downfield than the H at 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl). Thus, their NMR signals would be at higher ppm. So the 8.02 ppm would correspond to H 2 and 6, and 7.72 to H 3 and 5.

Looking at the options, that would suggest option B is correct.

Now, looking back at the mass spec: the molecular ion is 156, which is M for 35Cl. The M+2 is 158 (37Cl), and the ratio is 3:1. The data has 32% at 158, which is approximately a third. So 32% is about 33%, which is roughly 1/3 of 100% (M). So the 3:1 ratio would give M as 35Cl (75%) and M+2 as 37Cl (25%). But the data presents M as 100% and M+2 as 32%. Hmm, that doesn't align with the expected 3:1 ratio. How can this be?

Wait, perhaps the molecular ion is the sum of both isotopes? So the total ion current would be 75% (35Cl) plus 25% (37Cl), so the M peak would be 100% when normalized, because 75% +25% =100%. But in the data, M is at 156 (100%) and M+2 at 158 (32%). Wait, that doesn't make sense because if M is the sum of both, then M would be 100%, and M+2 would be 32% of the M peak? Or is the 32% of the total?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the data is presented as the percentage of each peak relative to the total. So the M is 156 (100%) and M+2 is 158 (32%). So the ratio would be about 100:32, which is roughly 3:1. Because 100/32 ≈3.125, which is close to 3:1. So that makes sense. So the presence of Cl is confirmed.

So putting it all together:

- The molecular weight is consistent with options B and D.
- The IR shows a strong carbonyl around 1720 cm^-1, supporting a carboxylic acid.
- The broad peak in IR is likely the O-H of the carboxylic acid.
- The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, consistent with COOH.
- The NMR aromatic protons are two doublets, which fits a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The substituents are Cl and COOH in para positions, as in option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).
- The mass spec data supports one Cl atom, with the correct isotopic ratio.

So the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)** and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggest a molecular weight of approximately 156 and the presence of a single chlorine atom, as the isotopic ratio of chlorine (35Cl:37Cl = 3:1) aligns with the observed data. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from **3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, likely due to an O-H stretch, and a strong sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹**, consistent with a carboxylic acid carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR data includes a singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)**, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)**, indicative of aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This structure contains an aldehyde group (-CHO) and a hydroxyl group (-OH). The aldehyde proton would typically appear around 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR, but the observed singlet at 11.0 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. Additionally, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ does not match the expected aldehyde C=O stretch (~1720 cm⁻¹ for aldehydes, but this is less typical). Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This structure features a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position. The molecular weight matches the given data, and the IR and NMR spectra align well with this structure. The singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm match the aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The mass spec data also supports the presence of one chlorine atom.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   The molecular weight of phenyl chloroformate is significantly higher (~168.5), which does not match the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156. This option is eliminated based on the molecular weight discrepancy.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This structure contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the ortho position. While the molecular weight matches, the NMR data does not align with this structure. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would not produce two distinct doublets as observed. Instead, the substitution pattern would result in a different splitting pattern, making this option unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular weight, IR, NMR, and mass spec, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular weight matches, the IR and NMR spectra align with the structure, and the substitution pattern explains the observed aromatic proton splitting.
