Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is about stars with dark spots and how they affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

Alright, let's break down what's given. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So spots are making the star appear cooler overall.

The part I'm more interested in is the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has no spots, the ratio is higher, but when it has spots, the ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, lower. So the factor would be the ratio when no spots divided by when spots are present.

But wait, how does temperature affect the energy levels of atoms? Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)).

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Let me calculate the energy difference between the two levels. Wavelength λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters. Using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

Calculating E: h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c = 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

But to get this in electron volts (eV), since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV. Wait, that seems high. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, wait. Because in the Boltzmann factor, we use the energy difference between the two levels. But another approach is to compute the energy in terms of temperature using the relation E = k * T * theta, where theta is some characteristic temperature parameter. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation involving the thermal energy kT.

Wait, let me think. The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/(λ). So I can compute ΔE and then find the ratio for each temperature.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels. But if the statistical weights are the same, which I don't know, but the problem doesn't mention them, so perhaps they are the same, so the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann distribution is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). If E2 > E1, then (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1.

If the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which implies that the temperature is lower. So when T decreases, the exponential term decreases, making n1/n2 smaller. So when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't (6000 K). So the factor is ratio_no_spots / ratio_spots.

So to find the factor, we need to compute (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Assuming that the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same, which I think the problem doesn't specify any difference, so perhaps we can assume they cancel out.

So (n1/n2) proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the ratio when no spots, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

The ratio when spots, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Factor = R1/R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

= exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, because 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1 since T2=5500 < T1=6000.

So compute that exponent.

But let me compute ΔE in terms of k*T. Because ΔE = hc/(lambda) ≈ hc/(lambda), and k is Boltzmann's constant.

So the exponent becomes [ (hc/(lambda k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Wait, let's compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) * hc/(lambda k )

First, compute 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000) approximately.

1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1

1/6000 ≈ 1.666e-4 K^-1

Difference is about 1.52e-5 K^-1.

Then, compute hc/(lambda k )

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So hc/(lambda k ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = (1.448 *1.38) e-30 = approx 1.997e-30 J·m.

Wait, wait, no. 1.448e-7 m multiplied by 1.38e-23 J/K gives 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-7-23 = 1.997 *1e-30 = 1.997e-30.

So hc/(lambda k ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.997e-30 ) = approx 1e5 (since 1.9878 / 1.997 is ~1, and 1e-25 /1e-30 is 1e5). So about 1e5 K.

Wait, that's 100,000 K.

So putting it all together, the exponent is (1e5 K) * (1.52e-5 K^-1 )

Calculate 1e5 * 1.52e-5 = 1.52.

So the exponent is 1.52. So exp(1.52) is approximately e^1.52.

e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.52 is somewhere around 4.57?

Alternatively, exact calculation:

1.52 is 1.5 + 0.02.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.02 ≈ 1.0202.

Multiply 4.4817 * 1.0202 ≈ 4.572.

So the factor is approximately 4.57.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close. So the factor is around 4.5.

Wait, but wait, I thought the exponent was 1.52, so exp(1.52) is about 4.57. So the factor is approximately 4.57. So the closest option is C) ~4.5.

Another way to think: If without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower, so the factor is (R1/R2) which is about 4.5 times higher.

So the answer should be C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations, \( n_1/n_2 \), is proportional to \( \exp(-\Delta E / kT) \), where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = hc / \lambda \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light, we calculate \( \Delta E \) in joules and convert it to electron volts (eV). The energy difference is approximately \( \Delta E \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV} \).

The Boltzmann factor depends on the temperature. When the star has no spots, the effective temperature is \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when it has spots, the effective temperature decreases to \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{(n_1/n_2)_{\text{no spots}}}{(n_1/n_2)_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{\exp(-\Delta E / kT_1)}{\exp(-\Delta E / kT_2)} = \exp\left(\Delta E / k \cdot \left(1/T_2 - 1/T_1\right)\right).
\]

First, calculate \( 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 \):
\[
1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.666 \times 10^{-4} = 1.52 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Next, calculate \( \Delta E / k \):
\[
\Delta E / k = \frac{hc}{\lambda k} \approx \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{(1448 \times 10^{-10})(1.38 \times 10^{-23})} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, compute the exponent:
\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(1/T_2 - 1/T_1\right) = (1 \times 10^5) \cdot (1.52 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.52.
\]

Finally, calculate \( \exp(1.52) \):
\[
\exp(1.52) \approx 4.57.
\]

Thus, the factor by which the ratio decreases when the star has spots is approximately \( 4.57 \). The closest option is **C) ~4.5**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is about stars with dark spots and how they affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

Calculating E: h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c = 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

But to get this in electron volts (eV), since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV. Wait, that seems high. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, wait. Because in the Boltzmann factor, we use the energy difference between the two levels. But another approach is to compute the energy in terms of temperature using the relation E = k * T * theta, where theta is some characteristic temperature parameter. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation involving the thermal energy kT.

Wait, let me think. The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/(λ). So I can compute ΔE and then find the ratio for each temperature.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels. But if the statistical weights are the same, which I don't know, but the problem doesn't mention them, so perhaps they are the same, so the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann distribution is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). If E2 > E1, then (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1.

If the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which implies that the temperature is lower. So when T decreases, the exponential term decreases, making n1/n2 smaller. So when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't (6000 K). So the factor is ratio_no_spots / ratio_spots.

So to find the factor, we need to compute (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Assuming that the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same, which I think the problem doesn't specify any difference, so perhaps we can assume they cancel out.

So (n1/n2) proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the ratio when no spots, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

The ratio when spots, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Factor = R1/R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

= exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, because 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1 since T2=5500 < T1=6000.

So compute that exponent.

But let me compute ΔE in terms of k*T. Because ΔE = hc/(lambda) ≈ hc/(lambda), and k is Boltzmann's constant.

So the exponent becomes [ (hc/(lambda k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Wait, let's compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) * hc/(lambda k )

First, compute 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000) approximately.

1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1

1/6000 ≈ 1.666e-4 K^-1

Difference is about 1.52e-5 K^-1.

Then, compute hc/(lambda k )

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So hc/(lambda k ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = (1.448 *1.38) e-30 = approx 1.997e-30 J·m.

Wait, wait, no. 1.448e-7 m multiplied by 1.38e-23 J/K gives 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-7-23 = 1.997 *1e-30 = 1.997e-30.

So hc/(lambda k ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.997e-30 ) = approx 1e5 (since 1.9878 / 1.997 is ~1, and 1e-25 /1e-30 is 1e5). So about 1e5 K.

Wait, that's 100,000 K.

So putting it all together, the exponent is (1e5 K) * (1.52e-5 K^-1 )

Calculate 1e5 * 1.52e-5 = 1.52.

So the exponent is 1.52. So exp(1.52) is approximately e^1.52.

e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.52 is somewhere around 4.57?

Alternatively, exact calculation:

1.52 is 1.5 + 0.02.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.02 ≈ 1.0202.

Multiply 4.4817 * 1.0202 ≈ 4.572.

So the factor is approximately 4.57.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close. So the factor is around 4.5.

Wait, but wait, I thought the exponent was 1.52, so exp(1.52) is about 4.57. So the factor is approximately 4.57. So the closest option is C) ~4.5.

Another way to think: If without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower, so the factor is (R1/R2) which is about 4.5 times higher.

So the answer should be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations, \( n_1/n_2 \), is proportional to \( \exp(-\Delta E / kT) \), where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = hc / \lambda \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light, we calculate \( \Delta E \) in joules and convert it to electron volts (eV). The energy difference is approximately \( \Delta E \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV} \).

The Boltzmann factor depends on the temperature. When the star has no spots, the effective temperature is \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when it has spots, the effective temperature decreases to \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{(n_1/n_2)_{\text{no spots}}}{(n_1/n_2)_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{\exp(-\Delta E / kT_1)}{\exp(-\Delta E / kT_2)} = \exp\left(\Delta E / k \cdot \left(1/T_2 - 1/T_1\right)\right).
\]

First, calculate \( 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 \):
\[
1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.666 \times 10^{-4} = 1.52 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Next, calculate \( \Delta E / k \):
\[
\Delta E / k = \frac{hc}{\lambda k} \approx \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{(1448 \times 10^{-10})(1.38 \times 10^{-23})} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, compute the exponent:
\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(1/T_2 - 1/T_1\right) = (1 \times 10^5) \cdot (1.52 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.52.
\]

Finally, calculate \( \exp(1.52) \):
\[
\exp(1.52) \approx 4.57.
\]

Thus, the factor by which the ratio decreases when the star has spots is approximately \( 4.57 \). The closest option is **C) ~4.5**.

Answer: C
