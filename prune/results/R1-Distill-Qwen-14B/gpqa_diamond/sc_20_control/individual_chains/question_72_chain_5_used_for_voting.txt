Okay, so I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product 4 of this reaction sequence. Hmm, I remember that each step involves some kind of organic reaction, so I have to go through each step carefully to visualize the structure.

Let me start by breaking down each part.

The first step is combining 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and elevated temperature suggests some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like a norbornane structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So that's a bulky group attached.

The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group. So each is a CH2Br2 group attached to the cyclohexadiene ring.

When 2 equivalents of this are used, maybe each of the dienophile's CH2Br2 groups reacts with the norbornene structure. Since sodium iodide is present, perhaps it's an elimination reaction, or maybe a substitution?

Wait, the norbornene has a diene. It's a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a conjugated diene. The other compound is a diene as well: cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Oh, wait, I think this could be a Diels-Alder reaction. The norbornene is a diene, and the other molecule is a dienophile? Or maybe the other way around. Let me think. The dienophile is usually something electron-deficient, like a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups.

In this case, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two substituents at 5 and 6 positions, each being a dibromomethyl group. The CH2Br2 is a good electron-withdrawing group because of the two bromines. So that makes the cyclohexadiene a good dienophile.

So the norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) would act as the diene, and the cyclohexadiene with Br groups would be the dienophile.

Since there are two equivalents of the dienophile, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur. Each dienophile would add to the norbornene structure.

Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic diene. How does the Diels-Alder proceed here? The norbornene has two double bonds, but wait, no, it's hepta-2,5-diene, which is a conjugated diene between carbons 2 and 3, and 5 and 6. So it's a conjugated diene in a bicyclic structure.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene must be conjugated and the dienophile has a conjugated double bond. So the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the dienophile because it has the EWG substituents.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile here is the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups on carbons 5 and 6.

So when the Diels-Alder occurs, the diene (norbornene) would attack the dienophile (cyclohexadiene derivative). Each dienophile can react twice since there are two equivalents. So maybe two Diels-Alder adducts form, each adding a dienophile to the norbornene.

But wait, the norbornene has two double bonds. Hmm, actually, no, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a structure where the bicyclo has two double bonds? Or is it a single conjugated diene in a bicyclic system?

Wait, I think the structure is such that there are two double bonds. Let me try to sketch it.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene: the structure has two rings, a bridge structure, and double bonds at 2 and 5 positions. So, the molecule has a norbornene structure with two double bonds: between C2-C3 and C5-C6. So, a conjugated diene in a bicyclic system.

So when Diels-Alder occurs, each of these double bonds can react. But since there are two equivalents of the dienophile, maybe each double bond of the norbornene reacts with one dienophile.

Wait, but each dienophile is a cyclohexadiene derivative. So each dienophile would add across a double bond of the norbornene, forming a six-membered transition state.

But wait, the norbornene might have two double bonds, but after the first Diels-Alder reaction, perhaps it's only the endo rule that one would proceed. Alternatively, maybe each dienophile adds to the same double bond? No, that doesn't make sense because each dienophile would have to react on a separate site.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene's double bonds are in positions that each can react with the dienophiles. But wait, the norbornene has only one conjugated diene system, right? So it has two double bonds that are conjugated. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the numbering might be such that the double bonds are not conjugated. Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So the structure is like a bridge where the double bonds are at positions 2-3 and 5-6. So they are not conjugated, but are isolated double bonds.

Wait, no, in bicyclo systems, the numbering can make the double bonds conjugated. For example, in norbornene, the bridgehead positions are 1, 2, and 7. The double bonds are between 2 and 3, and 5 and 6. So they are conjugated through the bridge.

So the norbornene is a conjugated diene, which can act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. So each molecule of the dienophile (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would react with the norbornene.

But there are two equivalents of dienophile, so maybe two Diels-Alder reactions happen, each adding a dienophile to the norbornene.

Wait, but norbornene has two double bonds as diene parts? Or is it a single conjugated diene. I think it's a single conjugated diene, so each equivalent of dienophile would add to one of the double bonds, but wait, each norbornene molecule has two double bonds. Wait, no, no, the norbornene molecule has two double bonds, but each is part of a conjugated system. So maybe each double bond can react with a dienophile. But since each dienophile has two reactive sites (the dibromomethyl groups are on positions 5 and 6, which are adjacent to the diene), perhaps each dienophile can add twice? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) has two substituent groups which are dibromomethyl. So when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, each of these substituents is in a position that can react.

Wait, maybe the Diels-Alder reaction is such that the dienophile (cyclohexadiene) is attacked by the diene (norbornene), leading to a six-membered transition state. But the dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups on adjacent carbons (5 and 6), which are part of the diene. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, the two substituents would end up in positions on the adduct.

Wait, perhaps each dienophile will form two separate adducts, but with two equivalents, each dienophile will add once, giving two adducts on the norbornene. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try an alternative approach.

After the reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. That probably involves some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, maybe elimination or ring-opening.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, but DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. Wait, more accurately, SO3 is often used for sulfonation, but in the presence of pyridine, maybe it's acting as a catalyst or to absorb the H2SO4 produced. Alternatively, another possibility is that it's a sulfonating reaction where a sulfonic acid group is introduced.

Wait, but DMSO is a solvent that can also act as an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonation reaction where a hydroxyl group is converted to a sulfonic acid group. But why would product 2 have hydroxyl groups?

Wait, let me think about the first reaction. If the Diels-Alder adds a dienophile to the norbornene, the adduct would have a six-membered ring with substituents. The dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups; in the Diels-Alder, these would become endo substituents.

Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction adds the dienophile to the diene, forming a six-membered cyclic structure. The substituents on the dienophile (CH2Br2) would end up in the endo position on the adduct.

So after the Diels-Alder, each dienophile adds two CH2Br2 groups to the norbornene structure. But wait, no, each dienophile has two substituents, but in the Diels-Alder, each substituent is on a different carbon of the dienophile.

Wait, the dienophile is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with CH2Br2 groups on carbons 5 and 6. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, the dienophile would add to the diene, and the substituents would end up in the bridge positions of the adduct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps each Diels-Alder adds a dienophile to the norbornene, leading to a larger bicyclic structure with substituents.

Wait, another thought: the norbornene has a tert-butoxy group. That's a bulky group. When the Diels-Alder occurs, the endo rule suggests that the substituents (the CH2Br2 groups) would be placed towards the bridgehead, perhaps.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structure of product 1. Maybe I should think about what each subsequent step does.

After product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, which is a strong acid. Acid often leads to elimination reactions, especially if there are leaving groups present. So if product 1 has bromine substituents, perhaps they are eliminated. Wait, but product 1 comes from a Diels-Alder reaction, which forms new sigma bonds. So perhaps the Diels-Alder product has bromine substituents adjacent to a leaving group, or maybe not.

Wait, the dienophile has CH2Br2 groups. When the Diels-Alder occurs, the substituents would be in a certain position. So in product 1, the substituents from the dienophile would be attached to the adduct. So each dienophile adds two CH2Br2 groups to the norbornene.

But then, when product 1 is treated with H2SO4, maybe the Br groups are replaced by something else. Wait, but in the first step, we have two equivalents of the dienophile and sodium iodide. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, sodium iodide in the presence of dienophiles with Br groups—could it lead to a substitution reaction? For example, the Br in the dienophile is replaced by iodide via an SN2 mechanism. So each CH2Br2 group might become CH2I2. But that doesn't make much sense, as iodide is a good nucleophile, and Br is a better leaving group than iodide. Wait, no, iodide is a better nucleophile, but in substitution reactions, the leaving group must be good. So perhaps it's a Finkelstein reaction, where Br is replaced by I.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile's Br groups are replaced during the reaction. So product 1 would have CH2I2 groups instead of CH2Br2.

But then, when treated with H2SO4, perhaps these iodides are eliminated. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder reaction is followed by elimination. Wait, but Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition, forming a six-membered ring as a bicyclic structure.

Wait, maybe product 1 has bromides in positions that are adjacent to each other, leading to a possibility of elimination when treated with acid. So aqueous H2SO4 could protonate a leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromides are part of a vicinal dihalide, which upon treatment with acid would undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond.

So if product 1 has two adjacent CH2Br2 groups, then in product 2, elimination would occur, forming a double bond.

Wait, but the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the substituents are on adjacent carbons (5 and 6), which are part of the diene. So in the Diels-Alder adduct, those substituents would be on adjacent positions, which could lead to a vicinal dihalide.

So after the Diels-Alder, product 1 has two adjacent CH2Br groups on the adduct. Then, treatment with aqueous H2SO4 (acid) would cause elimination, forming a double bond. So product 2 would have a new double bond where the two Brs were.

But wait, each dienophile has two CH2Br groups, so each would contribute two Brs, but if two dienophiles are added, per the two equivalents, then product 1 would have four Br substituents?

Wait, perhaps each Diels-Alder adds two Br groups. For each dienophile, two Brs are added? No, I think each dienophile has two substituents, each with two Brs. Wait, no, each substituent is CH2Br2, so each has two Br atoms.

Wait, the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the substituents are at carbons 5 and 6, each being CH2Br2. So each dienophile has four Br atoms. When it reacts, maybe each Br is retained, but in a different position.

But when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the diene (norbornene) would attack the dienophile's double bond, leading to a cycloadduct where the substituents (the CH2Br2 groups) are in specific positions.

But perhaps the key is that after the Diels-Alder and the subsequent acid treatment, some of the Brs are eliminated, forming double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder adduct has the CH2Br2 groups in positions that are adjacent, so upon treatment with acid, they eliminate to form a double bond, releasing HBr.

So, for product 2, each original dienophile's substituents have been converted into a double bond. So each dienophile's Brs are eliminated, leading to a conjugated diene in the molecule.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, but DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. Wait, but in the presence of pyridine, which is a base, perhaps it's a sulfonation reaction where a hydroxyl group is converted into a sulfonic acid group.

Wait, but if product 2 has a double bond, perhaps some hydroxyl groups are present. Alternatively, maybe the acid treatment in step 2 introduces hydroxyl groups.

Wait, step 1: Diels-Alder forms product 1 with Br substituents. Step 2: treatment with H2SO4, which could cause elimination of HBr, forming double bonds. So product 2 would have double bonds where the Brs were.

Then, product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. Hmm, but SO3 is a strong dehydrating agent and can also be used for sulfonation. Wait, perhaps in this case, it's a sulfonation of an aromatic ring, but product 2 doesn't have an aromatic ring. Alternatively, if product 2 has an alcohol group, SO3 would convert it into a sulfonate ester.

Wait, but product 2 might have some dihydroxyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in step 2 forms some diol, which in step 3 is sulfonated.

Alternatively, if product 2 has alkenes, maybe the treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO is for some kind of addition or epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: SO3 in pyridine and DMSO could be used for the sulfonation of an aromatic ring. But product 2 doesn't have an aromatic ring unless some ring formation occurred in an earlier step.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a sulfonated version of product 2. Let me think: after product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, product 3 is formed. Maybe a hydroxyl group is converted into a sulfonic acid group.

But wait, if product 2 has a hydroxyl group, then treatment with SO3 would convert it into a sulfonate. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, in some cases, DMSO can act as an oxidizing agent, especially with SO3, leading to sulfonation.

Then, product 3 is heated at 150°C, forming the final product 4. Heating could lead to various reactions, such as elimination, rearrangement, or decomposition. But perhaps in this case, it leads to the loss of a sulfonic acid group or some ring-forming reaction.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps again, perhaps more clearly.

1. Diels-Alder reaction between norbornene and two equivalents of the dienophile. Each dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups. So product 1 would have four CH2Br2 groups attached to the norbornene structure.

Wait, no, each dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups. When two equivalents are used, perhaps each dienophile adds two substituents to the norbornene. But norbornene is a diene, so each equivalent of dienophile can add two substituents? Or perhaps each dienophile adds once, contributing two substituents.

Hmm, perhaps each dienophile adds to a double bond, contributing two substituents. So two dienophiles would add four substituents.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the Diels-Alder product. The Diels-Alder forms a six-membered ring with substituents from the dienophile. Each dienophile has two substituents, so each molecule would have those substituents in specific positions.

But I'm not seeing the exact structure. Maybe I should move on and think about what the final product would look like.

After all steps, including sulfonation and heating, the product 4 is formed. The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Assuming that the final step is elimination or ring formation, perhaps product 4 is a fused ring system with multiple substituents.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Maybe I should think of the possibilities.

The options are 4, 7, 8, or 10 distinct H atoms. 

Assuming that product 4 is a highly symmetrical structure, the number of distinct H's would be lower. For example, if it's a norbornene derivative with multiple substituents, but in symmetrical positions.

Wait, norbornene has a bridge structure. If substituents are placed symmetrically, the number of distinct H's could be lower.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I can think of another approach. Let me consider the steps again.

The initial molecule is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The tert-butoxy group is bulky. Then, two equivalents of the dienophile are added via Diels-Alder, leading to product 1.

Product 1, upon treatment with H2SO4, eliminates some groups to form product 2, perhaps introducing new double bonds.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3, which is then heated to form product 4.

If I imagine that each step adds substituents and then removes some, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a certain number of rings and substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with multiple substituents, and I need to count the distinct H environments.

But perhaps the final product has multiple rings, each with unique substituents leading to distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cage-like structure with multiple substituents, leading to several unique H environments.

Wait, another approach: each step adds or removes certain groups, which affect the symmetry of the molecule, thereby influencing the number of distinct H atoms.

The starting material is a bicyclic structure with a tert-butoxy group. Then, after Diels-Alder, substituents are added, which might break some symmetry. Then, elimination could form new rings or double bonds, again affecting symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm having trouble. Maybe I can think of it in terms of the number of steps and what each could do.

In the end, the product 4 is heated, possibly leading to ring formation or elimination. So perhaps it's a fused ring system.

But, without the exact structure, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the final product is a molecule similar to cubane or another polycyclic structure.

Wait, but perhaps the final product is a molecule with several bridge structures, each leading to unique H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a certain number of methyl groups, tert-butyl groups, and other substituents that each contribute to distinct H's.

Wait, perhaps the final product has a structure where the tert-butoxy group remains, along with some other substituents, and the number of distinct H's can be counted based on symmetry.

Wait, considering the options: the answer is likely to be 7 or 8. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each step adds substituents in such a way that each new group adds two new distinct H's, leading to a total of 7 or 8.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think of each step's effect on the molecule.

Step 1: Diels-Alder adds two dienophiles, each adding two substituents. So product 1 has four substituents (two from each dienophile).

Step 2: treatment with H2SO4 leads to elimination, perhaps removing two substituents and forming double bonds. So product 2 might have fewer substituents but more double bonds.

Step 3: treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. If product 2 has OH groups, they would be converted to OSO3H groups. Alternatively, if product 2 has alkenes, perhaps some dihydroxylation or addition occurs, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a sulfonic acid group in place of a hydroxyl group. Then, heating product 3 would cause some rearrangement, perhaps leading to a more symmetrical structure, which would reduce the number of distinct H's.

Hmm. It's possible that the final product has a structure with multiple rings, each contributing to distinct H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a tricyclic structure, and each bridge has substituents leading to unique H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile after Diels-Alder adds substituents in a way that product 1 has four Br substituents. Then, in step 2, two of them are eliminated, leaving two Br substituents. Then, in step 3, those Brs are replaced by something else, maybe sulfonic acid groups.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has sulfonic acid groups, and upon heating, they eliminate or rearrange, leading to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a norbornene-like structure, but with several substituents, making the number of distinct H's equal to 7 or 8.

Given the options, I think the most plausible answer is option D) 7 or option B)4.

Wait, but in the starting material, the tert-butoxy group has equivalent H's. But after the reactions, perhaps the substituents break symmetry, leading to more distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a structure where each bridge has a unique substituent, leading to 7 distinct H's.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go with option D)7, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and proceeding through Diels-Alder reactions, acid treatment, sulfonation, and heating. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

1. **Step 1: Diels-Alder Reaction**  
   The starting material, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene in the presence of sodium iodide. The norbornene acts as the diene, and the cyclohexadiene derivative acts as the dienophile. Each dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups, which are electron-withdrawing and make it a good dienophile. The reaction likely forms a bicyclic adduct with substituents derived from the dienophile. The tert-butoxy group remains intact, and the CH2Br2 groups from the dienophiles are added to the structure.

2. **Step 2: Acid Treatment**  
   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. Acidic conditions can lead to elimination reactions, particularly if there are vicinal halides (e.g., CH2Br2 groups). This step likely results in the formation of new double bonds by eliminating HBr from the CH2Br2 groups, leading to a more unsaturated structure (product 2).

3. **Step 3: Sulfonation**  
   Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. This step likely introduces sulfonic acid groups (-SO3H) into the structure. If product 2 contains hydroxyl groups, they would be converted into sulfonic acid groups. The exact position of these groups depends on the structure of product 2.

4. **Step 4: Heating**  
   Product 3 is heated at 150°C to form the final product (product 4). Heating can lead to rearrangements, eliminations, or further structural changes. The final product likely has a well-defined structure with specific substituents and symmetry.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**  
   The final product's structure determines the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. The tert-butoxy group contributes equivalent hydrogens, but the addition of substituents and structural changes in the reaction sequence likely break symmetry, increasing the number of distinct hydrogen environments. Based on the reaction steps and the options provided, the most plausible number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product is **7**.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product 4 of this reaction sequence. Hmm, I remember that each step involves some kind of organic reaction, so I have to go through each step carefully to visualize the structure.

Let me start by breaking down each part.

The first step is combining 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and elevated temperature suggests some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like a norbornane structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So that's a bulky group attached.

The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group. So each is a CH2Br2 group attached to the cyclohexadiene ring.

When 2 equivalents of this are used, maybe each of the dienophile's CH2Br2 groups reacts with the norbornene structure. Since sodium iodide is present, perhaps it's an elimination reaction, or maybe a substitution?

Wait, the norbornene has a diene. It's a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a conjugated diene. The other compound is a diene as well: cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Oh, wait, I think this could be a Diels-Alder reaction. The norbornene is a diene, and the other molecule is a dienophile? Or maybe the other way around. Let me think. The dienophile is usually something electron-deficient, like a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups.

In this case, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two substituents at 5 and 6 positions, each being a dibromomethyl group. The CH2Br2 is a good electron-withdrawing group because of the two bromines. So that makes the cyclohexadiene a good dienophile.

So the norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) would act as the diene, and the cyclohexadiene with Br groups would be the dienophile.

Since there are two equivalents of the dienophile, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur. Each dienophile would add to the norbornene structure.

Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic diene. How does the Diels-Alder proceed here? The norbornene has two double bonds, but wait, no, it's hepta-2,5-diene, which is a conjugated diene between carbons 2 and 3, and 5 and 6. So it's a conjugated diene in a bicyclic structure.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene must be conjugated and the dienophile has a conjugated double bond. So the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the dienophile because it has the EWG substituents.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile here is the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups on carbons 5 and 6.

So when the Diels-Alder occurs, the diene (norbornene) would attack the dienophile (cyclohexadiene derivative). Each dienophile can react twice since there are two equivalents. So maybe two Diels-Alder adducts form, each adding a dienophile to the norbornene.

But wait, the norbornene has two double bonds. Hmm, actually, no, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a structure where the bicyclo has two double bonds? Or is it a single conjugated diene in a bicyclic system?

Wait, I think the structure is such that there are two double bonds. Let me try to sketch it.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene: the structure has two rings, a bridge structure, and double bonds at 2 and 5 positions. So, the molecule has a norbornene structure with two double bonds: between C2-C3 and C5-C6. So, a conjugated diene in a bicyclic system.

So when Diels-Alder occurs, each of these double bonds can react. But since there are two equivalents of the dienophile, maybe each double bond of the norbornene reacts with one dienophile.

Wait, but each dienophile is a cyclohexadiene derivative. So each dienophile would add across a double bond of the norbornene, forming a six-membered transition state.

But wait, the norbornene might have two double bonds, but after the first Diels-Alder reaction, perhaps it's only the endo rule that one would proceed. Alternatively, maybe each dienophile adds to the same double bond? No, that doesn't make sense because each dienophile would have to react on a separate site.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene's double bonds are in positions that each can react with the dienophiles. But wait, the norbornene has only one conjugated diene system, right? So it has two double bonds that are conjugated. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the numbering might be such that the double bonds are not conjugated. Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So the structure is like a bridge where the double bonds are at positions 2-3 and 5-6. So they are not conjugated, but are isolated double bonds.

Wait, no, in bicyclo systems, the numbering can make the double bonds conjugated. For example, in norbornene, the bridgehead positions are 1, 2, and 7. The double bonds are between 2 and 3, and 5 and 6. So they are conjugated through the bridge.

So the norbornene is a conjugated diene, which can act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. So each molecule of the dienophile (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would react with the norbornene.

But there are two equivalents of dienophile, so maybe two Diels-Alder reactions happen, each adding a dienophile to the norbornene.

Wait, but norbornene has two double bonds as diene parts? Or is it a single conjugated diene. I think it's a single conjugated diene, so each equivalent of dienophile would add to one of the double bonds, but wait, each norbornene molecule has two double bonds. Wait, no, no, the norbornene molecule has two double bonds, but each is part of a conjugated system. So maybe each double bond can react with a dienophile. But since each dienophile has two reactive sites (the dibromomethyl groups are on positions 5 and 6, which are adjacent to the diene), perhaps each dienophile can add twice? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) has two substituent groups which are dibromomethyl. So when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, each of these substituents is in a position that can react.

Wait, maybe the Diels-Alder reaction is such that the dienophile (cyclohexadiene) is attacked by the diene (norbornene), leading to a six-membered transition state. But the dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups on adjacent carbons (5 and 6), which are part of the diene. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, the two substituents would end up in positions on the adduct.

Wait, perhaps each dienophile will form two separate adducts, but with two equivalents, each dienophile will add once, giving two adducts on the norbornene. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try an alternative approach.

After the reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. That probably involves some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, maybe elimination or ring-opening.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, but DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. Wait, more accurately, SO3 is often used for sulfonation, but in the presence of pyridine, maybe it's acting as a catalyst or to absorb the H2SO4 produced. Alternatively, another possibility is that it's a sulfonating reaction where a sulfonic acid group is introduced.

Wait, but DMSO is a solvent that can also act as an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonation reaction where a hydroxyl group is converted to a sulfonic acid group. But why would product 2 have hydroxyl groups?

Wait, let me think about the first reaction. If the Diels-Alder adds a dienophile to the norbornene, the adduct would have a six-membered ring with substituents. The dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups; in the Diels-Alder, these would become endo substituents.

Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction adds the dienophile to the diene, forming a six-membered cyclic structure. The substituents on the dienophile (CH2Br2) would end up in the endo position on the adduct.

So after the Diels-Alder, each dienophile adds two CH2Br2 groups to the norbornene structure. But wait, no, each dienophile has two substituents, but in the Diels-Alder, each substituent is on a different carbon of the dienophile.

Wait, the dienophile is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with CH2Br2 groups on carbons 5 and 6. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, the dienophile would add to the diene, and the substituents would end up in the bridge positions of the adduct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps each Diels-Alder adds a dienophile to the norbornene, leading to a larger bicyclic structure with substituents.

Wait, another thought: the norbornene has a tert-butoxy group. That's a bulky group. When the Diels-Alder occurs, the endo rule suggests that the substituents (the CH2Br2 groups) would be placed towards the bridgehead, perhaps.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structure of product 1. Maybe I should think about what each subsequent step does.

After product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, which is a strong acid. Acid often leads to elimination reactions, especially if there are leaving groups present. So if product 1 has bromine substituents, perhaps they are eliminated. Wait, but product 1 comes from a Diels-Alder reaction, which forms new sigma bonds. So perhaps the Diels-Alder product has bromine substituents adjacent to a leaving group, or maybe not.

Wait, the dienophile has CH2Br2 groups. When the Diels-Alder occurs, the substituents would be in a certain position. So in product 1, the substituents from the dienophile would be attached to the adduct. So each dienophile adds two CH2Br2 groups to the norbornene.

But then, when product 1 is treated with H2SO4, maybe the Br groups are replaced by something else. Wait, but in the first step, we have two equivalents of the dienophile and sodium iodide. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, sodium iodide in the presence of dienophiles with Br groups—could it lead to a substitution reaction? For example, the Br in the dienophile is replaced by iodide via an SN2 mechanism. So each CH2Br2 group might become CH2I2. But that doesn't make much sense, as iodide is a good nucleophile, and Br is a better leaving group than iodide. Wait, no, iodide is a better nucleophile, but in substitution reactions, the leaving group must be good. So perhaps it's a Finkelstein reaction, where Br is replaced by I.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile's Br groups are replaced during the reaction. So product 1 would have CH2I2 groups instead of CH2Br2.

But then, when treated with H2SO4, perhaps these iodides are eliminated. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder reaction is followed by elimination. Wait, but Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition, forming a six-membered ring as a bicyclic structure.

Wait, maybe product 1 has bromides in positions that are adjacent to each other, leading to a possibility of elimination when treated with acid. So aqueous H2SO4 could protonate a leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromides are part of a vicinal dihalide, which upon treatment with acid would undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond.

So if product 1 has two adjacent CH2Br2 groups, then in product 2, elimination would occur, forming a double bond.

Wait, but the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the substituents are on adjacent carbons (5 and 6), which are part of the diene. So in the Diels-Alder adduct, those substituents would be on adjacent positions, which could lead to a vicinal dihalide.

So after the Diels-Alder, product 1 has two adjacent CH2Br groups on the adduct. Then, treatment with aqueous H2SO4 (acid) would cause elimination, forming a double bond. So product 2 would have a new double bond where the two Brs were.

But wait, each dienophile has two CH2Br groups, so each would contribute two Brs, but if two dienophiles are added, per the two equivalents, then product 1 would have four Br substituents?

Wait, perhaps each Diels-Alder adds two Br groups. For each dienophile, two Brs are added? No, I think each dienophile has two substituents, each with two Brs. Wait, no, each substituent is CH2Br2, so each has two Br atoms.

Wait, the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the substituents are at carbons 5 and 6, each being CH2Br2. So each dienophile has four Br atoms. When it reacts, maybe each Br is retained, but in a different position.

But when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the diene (norbornene) would attack the dienophile's double bond, leading to a cycloadduct where the substituents (the CH2Br2 groups) are in specific positions.

But perhaps the key is that after the Diels-Alder and the subsequent acid treatment, some of the Brs are eliminated, forming double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder adduct has the CH2Br2 groups in positions that are adjacent, so upon treatment with acid, they eliminate to form a double bond, releasing HBr.

So, for product 2, each original dienophile's substituents have been converted into a double bond. So each dienophile's Brs are eliminated, leading to a conjugated diene in the molecule.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, but DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. Wait, but in the presence of pyridine, which is a base, perhaps it's a sulfonation reaction where a hydroxyl group is converted into a sulfonic acid group.

Wait, but if product 2 has a double bond, perhaps some hydroxyl groups are present. Alternatively, maybe the acid treatment in step 2 introduces hydroxyl groups.

Wait, step 1: Diels-Alder forms product 1 with Br substituents. Step 2: treatment with H2SO4, which could cause elimination of HBr, forming double bonds. So product 2 would have double bonds where the Brs were.

Then, product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. Hmm, but SO3 is a strong dehydrating agent and can also be used for sulfonation. Wait, perhaps in this case, it's a sulfonation of an aromatic ring, but product 2 doesn't have an aromatic ring. Alternatively, if product 2 has an alcohol group, SO3 would convert it into a sulfonate ester.

Wait, but product 2 might have some dihydroxyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in step 2 forms some diol, which in step 3 is sulfonated.

Alternatively, if product 2 has alkenes, maybe the treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO is for some kind of addition or epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: SO3 in pyridine and DMSO could be used for the sulfonation of an aromatic ring. But product 2 doesn't have an aromatic ring unless some ring formation occurred in an earlier step.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a sulfonated version of product 2. Let me think: after product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, product 3 is formed. Maybe a hydroxyl group is converted into a sulfonic acid group.

But wait, if product 2 has a hydroxyl group, then treatment with SO3 would convert it into a sulfonate. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, in some cases, DMSO can act as an oxidizing agent, especially with SO3, leading to sulfonation.

Then, product 3 is heated at 150°C, forming the final product 4. Heating could lead to various reactions, such as elimination, rearrangement, or decomposition. But perhaps in this case, it leads to the loss of a sulfonic acid group or some ring-forming reaction.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps again, perhaps more clearly.

1. Diels-Alder reaction between norbornene and two equivalents of the dienophile. Each dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups. So product 1 would have four CH2Br2 groups attached to the norbornene structure.

Wait, no, each dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups. When two equivalents are used, perhaps each dienophile adds two substituents to the norbornene. But norbornene is a diene, so each equivalent of dienophile can add two substituents? Or perhaps each dienophile adds once, contributing two substituents.

Hmm, perhaps each dienophile adds to a double bond, contributing two substituents. So two dienophiles would add four substituents.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the Diels-Alder product. The Diels-Alder forms a six-membered ring with substituents from the dienophile. Each dienophile has two substituents, so each molecule would have those substituents in specific positions.

But I'm not seeing the exact structure. Maybe I should move on and think about what the final product would look like.

After all steps, including sulfonation and heating, the product 4 is formed. The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Assuming that the final step is elimination or ring formation, perhaps product 4 is a fused ring system with multiple substituents.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Maybe I should think of the possibilities.

The options are 4, 7, 8, or 10 distinct H atoms. 

Assuming that product 4 is a highly symmetrical structure, the number of distinct H's would be lower. For example, if it's a norbornene derivative with multiple substituents, but in symmetrical positions.

Wait, norbornene has a bridge structure. If substituents are placed symmetrically, the number of distinct H's could be lower.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I can think of another approach. Let me consider the steps again.

The initial molecule is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The tert-butoxy group is bulky. Then, two equivalents of the dienophile are added via Diels-Alder, leading to product 1.

Product 1, upon treatment with H2SO4, eliminates some groups to form product 2, perhaps introducing new double bonds.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3, which is then heated to form product 4.

If I imagine that each step adds substituents and then removes some, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a certain number of rings and substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with multiple substituents, and I need to count the distinct H environments.

But perhaps the final product has multiple rings, each with unique substituents leading to distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cage-like structure with multiple substituents, leading to several unique H environments.

Wait, another approach: each step adds or removes certain groups, which affect the symmetry of the molecule, thereby influencing the number of distinct H atoms.

The starting material is a bicyclic structure with a tert-butoxy group. Then, after Diels-Alder, substituents are added, which might break some symmetry. Then, elimination could form new rings or double bonds, again affecting symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm having trouble. Maybe I can think of it in terms of the number of steps and what each could do.

In the end, the product 4 is heated, possibly leading to ring formation or elimination. So perhaps it's a fused ring system.

But, without the exact structure, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the final product is a molecule similar to cubane or another polycyclic structure.

Wait, but perhaps the final product is a molecule with several bridge structures, each leading to unique H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a certain number of methyl groups, tert-butyl groups, and other substituents that each contribute to distinct H's.

Wait, perhaps the final product has a structure where the tert-butoxy group remains, along with some other substituents, and the number of distinct H's can be counted based on symmetry.

Wait, considering the options: the answer is likely to be 7 or 8. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each step adds substituents in such a way that each new group adds two new distinct H's, leading to a total of 7 or 8.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think of each step's effect on the molecule.

Step 1: Diels-Alder adds two dienophiles, each adding two substituents. So product 1 has four substituents (two from each dienophile).

Step 2: treatment with H2SO4 leads to elimination, perhaps removing two substituents and forming double bonds. So product 2 might have fewer substituents but more double bonds.

Step 3: treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. If product 2 has OH groups, they would be converted to OSO3H groups. Alternatively, if product 2 has alkenes, perhaps some dihydroxylation or addition occurs, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a sulfonic acid group in place of a hydroxyl group. Then, heating product 3 would cause some rearrangement, perhaps leading to a more symmetrical structure, which would reduce the number of distinct H's.

Hmm. It's possible that the final product has a structure with multiple rings, each contributing to distinct H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a tricyclic structure, and each bridge has substituents leading to unique H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile after Diels-Alder adds substituents in a way that product 1 has four Br substituents. Then, in step 2, two of them are eliminated, leaving two Br substituents. Then, in step 3, those Brs are replaced by something else, maybe sulfonic acid groups.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has sulfonic acid groups, and upon heating, they eliminate or rearrange, leading to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a norbornene-like structure, but with several substituents, making the number of distinct H's equal to 7 or 8.

Given the options, I think the most plausible answer is option D) 7 or option B)4.

Wait, but in the starting material, the tert-butoxy group has equivalent H's. But after the reactions, perhaps the substituents break symmetry, leading to more distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a structure where each bridge has a unique substituent, leading to 7 distinct H's.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go with option D)7, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and proceeding through Diels-Alder reactions, acid treatment, sulfonation, and heating. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

1. **Step 1: Diels-Alder Reaction**  
   The starting material, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene in the presence of sodium iodide. The norbornene acts as the diene, and the cyclohexadiene derivative acts as the dienophile. Each dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups, which are electron-withdrawing and make it a good dienophile. The reaction likely forms a bicyclic adduct with substituents derived from the dienophile. The tert-butoxy group remains intact, and the CH2Br2 groups from the dienophiles are added to the structure.

2. **Step 2: Acid Treatment**  
   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. Acidic conditions can lead to elimination reactions, particularly if there are vicinal halides (e.g., CH2Br2 groups). This step likely results in the formation of new double bonds by eliminating HBr from the CH2Br2 groups, leading to a more unsaturated structure (product 2).

3. **Step 3: Sulfonation**  
   Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. This step likely introduces sulfonic acid groups (-SO3H) into the structure. If product 2 contains hydroxyl groups, they would be converted into sulfonic acid groups. The exact position of these groups depends on the structure of product 2.

4. **Step 4: Heating**  
   Product 3 is heated at 150°C to form the final product (product 4). Heating can lead to rearrangements, eliminations, or further structural changes. The final product likely has a well-defined structure with specific substituents and symmetry.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**  
   The final product's structure determines the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. The tert-butoxy group contributes equivalent hydrogens, but the addition of substituents and structural changes in the reaction sequence likely break symmetry, increasing the number of distinct hydrogen environments. Based on the reaction steps and the options provided, the most plausible number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product is **7**.
