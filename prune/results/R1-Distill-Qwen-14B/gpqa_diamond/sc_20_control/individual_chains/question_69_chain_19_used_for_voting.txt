Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The given energy is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are in meters, varying from 1e-9 m up to 1e-1 m.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. The formula for the dilated lifetime is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, Lorentz factor γ is calculated as γ = E / m, because E is the total energy of the particle, right? So E is given as 27 GeV and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917, so γ is about 7.917.

So the dilated lifetime τ = γ * τ₀ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.917 *8 is around 63.336, so τ is 63.336e-16 s, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Now, the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula for decay length L is L = v * τ. But wait, I don't know the velocity v directly. Alternatively, since energy is given, maybe I can find the velocity from that.

Alternatively, I can find the velocity using the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. The energy E is related by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, the momentum p can be found as p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c². Wait, let me make sure. The equation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. So, solving for p, we get p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / (c²), but wait, no. Let me re-arrange:

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2 → (pc)² = E² - (m c²)^2 → pc = sqrt(E² - (m c)^4 ) / c? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with units. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. Oh wait, maybe better to compute in natural units where c=1, but perhaps it's easier to compute using SI units.

Wait, let's compute p. E = 27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV/c². So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c²? Wait, perhaps I should express it in terms of units where c is 1. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the velocity using beta (β) and gamma (γ), since I know γ is 7.917.

Wait, since γ = E/(m c²) → but E is given as 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV, so that's consistent with γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917 as before.

And β γ = v/c → because γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), and β is v/c. So β = (v/c) = (β γ) / γ. Wait, no. Alternatively, from β γ = (v/c) * γ → but since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), then β γ = β / sqrt(1 - β²).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to find the velocity v. Since γ is known, perhaps I can find β from the relation γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²). So, 1 - β² = 1/γ² → β² = 1 - 1/γ². Let's compute that.

γ is approximately 7.917, so γ² ≈ 62.7. Then 1/γ² is about 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is approximately 0.98405. So β² ≈ 0.98405 → β ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992 c. Which is a very high speed, as expected for such a high-energy particle.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.992 c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So v ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. Wait, but τ is the dilated lifetime, which I computed earlier as about 6.3336e-15 seconds. So L = v * τ = 2.976e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s.

Let me compute that. 2.976e8 * 6.3336e-15 = let's see. 2.976 * 6.3336 is approximately 18.87. Then, 1e8 * 1e-15 is 1e-7. So 18.87e-7 meters is 1.887e-6 meters. So about 1.887e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, that implies that we need to observe a certain fraction of the decays. So I think that relates to the probability of the decay being detected.

Wait, the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The probability that a decay happens within a certain length x is given by the decay probability formula: P = 1 - e^(-x/L). Because the decay follows an exponential distribution.

So if we want to observe at least 30% of the decays, that means P >= 0.3. So 1 - e^(-x/L) >= 0.3 → e^(-x/L) <= 0.7 → -x/L <= ln(0.7) → x >= L * ln(1/0.7) → ln(1/0.7) is ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567.

So x >= L * 0.3567.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-calculate. Because the formula is P = 1 - exp(-x/L). We want P >= 0.3. So 1 - exp(-x/L) >= 0.3 → exp(-x/L) <= 0.7 → -x/L <= ln(0.7) → x/L >= -ln(0.7) → x >= L * (-ln(0.7)).

Since ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, so -ln(0.7) is 0.35667. So x >= L * 0.35667.

So the minimum x is 0.35667 * L.

Wait, but I calculated L as about 1.887e-6 meters. So x would be 0.35667 * 1.887e-6 m ≈ 0.35667 * 1.887e-6 ≈ approximately 0.673e-6 m, or 6.73e-7 meters. Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, none of them are in that range. Wait, no, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, L was 2.976e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s. Let me compute that exactly: 2.976e8 * 6.3336e-15 = (2.976 * 6.3336) * 1e8 * 1e-15.

2.976 * 6.3336 is approximately: let's compute 3 *6.3336=18.99998, but since 2.976 is 0.024 less than 3, 0.024 *6.3336≈0.152. So 18.99998 -0.152≈18.848.

So 18.848 * 1e-7 = 1.8848e-6 meters. So L is approximately 1.8848e-6 meters.

So x = 0.35667 * 1.8848e-6 m ≈ 0.35667 * 1.8848e-6 ≈ let me compute 0.35667 *1.8848.

0.35667 * 1.8848 ≈ approximately 0.35667 *1.8 ≈ 0.642, and 0.35667 *0.0848≈0.0302. So total around 0.672. So 0.672e-6 meters, which is 6.72e-7 meters. Hmm, but looking at the options, the options are 2.08e-6, 2.08e-9, etc.

Wait, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a second, perhaps I confused the concept here. The question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh! Wait, perhaps the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products, which depends on the decay length. If the decay length is too small, the particles will decay too close together, making it hard to resolve individual decays.

So maybe the minimum resolution required is the length such that 30% of the decays are within that length, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the resolution refers to the detection system's ability to measure the decay point accurately. If the decay length is too small, the particles decay in a region that's too small for the detector to resolve.

Wait, perhaps the question is more straightforward. The minimum resolution needed would be the decay length itself, because if the detector's resolution is better (i.e., can measure smaller distances) than the decay length, it can resolve the decays.

Wait no, perhaps the minimal resolution refers to the uncertainty in the position measurement. But that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying is determined by the proper lifetime, but I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The proper lifetime is τ₀=8e-16 s. The lifetime observed in the lab is τ = γ τ₀ ≈ 7.917 *8e-16 = ~6.33e-15 s. The average decay length L is v τ, which we calculated as ~1.88e-6 m.

If the detector's resolution is the minimum distance it can measure, then to observe the decay, the decay must occur over a distance longer than the detector's resolution. Otherwise, the decays would be too close to distinguish.

Wait, but the question says 'minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.' So perhaps the decay length must be larger than the detector's resolution for a certain fraction of the decays.

Wait, another way: The probability that a decay occurs within a length x is P=1−exp(−x/L). To have at least 30% of decays observed, we set P=0.30.

So 1−exp(−x/L) = 0.3 → exp(−x/L) = 0.7 → x=−L ln(0.7) → x ≈ L * 0.35667.

So x is about 0.35667 * L.

Wait, I calculated L as 1.8848e-6 meters. So x=0.35667 *1.8848e-6 ≈ 0.672e-6 meters, which is 6.72e-7 meters, or 6.72 x10^-7 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, but that's about three times larger than our x value.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating L. Let me recheck. So E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV.

So γ = E/(m c²) → but since E is given in GeV and m c² is in GeV, the units cancel, so γ is 27 /3.41 ≈7.917.

v = β c, where β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) → beta squared is 1 - 1/(7.917)^2 → which is 1 - 1/62.7 → approximately 0.984 → beta ≈ 0.992.

Then L = v * τ = β c * gamma tau0.

Wait, tau is gamma tau0 =7.917 *8e-16 s =6.3336e-15 s.

So L= beta c * gamma tau0.

Compute beta c: 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma tau0: 2.976e8 m/s *6.3336e-15 s.

2.976e8 *6.3336e-15 = let me compute 2.976 *6.3336 ≈ 18.848, and 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7 → 18.848e-7 m → 1.8848e-6 m.

So L ≈1.8848e-6 meters. Then x=0.35667 * L →0.35667 *1.8848e-6 ≈0.672e-6 m →6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. The options are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9 m, etc.

Wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me compute 27 GeV /3.41 GeV. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917 as before.

Wait, let me think again about the L calculation. L= beta c * gamma * tau0.

Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), and L = v tau = beta c tau. But tau is gamma tau0.

So L = beta c gamma tau0.

Alternatively, I could compute L as (beta gamma) c tau0.

Wait, beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma. Let me compute beta gamma:

beta is about 0.992, gamma is 7.917 → beta gamma≈ 0.992 *7.917 ≈7.855.

So L= beta gamma c tau0 → 7.855 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute that: 7.855 *3e8 =2.3565e9 m/s. Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.3565e9 *8e-16 = 1.8852e-6 meters. So same as before.

So L is approximately 1.8852e-6 meters, which is 1.8852 micrometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimal resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So how does that relate to L?

If the detector's spatial resolution is R, then the probability of a decay being observed (i.e., the decay occurring within a distance R from the point of origin) is P=1 - e^{-R/L}.

We need P >= 0.3 → 1 - e^{-R/L} >= 0.3 → e^{-R/L} <= 0.7 → R >= L * ln(1/0.7) → R >= L * 0.3567.

So R is about 0.3567 *1.8852e-6 m → approximately 0.3567 *1.8852e-6 ≈ 0.671e-6 m, which is 6.71e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. The options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, so 6.7e-7 m is about 0.67 micrometers. The closest option is A, which is 2.08e-6 m, but that's about 3 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check the gamma and beta.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

gamma = E/(m c²) → since E is in GeV and m c² is GeV, units are correct. So gamma is 27 /3.41 ≈7.917.

Beta squared = 1 - (1/(gamma^2)) → 1 - 1/(62.7) → 1 - 0.01595 → 0.98405 → beta= sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.99198.

So L= beta * c * gamma * tau0 → beta*gamma is 0.99198 *7.917 ≈7.842.

So L=7.842 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.842 *3e8 = 2.3526e9 m/s. Multiply by 8e-16 s → 2.3526e9 *8e-16 = 1.882e-6 m.

So L=1.882e-6 m → same as before.

Hmm. So the calculation seems correct. So R = 0.3567 * L → 0.3567 *1.882e-6 = approx 0.67e-6 m =6.7e-7 m.

Looking at the options, none is exactly this, but option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 3 times larger than what I found.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Another way to think: the minimum resolution required is the decay length such that 30% of the particles decay within that length. So R is the distance where the probability P is 30%. So maybe I should compute R as L * (1 - e^{-x/L})=0.3.

Wait, no, the formula is P=1 - e^{-x/L}.

We're looking for x such that P=0.3. So x = L * ln(1/(1-P)).

Wait, ln(1/(1-0.3))=ln(1/0.7)=0.35667.

So x=0.35667 * L.

Which again gives x=0.35667 *1.882e-6≈6.7e-7 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution as the decay length L itself. Because, if the detector's resolution is better than L, then it can resolve the decay. But in that case, it's 1.88e-6 m, which is option A (2.08e-6 m). But 1.88 is closer to 2.08, but that's about 10% higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma and beta more accurately.

Gamma: E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

gamma = 27 /3.41 = let's compute that exactly. 3.41 *7 =23.87, 3.41*7.9= 27. 3.41 *7.9 = ?

Wait 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069 → 23.87 +3.069=26.939. So 7.9 gives 26.939 GeV. But E is 27 GeV, so 27 -26.939=0.061 GeV. So 3.41 * x =0.061 → x=0.061/3.41≈0.0179.

So gamma is approximately 7.9 +0.0179≈7.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

Beta squared =1 -1/(gamma^2)=1 – 1/(7.9179^2) →7.9179 squared is 62.700 →1/62.700=0.01595 →1-0.01595=0.98405 → beta= sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So beta=0.9920.

So beta gamma=0.9920 *7.9179 ≈7.854.

So L= beta gamma * c tau0.

c tau0 is the speed of light multiplied by the proper lifetime. c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

c tau0=3e8 *8e-16=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Then, L=7.854 * 2.4e-7 m = let's compute 7.854 *2.4=18.8496 → 18.8496e-7 m →1.88496e-6 m.

So L=1.88496e-6 m.

Hmm, same as before.

So now, R is 0.35667 * L →0.35667 *1.88496e-6 ≈0.672e-6 m →6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed, implying that the detector must be able to measure a path longer than a certain length. But if the decay length is smaller than the detector's resolution, the decays are too close together to be resolved.

Wait, no, if the decay length is larger than the detector's resolution, then the decays can be resolved. Wait, but the decay length is the average distance. So if the detector's resolution (spatial) is R, then to resolve the decay, the decay must occur over a distance longer than R. So perhaps the minimum R needed is such that 30% of decays are at a distance greater than R. Or perhaps the other way.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the detector's ability to measure the decay point. If the decay occurs over a small length, the detector can't resolve it. So to observe the decay, the decay length must be larger than the detector's resolution. So the minimum resolution R is such that L is about equal to R.

Wait, but in that case, the R would be about 1.88e-6 m, which is option A (2.08e-6 m). But 1.88 is less than 2.08. Hmm, perhaps the actual calculation with more precise numbers gives a higher value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the probability but about the decay length itself. So perhaps the minimum resolution is just the decay length, which is 1.88e-6 m, which is option A, 2.08e-6 m. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me compute E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

gamma = E/(m c^2) → since E is in GeV and m c² is in GeV, this is 27/3.41=7.9179.

Yes, correct.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the decay length in meters.

L = beta * gamma * c * tau0.

beta is 0.9920, gamma=7.9179, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=0.9920 *7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 0.9920 *7.9179 → approximately 7.854.

Then, 7.854 *3e8 =2.3562e9. Multiply by 8e-16 → 2.3562e9 *8e-16 =1.88496e-6 m.

So L=1.88496e-6 m.

So again, same as before.

So the minimum resolution would need to be at least as good as L, but perhaps the problem is referring to the minimum resolution as the decay length itself. So if the detector has a resolution (i.e., can measure down to) 1.88e-6 m, then it can observe the decay.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine my calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given in GeV, but I should have considered units correctly when computing gamma. Let me see:

E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c².

So gamma = E/(m c²) → but E is in GeV, m c^2 is (3.41 GeV/c²)*c²=3.41 GeV.

So gamma is 27 GeV /3.41 GeV =7.9179, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that E is the total energy, which includes the rest mass. So gamma is E/(m c²) =27/3.41=7.9179.

Another thought: perhaps the lifetime is given in tau_0 =8e-16 seconds. Maybe I should compute the lab frame lifetime correctly.

Wait, I did compute tau = gamma tau0 =7.9179 *8e-16 ≈6.334e-15 s.

So L= beta gamma c tau0 → which is 7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 →2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.854 →2.4e-7 *7.854 ≈1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution as the proper length, but that doesn't make sense because proper length is zero in the rest frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mean decay length and then find the resolution based on that.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the mean decay length is about 1.88e-6 meters. So the detector needs to have a resolution (ability to measure) at least that. So the minimum resolution R is 1.88e-6 m. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

B) 2.08e-9 m → 2.08 nanometers.

C) 2.08e-1 m →20.8 cm.

D) 2.08e-3 m →2.08 mm.

So option A is 2.08e-6 m. Which is about 10% larger than our calculated 1.88e-6 m. Maybe the exact calculation gives 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma =27 /3.41 = ?

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.41 *0.9=3.069 → so 7.9 → 23.87 +3.069=26.939.

27-26.939=0.061.

So 0.061 /3.41 =0.01789.

So gamma=7.91789.

So gamma ≈7.91789.

Beta squared =1 – (1/gamma^2) →1 – (1/(7.91789)^2).

Compute 7.91789^2:

7.91789^2 → let's compute 7.9^2=62.41.

7.91789^2 = (7.9 +0.01789)^2 =7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.01789 + (0.01789)^2.

7.9^2=62.41.

2*7.9*0.01789≈ 15.8 *0.01789≈0.2836.

(0.01789)^2≈0.000320.

So total ≈62.41 +0.2836=62.6936 +0.00032≈62.6939.

So 1/gamma^2=1/62.6939≈0.015947.

So beta squared=1 –0.015947=0.984053.

Beta= sqrt(0.984053)= let's compute.

0.992^2=0.984064, which is very close to 0.984053.

So beta= approximately 0.992 – let's compute the exact value.

(0.992)^2 =0.984064.

We have 0.984053, which is 0.000011 less.

So, 0.992^2=0.984064 → so we need beta^2=0.984053 → difference is 0.984053-0.984064= -0.000011.

So beta=0.992 – delta.

Let me compute (0.992 - delta)^2 ≈0.984053.

Expanding (a - d)^2 =a² -2 a d +d².

a=0.992, a²=0.984064.

So 0.984064 - 2*0.992*delta + delta^2 =0.984053.

Neglecting delta^2, we have:

0.984064 -1.984 delta ≈0.984053 → 0.984064 -0.984053 =1.984 delta → 0.000011=1.984 delta → delta≈0.000011 /1.984 ≈5.54e-6.

So beta≈0.992 –0.00000554≈0.99199446.

So beta=0.99199446.

So beta gamma=0.99199446 *7.91789.

Compute that:

0.99199446 *7 =6.94396.

0.99199446 *0.91789 → let's compute that.

0.99199446 *0.9 =0.892795.

0.99199446 *0.01789≈0.01774.

So sum is 0.892795 +0.01774=0.910535.

So total beta gamma ≈6.94396 +0.910535=7.854495.

So beta gamma≈7.8545.

So L= beta gamma * c * tau0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

c*tau0=3e8 *8e-16=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

L=7.8545 *2.4e-7 =18.8508e-7 m =1.88508e-6 m.

So L≈1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, same as before.

So the minimum resolution R would be when P=30%, so R=0.35667 * L=0.35667 *1.885e-6≈0.671e-6 m.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the decay length L itself, which is ~1.885e-6 m. But the options don't have that; option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different gamma calculation. Let me recheck: gamma=E/(m c²) → E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma=27/3.41=7.9179.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires using relativistic momentum or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity using E = gamma m c² → which I did, so beta = v/c.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the calculation is done using the lab frame lifetime, but I'm not considering relativistic effects correctly. Or perhaps the energy is given as the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But the problem states the energy is 27 GeV, which I assume is the total energy.

Wait, the problem says 'the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV.' So that should be the total energy E=K +m c²=27 GeV.

So m c² is 3.41 GeV, so K=27 –3.41=23.59 GeV.

So gamma is E/(m c²)=27/3.41=7.9179, as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation is correct but the options don't match. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the proper lifetime. No, because the proper lifetime is given as tau0=8e-16 s.

Wait, no, the decay length in the lab frame is based on the lab lifetime, which is longer.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the minimum resolution as the length that corresponds to 30% of the decay probability. So R= L * ln(2) → but earlier calculation shows that for 30% probability, R is about 0.356 L.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be L multiplied by a different factor. Let me think of the formula again.

P =1 - e^{-x/L} ≥ 0.3 → x ≥ L ln(1/(1-0.3)) → x= L ln(1/0.7)= L * 0.35667.

So that's what I did.

But perhaps the problem is looking for the minimum resolution in terms of the proper length, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the average decay length, which is L=1.885e-6 m, and the minimal resolution is equal to that, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma using E= (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So E=27 GeV, m c²=3.41 GeV.

So (pc)^2 = E² – (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 =27² –3.41² =729 – 11.6281=717.3719 → pc= sqrt(717.3719)=26.78 GeV/c.

So p=26.78 GeV/c.

Gamma is E/(m c²)=27/3.41=7.9179.

But another way to compute beta is beta = (pc²)/(E). Because p c = (gamma m v) → and E=gamma m c² → so beta = (p c²) / E = (26.78 GeV/c * c²) /27 GeV → units check: GeV cancels, c cancels, so beta=26.78 c /27 → wait, no.

Wait, pc is in GeV/c, so pc c is GeV.

Wait, beta = p c / E → because p c is GeV, E is GeV.

So beta= (26.78 GeV) /27 GeV ≈0.99185.

So same as before.

So beta=0.99185.

So then, L=beta *c *gamma *tau0.

Which is 0.99185 *3e8 m/s *7.9179 *8e-16 s.

Wait, 8e-16 s is tau0.

Wait, no, tau is gamma tau0, so L= beta c * tau.

Tau= gamma tau0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.3343e-15 s.

So L=0.99185 *3e8 *6.3343e-15.

Compute that: 0.99185 *3e8 =2.97555e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3343e-15 s: 2.97555e8 *6.3343e-15 = (2.97555 *6.3343) *1e-7.

2.97555 *6.3343 ≈ about 18.85.

So 18.85e-7 m=1.885e-6 m.

Same result again.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, option A is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the proper lifetime is given as tau0=8e-16 s, but the lab frame uses tau=gamma tau0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s.

But perhaps I mixed up the energy and mass. Let me check again: the mass is 3.41 GeV, and the energy is27 GeV. So gamma=27/3.41=7.9179.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires using the speed as a fraction of light speed correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v as (pc²)/E. Because p=E beta/gamma. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, another formula: beta = pc/(E) → pc is 26.78 GeV, E is 27 GeV → beta=26.78/27≈0.99185.

So same as before.

I think I've done everything correctly. So the minimum resolution needed is approximately 1.88e-6 m, but the options don't have that. So perhaps it's a typo in the options, and option A is the intended answer, 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the speed of light as 3e8 m/s, but perhaps more accurately, c=2.99792e8 m/s.

Let me recompute L using c=2.99792e8 m/s.

L=beta gamma c tau0.

Beta gamma=7.8545, c=2.99792e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.8545 *2.99792e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.8545 *2.99792e8 →7.8545 *2.99792=23.536 → 23.536e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s →23.536e8 *8e-16=23.536 *8 *1e-8=188.288e-8 m=1.88288e-6 m.

Still same result.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A (2.08e-6 m), considering some approximation during calculations. So I'll go with option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \) with the following given parameters:

- Proper lifetime of \( X^0 \): \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \),
- Energy of \( X^0 \): \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Mass of \( X^0 \): \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The lifetime of \( X^0 \) in the lab frame is extended due to time dilation:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0,
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9179.
   \]
   Substituting \( \tau_0 \):
   \[
   \tau = 7.9179 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Decay Length**:  
   The average distance \( X^0 \) travels before decaying (decay length) is:
   \[
   L = v \tau,
   \]
   where \( v \) is the velocity of \( X^0 \). Using the relation \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \), we find:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.9179^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \approx 0.992.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   v = \beta c \approx 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \tau \):
   \[
   L = (2.976 \times 10^8) \times (6.334 \times 10^{-15}) \approx 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

3. **Minimum Resolution for 30% Detection**:  
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the probability of decay within a distance \( x \) is given by:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-x/L}.
   \]
   Setting \( P = 0.3 \):
   \[
   1 - e^{-x/L} = 0.3 \implies e^{-x/L} = 0.7 \implies x = L \ln(1/0.7).
   \]
   Using \( \ln(1/0.7) \approx 0.3567 \):
   \[
   x = 0.3567 \times L \approx 0.3567 \times 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated minimum resolution \( x \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), which is approximately three times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or rounding in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Given the options, the closest match to the calculated minimum resolution is \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Therefore, the answer is:

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The given energy is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are in meters, varying from 1e-9 m up to 1e-1 m.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. The formula for the dilated lifetime is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, Lorentz factor γ is calculated as γ = E / m, because E is the total energy of the particle, right? So E is given as 27 GeV and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917, so γ is about 7.917.

So the dilated lifetime τ = γ * τ₀ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.917 *8 is around 63.336, so τ is 63.336e-16 s, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Now, the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula for decay length L is L = v * τ. But wait, I don't know the velocity v directly. Alternatively, since energy is given, maybe I can find the velocity from that.

Alternatively, I can find the velocity using the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. The energy E is related by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, the momentum p can be found as p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c². Wait, let me make sure. The equation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. So, solving for p, we get p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / (c²), but wait, no. Let me re-arrange:

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2 → (pc)² = E² - (m c²)^2 → pc = sqrt(E² - (m c)^4 ) / c? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with units. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. Oh wait, maybe better to compute in natural units where c=1, but perhaps it's easier to compute using SI units.

Wait, let's compute p. E = 27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV/c². So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c²? Wait, perhaps I should express it in terms of units where c is 1. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the velocity using beta (β) and gamma (γ), since I know γ is 7.917.

Wait, since γ = E/(m c²) → but E is given as 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV, so that's consistent with γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917 as before.

And β γ = v/c → because γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), and β is v/c. So β = (v/c) = (β γ) / γ. Wait, no. Alternatively, from β γ = (v/c) * γ → but since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), then β γ = β / sqrt(1 - β²).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to find the velocity v. Since γ is known, perhaps I can find β from the relation γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²). So, 1 - β² = 1/γ² → β² = 1 - 1/γ². Let's compute that.

γ is approximately 7.917, so γ² ≈ 62.7. Then 1/γ² is about 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is approximately 0.98405. So β² ≈ 0.98405 → β ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992 c. Which is a very high speed, as expected for such a high-energy particle.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.992 c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So v ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. Wait, but τ is the dilated lifetime, which I computed earlier as about 6.3336e-15 seconds. So L = v * τ = 2.976e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s.

Let me compute that. 2.976e8 * 6.3336e-15 = let's see. 2.976 * 6.3336 is approximately 18.87. Then, 1e8 * 1e-15 is 1e-7. So 18.87e-7 meters is 1.887e-6 meters. So about 1.887e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, that implies that we need to observe a certain fraction of the decays. So I think that relates to the probability of the decay being detected.

Wait, the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The probability that a decay happens within a certain length x is given by the decay probability formula: P = 1 - e^(-x/L). Because the decay follows an exponential distribution.

So if we want to observe at least 30% of the decays, that means P >= 0.3. So 1 - e^(-x/L) >= 0.3 → e^(-x/L) <= 0.7 → -x/L <= ln(0.7) → x >= L * ln(1/0.7) → ln(1/0.7) is ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567.

So x >= L * 0.3567.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-calculate. Because the formula is P = 1 - exp(-x/L). We want P >= 0.3. So 1 - exp(-x/L) >= 0.3 → exp(-x/L) <= 0.7 → -x/L <= ln(0.7) → x/L >= -ln(0.7) → x >= L * (-ln(0.7)).

Since ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, so -ln(0.7) is 0.35667. So x >= L * 0.35667.

So the minimum x is 0.35667 * L.

Wait, but I calculated L as about 1.887e-6 meters. So x would be 0.35667 * 1.887e-6 m ≈ 0.35667 * 1.887e-6 ≈ approximately 0.673e-6 m, or 6.73e-7 meters. Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, none of them are in that range. Wait, no, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, L was 2.976e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s. Let me compute that exactly: 2.976e8 * 6.3336e-15 = (2.976 * 6.3336) * 1e8 * 1e-15.

2.976 * 6.3336 is approximately: let's compute 3 *6.3336=18.99998, but since 2.976 is 0.024 less than 3, 0.024 *6.3336≈0.152. So 18.99998 -0.152≈18.848.

So 18.848 * 1e-7 = 1.8848e-6 meters. So L is approximately 1.8848e-6 meters.

So x = 0.35667 * 1.8848e-6 m ≈ 0.35667 * 1.8848e-6 ≈ let me compute 0.35667 *1.8848.

0.35667 * 1.8848 ≈ approximately 0.35667 *1.8 ≈ 0.642, and 0.35667 *0.0848≈0.0302. So total around 0.672. So 0.672e-6 meters, which is 6.72e-7 meters. Hmm, but looking at the options, the options are 2.08e-6, 2.08e-9, etc.

Wait, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a second, perhaps I confused the concept here. The question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh! Wait, perhaps the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products, which depends on the decay length. If the decay length is too small, the particles will decay too close together, making it hard to resolve individual decays.

So maybe the minimum resolution required is the length such that 30% of the decays are within that length, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the resolution refers to the detection system's ability to measure the decay point accurately. If the decay length is too small, the particles decay in a region that's too small for the detector to resolve.

Wait, perhaps the question is more straightforward. The minimum resolution needed would be the decay length itself, because if the detector's resolution is better (i.e., can measure smaller distances) than the decay length, it can resolve the decays.

Wait no, perhaps the minimal resolution refers to the uncertainty in the position measurement. But that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying is determined by the proper lifetime, but I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The proper lifetime is τ₀=8e-16 s. The lifetime observed in the lab is τ = γ τ₀ ≈ 7.917 *8e-16 = ~6.33e-15 s. The average decay length L is v τ, which we calculated as ~1.88e-6 m.

If the detector's resolution is the minimum distance it can measure, then to observe the decay, the decay must occur over a distance longer than the detector's resolution. Otherwise, the decays would be too close to distinguish.

Wait, but the question says 'minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.' So perhaps the decay length must be larger than the detector's resolution for a certain fraction of the decays.

Wait, another way: The probability that a decay occurs within a length x is P=1−exp(−x/L). To have at least 30% of decays observed, we set P=0.30.

So 1−exp(−x/L) = 0.3 → exp(−x/L) = 0.7 → x=−L ln(0.7) → x ≈ L * 0.35667.

So x is about 0.35667 * L.

Wait, I calculated L as 1.8848e-6 meters. So x=0.35667 *1.8848e-6 ≈ 0.672e-6 meters, which is 6.72e-7 meters, or 6.72 x10^-7 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, but that's about three times larger than our x value.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating L. Let me recheck. So E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV.

So γ = E/(m c²) → but since E is given in GeV and m c² is in GeV, the units cancel, so γ is 27 /3.41 ≈7.917.

v = β c, where β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) → beta squared is 1 - 1/(7.917)^2 → which is 1 - 1/62.7 → approximately 0.984 → beta ≈ 0.992.

Then L = v * τ = β c * gamma tau0.

Wait, tau is gamma tau0 =7.917 *8e-16 s =6.3336e-15 s.

So L= beta c * gamma tau0.

Compute beta c: 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma tau0: 2.976e8 m/s *6.3336e-15 s.

2.976e8 *6.3336e-15 = let me compute 2.976 *6.3336 ≈ 18.848, and 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7 → 18.848e-7 m → 1.8848e-6 m.

So L ≈1.8848e-6 meters. Then x=0.35667 * L →0.35667 *1.8848e-6 ≈0.672e-6 m →6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. The options are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9 m, etc.

Wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me compute 27 GeV /3.41 GeV. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917 as before.

Wait, let me think again about the L calculation. L= beta c * gamma * tau0.

Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), and L = v tau = beta c tau. But tau is gamma tau0.

So L = beta c gamma tau0.

Alternatively, I could compute L as (beta gamma) c tau0.

Wait, beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma. Let me compute beta gamma:

beta is about 0.992, gamma is 7.917 → beta gamma≈ 0.992 *7.917 ≈7.855.

So L= beta gamma c tau0 → 7.855 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute that: 7.855 *3e8 =2.3565e9 m/s. Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.3565e9 *8e-16 = 1.8852e-6 meters. So same as before.

So L is approximately 1.8852e-6 meters, which is 1.8852 micrometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimal resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So how does that relate to L?

If the detector's spatial resolution is R, then the probability of a decay being observed (i.e., the decay occurring within a distance R from the point of origin) is P=1 - e^{-R/L}.

We need P >= 0.3 → 1 - e^{-R/L} >= 0.3 → e^{-R/L} <= 0.7 → R >= L * ln(1/0.7) → R >= L * 0.3567.

So R is about 0.3567 *1.8852e-6 m → approximately 0.3567 *1.8852e-6 ≈ 0.671e-6 m, which is 6.71e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. The options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, so 6.7e-7 m is about 0.67 micrometers. The closest option is A, which is 2.08e-6 m, but that's about 3 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check the gamma and beta.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

gamma = E/(m c²) → since E is in GeV and m c² is GeV, units are correct. So gamma is 27 /3.41 ≈7.917.

Beta squared = 1 - (1/(gamma^2)) → 1 - 1/(62.7) → 1 - 0.01595 → 0.98405 → beta= sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.99198.

So L= beta * c * gamma * tau0 → beta*gamma is 0.99198 *7.917 ≈7.842.

So L=7.842 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.842 *3e8 = 2.3526e9 m/s. Multiply by 8e-16 s → 2.3526e9 *8e-16 = 1.882e-6 m.

So L=1.882e-6 m → same as before.

Hmm. So the calculation seems correct. So R = 0.3567 * L → 0.3567 *1.882e-6 = approx 0.67e-6 m =6.7e-7 m.

Looking at the options, none is exactly this, but option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 3 times larger than what I found.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Another way to think: the minimum resolution required is the decay length such that 30% of the particles decay within that length. So R is the distance where the probability P is 30%. So maybe I should compute R as L * (1 - e^{-x/L})=0.3.

Wait, no, the formula is P=1 - e^{-x/L}.

We're looking for x such that P=0.3. So x = L * ln(1/(1-P)).

Wait, ln(1/(1-0.3))=ln(1/0.7)=0.35667.

So x=0.35667 * L.

Which again gives x=0.35667 *1.882e-6≈6.7e-7 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution as the decay length L itself. Because, if the detector's resolution is better than L, then it can resolve the decay. But in that case, it's 1.88e-6 m, which is option A (2.08e-6 m). But 1.88 is closer to 2.08, but that's about 10% higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma and beta more accurately.

Gamma: E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

gamma = 27 /3.41 = let's compute that exactly. 3.41 *7 =23.87, 3.41*7.9= 27. 3.41 *7.9 = ?

Wait 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069 → 23.87 +3.069=26.939. So 7.9 gives 26.939 GeV. But E is 27 GeV, so 27 -26.939=0.061 GeV. So 3.41 * x =0.061 → x=0.061/3.41≈0.0179.

So gamma is approximately 7.9 +0.0179≈7.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

Beta squared =1 -1/(gamma^2)=1 – 1/(7.9179^2) →7.9179 squared is 62.700 →1/62.700=0.01595 →1-0.01595=0.98405 → beta= sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So beta=0.9920.

So beta gamma=0.9920 *7.9179 ≈7.854.

So L= beta gamma * c tau0.

c tau0 is the speed of light multiplied by the proper lifetime. c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

c tau0=3e8 *8e-16=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Then, L=7.854 * 2.4e-7 m = let's compute 7.854 *2.4=18.8496 → 18.8496e-7 m →1.88496e-6 m.

So L=1.88496e-6 m.

Hmm, same as before.

So now, R is 0.35667 * L →0.35667 *1.88496e-6 ≈0.672e-6 m →6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed, implying that the detector must be able to measure a path longer than a certain length. But if the decay length is smaller than the detector's resolution, the decays are too close together to be resolved.

Wait, no, if the decay length is larger than the detector's resolution, then the decays can be resolved. Wait, but the decay length is the average distance. So if the detector's resolution (spatial) is R, then to resolve the decay, the decay must occur over a distance longer than R. So perhaps the minimum R needed is such that 30% of decays are at a distance greater than R. Or perhaps the other way.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the detector's ability to measure the decay point. If the decay occurs over a small length, the detector can't resolve it. So to observe the decay, the decay length must be larger than the detector's resolution. So the minimum resolution R is such that L is about equal to R.

Wait, but in that case, the R would be about 1.88e-6 m, which is option A (2.08e-6 m). But 1.88 is less than 2.08. Hmm, perhaps the actual calculation with more precise numbers gives a higher value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the probability but about the decay length itself. So perhaps the minimum resolution is just the decay length, which is 1.88e-6 m, which is option A, 2.08e-6 m. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me compute E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

gamma = E/(m c^2) → since E is in GeV and m c² is in GeV, this is 27/3.41=7.9179.

Yes, correct.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the decay length in meters.

L = beta * gamma * c * tau0.

beta is 0.9920, gamma=7.9179, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=0.9920 *7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 0.9920 *7.9179 → approximately 7.854.

Then, 7.854 *3e8 =2.3562e9. Multiply by 8e-16 → 2.3562e9 *8e-16 =1.88496e-6 m.

So L=1.88496e-6 m.

So again, same as before.

So the minimum resolution would need to be at least as good as L, but perhaps the problem is referring to the minimum resolution as the decay length itself. So if the detector has a resolution (i.e., can measure down to) 1.88e-6 m, then it can observe the decay.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine my calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given in GeV, but I should have considered units correctly when computing gamma. Let me see:

E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c².

So gamma = E/(m c²) → but E is in GeV, m c^2 is (3.41 GeV/c²)*c²=3.41 GeV.

So gamma is 27 GeV /3.41 GeV =7.9179, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that E is the total energy, which includes the rest mass. So gamma is E/(m c²) =27/3.41=7.9179.

Another thought: perhaps the lifetime is given in tau_0 =8e-16 seconds. Maybe I should compute the lab frame lifetime correctly.

Wait, I did compute tau = gamma tau0 =7.9179 *8e-16 ≈6.334e-15 s.

So L= beta gamma c tau0 → which is 7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 →2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.854 →2.4e-7 *7.854 ≈1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution as the proper length, but that doesn't make sense because proper length is zero in the rest frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mean decay length and then find the resolution based on that.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the mean decay length is about 1.88e-6 meters. So the detector needs to have a resolution (ability to measure) at least that. So the minimum resolution R is 1.88e-6 m. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

B) 2.08e-9 m → 2.08 nanometers.

C) 2.08e-1 m →20.8 cm.

D) 2.08e-3 m →2.08 mm.

So option A is 2.08e-6 m. Which is about 10% larger than our calculated 1.88e-6 m. Maybe the exact calculation gives 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma =27 /3.41 = ?

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.41 *0.9=3.069 → so 7.9 → 23.87 +3.069=26.939.

27-26.939=0.061.

So 0.061 /3.41 =0.01789.

So gamma=7.91789.

So gamma ≈7.91789.

Beta squared =1 – (1/gamma^2) →1 – (1/(7.91789)^2).

Compute 7.91789^2:

7.91789^2 → let's compute 7.9^2=62.41.

7.91789^2 = (7.9 +0.01789)^2 =7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.01789 + (0.01789)^2.

7.9^2=62.41.

2*7.9*0.01789≈ 15.8 *0.01789≈0.2836.

(0.01789)^2≈0.000320.

So total ≈62.41 +0.2836=62.6936 +0.00032≈62.6939.

So 1/gamma^2=1/62.6939≈0.015947.

So beta squared=1 –0.015947=0.984053.

Beta= sqrt(0.984053)= let's compute.

0.992^2=0.984064, which is very close to 0.984053.

So beta= approximately 0.992 – let's compute the exact value.

(0.992)^2 =0.984064.

We have 0.984053, which is 0.000011 less.

So, 0.992^2=0.984064 → so we need beta^2=0.984053 → difference is 0.984053-0.984064= -0.000011.

So beta=0.992 – delta.

Let me compute (0.992 - delta)^2 ≈0.984053.

Expanding (a - d)^2 =a² -2 a d +d².

a=0.992, a²=0.984064.

So 0.984064 - 2*0.992*delta + delta^2 =0.984053.

Neglecting delta^2, we have:

0.984064 -1.984 delta ≈0.984053 → 0.984064 -0.984053 =1.984 delta → 0.000011=1.984 delta → delta≈0.000011 /1.984 ≈5.54e-6.

So beta≈0.992 –0.00000554≈0.99199446.

So beta=0.99199446.

So beta gamma=0.99199446 *7.91789.

Compute that:

0.99199446 *7 =6.94396.

0.99199446 *0.91789 → let's compute that.

0.99199446 *0.9 =0.892795.

0.99199446 *0.01789≈0.01774.

So sum is 0.892795 +0.01774=0.910535.

So total beta gamma ≈6.94396 +0.910535=7.854495.

So beta gamma≈7.8545.

So L= beta gamma * c * tau0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

c*tau0=3e8 *8e-16=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

L=7.8545 *2.4e-7 =18.8508e-7 m =1.88508e-6 m.

So L≈1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, same as before.

So the minimum resolution R would be when P=30%, so R=0.35667 * L=0.35667 *1.885e-6≈0.671e-6 m.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the decay length L itself, which is ~1.885e-6 m. But the options don't have that; option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different gamma calculation. Let me recheck: gamma=E/(m c²) → E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma=27/3.41=7.9179.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires using relativistic momentum or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity using E = gamma m c² → which I did, so beta = v/c.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the calculation is done using the lab frame lifetime, but I'm not considering relativistic effects correctly. Or perhaps the energy is given as the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But the problem states the energy is 27 GeV, which I assume is the total energy.

Wait, the problem says 'the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV.' So that should be the total energy E=K +m c²=27 GeV.

So m c² is 3.41 GeV, so K=27 –3.41=23.59 GeV.

So gamma is E/(m c²)=27/3.41=7.9179, as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation is correct but the options don't match. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the proper lifetime. No, because the proper lifetime is given as tau0=8e-16 s.

Wait, no, the decay length in the lab frame is based on the lab lifetime, which is longer.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the minimum resolution as the length that corresponds to 30% of the decay probability. So R= L * ln(2) → but earlier calculation shows that for 30% probability, R is about 0.356 L.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be L multiplied by a different factor. Let me think of the formula again.

P =1 - e^{-x/L} ≥ 0.3 → x ≥ L ln(1/(1-0.3)) → x= L ln(1/0.7)= L * 0.35667.

So that's what I did.

But perhaps the problem is looking for the minimum resolution in terms of the proper length, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the average decay length, which is L=1.885e-6 m, and the minimal resolution is equal to that, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma using E= (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So E=27 GeV, m c²=3.41 GeV.

So (pc)^2 = E² – (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 =27² –3.41² =729 – 11.6281=717.3719 → pc= sqrt(717.3719)=26.78 GeV/c.

So p=26.78 GeV/c.

Gamma is E/(m c²)=27/3.41=7.9179.

But another way to compute beta is beta = (pc²)/(E). Because p c = (gamma m v) → and E=gamma m c² → so beta = (p c²) / E = (26.78 GeV/c * c²) /27 GeV → units check: GeV cancels, c cancels, so beta=26.78 c /27 → wait, no.

Wait, pc is in GeV/c, so pc c is GeV.

Wait, beta = p c / E → because p c is GeV, E is GeV.

So beta= (26.78 GeV) /27 GeV ≈0.99185.

So same as before.

So beta=0.99185.

So then, L=beta *c *gamma *tau0.

Which is 0.99185 *3e8 m/s *7.9179 *8e-16 s.

Wait, 8e-16 s is tau0.

Wait, no, tau is gamma tau0, so L= beta c * tau.

Tau= gamma tau0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.3343e-15 s.

So L=0.99185 *3e8 *6.3343e-15.

Compute that: 0.99185 *3e8 =2.97555e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3343e-15 s: 2.97555e8 *6.3343e-15 = (2.97555 *6.3343) *1e-7.

2.97555 *6.3343 ≈ about 18.85.

So 18.85e-7 m=1.885e-6 m.

Same result again.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, option A is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the proper lifetime is given as tau0=8e-16 s, but the lab frame uses tau=gamma tau0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s.

But perhaps I mixed up the energy and mass. Let me check again: the mass is 3.41 GeV, and the energy is27 GeV. So gamma=27/3.41=7.9179.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires using the speed as a fraction of light speed correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v as (pc²)/E. Because p=E beta/gamma. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, another formula: beta = pc/(E) → pc is 26.78 GeV, E is 27 GeV → beta=26.78/27≈0.99185.

So same as before.

I think I've done everything correctly. So the minimum resolution needed is approximately 1.88e-6 m, but the options don't have that. So perhaps it's a typo in the options, and option A is the intended answer, 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the speed of light as 3e8 m/s, but perhaps more accurately, c=2.99792e8 m/s.

Let me recompute L using c=2.99792e8 m/s.

L=beta gamma c tau0.

Beta gamma=7.8545, c=2.99792e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.8545 *2.99792e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.8545 *2.99792e8 →7.8545 *2.99792=23.536 → 23.536e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s →23.536e8 *8e-16=23.536 *8 *1e-8=188.288e-8 m=1.88288e-6 m.

Still same result.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A (2.08e-6 m), considering some approximation during calculations. So I'll go with option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \) with the following given parameters:

- Proper lifetime of \( X^0 \): \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \),
- Energy of \( X^0 \): \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Mass of \( X^0 \): \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The lifetime of \( X^0 \) in the lab frame is extended due to time dilation:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0,
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9179.
   \]
   Substituting \( \tau_0 \):
   \[
   \tau = 7.9179 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Decay Length**:  
   The average distance \( X^0 \) travels before decaying (decay length) is:
   \[
   L = v \tau,
   \]
   where \( v \) is the velocity of \( X^0 \). Using the relation \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \), we find:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.9179^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \approx 0.992.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   v = \beta c \approx 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \tau \):
   \[
   L = (2.976 \times 10^8) \times (6.334 \times 10^{-15}) \approx 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

3. **Minimum Resolution for 30% Detection**:  
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the probability of decay within a distance \( x \) is given by:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-x/L}.
   \]
   Setting \( P = 0.3 \):
   \[
   1 - e^{-x/L} = 0.3 \implies e^{-x/L} = 0.7 \implies x = L \ln(1/0.7).
   \]
   Using \( \ln(1/0.7) \approx 0.3567 \):
   \[
   x = 0.3567 \times L \approx 0.3567 \times 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated minimum resolution \( x \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), which is approximately three times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or rounding in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Given the options, the closest match to the calculated minimum resolution is \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Therefore, the answer is:

**Answer: A**
