Okay, so I've got this problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their time slows down relative to a stationary observer. But wait, how does that work exactly?

The question is about an astronaut traveling to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long the trip will take from their own perspective.

Wait, I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, right? Because from Earth's frame of reference, the trip would take longer, but the astronaut's own time would be less due to time dilation.

But first, I should figure out how far away the Large Magellanic Cloud is from Earth. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give that distance. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about applying time dilation formula correctly.

Wait, no, the question is about the astronaut's experienced time, which is their proper time. So I need to calculate the proper time for the journey.

But wait, do I have enough data? Let me read the question again.

The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. The astronaut's average lifetime is around 150 solar years, but that's probably not directly relevant here. The key is the time experienced by the astronaut.

So the formula for time dilation is based on the Lorentz factor gamma (γ). The formula is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then, the proper time τ is equal to the time measured in the spaceship's frame, which is the astronaut's time. The proper time is related to the time in the Earth's frame (t) by τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is the same as τ = t / γ.

But wait, I don't know the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh wait, perhaps that's given as a standard distance? Or maybe it's implied that the distance is such that the time would be a certain value.

Wait, wait, no, the question is about the astronaut's experienced time, which is the proper time. But without knowing the distance, how can I calculate that? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the problem expects me to calculate how much time passes on Earth and then apply time dilation to find the astronaut's time.

Wait, let's think. The distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately about 163,000 light-years. Wait, no, I think I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. But wait, is that correct? I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but let's say it's roughly 160,000 light-years. So the distance is approximately 160,000 ly.

So, the time for the journey, from Earth's perspective, would be distance divided by speed. The speed is 0.99999987c. So the time t_earth is (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 * c) = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 years. Wait, that can't be right because 160,000 ly divided by a speed almost c would be about 160,000 years. But that seems way too long.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me compute that again. If the speed is v = 0.99999987c, then the time from Earth's perspective is t = distance / v. So if distance D is 160,000 light-years, then t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) = (160,000 / 0.99999987) * (ly / c) * (1 year per ly / c). Wait, because light travels 1 ly in a year. So, ly/c = year.

So, t = (160,000 / 0.99999987) years ≈ approximately 160,000 / 1 = 160,000 years. Wait, but that's a really long time. The astronaut's lifetime is only 150 years, but wait, the astronaut is 22 now. So if the trip takes 160,000 years from Earth's perspective, and the astronaut's lifetime is about 150 solar years, the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. But wait, the options don't mention 160,000 years. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the distance is much smaller. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the distance as the average distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is about 160,000 ly, but maybe I'm supposed to use that the time from the astronaut's perspective is much less due to time dilation.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes, say, 70 years from the astronaut's perspective, they would be 92 when they arrive. That would make sense. But if the trip takes longer, perhaps they wouldn't make it.

Wait, let's compute the gamma factor first. v = 0.99999987c. Let me compute v²/c².

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ (1 - 1.3e-7)² ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7, and sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So gamma is 1 / (5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78.

So gamma is approximately 1960.

So from Earth's frame, the time taken is t_earth = D / v. Let's compute that with D = 160,000 ly.

t_earth = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years (approx 160,000).

But wait, that can't be right because the spaceship is moving so fast. Or wait, no, 0.99999987c is so close to c that the time is almost the same as the distance in light-years. So 160,000 ly / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years.

But then, the proper time τ experienced by the astronaut is τ = t_earth / gamma.

So τ = 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ approximately 81.4 years.

Wait, that's about 81 years. So the astronaut is 22 now, and the trip would take about 81 years from their perspective. So their age upon arrival would be 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than 150, so they'd live to see it.

But wait, the options don't have 81.4, but option C is 81 years. So that's probably the answer. But let me double-check.

Wait, but the problem says the average lifetime is 150 years, so if the trip takes about 81, they would live.

Wait, but the options are A to D, with D being 77, C 81. So if my calculation is around 81.4, then option C is the correct one.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute that.

0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is approximately 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Because 1e-7 is 1e-3.5^2.

sqrt(2.6) is approx 1.612. 1e-3.5 is approximately 3.16e-4, because 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001, so 3.16e-4 is approx 0.000316.

So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So let's say gamma is approximately 1964.

t_earth is 160,000 ly divided by (0.99999987 c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.0002 years (since 1/0.99999987 is approx 1.00000013).

So t_earth ≈ 160,000 years.

Proper time τ = t_earth / gamma = 160,000 / 1964 ≈ 160000 / 1964 ≈ let's compute that.

1964 * 81 = ?

1964 * 80 = 157,120.

1964 * 1 = 1,964. So 157,120 + 1,964 = 159,084. So 81 * 1964 = 159,084, which is less than 160,000.

The difference is 160,000 - 159,084 = 916.

So 916 / 1964 ≈ approximately 0.466 years, about 5.6 months.

So τ ≈81.466 years. So approximately 81.5 years.

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years, so that's the closest.

Wait, but another thought: when you travel at 0.99999987c, the distance measured in the astronaut's frame is contracted. So the distance D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / gamma.

So D' = 160,000 ly / 1964 ≈81.46 ly.

The time experienced by the astronaut is D' / v = (81.46 ly) / (0.99999987 c) ≈81.46 / 0.99999987 ≈81.46 years.

So yes, same result.

So the astronaut would live about 81 years during the trip, so they would reach Earth at the age of 22 +81=103, which is well within their 150-year lifespan. So the answer is option C, 81 years.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations again because the numbers are tight.

Calculating gamma: v=0.99999987c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000001.

1 - v^2/c^2 = 2.6e-7.

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)=sqrt(2.6e-7)= around 5.099e-4.

gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈1961.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought gamma was 1964, but recalculating, 1/5.099e-4 is approximately 1961. So let's use gamma=1961.

t_earth = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987 c) ≈160,000 / ~1 ≈160,000 years.

Proper time τ = t_earth / gamma =160000 /1961≈81.45 years.

So around 81.45 years.

So the astronaut would take about 81 years of their life to reach Earth. So option C is 81.

Wait, but the problem is that the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years. Did I use the right number? Because using 160,000 gives us 81 years, but if it's 163,000, the time would be a bit longer.

t_earth =163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000 years.

Proper time τ=163,000 /1961≈83.1 years. Hmm, which would be more than 81, but perhaps the problem uses a rounded figure.

But the question says the average lifetime is 150 years, so an 81-year trip is feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate without considering the exact distance, but the problem seems to imply that the distance is known. Wait, the question doesn't provide the distance, so perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says the astronaut is 22 now, and wants to know how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options are A to D.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question expects me to calculate using the time experienced by the astronaut without considering the actual distance, but using the velocity and the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but without knowing the distance, I can't find the time experienced. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the distance is such that the trip time from Earth's frame is much longer, but the astronaut's time is manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intending us to compute the time experienced based on the velocity, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Let me think: the speed is so high, but the astronaut's perspective is that the distance is contracted. So the time experienced is distance_contracted / speed.

Wait, the proper time is the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the same as the time in their rest frame. So the contracted distance is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / gamma.

So time τ = D' / v = (D / gamma) / v = D/(v gamma).

But D is the distance in Earth's frame, which is 160,000 ly.

So τ = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c * gamma).

But gamma is 1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈1961.

So τ = (160,000 * 1 ly) / (0.99999987 * c * 1961) 

Since 1 ly is 1 light-year, which is the distance light travels in a year. And c is 1 ly/year.

So the denominator is 0.99999987 * 1961 ≈ approx 1960.78 (since 0.99999987 is nearly 1).

So τ = 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈81.4 years.

So same as before.

Thus, the correct answer is C) 81 years.

But let me check the options again. Option C is 81, which matches.

So the astronaut will experience about 81 years of their life during the trip and will reach Earth at the age of 22 +81=103, which is within their 150-year lifespan. So they will make it. Thus, the answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D = 160,000 \, \text{ly} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]
First, compute \( v^2/c^2 \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]
Then, \( 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6 \times 10^{-7} \). Taking the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{-4}
\]
Thus:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{5.09 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1961
\]

### Step 2: Time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, \( \tau \))
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \)) by:
\[
\tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma}
\]
First, calculate \( t_{\text{Earth}} \), the time it takes for the journey from Earth's perspective:
\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]
Now, calculate \( \tau \):
\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{1961} \approx 81.4 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Interpretation
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. After traveling for approximately 81 years (from their perspective), they will reach Earth at the age of \( 22 + 81 = 103 \), which is well within their average lifetime of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the trip.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** Incorrect. The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth, as the trip takes about 81 years, which is shorter than their lifespan.
- **B)** Incorrect. The time is not 72 years; the calculation shows approximately 81 years.
- **C)** Correct. The proper time experienced by the astronaut is approximately 81 years.
- **D)** Incorrect. The time is not 77 years; the calculation shows approximately 81 years.

### Final Answer:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. 

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their time slows down relative to a stationary observer. But wait, how does that work exactly?

The question is about an astronaut traveling to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long the trip will take from their own perspective.

Wait, I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, right? Because from Earth's frame of reference, the trip would take longer, but the astronaut's own time would be less due to time dilation.

But first, I should figure out how far away the Large Magellanic Cloud is from Earth. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give that distance. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about applying time dilation formula correctly.

Wait, no, the question is about the astronaut's experienced time, which is their proper time. So I need to calculate the proper time for the journey.

But wait, do I have enough data? Let me read the question again.

Then, the proper time τ is equal to the time measured in the spaceship's frame, which is the astronaut's time. The proper time is related to the time in the Earth's frame (t) by τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is the same as τ = t / γ.

But wait, I don't know the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh wait, perhaps that's given as a standard distance? Or maybe it's implied that the distance is such that the time would be a certain value.

Wait, wait, no, the question is about the astronaut's experienced time, which is the proper time. But without knowing the distance, how can I calculate that? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the problem expects me to calculate how much time passes on Earth and then apply time dilation to find the astronaut's time.

Wait, let's think. The distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately about 163,000 light-years. Wait, no, I think I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. But wait, is that correct? I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but let's say it's roughly 160,000 light-years. So the distance is approximately 160,000 ly.

So, the time for the journey, from Earth's perspective, would be distance divided by speed. The speed is 0.99999987c. So the time t_earth is (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 * c) = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 years. Wait, that can't be right because 160,000 ly divided by a speed almost c would be about 160,000 years. But that seems way too long.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me compute that again. If the speed is v = 0.99999987c, then the time from Earth's perspective is t = distance / v. So if distance D is 160,000 light-years, then t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) = (160,000 / 0.99999987) * (ly / c) * (1 year per ly / c). Wait, because light travels 1 ly in a year. So, ly/c = year.

So, t = (160,000 / 0.99999987) years ≈ approximately 160,000 / 1 = 160,000 years. Wait, but that's a really long time. The astronaut's lifetime is only 150 years, but wait, the astronaut is 22 now. So if the trip takes 160,000 years from Earth's perspective, and the astronaut's lifetime is about 150 solar years, the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. But wait, the options don't mention 160,000 years. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the distance is much smaller. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the distance as the average distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is about 160,000 ly, but maybe I'm supposed to use that the time from the astronaut's perspective is much less due to time dilation.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes, say, 70 years from the astronaut's perspective, they would be 92 when they arrive. That would make sense. But if the trip takes longer, perhaps they wouldn't make it.

Wait, let's compute the gamma factor first. v = 0.99999987c. Let me compute v²/c².

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ (1 - 1.3e-7)² ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7, and sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So gamma is 1 / (5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78.

So gamma is approximately 1960.

So from Earth's frame, the time taken is t_earth = D / v. Let's compute that with D = 160,000 ly.

t_earth = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years (approx 160,000).

But wait, that can't be right because the spaceship is moving so fast. Or wait, no, 0.99999987c is so close to c that the time is almost the same as the distance in light-years. So 160,000 ly / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years.

But then, the proper time τ experienced by the astronaut is τ = t_earth / gamma.

So τ = 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ approximately 81.4 years.

Wait, that's about 81 years. So the astronaut is 22 now, and the trip would take about 81 years from their perspective. So their age upon arrival would be 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than 150, so they'd live to see it.

But wait, the options don't have 81.4, but option C is 81 years. So that's probably the answer. But let me double-check.

Wait, but the problem says the average lifetime is 150 years, so if the trip takes about 81, they would live.

Wait, but the options are A to D, with D being 77, C 81. So if my calculation is around 81.4, then option C is the correct one.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute that.

0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is approximately 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Because 1e-7 is 1e-3.5^2.

sqrt(2.6) is approx 1.612. 1e-3.5 is approximately 3.16e-4, because 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001, so 3.16e-4 is approx 0.000316.

So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So let's say gamma is approximately 1964.

t_earth is 160,000 ly divided by (0.99999987 c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.0002 years (since 1/0.99999987 is approx 1.00000013).

So t_earth ≈ 160,000 years.

Proper time τ = t_earth / gamma = 160,000 / 1964 ≈ 160000 / 1964 ≈ let's compute that.

1964 * 81 = ?

1964 * 80 = 157,120.

1964 * 1 = 1,964. So 157,120 + 1,964 = 159,084. So 81 * 1964 = 159,084, which is less than 160,000.

The difference is 160,000 - 159,084 = 916.

So 916 / 1964 ≈ approximately 0.466 years, about 5.6 months.

So τ ≈81.466 years. So approximately 81.5 years.

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years, so that's the closest.

Wait, but another thought: when you travel at 0.99999987c, the distance measured in the astronaut's frame is contracted. So the distance D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / gamma.

So D' = 160,000 ly / 1964 ≈81.46 ly.

The time experienced by the astronaut is D' / v = (81.46 ly) / (0.99999987 c) ≈81.46 / 0.99999987 ≈81.46 years.

So yes, same result.

So the astronaut would live about 81 years during the trip, so they would reach Earth at the age of 22 +81=103, which is well within their 150-year lifespan. So the answer is option C, 81 years.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations again because the numbers are tight.

Calculating gamma: v=0.99999987c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000001.

1 - v^2/c^2 = 2.6e-7.

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)=sqrt(2.6e-7)= around 5.099e-4.

gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈1961.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought gamma was 1964, but recalculating, 1/5.099e-4 is approximately 1961. So let's use gamma=1961.

t_earth = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987 c) ≈160,000 / ~1 ≈160,000 years.

Proper time τ = t_earth / gamma =160000 /1961≈81.45 years.

So around 81.45 years.

So the astronaut would take about 81 years of their life to reach Earth. So option C is 81.

Wait, but the problem is that the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years. Did I use the right number? Because using 160,000 gives us 81 years, but if it's 163,000, the time would be a bit longer.

t_earth =163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000 years.

Proper time τ=163,000 /1961≈83.1 years. Hmm, which would be more than 81, but perhaps the problem uses a rounded figure.

But the question says the average lifetime is 150 years, so an 81-year trip is feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate without considering the exact distance, but the problem seems to imply that the distance is known. Wait, the question doesn't provide the distance, so perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says the astronaut is 22 now, and wants to know how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options are A to D.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question expects me to calculate using the time experienced by the astronaut without considering the actual distance, but using the velocity and the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but without knowing the distance, I can't find the time experienced. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the distance is such that the trip time from Earth's frame is much longer, but the astronaut's time is manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intending us to compute the time experienced based on the velocity, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Let me think: the speed is so high, but the astronaut's perspective is that the distance is contracted. So the time experienced is distance_contracted / speed.

Wait, the proper time is the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the same as the time in their rest frame. So the contracted distance is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / gamma.

So time τ = D' / v = (D / gamma) / v = D/(v gamma).

But D is the distance in Earth's frame, which is 160,000 ly.

So τ = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c * gamma).

But gamma is 1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈1961.

So τ = (160,000 * 1 ly) / (0.99999987 * c * 1961) 

Since 1 ly is 1 light-year, which is the distance light travels in a year. And c is 1 ly/year.

So the denominator is 0.99999987 * 1961 ≈ approx 1960.78 (since 0.99999987 is nearly 1).

So τ = 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈81.4 years.

So same as before.

Thus, the correct answer is C) 81 years.

But let me check the options again. Option C is 81, which matches.

So the astronaut will experience about 81 years of their life during the trip and will reach Earth at the age of 22 +81=103, which is within their 150-year lifespan. So they will make it. Thus, the answer is C.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D = 160,000 \, \text{ly} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]
First, compute \( v^2/c^2 \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]
Then, \( 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6 \times 10^{-7} \). Taking the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{-4}
\]
Thus:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{5.09 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1961
\]

### Step 2: Time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, \( \tau \))
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \)) by:
\[
\tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma}
\]
First, calculate \( t_{\text{Earth}} \), the time it takes for the journey from Earth's perspective:
\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]
Now, calculate \( \tau \):
\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{1961} \approx 81.4 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Interpretation
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. After traveling for approximately 81 years (from their perspective), they will reach Earth at the age of \( 22 + 81 = 103 \), which is well within their average lifetime of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the trip.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** Incorrect. The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth, as the trip takes about 81 years, which is shorter than their lifespan.
- **B)** Incorrect. The time is not 72 years; the calculation shows approximately 81 years.
- **C)** Correct. The proper time experienced by the astronaut is approximately 81 years.
- **D)** Incorrect. The time is not 77 years; the calculation shows approximately 81 years.

### Final Answer:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey.
