Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The situation is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spotted hemispheres. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes—like a light curve. The question says this setup can resemble an exoplanet's effect. So, they're asking, if there were no spots, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation (amplitude) in the star's light curve?

Hmm, right. So, I need to find Rpl divided by Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's.

First, I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets is when a planet passes in front of the star, blocking some light. The change in brightness is proportional to the area blocked, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Because the area is πR², so when you take the ratio, Rpl²/Rstar², you take the square root for the amplitude.

But wait, this question is about spots instead. So the star's brightness variation is due to spots rotating into and out of view, not a planet transiting. But the effect on the light curve's amplitude is similar—so we can model them both as causing dips in brightness.

So, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The brightness dip depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference compared to the rest of the star.

Let me think about the flux from the star. The star emits a certain amount of light, and the spots emit less because they're cooler. So when the spots are facing us, the total flux decreases.

The total flux from the star without any spots would be L = 4πRstar²σTeff^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But when there are spots, the flux is less when the spots are visible.

The spots have an area. Let's calculate the area of the spotted region. The problem says one hemisphere is covered, with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

The area of a hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000K = 5000K, I think. Wait, the temperature difference is 1000K, but are the spots hotter or cooler? The problem says "temperature difference of 1000K." Well, dark spots are usually cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so I'm guessing the spots are at 5000K. But the exact might matter, but let's proceed.

The flux without spots is L = 4πR²σTeff^4.

The flux with spots would be L = L_total - (area of spots) * σ T_spot^4 + (area of spots) * σ Teff^4? Wait, no, because when the spots are facing us, their contribution is lower. So perhaps the total flux is L_total = (1 - filling factor) * σ Teff^4 * 4πR² + filling factor * σ (T_spot)^4 * 4πR².

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the average flux when the spots are visible. The star's total flux when the spots are visible would be the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

So, the fraction of the star's surface that's spotted is the filling factor multiplied by the fraction of the hemisphere that's visible. Wait, the star is a sphere, and each hemisphere is 2πR². But when we look at the star, only a hemisphere is visible at any time. The problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots" — so when the star rotates, this hemisphere comes into view. So when that hemisphere is visible, the spots are covering 20% of it. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR².

So, the flux when the star is showing the spotted hemisphere is:

Flux_spotted = [ (2πR² - 0.4πR²) * σ Teff^4 ] + [ 0.4πR² * σ (Teff - 1000K)^4 ]

Wait, because the rest of the hemisphere is at Teff, and the spots are at lower temperature.

The unspotted area is (2πR²) * (1 - 0.2) = 1.6πR². So the flux is the sum of the unspotted part and the spotted part.

So Flux_spotted = (1.6πR²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4πR²) * σ (5000)^4.

The total flux without any spots would be when the star isn't spotted, so when the other hemisphere is showing. But wait, the star's other hemisphere doesn't have spots, right? Because the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star isn't showing the spotty hemisphere, the entire hemisphere we see is at Teff.

So, the maximum flux is when we see the unspotted hemisphere: Flux_max = 2πR² σ (6000)^4.

The minimum flux is when the spotty hemisphere is visible, which is Flux_spotted.

The variation in flux is Flux_max - Flux_spotted.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots would be (Flux_max - Flux_spotted)/Flux_max.

Then, the question says that this amplitude should be the same as that caused by a transit of an exoplanet. So the amplitude from the planet (which is a dip when the planet transits) is (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π Rpl² / π Rstar²) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, no. The transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is (Rpl²/Rstar²). So the dip in brightness is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But in the case of the spots, the dip is (Flux_max - Flux_spotted)/Flux_max. So we set this equal to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So, let me compute the flux difference.

Compute Flux_max = 2πR² σ (6000)^4.

Flux_spotted = (1.6πR² σ (6000)^4) + (0.4πR² σ (5000)^4).

So Flux_spotted = 1.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (5000)^4. But wait, all terms have 2πR² σ, which is a common factor, so when we take the ratio, these factors cancel out.

So, the amplitude is (Flux_max - Flux_spotted) / Flux_max.

Compute:

Flux_max = 2*(6000)^4.

Flux_spotted = 1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4.

So, Flux_max - Flux_spotted = 2*(6000)^4 - [1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4] = (2 -1.6)(6000^4) - 0.4*(5000^4) = 0.4*(6000^4) - 0.4*(5000^4) = 0.4 [6000^4 -5000^4].

So, the amplitude is [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4)] / (2*6000^4).

Simplify:

Amplitude = [0.4 (6^4 -5^4) ] / (2*6^4 ), since we can factor out 1000^4.

Compute 6^4: 6*6=36; 36*6=216; 216*6=1296.

5^4: 5*5=25; 25*5=125; 125*5=625.

So 6^4 -5^4 = 1296 - 625 = 671.

So, Amplitude = [0.4 * 671 ] / (2 * 1296) 

Compute numerator: 0.4 * 671 = 268.4.

Denominator: 2 * 1296 = 2592.

So Amplitude = 268.4 / 2592 ≈ let's compute that.

268.4 / 2592 ≈ approximately 0.1035.

Wait, 2592 * 0.1 is 259.2, so 259.2 is 10%, so 268.4 is about 10.35% of 2592.

So approximately 0.1035, or about 10.35% amplitude.

So, the brightness variation due to the spots is about 10.35% of the maximum flux.

Now, the exoplanet transit would cause a dip of (Rpl / Rstar)^2. So we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The amplitude is the change in brightness. For the exoplanet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So to find Rpl/Rstar, take the square root of the amplitude.

sqrt(0.1035) = approx 0.3217.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3217.

Looking at the options: Option D is ~0.32. Option A is ~0.39, C is ~0.11.

Wait, 0.32 is close to 0.3217, so option D is the answer.

Wait a minute, did I make any mistake?

Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun.

Wait, the star is a G-type star, similar to the Sun, radius same as Sun. So, Rpl is the radius of the planet, and Rstar is the same as R_sun.

So the calculation is correct.

But let me double-check my steps:

- Calculated the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

- Subtracted to get the amplitude.

- Set that equal to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

- Solved for Rpl/Rstar.

Another point to check: the star's effective temperature is 6000K, but the spots are 1000K cooler. So 5000K.

Wait, but when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere, the total flux is the sum of the unspotted part (1.6π R² * σ (6000)^4) and the spotted part (0.4π R² * σ (5000)^4).

Flux_spotted = 1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4. All terms multiplied by π R² σ, which cancels in the ratio.

Flux_max is 2*(6000)^4.

So the amplitude is (2*(6000)^4 - (1.6*(6000)^4 +0.4*(5000)^4 )) / (2*(6000)^4 )

= (0.4*(6000^4) - 0.4*(5000^4)) / (2*(6000^4)).

= 0.4/(2) * (6000^4 -5000^4)/(6000^4)

= 0.2 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Wait, wait, maybe that's a better way to compute it.

Because (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4.

So, let me calculate 5000/6000 =5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 = ?

0.8333^2 is about 0.6944. Square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Then, amplitude = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, same as before.

So, Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Which matches option D: ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) in the star's light curve as the spotted hemisphere, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( L_{\text{max}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), as only one hemisphere is visible at a time.
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux in this case is:
     \[
     L_{\text{spotted}} = (1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4),
     \]
     where \( 1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the unspotted area and \( 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the spotted area.

3. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude is the fractional change in flux:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{L_{\text{max}} - L_{\text{spotted}}}{L_{\text{max}}}.
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( L_{\text{max}} \) and \( L_{\text{spotted}} \), the amplitude simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spots}}^4)}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
     \]
   - Canceling common terms:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{2 \cdot 6000^4}.
     \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Compute \( 6000^4 = 1296 \times 10^6 \) and \( 5000^4 = 625 \times 10^6 \).
   - \( 6000^4 - 5000^4 = 671 \times 10^6 \).
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 671}{2 \cdot 1296} = \frac{268.4}{2592} \approx 0.1035.
     \]

5. **Exoplanet Transit Signal**:
   - The transit depth caused by an exoplanet is proportional to \( (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \).
   - Setting \( (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 = 0.1035 \), we solve for \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
