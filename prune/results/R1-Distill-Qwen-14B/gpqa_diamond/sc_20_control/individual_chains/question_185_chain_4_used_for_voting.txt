Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues are the possible outcomes when you measure an observable, and the Hamiltonian represents the energy of the system. 

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. Oh wait, right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each being 2x2 matrices. The dot product σ · n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix product depend on the components. But wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1 when acting on their respective eigenstates. But when they are multiplied by a scalar and added together, like in this case, how does that affect the eigenvalues?

Oh, wait, I remember that the square of the Pauli vector σ · n is (σ · n)^2. Let's compute that. Since σ_i are Pauli matrices, their squares are identity matrices. Also, the cross terms would involve anticommutation. 

So (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2 = n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + cross terms. 

Each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), so the first part becomes n_x² I + n_y² I + n_z² I. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So that part is I.

What about the cross terms? σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k. So when i≠j, the product σ_i σ_j is i times the epsilon (which is antisymmetric). But when you expand (σ · n)^2, the cross terms would be 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + 2n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + 2n_y n_z σ_y σ_z.

Wait, but when you square, you have each term appearing twice, hence the 2. But perhaps a smarter way exists. Alternatively, I remember that (σ · n)^2 = I, because (σ · n) is a unit vector operator. Because n is a unit vector, the square of σ · n would be the identity matrix. So (σ · n)^2 = I.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The operator σ · n is a 2x2 matrix. The trace is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector. But the square of σ · n... Let me compute it again.

Each Pauli matrix squared is I, so (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x +n_y σ_y +n_z σ_z)^2 = n_x² I + n_y² I + n_z² I + 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z )

But σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, σ_x σ_z = -i σ_y, σ_y σ_z = i σ_x. Let me substitute these:

= (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I + 2(n_x n_y i σ_z + n_x n_z (-i σ_y) + n_y n_z i σ_x )

But n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So:

= I + 2i [n_x n_y σ_z - n_x n_z σ_y + n_y n_z σ_x ]

Hmm, but this doesn't look like a simple multiple of I. Wait, but I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps (σ · n) squared equals I, because the magnitude of the spin operator in that direction would have eigenvalues ±1. Because when you have an operator like σ · n, which is a spin component along a direction, its eigenvalues are ±1. So, the eigenvalues of σ · n are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H would be ε times those, so ±ε.

Wait, but let me think about the eigenvalues. Suppose H = ε (σ ·n). Since σ ·n is a Hermitian operator (Pauli matrices are Hermitian, n has real components), its eigenvalues are real. Let's denote λ as an eigenvalue of σ ·n. Then, H would have eigenvalues ε λ.

What's λ? Since σ ·n is a Hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues are the solutions to det( (σ ·n) - λ I ) = 0. But the trace of σ ·n is zero, because each Pauli matrix has zero trace, and the trace is linear. So the sum of eigenvalues would be zero. The determinant is determinant of (σ ·n), which is determinant of a 2x2 matrix. For a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with trace T and determinant D, the eigenvalues are (T ± sqrt(T² -4D))/2. Since T=0, the eigenvalues would be sqrt(-4D)/2 and -sqrt(-4D)/2.

So, what's D for σ ·n? Let's compute the determinant of σ ·n. Let me compute it. Since σ ·n is a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is the product of its diagonal elements minus the product of off-diagonal. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that (σ ·n)^2 = I, as we discussed earlier.

Wait, if (σ ·n)^2 = I, then the eigenvalues of σ ·n must satisfy λ^2 = 1. So λ can be +1 or -1. That would make H's eigenvalues ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), so ε and -ε. So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

Looking at the options:

Option B is plus epsilon and minus epsilon. So the answer must be B.

Wait, but let me think again. Does (σ ·n)^2 equal I? Wait, earlier I thought it might not because of the cross terms, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach.

The spin matrices σ satisfy (σ ·n)^2 = (n · σ)(n · σ) = n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

Which is n_i n_j (δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k )

So this equals (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I + i (n_x n_y σ_z + n_x n_z σ_y + n_y n_z σ_x )

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So,

(σ ·n)^2 = I + i (n_x n_y σ_z + n_x n_z σ_y + n_y n_z σ_x )

Hmm, that doesn't look like I. So perhaps my earlier assumption that (σ ·n)^2 = I is wrong. So this complicates things.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I can take the trace. The trace of (σ ·n) is zero, as each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So the trace of (σ ·n)^2 is the sum of the squares of its elements. Let's compute the trace of (σ ·n)^2.

Compute Tr[ (σ ·n)^2 ] = Tr[ (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2 ]

Expanding this:

Tr [n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + 2n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + 2n_y n_z σ_y σ_z ]

The trace of each σ_i squared is 2, because σ_i^2 is 2I (since each Pauli matrix squared is identity, which has trace 2 for a 2x2 matrix). Wait, no, each Pauli matrix squared is I, which is 2x2, so trace is 2. So, Tr(σ_i^2) = 2.

So the trace becomes:

n_x² * 2 + n_y² * 2 + n_z² * 2 + 2n_x n_y Tr(σ_x σ_y) + 2n_x n_z Tr(σ_x σ_z) + 2n_y n_z Tr(σ_y σ_z )

But Tr(σ_i σ_j) is zero when i≠j because σ_i and σ_j anticommute and are traceless. 

Wait, let's think: σ_x σ_y = i σ_z.

Tr(σ_x σ_y) = Tr( i σ_z ) = i Tr(σ_z ). But σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so its trace is 0. So Tr(σ_x σ_y )=0.

Similarly, the cross terms would all have zero trace. So the trace of (σ ·n)^2 is 2(n_x² + n_y² + n_z² ) = 2(1) = 2.

So if (σ ·n)^2 has a trace of 2, but it's a 2x2 matrix, then the eigenvalues must satisfy λ^2 + λ'^2 = 2, and λ + λ' = 0 (since trace is zero). So λ = a, λ' = -a.

Then, a^2 + (-a)^2 = 2 => 2a² =2 => a²=1 => a=±1.

Wait, that can't be right because a^2 is 1, so a is ±1. Thus, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So σ ·n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, H = ε (σ ·n) has eigenvalues ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), which are +ε and -ε. So the answer is option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with energy dimensions, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. To find the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of Pauli matrices: \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \). The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are determined by its properties. Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. This implies that the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \).

The eigenvalues of \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are then \( \varepsilon \) times the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), which are \( \pm \varepsilon \). This matches the structure of the eigenvalues for a spin operator along an arbitrary direction.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) — Incorrect, as these are the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), not \( H \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) — Correct, as these are the eigenvalues of \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) — Incorrect, as the eigenvalues do not involve \( \hbar \) in this context.
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) — Incorrect, as these are unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).
