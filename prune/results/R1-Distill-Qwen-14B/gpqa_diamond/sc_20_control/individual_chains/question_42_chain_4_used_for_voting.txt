Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star, its orbital period, and its albedo. But wait, how exactly does that tie into the orbital period?

The question says that the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3 it's about 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are given, but I'm not sure how mass affects orbital period. Oh wait, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. But since all planets orbit the same star, the mass of the star is constant. So Kepler's law simplifies to P^2 being proportional to a^3, where a is the semi-major axis.

But how does equilibrium temperature tie into this? The equilibrium temperature formula is something like T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 pi sigma a^2) ]^(1/4). Wait, but L is the star's luminosity, which is constant for all these planets. So the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of a, because T ~ sqrt(L/(sigma a^2 (1 - a)) ), but wait, more precisely, T scales with (L/(16 pi sigma a^2 (1 - a)))^(1/4). So T is proportional to (1/(a^(1/2))) ) because a^2 in the denominator under the square root gives a^(1/2) in the numerator when you take the fourth root. So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).

Wait, actually, let me get that right. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ ( (1 - a) * L ) / (16 * pi * sigma * a^2) ) ]^(1/4) where a is the semi-major axis. So T is proportional to (L (1 - a))^(1/4) / (a^(1/2) * sigma^(1/4)) ). Since L and sigma and albedo a are the same for all three planets, T is proportional to 1/(a^(1/2)).

So the ratio of temperatures T1/T2 is (a2/a1)^(1/2), because T1 ∝ 1/sqrt(a1), T2 ∝ 1/sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, no. Let me think again. If T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), then T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, let's see. If a2 is larger than a1, then sqrt(a2/a1) is greater than 1. So T1 would be less than T2 because a2 is larger. So for example, if a2 is twice a1, T2 would be 1/sqrt(2) times T1, so T1 would be higher. Wait, no, because if a increases, the planet is farther away, so it's colder. So T should decrease as a increases.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as T proportional to (1/sqrt(a)) because farther planets are colder. So if a2 is larger than a1, T2 is smaller than T1. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1), right?

Wait, let's take an example. If a2 is 4 times a1, then T2 would be T1 * sqrt( a1/(a2) ) because T2 = k / sqrt(a2) = k/(sqrt(4 a1)) )= k/(2 sqrt(a1)) )= (1/2) * (k/sqrt(a1)) )= (1/2) T1. So T1/T2 = 2, which is sqrt(4) = 2. So yes, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Given that, the question says the ratio of T1 to T2 is 1.4. So:

T1 / T2 = 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So squaring both sides: (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 = 1.96 a1.

Similarly, the ratio of T2 to T3 is 2.3. So:

T2 / T3 = 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

So (a3/a2) = (2.3)^2 = approx 5.29. So a3 = 5.29 a2.

Wait, but wait, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3, and since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), then T2 is higher than T3, meaning a2 is smaller than a3.

So a3 = (T2/T3)^2 * a2 = (2.3)^2 a2 = 5.29 a2.

So now we can express a3 in terms of a1.

We have a2 = 1.96 a1, so a3=5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Compute 5.29 * 1.96:

Let me compute 5 * 1.96 = 9.8, and 0.29 * 1.96 ≈ 0.5684. So total is about 10.3684. So a3 ≈ 10.3684 a1.

Wait, wait, 5.29 *1.96: Let me do exact calculation. 5.29 * 1.96.

5.29 * 2 is 10.58, subtract 5.29 * 0.04 = 0.2116 → 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684. So yes, a3 ≈ 10.368 a1.

Now, Kepler's third law says that P^2 is proportional to a^3 (assuming the same mass for the star and negligible planet masses). So P^2 ∝ a^3 → P ∝ a^(3/2).

So the ratio of P3 to P1 is (a3/a1)^(3/2).

a3/a1 is 10.368. So (10.368)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.368^3).

Wait, no, 10.368^(3/2) is sqrt(10.368^3) ) or (10.368)^(1) * sqrt(10.368).

Wait, 10.368^(3/2) = (10.368) * sqrt(10.368).

Let me compute that.

First, sqrt(10.368). Let's compute 10.368.

Well, sqrt(10) is about 3.1623. 3.2^2 is 10.24, 3.22^2 = 10.3684. Oh wait, that's convenient. So sqrt(10.368) is approximately 3.22.

So 10.368 * 3.22 ≈ ?

10 *3.22=32.2, 0.368 *3.22≈1.184. Total is about 32.2 + 1.184 = 33.384. So approximately 33.38.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.38, so about 33.4. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me recap.

Given:

T1/T2 = 1.4 ⇒ (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 ⇒ a2 = 1.96 a1.

T2/T3 =2.3 ⇒ (a3/a2) = (2.3)^2=5.29 ⇒ a3 =5.29 a2 =5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Compute 5.29 * 1.96:

5 *1.96 =9.8.

0.29 *1.96: 0.2 *1.96=0.392; 0.09*1.96=0.1764 → total 0.392 +0.1764=0.5684.

So 9.8 + 0.5684=10.3684 → a3 =10.3684 a1.

P^2 ∝ a^3 → P ∝ a^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Compute 10.3684^(3/2):

Take the square root of 10.3684 ≈ 3.22. Then multiply by 10.3684: 3.22 *10.3684.

Compute 3*10=30, 3*0.3684≈1.1052. 0.22 *10=2.2, 0.22 *0.3684≈0.081. Sum all: 30 +1.1052=31.1052; 2.2 +0.081=2.281. Total 31.1052 + 2.281=33.3862. Approximately 33.39.

So the factor is about 33.4, which matches option D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \)
   - \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \)
   - The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{a} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis. Thus:
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}.
     \]

2. **Semi-Major Axis Ratios**:
   - From \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_2 = 1.96 \, a_1.
     \]
   - From \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_3 = 5.29 \, a_2.
     \]

3. **Expressing \( a_3 \) in Terms of \( a_1 \)**:
   - Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 \, a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 \, a_2 \):
     \[
     a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \, a_1 = 10.3684 \, a_1.
     \]

4. **Orbital Period Ratios**:
   - Kepler's Third Law states \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so:
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} = 10.3684 \):
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}.
     \]

5. **Calculating \( (10.3684)^{3/2} \)**:
   - First, compute \( \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \).
   - Then, multiply by \( 10.3684 \):
     \[
     (10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \times 3.22 \approx 33.38.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The correct answer is:

Wait, but L is the star's luminosity, which is constant for all these planets. So the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of a, because T ~ sqrt(L/(sigma a^2 (1 - a)) ), but wait, more precisely, T scales with (L/(16 pi sigma a^2 (1 - a)))^(1/4). So T is proportional to (1/(a^(1/2))) ) because a^2 in the denominator under the square root gives a^(1/2) in the numerator when you take the fourth root. So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).

Wait, actually, let me get that right. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ ( (1 - a) * L ) / (16 * pi * sigma * a^2) ) ]^(1/4) where a is the semi-major axis. So T is proportional to (L (1 - a))^(1/4) / (a^(1/2) * sigma^(1/4)) ). Since L and sigma and albedo a are the same for all three planets, T is proportional to 1/(a^(1/2)).

So the ratio of temperatures T1/T2 is (a2/a1)^(1/2), because T1 ∝ 1/sqrt(a1), T2 ∝ 1/sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, no. Let me think again. If T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), then T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, let's see. If a2 is larger than a1, then sqrt(a2/a1) is greater than 1. So T1 would be less than T2 because a2 is larger. So for example, if a2 is twice a1, T2 would be 1/sqrt(2) times T1, so T1 would be higher. Wait, no, because if a increases, the planet is farther away, so it's colder. So T should decrease as a increases.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as T proportional to (1/sqrt(a)) because farther planets are colder. So if a2 is larger than a1, T2 is smaller than T1. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1), right?

Wait, let's take an example. If a2 is 4 times a1, then T2 would be T1 * sqrt( a1/(a2) ) because T2 = k / sqrt(a2) = k/(sqrt(4 a1)) )= k/(2 sqrt(a1)) )= (1/2) * (k/sqrt(a1)) )= (1/2) T1. So T1/T2 = 2, which is sqrt(4) = 2. So yes, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Given that, the question says the ratio of T1 to T2 is 1.4. So:

T1 / T2 = 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So squaring both sides: (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 = 1.96 a1.

Similarly, the ratio of T2 to T3 is 2.3. So:

T2 / T3 = 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

So (a3/a2) = (2.3)^2 = approx 5.29. So a3 = 5.29 a2.

Wait, but wait, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3, and since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), then T2 is higher than T3, meaning a2 is smaller than a3.

So a3 = (T2/T3)^2 * a2 = (2.3)^2 a2 = 5.29 a2.

So now we can express a3 in terms of a1.

We have a2 = 1.96 a1, so a3=5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Compute 5.29 * 1.96:

Let me compute 5 * 1.96 = 9.8, and 0.29 * 1.96 ≈ 0.5684. So total is about 10.3684. So a3 ≈ 10.3684 a1.

Wait, wait, 5.29 *1.96: Let me do exact calculation. 5.29 * 1.96.

5.29 * 2 is 10.58, subtract 5.29 * 0.04 = 0.2116 → 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684. So yes, a3 ≈ 10.368 a1.

Now, Kepler's third law says that P^2 is proportional to a^3 (assuming the same mass for the star and negligible planet masses). So P^2 ∝ a^3 → P ∝ a^(3/2).

So the ratio of P3 to P1 is (a3/a1)^(3/2).

a3/a1 is 10.368. So (10.368)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.368^3).

Wait, no, 10.368^(3/2) is sqrt(10.368^3) ) or (10.368)^(1) * sqrt(10.368).

Wait, 10.368^(3/2) = (10.368) * sqrt(10.368).

Let me compute that.

First, sqrt(10.368). Let's compute 10.368.

Well, sqrt(10) is about 3.1623. 3.2^2 is 10.24, 3.22^2 = 10.3684. Oh wait, that's convenient. So sqrt(10.368) is approximately 3.22.

So 10.368 * 3.22 ≈ ?

10 *3.22=32.2, 0.368 *3.22≈1.184. Total is about 32.2 + 1.184 = 33.384. So approximately 33.38.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.38, so about 33.4. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me recap.

Given:

T1/T2 = 1.4 ⇒ (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 ⇒ a2 = 1.96 a1.

T2/T3 =2.3 ⇒ (a3/a2) = (2.3)^2=5.29 ⇒ a3 =5.29 a2 =5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Compute 5.29 * 1.96:

5 *1.96 =9.8.

0.29 *1.96: 0.2 *1.96=0.392; 0.09*1.96=0.1764 → total 0.392 +0.1764=0.5684.

So 9.8 + 0.5684=10.3684 → a3 =10.3684 a1.

P^2 ∝ a^3 → P ∝ a^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Compute 10.3684^(3/2):

Take the square root of 10.3684 ≈ 3.22. Then multiply by 10.3684: 3.22 *10.3684.

Compute 3*10=30, 3*0.3684≈1.1052. 0.22 *10=2.2, 0.22 *0.3684≈0.081. Sum all: 30 +1.1052=31.1052; 2.2 +0.081=2.281. Total 31.1052 + 2.281=33.3862. Approximately 33.39.

So the factor is about 33.4, which matches option D.
