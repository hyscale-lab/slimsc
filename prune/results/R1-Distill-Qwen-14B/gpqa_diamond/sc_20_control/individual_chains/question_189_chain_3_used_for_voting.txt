Okay, so I've got this question about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I remember that when a symmetry is spontaneously broken, certain particles emerge as the "messengers" of that broken symmetry. Let me think about each option.

The question is asking which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

Wait, what do I know about each of these? 

Phonon: I'm a bit fuzzy, but I think phonons are related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. They're quantized sound waves. I'm not sure if they arise from symmetry breaking. Maybe they're more about the lattice structure and not directly tied to gauge symmetries or spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Skyrmion: Oh right, skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They were proposed by Skyrme to model certain particles. I think they're associated with pions as Goldstone bosons when chiral symmetry is broken in the quark model. So Skyrmions are connected to broken symmetries.

Magnon: Magnons are the quasiparticles for spin waves in magnetic materials. They arise from the quantization of spin waves, which I believe happens when there's a broken symmetry in the magnetic ordering. For example, in ferromagnetism, the continuous symmetry is broken, leading to magnons as Goldstone modes. So magnons are linked to broken symmetries.

Pion: Pions are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. When the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, the pions (along with other mesons) appear as the massless particles (though they do have small masses due to QED effects). So pions are directly tied to a broken symmetry.

So, the question is which one does NOT come from a broken symmetry. Phonon is the odd one out here. Because phonons are more about lattice vibrations, not directly about the symmetry breaking in the gauge or chiral sense. They might emerge from symmetry considerations in crystal structures, but maybe that's a different kind of symmetry, not spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same way as the others.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Are phonons considered to be from broken symmetries? I think they might arise from the breaking of translational symmetry in the crystal lattice, but that's more about the structure rather than a spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking. So in the context of the question, which is about effective particles from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the quantum field theory sense, phonons wouldn't fit. The other options are all tied to such symmetries.

To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we analyze each option:

- **Phonon**: Phonons are quantized sound waves representing vibrations in a crystal lattice. They arise from the breaking of translational symmetry in the lattice structure but are not directly tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the quantum field theory sense, such as gauge or chiral symmetry breaking.

- **Skyrmion**: Skyrmions are topological solitons proposed by Skyrme to model certain particles. They are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the quark model, where pions act as Goldstone bosons. Thus, skyrmions are linked to broken symmetries.

- **Magnon**: Magnons are quasiparticles representing spin waves in magnetic materials. They arise from the quantization of spin waves, which occur when magnetic ordering breaks the continuous symmetry of spin systems. Magnons are therefore connected to broken symmetries.

- **Pion**: Pions are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). When chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, pions emerge as the massless particles (with small masses due to QED effects). Pions are directly tied to broken symmetries.

Among the options, phonons are distinct because they are not directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the quantum field theory context. Instead, they are related to lattice vibrations and structural symmetries. The other particles—skyrmions, magnons, and pions—are all tied to spontaneously-broken symmetries.
