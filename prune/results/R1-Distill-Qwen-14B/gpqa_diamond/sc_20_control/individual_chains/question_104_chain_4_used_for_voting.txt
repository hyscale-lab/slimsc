Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. So when the planet causes the star to move towards us, the spectral lines shift to shorter wavelengths (blue shift), and when it moves away, the lines shift to longer wavelengths (red shift). The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, right?

The problem says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are roughly the same mass. The RV method detected them, and the shifts in the spectral lines are given: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods. How do the shifts relate to the period? I think the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is something involving the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The velocity semi-amplitude is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us due to the planet.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(-2/3) )

Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance. Another approach: the RV method relates to the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula I think is K = ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * c )

But M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * c )

But since both stars have the same mass and the planets are similar to Neptune, M_p is same for both. So K is proportional to (1/(P^(1/3))) ).

Wait, let me think again. Let's write it more carefully.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) )^(1/ ( P * (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I need to simplify this using the approximation that M_p << M_star, and e is small (circular orbit, so e=0). So the formula simplifies.

The formula becomes:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star)^2 * P ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / c )

Wait, no, wait, let's get the exact formula.

Another approach: The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (v * (2π)) / P ) ) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) * c ) )

Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ≈ 1. So K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but in this case, M_p is the same for both planets since they're both Neptune-like. So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

Wait, that makes sense. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Because if a star moves more (higher K), the planet must be orbiting closer (smaller period). But wait, in the problem, planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 has 7. So K is higher for planet #2.

Wait, but K is the velocity semi-amplitude. So K is higher when the star's velocity is higher. So higher K would mean a larger velocity, which would happen if the planet is more massive (but here they have same mass), or if the period is shorter. Because for a given mass, a shorter orbital period would imply a closer orbit, leading to a larger velocity (since the star has to move more quickly in its orbit).

Wait, but the formula says K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K is higher when P is smaller. So if planet #2 has a higher K (7 vs 5), so its velocity semi-amplitude is higher, which would imply a shorter period. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So if planet #2 has a higher K, its period is shorter, which would mean P2 is less than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait, but let's think again. Let me write the formula for K.

The exact formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) * c ) ) * (1) / ( (P / (24*3600*365.25)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the relationship between K and P.

Since K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), and M_p and M_star are same for both, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-arrange the formula.

K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * c ) ) * (1) / ( P^(1/3) )

So K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 = constant * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

K2 = same constant * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can solve for P2/P1.

So rearranging:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

But wait, K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the reasoning.

If K is higher, it means the star is moving more, which happens if the planet is more massive (but same here) or if the period is shorter (so the planet is closer, leading to a larger velocity). So higher K implies shorter period.

So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, which matches the calculation of (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36.

So the ratio is about 0.36 times. So the answer should be option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which represents the star's maximum velocity due to the planet, is related to the orbital period \( P \) of the planet. For a given planet mass \( M_p \) and star mass \( M_\text{star} \), \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). Mathematically:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, the shifts in the spectral lines are given as \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx (0.714)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1.

But M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * c )

But since both stars have the same mass and the planets are similar to Neptune, M_p is same for both. So K is proportional to (1/(P^(1/3))) ).

Wait, let me think again. Let's write it more carefully.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

Wait, perhaps I need to simplify this using the approximation that M_p << M_star, and e is small (circular orbit, so e=0). So the formula simplifies.

The formula becomes:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star)^2 * P ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / c )

Wait, no, wait, let's get the exact formula.

Another approach: The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (v * (2π)) / P ) ) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) * c ) )

Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ≈ 1. So K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but K is the velocity semi-amplitude. So K is higher when the star's velocity is higher. So higher K would mean a larger velocity, which would happen if the planet is more massive (but here they have same mass), or if the period is shorter. Because for a given mass, a shorter orbital period would imply a closer orbit, leading to a larger velocity (since the star has to move more quickly in its orbit).

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) * c ) ) * (1) / ( (P / (24*3600*365.25)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the relationship between K and P.

Since K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), and M_p and M_star are same for both, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-arrange the formula.

K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * c ) ) * (1) / ( P^(1/3) )

So K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 = constant * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

K2 = same constant * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can solve for P2/P1.

So rearranging:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

But wait, K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which represents the star's maximum velocity due to the planet, is related to the orbital period \( P \) of the planet. For a given planet mass \( M_p \) and star mass \( M_\text{star} \), \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). Mathematically:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, the shifts in the spectral lines are given as \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx (0.714)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1.
