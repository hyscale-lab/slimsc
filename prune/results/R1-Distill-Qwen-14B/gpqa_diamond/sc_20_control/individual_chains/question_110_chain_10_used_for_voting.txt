Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Let me read the question again. It says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can do stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the stars need to be bright enough in V magnitude to be seen by both. Wait, no—ESPRESSO can go up to 17, HIRES up to 16.5? Wait, the question says, the V mag for ESPRESSO is brighter than 17, so that means apparent V mag less than 17. Because lower magnitude means brighter. So, for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have an apparent magnitude brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Because HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, that's confusing. Let's clarify.

Wait, the question says: With ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, if a star has V mag less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can observe it. For HIRES, same logic: stars brighter than 16 mag. So, to be observed by both, the star's apparent V mag must be brighter than 16 (since 16 is the higher limit for both). Because if it's brighter than 16, it's definitely brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So, the apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 mag.

Wait, no: Wait, the way it's worded is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So, that means apparent V mag ≤17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than V=17, it's V<17. So ESPRESSO can see up to V=17. HIRES can go up to V=16. So, for both, the star's V must be ≤16. Because if a star is V=16, HIRES can see it, and since 16 is within ESPRESSO's limit (17), ESPRESSO can also see it. If the star is V=17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't. So the star needs to have an apparent magnitude ≤16 to be seen by both.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, that's V <17. For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be observed, which is V <16. So, for a star to be detected by both, its V must be less than 16. Because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, let me rephrase: For a star to be observed by HIRES, it must have V <16. For ESPRESSO, V <17. So, if a star is V <16, it's visible by both. If it's between 16 and 17, it's only visible by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So, the stars we're looking for must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Now, let's look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude (M) is how bright it appears at 10 pc. So, apparent magnitude (m) can be found using the distance modulus: m = M +5 log10(d/10). For Star1, d=10 pc, so m =15.5 +0=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16. So, ESPRESSO (17) and HIRES (16) can both see it. But wait, HIRES can only see up to 16. So m=15.5 is <16, so HIRES can see it. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5, which is higher than 16. So for HIRES, it's too faint (since HIRES can only go to V=16). ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so Star2 is V=16.5, which is within ESPRESSO's limit. So Star2 is only visible by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V mag 15.5, but there's extinction (E(B-V)=0.6). The question says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 times E(B-V). So A_V =3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude without extinction would be m = ... Wait, wait, let me think. The star's actual brightness is dimmed by extinction. So the apparent magnitude is m = m_0 + A_V, where m_0 is the apparent magnitude without extinction. So wait, in this case, Star3's given apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that's without considering extinction? Or is that the observed magnitude? Hmm, the question says apparent V magnitude is 15.5. Wait, the note says the total absorption in the V band is related to E(B-V) by 3.1. So the extinction A_V =3.1 * E(B-V). So if a star has an apparent V of m, but there's extinction, then the observed m_observed is m_true + A_V. So the observed apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) than the actual. So for Star3, the actual m without extinction would be m_true = m_observed - A_V.

Wait, but wait, the way it's worded is the star's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. That would be m_observed. So, the star's intrinsic brightness would be m_true = m_observed - A_V.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Star3's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but due to extinction (dust), it's actually dimmer than it appears. So the actual brightness without extinction is brighter. So to get the actual m_true, we subtract A_V from m_observed. Because extinction makes stars appear fainter (higher m).

So, m_true = m_observed - A_V.

So for Star3, m_observed is 15.5, A_V=1.86. So m_true=15.5 -1.86=13.64. But wait, that can't be right. Because if the observed magnitude is 15.5, but it's actually brighter without extinction, then the true m is lower. So m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64. Hmm, but how does this affect the detection? Because the spectrographs detect the apparent magnitude as seen from Earth, including extinction.

Wait, but wait, in astronomy, when we talk about apparent magnitude, we usually include extinction. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is already the observed magnitude. So the question is, for the spectrographs, which use the apparent magnitude (corrected for extinction) to decide if they can observe it. Or is the apparent magnitude given without considering extinction?

I think the question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86. So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 +1.86 =17.36? Because extinction makes it appear dimmer. So the observed m is higher. So m_observed = m_true + A_V. Wait, that would make sense because higher magnitudes are fainter.

Wait, but what's given? The question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So apparent V is the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So the actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true = m_observed - A_V. Because without extinction, the star would appear brighter.

Wait no, I'm confused. Let me think in terms of flux. The observed flux is less than the intrinsic flux due to extinction. The formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Because if a star's brightness is dimmed, it has a higher magnitude.

So, if Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but there's extinction adding 1.86, then the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But wait, the way the question is phrased, Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So the question is, does the 15.5 include the extinction? Or is 15.5 the apparent magnitude before considering extinction?

I think the question is saying that Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, and it has E(B-V)=0.6. So, the actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is less (brighter) than 15.5 because extinction makes it fainter. So the observed magnitude is 15.5, which is dimmer than the actual. So, the actual m_true would be 15.5 - A_V. So m_true = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64.

But wait, how does this affect whether the spectrograph can detect it? The spectrograph detects the observed apparent magnitude. If the observed magnitude is 15.5, which is less than 17 (ESPRESSO can see up to 17) and less than 16 (HIRES can see up to 16), but wait, 15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES can see it. So, Star3's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is acceptable for both.

Wait, but wait! The confusion is whether the apparent magnitude given includes extinction or not. Because if the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, and the extinction makes it appear fainter, then the observed m is higher. But the given m is the observed m. So Star3's actual m without extinction would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64, which is brighter.

But the point is, for the purpose of being detected, the apparent magnitude (including extinction) is what the spectrograph sees. So, the spectrographs' detection limits are based on the actual m they observe, not the intrinsic brightness. So, if Star3's observed m is 15.5, then it's within the limit of both spectrographs.

Wait, but wait. The question says Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5. But considering the extinction, the actual observed magnitude is higher. So is Star3's apparent V mag 15.5 (observed) or 15.5 (intrinsic)? I think the question gives the observed apparent V mag, so including extinction. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is within both spectrographs' limits.

Wait, but let's think again. If the star's V magnitude is 15.5, and extinction is making it appear dimmer (m is higher), then without considering extinction, it would have been 15.5 - A_V. So the observed m is 15.5, and that's whatESPRESSO and HIRES can see.

So, the observed m for Star3 is 15.5, which is less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and less than 16, but wait no: wait, 15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES can see it. Because HIRES can only go up to 16. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, so it's within the limit of both.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify again. The detection limit for HIRES is stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16. So, stars with m <16. So, Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 16. So HIRES can see it. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so Star3 is within that as well. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Star4: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So using distance modulus, m = M +5 log (d/10) =15.5 + 5 * 0 (d=10). So m=15.5. But Star4 has E(B-V)=0.4, so A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_true + A_V. Wait, but again, the confusion arises. Is the given apparent magnitude already corrected for extinction, or is it the intrinsic?

Wait, the way the question is written, Star4's apparent V magnitude is not given. It only gives absolute V magnitude and E(B-V). So I need to compute the apparent magnitude, including extinction.

Wait, Star4 has absolute magnitude M=15.5, located at 10 pc. So without extinction, m = M, because d=10 pc. So m =15.5. But with extinction, the observed m is 15.5 + A_V =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, but that would make the observed m=16.74. So the apparent magnitude is 16.74.

So, which spectrographs can see that? ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is within. HIRES can go up to 16, so 16.74 is higher (fainter) than 16. So HIRES can't see it. So Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Star4's absolute magnitude is 15.5, so if it's at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5. Then, the extinction adds 1.24, making the observed m=16.74. So that's brighter than 16.74. But 16.74 is larger than 16, so for HIRES, which can go up to 16, 16.74 is too faint. So Star4 is only visible by ESPRESSO.

Star5: Absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. So, compute m. m = M +5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 * log (5/10) =16.5 +5 * log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, approximately 15.0.

So, m =15.0. Now, any extinction? The question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star5, so I think we can assume it's zero. So, m=15.0.

So, the apparent V is 15.0. So for both ESPRESSO (17) and HIRES (16), 15.0 is within the limit. So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait: Star5's m is 15.0, which is less than both 16 and 17, so both can observe it.

Now, let's compile this.

Which stars can be observed by both?

Star1: m=15.5. Observed by both.

Star2: m=16.5. Only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5 (assuming the given is observed, including extinction). Both.

Star4: m=16.74. Only ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15.0. Both.

Wait, but earlier for Star3, I thought that m is 15.5 (apparent, including extinction) and Star5 has m=15.0.

Wait, but wait: Star3's apparent V is given as 15.5, which already includes extinction? Or not?

Wait, the way the question is written: for Star3, the apparent V mag is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So, does that mean the apparent V is 15.5, and then we need to adjust for extinction to find the observed m? Or is the 15.5 the apparent before considering extinction?

I think the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude as observed, meaning it already includes the extinction. So no need to adjust it again. Because if the question gives apparent magnitude, it's already the observed value. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both spectrographs' limits.

So, which stars can be detected by both? Let's list:

Star1: m=15.5 → Both.

Star3: m=15.5 → Both.

Star5: m=15.0 → Both.

Wait, but wait, Star5's m=15.0. So according to that, Star5 is observable by both.

Wait, but earlier reasoning for Star1's m=15.5: yes, and Star5's m=15.0.

Wait, but let me check Star5 again.

Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, at 5 pc. So distance modulus: 5*log(5/10) =5*(-0.301)= -1.505.

So m = M + distance modulus =16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995, approximately 15.0.

So m=15.0. So, less than 16 → can be seen by both.

So, which stars are visible by both? Stars1, Star3, Star5.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So, the possible correct options would involve Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. Both are detectable by both spectrographs.

Wait, but Star1's m is 15.5. So it's within both. So option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4 is m=16.74, which can't be seen by HIRES. So Star1 can be seen by both, but Star4 can't, so D is out.

Wait, so the correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5. But the options don't have any option that includes two of these.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so only Star1 is.

So, the correct answer would have Star3 and Star5 as the possible pair.

Wait, but why isn't Star1 an option? Because Star1's m is 15.5. So, in that case, both Star1 and Star3 and Star5 are detectable by both.

But looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let's recheck Star3's m.

Star3's given apparent V mag is 15.5. It has E(B-V)=0.6. The question says that the total absorption in V is 3.1*E(B-V), so A_V=1.86.

So, the question is whether the given m of 15.5 is before or after extinction. Because if the given m is after extinction, then Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, so both can detect it.

If the given m is before extinction, then the observed m would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is beyond HIRES's limit (16), so only ESPRESSO can see it.

But the way the question is phrased, Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So I think the given m is the apparent magnitude, which is already corrected for extinction. So, the observed m is 15.5.

So, Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both spectrographs.

Star5's m is 15.0, also within both.

So, the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (m=15.5), Star3 (m=15.5), and Star5 (m=15.0).

Looking at the options, the only pair that includes both stars which are in this group is option B: Star3 and Star5.

So, the answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the two instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 (i.e., \( m < 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 (i.e., \( m < 16 \)). Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude \( m < 16 \) to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Using the distance modulus formula \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) \), the apparent V magnitude is \( m = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \) is less than both 16 and 17, so Star1 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 \) is greater than 16, so Star2 is too faint to be detected by HIRES. It is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), and \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.86 \).  
   - The apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \) is already given as the observed magnitude, which includes extinction.  
   - \( m = 15.5 \) is less than both 16 and 17, so Star3 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), and \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Without extinction, \( m = M = 15.5 \). With extinction, \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \), so the observed apparent magnitude is \( m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - \( m = 16.74 \) is greater than 16, so Star4 is too faint to be detected by HIRES. It is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Using the distance modulus formula \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) \), the apparent V magnitude is \( m = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
   - \( m = 15.0 \) is less than both 16 and 17, so Star5 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** are paired correctly.

**Answer: B**
