Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through the question again and think about what's going on here.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. There are two reactions mentioned:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. Then, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to figure out what reagents A and B are, based on the options provided.

Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, it usually undergoes a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I remember that the reaction of a ketone with a cyanide might not proceed directly under normal conditions. Oh, right! The formation of a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when a ketone (or aldehyde) reacts with CN- in an acidic solution to form a compound where the hydroxyl and cyanide groups are added to the carbonyl carbon.

So for the formation of a cyanohydrin, the conditions are typically acid-catalyzed. The NaCN provides the cyanide ion, but the reaction requires an acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Yep, that makes sense for a cyanohydrin of butan-2-one.

So for part A, the reagent is acid. Looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, but NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is strong). However, sometimes NaHSO3 is used in certain conditions. Wait, but in the first reaction, we need a strong acid to protonate the carbonyl. H3O+ is a strong acid, so that fits. So A is H3O+.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is the corresponding butanoic acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

I remember that nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical reagents for this are strong oxidizing agents. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions. Alternatively, using HCl (HCl, maybe with heat) can help in the hydrolysis or oxidation.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: the nitrile is at the end of a carbon chain. Or is it? Looking at the structure, the nitrile is attached to the second carbon, which also has a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the oxidation occurs in such a way that the nitrile is transformed into a carboxylic acid.

But wait, oxidation of nitriles usually requires specific conditions. For primary nitriles, oxidation with strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 in acidic conditions (like HCl) will convert them to carboxylic acids. If the nitrile is in a more hindered position, maybe a different approach is needed.

Alternatively, another way to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids is through hydrolysis. But hydrolysis of nitriles typically gives either amides or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. Acidic hydrolysis with HCl and water would convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid after several steps (maybe via an imidamide or amide stage).

Wait, but the second reaction is in the presence of water and reagent B. So the reaction is the nitrile group being converted to a carboxylic acid. So what reagent B would facilitate that?

Looking at the options for B: the choices are HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). So which one would be more suitable.

Wait, in the first step, when NaCN is used with H3O+, that's the cyanohydrin formation. Now, in the second step, the nitrile is being oxidized. So, for oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids, KMnO4 in acidic conditions is a common method. But among the options, the possible reagents are HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the second step is an hydrolysis reaction. Let's think. Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic (like HCl) or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, with HCl and water, the nitrile can undergo hydrolysis.

Wait, but under what conditions do we get a carboxylic acid from a nitrile? Let me recall: In acidic conditions, the nitrile can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, but it often requires more vigorous conditions, like heat and concentrated HCl. Alternatively, using KMnO4 in acidic conditions would oxidize the nitrile.

Wait, but looking at the reaction, perhaps the product is from a hydrolysis of the nitrile. So if reagent B is HCl, that's a possibility. Let me think about the reaction conditions.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... So, it's a reaction with water and reagent B.

So, the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. How can that happen? One way is hydrolysis. Under acidic conditions, nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids, but I think that usually requires strong acid and heat, maybe with a catalyst.

Alternatively, another possibility is the presence of a strong oxidizing agent in acidic conditions. But the options don't have KMnO4 or similar. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis.

Wait, but the first reagent A is H3O+ (from option A or B). Now, for the second reagent, if the reagent is HCl, then with H2O, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile must have been oxidized. Let me think about the structure. The molecule is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The nitrile is on the second carbon, which is also attached to a hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the nitrile is at the end of the chain. Wait, but butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but here it's butanenitrile with substituents. Hmm, maybe the nitrile is at the end, but in this structure, perhaps it's a secondary nitrile? Wait, no, butanenitrile is a primary nitrile.

Wait, perhaps the oxidation is converting the nitrile group into a COOH group. So the reagent needs to be a strong oxidizing agent in acidic conditions.

Wait, but the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH. So which one can act as an oxidizing agent in this context? HCl is a strong acid but isn't itself an oxidizing agent in this reaction. Alternatively, maybe in the presence of HCl and water, the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent B is HCl, so the reaction is hydrolysis under acidic conditions, using HCl as a catalyst or acid source.

Wait, when nitriles are hydrolyzed in acidic conditions, they typically form carboxylic acids, but the conditions can be harsh. Alternatively, using HCl as the acid would make sense.

Wait, but another angle: Maybe the first step is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which is an addition of CN- and OH- to the carbonyl. Then, the second step is the conversion of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So, for that, the nitrile needs to be oxidized. Oxidizing agents like KMnO4 in acidic conditions would do that, but none of the options for B are KMnO4.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a point here. Let me think about the sequences. In the first reaction, the ketone reacts with NaCN and an acid (like H3O+) to form the cyanohydrin. Then, in the second reaction, the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid under some conditions.

Another possibility: Maybe the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis under acidic conditions. So, B is HCl. That would make sense. So, the reagents would be H3O+ for A and HCl for B.

Looking back at the options, option A says A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Wait, but let me consider the second reaction more carefully. The starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, no, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So, when oxidized, perhaps it becomes a ketone, but in the product, it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, no. Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile (CN) is on the second carbon, and the product has a COOH group on the second carbon. So the CN has been oxidized to COOH.

Hmm, that's a big oxidation. So the nitrile is being oxidized all the way to a carboxylic acid. What reagents do that?

I think KMnO4 in acidic conditions (like HCl) can do that. But I don't see KMnO4 as an option for B. The options for B are only HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the nitrile is being hydrolyzed using a strong acid and water. But in such a case, what catalysts are used?

Alternatively, perhaps reagent B is HCl, providing the acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid, perhaps via an intermediate amide.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so the reaction would involve adding two oxygen atoms. That sounds like oxidation, not hydrolysis. Hmm. So maybe the reagents are for oxidation.

But none of the options for B are oxidizing agents, except perhaps if HCl is acting as an acid in an oxidation reaction.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me go back to the possible options.

Option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each reagent in the options.

In the first reaction, the reagent A is either H3O+ (options A, B) or NaHSO3 (options C, D). NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. What does that do?

Wait, wait a second. For the formation of a cyanohydrin, the catalyst is an acid. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- can donate a proton). But is it as strong as H3O+?

Alternatively, maybe in some cases, other acids like H2SO3 (bisulfite) can be used. But H3O+ is a stronger acid, so it would protonate the carbonyl more effectively. So perhaps the correct A is H3O+, which is option A or B.

So for reagent A, it's H3O+. So options A and B are possible.

Now, for reagent B, which is either HCl or CH3COOH.

In the second reaction, the nitrile is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Let's think about the conditions provided by each B.

If B is HCl (as in option A or C), then the conditions are acidic and possibly provide Cl- as a leaving group.

If the reaction is an oxidation, HCl might act as a proton source but not as an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, in some cases, HCl can facilitate the oxidation. But without an oxidizing agent present, I'm not sure. Unless the nitrile is being hydrolyzed.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid via the Stephen reduction or some other method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is not an oxidation but a hydrolysis. Let me think about the possible mechanisms.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic conditions. For example, in the presence of HCl and water, perhaps the nitrile converts to an amide first, then to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the reaction is:

CN → COOH

Which usually requires strong acidic conditions and heat. But if reagent B is HCl, then it's providing the necessary acid.

Alternatively, if B is acetic acid (CH3COOH), that's a weak acid. Would that be enough for the hydrolysis? I'm not sure. Perhaps a stronger acid is needed.

So, for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl, which gives an acidic environment, facilitating the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid. So in that case, option A would have B=HCl, which is suitable.

Wait, but in the product, is there any change in oxidation state? The nitrile is R-CN, which becomes R-COOH. The oxidation state of carbon in CN is +2 (since C≡N has each triple bond with N at -1 each). In COOH, the carbon is +3. So oxidation is happening, so you need an oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the options don't have any oxidizing agents except perhaps HCl as a co-reagent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about another angle.

The first reaction uses NaCN and an acid (A is H3O+). The second reaction uses B and H2O. If B is HCl, perhaps it's part of an acidic aqueous solution, which is the environment for the oxidation.

Wait, but without an oxidizing agent, like KMnO4 or CrO3, I don't think HCl alone can oxidize the nitrile. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the second step is a hydration or hydrolysis, not an oxidation. Let me think about that.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under basic or acidic conditions. Under acidic conditions, such as with HCl, the nitrile can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but that's not oxidation; that's hydrolysis. But wait, nitrile hydrolysis involves adding two oxygen atoms—so it's more like an addition of water across the triple bond, leading to a ketone or acid, depending on the structure. Wait, no, hydrolysis of a nitrile (RCN) to a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) is a two-step process: first to an amide (RCONH2) under acidic conditions, then further hydrolysis to RCOOH.

Wait, but in the presence of HCl, perhaps the reaction is facilitated. So, perhaps the second step uses HCl (B) in water to hydrolyze the nitrile to the acid.

But then why is the product a carboxylic acid? Because the nitrile is on a secondary carbon? Wait, no, but in the molecule, the nitrile is on a carbon that's already substituted with another group (the 2-hydroxy group and the benzyl group).

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the nitrile is being oxidized to a ketone first, but that doesn't fit the product. The product is a carboxylic acid, so oxidation must go all the way.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused here, but given the options, the most plausible scenario is that reagent B is HCl, providing the acidic conditions for hydrolysis, converting CN to COOH.

So, putting it all together, the reagents would be H3O+ for A and HCl for B. Looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but let me look at the options again:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

Hmm, but wait. Another possibility: What if the second reaction isn't oxidation or hydrolysis but something else?

Wait, another approach: The first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The second reaction is converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid with aqueous conditions and reagent B.

Another way to get a carboxylic acid from a nitrile is via the hydrolysis using H2O and acid. So, using HCl as the acid.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me think about what each reagent does.

If reagent B is HCl (option A), then in the second reaction, the nitrile is in an acidic HCl solution with water. This should facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if reagent B is CH3COOH (acetic acid), which is a weak acid. Would that be enough? Maybe for some reactions, but for hydrolysis of nitriles, I think a stronger acid like HCl is necessary.

So, I think the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the carbonyl group of the ketone reacts with cyanide (CN⁻) in the presence of an acid.  
   - Acidic conditions are required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this step.  
   - Therefore, reagent A is **H₃O⁺**.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This reaction involves the conversion of the nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).  
   - Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically requires acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl provides the necessary acidic environment for this transformation.  
   - Therefore, reagent B is **HCl**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ facilitates cyanohydrin formation, and HCl provides the acidic conditions for nitrile hydrolysis.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is not strong enough to facilitate cyanohydrin formation as effectively as H₃O⁺.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions. NaHSO₃ is not strong enough for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
