Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of a boson X, right? They gave me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, first, I should probably understand the Lagrangian they provided. The expression is given as L(y) = -λf fψ̄(y)(υ + X(y))ψf(y). Wait, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. The Lagrangian looks like it's describing an interaction term between the fermion fields and the boson field X. So, the interaction term is proportional to ψ̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ(y). Oh, wait, maybe the λ is a coupling constant here. So, this is a Yukawa-like interaction, perhaps?

Wait, in the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction is between a fermion and a scalar (like the Higgs), and it's something like λ ψ̄ ψ h, where h is the Higgs field. So here, X is acting like a scalar (boson) coupling to fermions. So the interaction term would mediate processes where X is emitted or absorbed by fermions.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, the possible decay products depend on the allowed fermion pairs that can be produced. Since the boson X is a scalar, its decay would be into fermion-antifermion pairs. So, the possible decay channels are X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

But wait, in the Standard Model, the fermion masses come from the Yukawa interaction, and the Yukawa coupling determines the mass. So, the decay X → f f̄ would be possible only if the fermion f has a mass less than half the mass of X. Because in pair production, each fermion would need to have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So, for each fermion f, the condition is 2 m_f ≤ m_X. That is, m_f ≤ m_X / 2.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, so m_X/2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV could be a decay product.

Wait, but let me think about the masses of the known fermions. Let me list them:

- Electron (e): mass about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.0047 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, wait, so the top quark is way heavier than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks. Similarly, the bottom quark is about 4.13 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks either. 

So the possible fermions that can be produced are those with m_f ≤3 GeV. Let's see which ones that includes.

From the list:

- e (0.0005 GeV)
- μ (0.105 GeV)
- τ (1.777 GeV) → all below 3 GeV.
- u (0.003)
- d (0.0047)
- s (0.095)
- c (1.27 GeV)
- b is too heavy, same with t.

Wait, so all the fermions except for b and t are okay. But wait, wait a second: the bottom quark is 4.13 GeV, which is above 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b quarks. So possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pairs where the mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, but let me check the quark masses more accurately. Sometimes, the masses are given as current masses. For example, the strange quark is about 95 MeV, which is 0.095 GeV. The charm is about 1.27 GeV, as I said. So yes, charm is under 3 GeV, so X can decay into c c̄ pairs as well.

Wait, but the question is about kinematically allowed decays. So, it's purely about the mass of X being larger than twice the mass of the fermion. So, any fermion with m_f ≤ 3 GeV can be produced.

So, the fermions that can be decay products are:

e, μ, τ (leptons),
u, d, s, c (quarks).

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? Oh no, because m_b is ~4 GeV, which is bigger than 3 GeV, so X (6 GeV) can't decay into b b̄. Because 2 m_b = 8 GeV, which is larger than m_X=6 GeV. So that's impossible.

Same with top quark, but top is way heavier anyway. So the possible decay channels are:

X → e+ e−,
X → μ+ μ−,
X → τ+ τ−,
X → u ū,
X → d d̄,
X → s s̄,
X → c c̄.

Wait, but what about the quark masses? Because in reality, the quarks can't be isolated due to confinement, but in terms of kinematics, it's allowed. So the question is about allowed decays, so regardless of whether they can be observed directly, as long as the energy is sufficient, it's allowed.

So, looking back at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s̄ s, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

But wait, b is too heavy. So this option includes b, which is not allowed. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X → c c̄, s̄ s, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Wait, that includes c, which has mass 1.27 GeV, which is okay. So all allowed fermion pairs are present except for the bottom and top. So option B includes all the allowed fermions except for the ones that are too heavy.

Option C: X → c c̄, s̄ s, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Ah, but t is way too heavy. So option C includes t, which is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b̄, s̄ s, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Again, includes b, which isn't allowed.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is over 3 GeV, so not allowed. So A is out.

Option B: includes c, which is allowed, as 1.27 GeV. So yes. So the decay X→c c̄ is allowed.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct options would include all the pairs except for b and t.

Looking again: option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's 7 decay channels.

Wait, but the question is about the lowest order. The interaction term is given as L = -λ f f ψ̄ (y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). So, this is proportional to X ψ̄ ψ. So, the vertex is X ψ ψ. So the coupling is to two fermions and X.

So, the decay would be X → f f̄. So, the lowest order decay is tree-level. So all the allowed fermions that can be produced would be possible, as long as kinematically allowed.

So, the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Let me check their maximum possible.

Wait, tau is 1.777 GeV. So 2m_tau = 3.554 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV? No wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, m_X is 6 GeV. The maximum mass allowed for each fermion is m_X/2 = 3 GeV. Because two fermions need to have a combined energy of 6 GeV, each at rest. So if a fermion has mass m, the other can be at rest, so 2m ≤ m_X.

So, for a fermion f, 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So, the tau is 1.777 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. So tau can be produced. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, 2 * 1.777 is ~3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Oh wait, no, wait: 2m is the minimum energy needed for the pair. So, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So, for tau, since 2m_tau=3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait—this is about the invariant mass. The invariant mass of the fermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson.

So, for X → f f̄, the invariant mass s = (p_f + p_f̄)^2 = m_X^2 = (6 GeV)^2.

The minimal energy is when the fermions are produced at rest, meaning each would have energy m_f. So each would have 3 GeV (if m_X is 6 GeV). So, as long as m_f ≤3 GeV, it's allowed.

So, tau is ~1.777 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. So yes.

So, any fermion with m_f ≤3 GeV can be produced. So, the fermions allowed are:

e (0.0005 GeV),
μ (0.105 GeV),
τ (1.777 GeV),
u (0.003 GeV),
d (0.0047 GeV),
s (0.095 GeV),
c (1.27 GeV).

So, the decay channels are X → f f̄ for each of these.

So looking at the options again:

Option B: X → c c̄, s̄ s, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

That's exactly the list I have here. So, option B is correct.

Wait, but let me check again each option.

Option A: X→ b b̄ etc. So includes b, which is too heavy. So incorrect.

Option B: includes c, which is 1.27 GeV, allowed.

Option C: includes t, which is 173 GeV, way too heavy. So incorrect.

Option D: includes b, so invalid.

So the correct answer must be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction provided by the Lagrangian. The interaction term describes a Yukawa-like coupling between the boson \( X \) and fermions, allowing \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) at the lowest order. The kinematic constraint for such decays is that the mass of the fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), or equivalently \( m_f \leq m_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Analyze the fermion masses
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this list, only fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are allowed. Thus, the allowed fermions are:
- \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \).

### Step 2: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( m_b = 4.13 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^{+} \tau^{-}, \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, e^{+} e^{-} \), all of which are allowed since their masses satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^{+} \tau^{-}, \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, e^{+} e^{-} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
