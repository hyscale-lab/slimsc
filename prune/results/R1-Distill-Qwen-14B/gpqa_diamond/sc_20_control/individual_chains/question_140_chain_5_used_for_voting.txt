Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y, releasing gas W, and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me start by looking at each part of the problem.

First, gas W: its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, so each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about common gases. One possibility is H2O (water vapor), but wait, the number of protons and neutrons would vary. Wait, no, for each molecule. Let me think about H2O: each molecule has 2 H (1 proton each) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So for O, protons are 8 and neutrons are 8. But the molecule as a whole doesn't have the same number of protons and neutrons. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, maybe it's another gas. Let's consider CO2. Each molecule has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons if it's the most common isotope), and two O (8 protons each, 8 neutrons each if the common isotope). So the total protons per molecule would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh wait, that's 22 each. So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in each molecule. That fits. So W could be CO2. So gas W is CO2.

Wait, but another possibility is CH4. Let's see: C has 6 protons, each H has 1. So the molecule has 6 + 4(1) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (if it's the 12C isotope), H has 0. So 6 neutrons. That doesn't match. So CO2 seems to fit.

So, if W is CO2, then Y is probably something that when reacted with X gives CO2. Also, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe ammonium chloride? No, its melting point is higher. Wait, maybe something like sodium chloride? No, that's way higher. Wait, what about something like ammonium carbonate? Or perhaps it's something that upon heating decomposes.

Wait, another thought: when G is heated, it releases B. So B is a solid that's left after releasing gas. Wait, maybe G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. But earlier, W is CO2, so that might fit. Alternatively, if G is a sulfide, heating might release something else.

Wait, but considering the melting point: 277 K is about 4°C. That's close to the melting point of ice (273 K), but higher. Wait, water freezes at 273 K, but here it's 277, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe it's not water. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, that's higher. Wait, what about something like magnesium sulfate heptahydrate? No, that's 277 K? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal carbonate. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think differently.

Substance X reacts with Y to produce CO2. So X is a carbonate or maybe a bicarbonate? Or perhaps X is something else like a hydroxide reacting with an acid. Wait, but Y is a liquid. So maybe Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate. For example, if X is sodium carbonate and Y is hydrochloric acid, then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and sodium chloride. But in that case, the precipitate G would be sodium chloride, but sodium chloride is soluble in water, so it wouldn't precipitate. Hmm, maybe Y is a different acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate reacts with an acid to produce CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. If Y is an acid like H2SO3 (but I'm not sure if that's a liquid), then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and sodium sulfate, perhaps. But again, sodium sulfate is soluble, so maybe the precipitate is something else.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate isn't the salt but another product. Let's think about other possibilities. If X is a metal oxide that reacts with an acid, but then the product would be a salt and water. But if the metal oxide is a heavier one, maybe it's less soluble. For example, calcium oxide reacts with an acid like H2SO4 to form calcium sulfate, which is a precipitate. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe X is a sulfite. If Y is an acid, like H2SO4, then reacting with a sulfite would produce SO2 gas, which doesn't fit our W being CO2. So that's probably not it.

Wait, going back to the fact that W is CO2. So the reaction between X and Y must produce CO2. One common reaction is a carbonate reacting with an acid. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacting with hydrochloric acid (HCl) would produce CO2, water, and NaCl. But NaCl is soluble, so it wouldn't form a precipitate. So maybe Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt.

Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) reacting with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) would produce CO2, water, and sodium sulfate. Sodium sulfate is soluble in water, though. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitride? If X is Mg3N2, and Y is water, then the reaction would produce NH3 gas. But that's not CO2. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe X is a sulfide. If X is FeS and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce H2S gas, which isn't CO2. So that's not it.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So when G is heated, B is released as a solid? Or perhaps B is a solid. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let me think about substances that melt around that temperature. For example, water melts at 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Maybe ammonium nitrate? No, that's a solid that can melt at higher temps. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal oxide. For example, when a carbonate is heated, it decomposes into the metal oxide and CO2. So if G is a carbonate, heating would release CO2 and leave the metal oxide. But then B would be the metal oxide. The melting point of a metal oxide may vary. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal hydroxide.

Wait, another approach. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So, if B is a solid at normal conditions, maybe it's a hydrated salt. For example, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate melts at about 277 K. Hmm, yes, I think that's right. Because magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O) has a melting point of about 277 K. So B is MgSO4·7H2O.

If that's the case, then when G is heated, it releases B. Wait, that would mean that G upon heating decomposes into B and perhaps some gas? Or maybe G is a hydrate, and upon heating, it loses water and forms a different compound. Wait, no. Because when G is heated, it releases B, which is a solid. So perhaps G is a compound that, when heated, loses some volatile component and leaves B. Alternatively, maybe G is an anhydrous salt that, upon heating, absorbs water to form B. Hmm, that doesn't fit because heating usually causes loss of water, not gain.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate and upon heating, it decomposes into a metal oxide plus CO2. But then B would be the metal oxide. Alternatively, perhaps G is a nitrate that decomposes into a metal oxide, NO2, and O2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if B is magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, perhaps G is an anhydrous magnesium sulfate. When heated, it might not change much, but that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to think about the entire reaction. X reacts with Y to produce CO2, G, and perhaps other products. Then G upon heating releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it becomes a metal oxide and CO2. So B would be the metal oxide. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Let me think about metal oxides. For example, sodium oxide has a high melting point, like around 1700°C, which is way higher than 277 K. That doesn't fit. Magnesium oxide's melting point is about 2800°C. Hmm, that's way higher. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps B is not a metal oxide but something else. Another thought: maybe B is a hydrate, like magnesium sulfate heptahydrate. So when G is heated, it releases B. That would imply that G is something that, upon heating, forms B. But that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps G is a different form of B. For example, if B is a crystal hydrate, and G is an anhydrous form that, upon heating, absorbs water to form B. But in that case, heating G would produce B and release some energy, but that's not matching because the question says G releases B upon heating.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the product of X with a keto acid. The product contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, X reacts with a keto acid to form something with 2 O atoms. Let's think about what X could be.

Keto acids are molecules with a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. For example, acetoacetic acid. When a base is added to a keto acid, perhaps it undergoes a reaction like decarboxylation or something else. If X is a base, such as a carbonate or bicarbonate, and the reaction produces CO2, which fits with W being CO2.

Wait, the product of X and the keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, but the product would form a salt. Let me think: for example, if X is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate) and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). Reacting them would form sodium acetoacetate (CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+), which has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylate group (O in COO^-). But wait, the product would have more than two oxygen atoms in the molecule. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base like NaOH. Reacting with a keto acid like acetoacetic acid would deprotonate it, forming the conjugate base. But the product would have more oxygen atoms, not two. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: if X is something like LiAlH4, a strong reducing agent. When a keto acid (like a ketone with a carboxylic acid group) reacts with LiAlH4, it could be reduced. For example, the carboxylic acid group could be reduced to an alcohol. So the product would have more hydrogen and oxygen. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, which would react with the keto acid to form CO2, and the corresponding carboxylic acid. But the product would have a certain number of oxygen atoms. Let me think: the keto acid has, say, two carbonyl groups. When reacting with a carbonate, perhaps it would lose CO2 and form a different compound.

Wait, but getting back to the main problem. Let's think about what X could be. The question says that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs. That makes me think of something like NaHCO3 or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a Grignard reagent, but I don't think so because Grignard reagents are organometallic, and their reactions usually involve adding to carbonyls.

Wait, maybe X is a hydroxide. For example, sodium hydroxide. It's used as a strong base in reactions. But how does that fit the reaction with Y?

Wait, in the reaction, X reacts with Y to produce CO2. So if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, that would produce CO2. Alternatively, if X is a bicarbonate, same thing.

Wait, perhaps X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Reacting with Y (maybe H2SO4, but that's a strong acid) would give CO2, H2O, and Na2SO4. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so it wouldn't precipitate. So G wouldn't form. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, Y might be a different acid. For example, if Y is a weak acid like acetic acid, maybe the carbonate would react but not completely, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G. If G forms when X reacts with Y, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is a salt that produces an insoluble carbonate. For example, if Y is CaCl2, and X is Na2CO3, then the reaction would produce CaCO3 precipitate, 2 NaCl, and CO2 gas. So in this case, G would be CaCO3, and the gas W would be CO2.

Then, when G (CaCO3) is heated, it decomposes into CaO and CO2. So B would be CaO. The melting point of CaO is about 2880°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Wait, but earlier I thought B's melting point is about 277 K, which is 4°C. So CaO's melting point is way higher. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the scenario.

Alternatively, what if Y is a different acid? Let's say Y is sulfuric acid, H2SO4. If X is Na2CO3, the reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and Na2SO4. But again, Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is something else. For example, if Y is water, and X is a carbonate. Then the reaction would be Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaHCO3. But that doesn't produce CO2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with HCl (Y) to produce CO2, H2O, and NaCl. NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't explain G.

Wait, unless Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt. For example, Y could be AgNO3. If X is Na2CO3, then the reaction would produce Ag2CO3 (silver carbonate), which is insoluble and would precipitate as G. Then, when G (Ag2CO3) is heated, it would decompose into Ag2O and CO2. So B would be Ag2O. What's the melting point of Ag2O? Silver oxide has a melting point of around 1530°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the product of X with the keto acid. The product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. Let me think about what kind of reaction would produce a molecule with two O atoms.

Wait, perhaps X is a base like NaOH, and the reaction is a neutralization. For example, a keto acid like CH3COCH2COOH (acetoacetic acid) reacting with NaOH would form the sodium salt, which has O from the carboxylate group. But that might have more than two O atoms. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a reducing agent. For example, LiAlH4 reduces the keto acid. Let's say the keto acid is something like cyclohexanone carboxylic acid. Reacting with LiAlH4 would reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, but I'm not sure how that would leave the product with two O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is esterification. For example, a keto acid could react with an alcohol in the presence of H2SO4 to form an ester. But I'm not sure how that leaves two O atoms in the product.

Hmm, maybe this part is harder than I thought. Let me try to focus on the other parts first.

Let's go back to the initial reaction: X + Y → W (CO2) + G. G is a precipitate that, upon heating, releases B, which has a melting point around 277 K. So B is a solid that's formed when G is heated.

Wait, what if G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it loses CO2 to form a metal oxide (B). Then, B would be the metal oxide. But earlier, that didn't fit because melting points were way higher. Unless it's a different oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is NaOH and Y is a metal carbonate, but that seems unlikely.

Another angle: the melting point of B is near 277 K, which is 4°C. What substances have a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, ammonium nitrate's melting point is around 169°C. Hmm. Maybe it's not a pure element but a compound. Wait, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O) has a melting point of about 277 K. If that's the case, then B is MgSO4·7H2O.

So, if G is heated to form B, which is MgSO4·7H2O, then perhaps G is an anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). But wait, heating MgSO4 wouldn't form the hydrate; usually, heating would drive off water, not add it. So that's the opposite. So perhaps G is the hydrate, and upon heating, it loses water to form an anhydrous form, but that wouldn't release B. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps G is a different compound. Let me think of another scenario. Suppose X is a carbonate, Y is a metal hydroxide. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide, but that would produce H2S gas, not CO2.

Wait, another approach: what if Y is a carbonate and X is a metal hydroxide? No, that might not produce CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. Let's say X is NaHCO3, and Y is a strong acid like H2SO4. The reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and NaHSO4. But NaHSO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the initial part again. The problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X contains a heavier isotope, perhaps like Cl-35 instead of Cl-37? No, wait, Cl usually has isotopes with 35 and 37 protons. Wait, wait, chlorine has atomic number 17, so isotopes are 35Cl (18 neutrons) and 37Cl (20 neutrons). So if X has a heavy isotope, perhaps it's Cl involved.

Wait, if X is NaCl, but that's a neutral salt. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NaHCO3, which contains sodium (23), hydrogen (1), carbon (12), and oxygen (16). But I don't see a heavy isotope in that.

Wait, another thought: X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaHCO3, Na2CO3, KOH, etc. Oh wait, another important reagent is sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7), which is used as an oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure about the isotopes in that.

Wait, the problem states that X's analog is used as a reagent. One such reagent is NaOH, which is often used in organic reactions. But NaOH doesn't have any heavy isotopes in its common form. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Sodium has a heavy isotope, but I don't think that's the main point here. Alternatively, the carbon in the carbonate could be a heavy isotope, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps X is a borohydride, like NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent in organic chemistry. Boron has several isotopes, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, maybe X is a hydroxide, like Ca(OH)2, which is used in some reactions. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but going back to the reaction: X reacts with Y (a liquid) to produce CO2 and precipitate G. So if Y is a liquid acid, and X is a carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate as G.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is AgNO3 (a liquid?), then the reaction would produce Ag2CO3 precipitate, CO2 gas, and NaNO3. Ag2CO3 is white and insoluble, so that could be G. Then, when G (Ag2CO3) is heated, it would decompose into Ag2O and CO2. So B would be Ag2O. But the melting point of Ag2O is around 1530°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a key point here. Let's try to think about the melting point of B being 277 K. That's about 4°C. So B is a solid at that temperature. What solid has a melting point near that? Wait, maybe it's not a pure element but a hydrate. For example, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O) has a melting point of approximately 277 K. So B is MgSO4·7H2O.

If that's the case, then when G is heated, it must produce B. So, G is something that upon heating produces MgSO4·7H2O. That doesn't make much sense because heating usually removes water, not adds it. Unless G is a different compound that, upon heating, forms the hydrate and releases something else. But that's not common. So perhaps I'm wrong about B.

Another thought: maybe B is a different compound. Let me think of other substances. What about ammonium nitrate? Its melting point is around 160°C. No, that's higher. What about sodium chloride? It's 801°C. Hmm. Maybe something else.

Wait, perhaps B is not a pure element but a compound. Let me think. Another possibility: magnesium hydroxide. Mg(OH)2 has a melting point around 1900°C. No, that's way too high.

Wait, maybe B is a different carbonate. Let me think, but earlier that didn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a basic carbonate. Like sodium carbonate decahydrate, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. If X is a carbonate and Y is a salt that produces an insoluble carbonate as G. Then, when G is heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. So B would be the metal oxide. But as I saw before, metal oxides have high melting points. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless B is not the metal oxide but something else. Maybe B is a different carbonate. For example, what if G is a mixed carbonate that, upon heating, loses CO2 and forms a different carbonate, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate heated would produce sodium carbonate, water, and CO2. So B would be sodium carbonate. But the melting point of sodium carbonate is about 850°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm. I'm stuck on this part. Maybe I should think about the other parts of the problem and see if that helps.

The product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, the product must have O2 in it. Let's think: X is a reagent in organic chemistry. One common reagent is a base like NaOH or NaHCO3. Suppose X is NaHCO3. Reacting it with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) would produce sodium acetoacetate. The structure would be CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+. The molecule would have two oxygen atoms in the carboxylate group. Wait, no: the structure is O=C-O-CH2-CO-O^-? Wait, no, let me draw it. Acetoacetic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. When it reacts with NaHCO3, it would form CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+ and CO2 and H2O.

Wait, the product (sodium acetoacetate) has the formula CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+ which contains two oxygen atoms in the carboxylate group. But the molecule would have more than two oxygen atoms. Wait, no, each carboxylate group has two oxygen atoms (O in COO^-). But the entire molecule would have more. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent. Let's say X is LiAlH4, which reduces keto acids. For example, reducing a ketone would add H. But I'm not sure how that would result in a product with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is an ester. For example, if X is an alcohol and the keto acid undergoes esterification. But I'm not sure how that fits.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to think about the elements in X. The problem says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So X must have at least two different elements.

Earlier, I thought X might be a carbonate (like Na2CO3), which has Na, C, and O. Or perhaps a bicarbonate (NaHCO3), which has Na, H, C, O. Alternatively, X could be something like NaOH, which has Na, O, H.

Wait, but X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a compound where one of its elements has a heavy isotope. Chlorine, for example, has a heavy isotope (Cl-37 vs Cl-35). If X contains Cl, then when it reacts, it might have a heavier isotope.

Wait, X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent. One reagent that comes to mind is NaCl, but that's more of a salt. Another is KCl. Alternatively, maybe X is a dichromate, like Na2Cr2O7, which is used as an oxidizing agent. Chromium has several isotopes, including Cr-52 and Cr-54. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another key point: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, and the product has a deprotonated form with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is something like acetone (but that's a ketone, not a keto acid), or maybe a compound like acetoacetic acid.

Wait, when a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) reacts with a base like NaHCO3, it forms the corresponding sodium salt, which has a structure with more oxygen atoms. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is something that when it reacts adds two oxygens. For example, if X is O2, but that's not a reagent in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, which would add O, but that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonyl reagent. Like in the formation of an acetal. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps this part is tricky, but let's think about X's elements. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X has at least two elements: the lightest and the heaviest.

If X is Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate), the elements are Na (lightest), C, and O (heaviest). Wait, no, O is lighter than C? Wait, atomic numbers: O is 8, C is 6. So in Na2CO3, the heaviest element is Na (atomic number 11). So the lightest is C (6) and heaviest is Na (11). Atomic masses: C is 12, Na is about 23. So 12 + 23 = 35. Looking at the options, option A is 35.

But wait, the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements. So if X is Na2CO3, lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Na (23), sum is 35. So option A is 35.

But wait, earlier I thought X might be NaHCO3. Let's see: elements are Na, H, C, O. The heaviest is Na (23), the lightest is H (1). Sum is 24. That's option B (25 is close, but not 24). Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is NaOH. Elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Again, 24 isn't one of the options, but option B is 25. Hmm.

Alternatively, what if X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid)? But that's a liquid, and the question says X reacts with Y (a liquid). Hmm, but the problem states that X is a substance used as a reagent, which could be a liquid.

Wait, but acetic acid is a keto acid itself, so when it reacts with another keto acid, I'm not sure. Alternatively, X could be something like benzene, but that's not a reagent in the way described.

Wait, let me think again about the options. The options are 35,25,31,29. So 35 is option A. If X is Na2CO3, the sum is 35. So that's a possibility.

But wait, the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So in Na2CO3, the isotopes would be in Na and C and O. But perhaps the heavier isotope is in C or O?

Wait, perhaps the heavier isotope is in chlorine. If X is NaCl, which has Na (23) and Cl (35 and 37). So the lightest element is Na (23), heaviest is Cl (37). Sum is 23 +37=60, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, if X is Cl2, but that's a diatomic liquid? No, Cl2 is a gas at room temperature. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps X is something like (CH3)2CO (acetone), but that's a liquid and a ketone, but not sure how that fits.

Wait, going back, perhaps X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). The elements are Na, H, C, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option. So that's not it.

Alternatively, if X is something like NH4Cl (ammonium chloride). The elements are N, H, Cl. The lightest is H, heaviest Cl (35 or 37). Sum is 1 +35=36 (if using 35Cl) or 1+37=38. Not matching the options, but option A is 35. Close but not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X is NaNO2 (sodium nitrite). The elements are Na, N, O. Lightest is N (14) or O (16)? Wait, no: the lightest element is N (7), but atomic mass is 14. Wait, no, the elements' lightest would be the one with the lowest atomic number. So Na (11), N (7), O (8). So lightest is N, heaviest Na. Sum is 14 (N) +23 (Na) =37. Close to option A (35), but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe X is something else. Let's think about the options again. The options are 35, 25,31,29.

If I think X is Na2CO3, sum is 35, which is option A. But earlier, the melting point of B didn't fit. But perhaps I'm not correct about B.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let's think about another compound. What if X is CuSO4·5H2O (copper sulfate pentahydrate). But that's a blue crystal, and upon heating, it loses water. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base that when reacts with the keto acid, forms a product with two O atoms. Like, maybe X is a hydride, such as NaBH4. When NaBH4 reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone with a carboxylic acid group), perhaps it adds H across the carbonyl, but I'm not sure how that would result in two O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple neutralization. Let's say X is NaOH and the keto acid is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid). Then the product would be NaCH3COO and water. The product (sodium acetate) has more than two O atoms, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. But that would require a reduction, not just a reaction with a base.

Alternatively, maybe the keto acid loses a CO2 group. For example, decarboxylation. So if X is a base that induces decarboxylation, the product would have fewer O atoms. For example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), and upon reaction with X, it loses CO2 to form CH3COCH3 (acetone). That product has O: acetone has three O? No, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has one O. So that would give a product with one O atom, which doesn't match the two O atoms mentioned.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me make an educated guess based on the options. The sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of the options: 35, 25, 31, 29.

If X is Na2CO3, then the lightest element is C (12) and the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A. Alternatively, if X is NaOH, the sum is 23 (Na) +1 (H) =24, which is not an option.

Another possibility: X is NH4Cl. Heaviest element Cl (35), lightest H (1). Sum 36, not an option. Alternatively, if X is Mg(OH)2. Elements are Mg, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Mg (24.3). Sum is 25.3. Close to option B (25). Hmm.

So if X is Mg(OH)2, the lightest element is H (1), heaviest Mg (24.3). Sum is 25.3, approximately 25. So option B is 25.

But then, how does that fit with the reaction? Mg(OH)2 is not very soluble, but if Y is an acid, the reaction would produce Mg^2+ and water. But Mg(OH)2 is a weak base. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is CaCO3. Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Ca (40). Sum 52, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: what if X is a boron compound? Boron has a heavy isotope, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like (NH4)2CO3 (ammonium carbonate). The elements are N, H, C, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is N (14) or C (12) or O (16). So the heaviest is O (16). Sum is 1 +16=17. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck between options A (35) and B (25). Let's think again about the reaction.

If X is Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate), then:

X + Y → CO2 + G (precipitate).

If Y is a solution of a metal nitrate, like AgNO3, then the reaction would produce Ag2CO3 as a precipitate. Ag2CO3 is insoluble. So G would be Ag2CO3.

Then, when G is heated, it decomposes into Ag2O and CO2. So B would be Ag2O. But Ag2O's melting point is around 1530°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

But wait, the problem states that B's melting point is close to 277 K. So that scenario doesn't fit.

Hmm. So perhaps X is something else. Let me think of another reaction.

If X is NaHCO3 and Y is HNO3 (a liquid acid), the reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and NaNO3. But NaNO3 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2. Then, X as Na2CO3 would react to produce BaCO3 precipitate, CO2, and NaNO3. BaCO3 is insoluble, so G is BaCO3. Heating BaCO3 would produce BaO and CO2. BaO has a high melting point, so that's not matching.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles. Based on the options, the most plausible sum is 35 (option A) if X is Na2CO3. But the melting point part doesn't fit. Alternatively, if X is Mg(OH)2, sum is 25. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If G is a hydroxide, like Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 would produce Al2O3 and H2O. Al2O3 has a melting point around 2050°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate of a transition metal. Wait, but those decompose into oxides with high melting points.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Another approach: 277 K is approximately 4°C. What solid has a melting point near that? Maybe something like ammonium formate? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a hydrate. Wait, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate melts at about 277 K. So B is MgSO4·7H2O.

So if G, when heated, releases B (MgSO4·7H2O), that implies that G is an anhydrous form that, upon heating, absorbs water to form the hydrate. But that's unusual because heating usually causes dehydration, not hydration. So perhaps this is not the case.

Another possibility: perhaps G is a different hydrate. For example, if G is MgSO4·5H2O, which upon heating would lose water to form MgSO4·7H2O? No, that doesn't make sense because heating would drive off water, not add it.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Let me make a decision based on the options and the likely sum.

If X is Na2CO3, then the sum is Na (23) + C (12) =35. That's option A.

But earlier, the melting point of B didn't fit. However, perhaps the melting point of B is not the same as the metal oxide but another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Wait, the problem says that when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate and B is a metal oxide, but the melting point is that of the oxide.

Wait, if B is sodium oxide (Na2O), its melting point is around 1380°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, what about if B is sodium bicarbonate? No, that's not a solid with a high melting point.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps B is not a metal oxide but a different carbonate. For example, if G is NaHCO3, heating would produce Na2CO3 and CO2. But the melting point of Na2CO3 is around 850°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Alternatively, maybe B is a basic carbonate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Based on the options, and considering that X is Na2CO3, which would give a sum of 35 (Na + C), I think the answer is A) 35.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to produce Gas W (CO₂), a precipitate G, and a compound B upon heating G. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K, and the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W (CO₂):** The reaction between X and Y produces CO₂, indicating that X likely contains carbon and oxygen. Possible candidates for X include carbonates, bicarbonates, or hydroxides.

2. **Precipitate G and Compound B:** G forms when X reacts with Y, and upon heating, G releases B, which has a melting point of 277 K. This melting point suggests B could be a hydrate like magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO₄·7H₂O), which has a melting point close to 277 K. However, the exact identity of B remains unclear due to conflicting evidence.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid:** The product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X reacts with the keto acid in a way that introduces or retains exactly 2 oxygen atoms in the product. For example, if X is a carbonate or bicarbonate, it could deprotonate the keto acid, forming a salt with the required oxygen count.

4. **Isotope Incorporation:** X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. For example, if X is sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), it could contain a heavier isotope of sodium or carbon.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The problem requires calculating the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is Na₂CO₃:
   - The lightest element is carbon (C, atomic mass ≈ 12).
   - The heaviest element is sodium (Na, atomic mass ≈ 23).
   - The cumulative atomic mass is \( 12 + 23 = 35 \).

6. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A (35):** Matches the cumulative atomic mass of Na₂CO₃.
   - **Option B (25):** Could correspond to a different compound like Mg(OH)₂, but this does not fit the reaction context.
   - **Option C (31):** Does not align with any plausible candidate for X.
   - **Option D (29):** Similarly, does not match the required criteria.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible candidate for X is sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), and the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements in X sum to 35. This aligns with Option A.
