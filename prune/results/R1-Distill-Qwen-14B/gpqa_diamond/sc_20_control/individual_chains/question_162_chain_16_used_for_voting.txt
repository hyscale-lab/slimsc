Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think through this.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit strange. I remember that metrics usually describe the geometry of spacetime, and in this case, it's probably a 2-dimensional space since there are two spatial coordinates (x and y) and no time component mentioned. Or wait, maybe it's a 2-dimensional spacetime? Hmm, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere, which is a concept from geometry, often used in hyperbolic space.

Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like a tractricoid, the surface formed by rotating a tractrix. But in the context of metrics, the term might refer to a space with negative curvature.

So the question is asking for the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. But wait, how does this metric relate to the pseudosphere? Let me parse the metric.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which suggests that the coordinates x and y are constrained such that x² + y² <4, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, leading to issues. So the domain is where x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but this is a 2-dimensional metric. So the space described by this metric is a 2-dimensional surface. So if it's a pseudosphere, which is a 2-dimensional surface, it's probably a hyperbolic space.

Wait, hyperbolic space can be represented in different coordinate systems. Like, the Poincaré disk model, which uses coordinates where the hyperbolic plane is mapped to the interior of a disk. The metric for the Poincaré disk model is ds² = (4/(R^2 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate and θ the angular one. But in our case, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me see: if I switch to polar coordinates, x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, then x² + y² = r². So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). 

In the standard Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually written as ds² = (4/(R² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where R is the radius of the disk. Comparing that to our metric, 32/(4 - r²) = 4/(R² - r²) if 32/(4 - r²) =4/(R² - r²). Let me see: 32/(4 - r²) =4/(R² - r²). Then, cross-multiplying: 32*(R² - r²) =4*(4 - r²). Divide both sides by 4: 8*(R² - r²) =4 - r² → 8 R² -8 r² =4 - r² → 8R² =4 +7 r². Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a hyperbolic space with a curvature. The standard metric for a 2D hyperbolic space in the Poincaré disk model is indeed ds² = (4/(R^2 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where R is the radius of the disk. The Gaussian curvature K of the hyperbolic plane is -1/R². 

In our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), so R² is 4, so R=2. So the curvature would be K= -1/(R²) = -1/4. So the Gaussian curvature is -1/4. That makes sense. So the metric here represents a hyperbolic plane with R=2.

Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface, which in 3D. But in this case, since the metric is 2D, perhaps the question is referring to the area of a region in this hyperbolic plane. Wait, but what's the pseudosphere's area in this context?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of a sphere in this space, but since it's a 2D metric, a sphere would be a one-dimensional 'circle' in the space. Wait, that's confusing. Or maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in a higher dimension, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the area in question is the area of the entire space. But the entire hyperbolic plane has infinite area. So if the question is about the area of the pseudosphere, which is the entire hyperbolic plane, then the area would be infinite.

Wait, the options are A) 0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C)4π(x² - y²), D) +∞. So D is infinity. So if the area is infinite, then D would be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the area of a sphere of radius 2 in this space. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the pseudosphere is the tractricoid, which is a finite area surface. But in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Hmm, but the area of a pseudosphere in 3D is finite. But in 2D hyperbolic space, the area would be different.

Wait, but in the metric given, the space is 2-dimensional. So the 'pseudosphere' here might refer to the entire 2D hyperbolic space, which has infinite area. So the area would be infinite.

So looking at the options, D is +infty. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" So perhaps they're considering a sphere of radius 2 in this space. But in 2D hyperbolic space, a sphere (which would be a circle) of radius 2 would have a certain circumference, but the area of the sphere in 3D is different.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, in 3D, a pseudosphere has finite area. But in 2D, the pseudosphere would be a model of hyperbolic space, which is infinite in extent. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the area of a sphere in this space.

Wait, but the metric is 2-dimensional, so the space is 2-dimensional. So a sphere in this context would be a circle, a 1-sphere. But the question is about the area, which is a 2-dimensional measure. Maybe the question is not about a sphere but about the entire space, which would have infinite area.

So putting it all together, the area of the pseudosphere (which in 2D would be the entire hyperbolic plane) is infinite, so the answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) are constrained to the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2. In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\), the metric becomes 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

This is recognized as the metric for the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the Gaussian curvature is \(-1/4\) and the radius of the disk is \(R = 2\). The hyperbolic plane described by this metric is infinite in extent.

The question asks for the area of the "pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\)." In this context, the pseudosphere refers to the entire hyperbolic plane, as the metric represents a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. Since the hyperbolic plane is infinite, its area is also infinite.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) 0**: This is incorrect because the area of the hyperbolic plane is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: This is incorrect because the area of the hyperbolic plane is not dependent on the coordinates \(x\) and \(y\).
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: This is incorrect for the same reason as option B.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: This is correct because the hyperbolic plane described by the metric is infinite in extent.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere (hyperbolic plane) is infinite.
