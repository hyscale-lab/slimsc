Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as expected in the mouse model. The setup involves creating a transgenic mouse with an inducible overexpression of GADD45G. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells, and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. Looking at the DNA sequence provided, I need to find out what's wrong.

First, let me look at the sequence. The plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's the coding sequence for GADD45G and the HA tag. I should check if there are any in-frame stop codons or issues in the DNA that would cause the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, the question says that the sequence is for the plus strand. So, looking for stop codons (TAG, TGA, TAA) in the reading frame. Let me scan through the sequence.

Breaking it down:

The sequence is provided as a long string. Let me note where any stop codons might be.

Looking through the sequence:

...I see several sections. Let's take it step by step. Are there any in-frame stop codons?

First, the sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start. Then the next codons are TAC (tyrosine), CCC (proline), ATC (isoleucine), etc. Let me check for any TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Wait, I notice that towards the end, there's a part that says ...CTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, looking at the very end, there's 'TGA'. Let me check the context.

The last part is ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the very end is 'GAGTGA'. So the last few bases are ...AGTGA.

Wait, but looking at the last part: ...CGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, let me look for TGA or TAG. I see 'TGA' in the middle. Let me check where.

Looking through the sequence, I see 'TGA' a few times. For example, earlier parts have ATG (start), then later parts have TGA. Let me see:

Looking at the sequence, let me write out a few segments:

- ...CCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I'm seeing TGA in the middle. Let me check the exact positions.

For example, the segment: ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, looking for TGA. Let me see:

In the sequence, I see a section: ATGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see TGA in the middle: GAGTGA is at the very end. Let me check:

The last part is ...GAGTGA.

Wait, that's in the context of the reading frame. Let's look for the codons.

Because the plus strand starts with ATG, the mRNA would be the same as the coding sequence except T→U. So the mRNA would be AUG... and the coding frame is 3 nucleotides at a time.

So the very end of the sequence is ...GAGTGA, which as mRNA would be ...GAU GUA (but wait, mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is complementary to the plus strand. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the provided sequence is the plus strand. The mRNA is synthesized from the template (negative) strand, which is complementary to the plus. So the mRNA would have the same sequence as the plus strand, except T becomes U.

Wait, no. No, wait— the plus strand is the same as the mRNA. Because when the mRNA is made, it's complementary to the template (negative) strand. So if the plus strand is the coding strand, the mRNA would be same as plus, but with T→U.

Wait, no, that's correct. So the mRNA would have the same sequence as the plus strand, but with T replaced by U.

Thus, the plus strand sequence provides the mRNA sequence, except T→U.

So looking for stop codons in the mRNA, which are AUG (start), and the stops are UAA, UAG, UGA.

In the plus strand, the stop codons would be complementary to those. Because the mRNA is synthesized from the template, which is the complementary strand.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me think about the DNA coding sequence. The gene is on the plus strand, so the mRNA is the same as the plus strand, except T→U.

So any stop codons in the mRNA would be UAA, UAG, UGA.

So in the DNA plus strand, the corresponding codons would be TAA (for UAA), TAG (for UAG), and TGA (for UGA).

Looking back at the sequence, I need to check if any such codons appear in the coding frame. 

So, I'll scan the plus strand for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking at the sequence:

First part: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in triplets.

Looking through:

- TAC TCC TAT ... no.
- ...ATG TAC GAT G...
Wait, let's find all the TGA triplets:

Looking for TGA in the sequence. Let me check:

...AGTCTTGAACGTGGAC...

Wait, here's a part: ...CTTGAACG... So the triplet is TGA, but in the context of the reading frame.

Wait, let's get the exact position. Let's look for 'TGA' in the sequence.

Looking again, I spot 'TGA' in the middle.

Wait, here's a segment: ...TTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, in the segment: ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA in the sequence. Let me see:

I think I found a TGA here: ...CGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, let me look for 'TGA' as a triplet. So in the sequence, I'm looking for three letters in a row: T, G, A.

Looking through the sequence:

...ACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Ah, I see 'TGA' at the very end. The last part is 'CGAGTGA'. So the last six nucleotides are GCTGCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is 'GAGTGA', which is in the sequence as ...GCTGCGAGTGA.

Wait, but let me look at the triplet:

The last part is 'GAGTGA3' (since the sequence ends with TGA).

So the triplet is TGA. So in the DNA plus strand, there's a TGA codon. That would correspond to UGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon.

So if the DNA has a TGA in the reading frame, the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation there, leading to a truncated protein.

So where is this TGA located? Let me see. It's somewhere in the middle of the sequence, not at the very end. Because the very end is GAGTGA, but that's the last part.

Wait, perhaps the GADD45G is followed by the HA tag, but the HA tag's sequence is part of the construct. Oh, wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the construct is GADD45G coding sequence plus HA. But wait, no. The description says "introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein."

So the HA tag is at the beginning, so the construct would start with HA coding sequence, then GADD45G.

Wait, but in the plus strand, the first codon is ATG, which is the start, then the HA sequence. Suppose the HA sequence is correctly included, but perhaps in the provided DNA sequence, the HA is followed by GADD45G.

But the problem is that there's a TGA in the sequence, which is a stop codon in the DNA, leading to UGA in mRNA, which is a stop.

So the presence of a TGA codon in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop, leading to a truncated protein. So the overexpression isn't happening because the protein isn't being made beyond that point; it's either not produced or only a short version.

So the possible reasons are that there's an early stop codon in the DNA sequence, which is causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Well, if the HA tag's sequence is wrong, it might affect the protein's structure but not necessarily cause a premature stop. Unless the mutation creates a stop codon. But the question is about the HA sequence, not about a stop codon in the HA itself.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

This is the result of a stop codon in the mRNA, which would be due to a TGA, TAG, or TAA in the DNA coding sequence.

C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

A linker sequence missing might cause the protein to be cleaved, but I'm not sure. Proteolysis usually occurs post-translationally, unless a specific cleavage site exists. But the question is about the inability to overexpress, which could be due to the protein not being made correctly.

D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Wait, UAA is a stop codon in mRNA. The DNA would have TAA. But in the sequence, the stop codon is TGA, leading to UGA in mRNA. So D is about UAA, which isn't the case here.

So the issue is that the DNA has a TGA codon, which leads to UGA in mRNA, a stop codon. Therefore, the ribosome stops early, so the protein isn't overexpressed.

Which option corresponds to this? Option B says the ribosome terminated early, which seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the construct has an early stop codon.

So the problem is that the sequence has a TGA in the coding frame, causing a premature stop. The options don't directly say that, but option B is about the ribosome stopping early. Alternatively, another possibility is that the HA tag's sequence has an in-frame stop codon.

Wait, but looking at the HA tag, it's a single determinant. The HA tag is a small peptide, so perhaps it's a short sequence that doesn't include a stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag is from the influenza virus, and it's typically a short sequence. For example, the HA tag is usually around 11 amino acids. So its DNA sequence shouldn't have a stop codon in the middle, especially since it's designed as an antigenic determinant.

So the problem must be elsewhere. The presence of TGA in the DNA sequence is causing the mRNA to have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome stops early, leading to a truncated protein. Since the construct is designed to overexpress the HA-GADD45G fusion, but the ribosome stops early, the protein isn't made in sufficient quantity, hence no overexpression.

So the correct answer is B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says that. However, the presence of a stop codon in the DNA would cause this. So the issue is that the DNA has an in-frame TGA, leading to UGA in the mRNA, causing the ribosome to stop early.

Another thing to consider: perhaps the stop codon is in the HA tag's sequence. But HA is at the beginning. Let me check the initial part of the DNA sequence.

The first part is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A... So the first codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCC (proline), ATA (isoleucine), CGA (arginine), TGT (cysteine), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TTA (leucine), CGC (arg), CAA (glu), ATG (another start? That can't be right).

Wait, wait a minute. The sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then TAC, which is tyrosine. So the HA tag is probably in the first few codons. But the presence of another ATG downstream could be a problem. Because if there's an ATG in the middle, it could serve as a start codon, but then the rest would be a different reading frame.

Wait, no, because the original ATG is the start. Any internal ATG would be in the same frame, so if the sequence doesn't have a stop codon before, it would continue. But in this case, the construct has an ATG in the middle, which is not a start codon for the same frame, but perhaps a frameshift? Or perhaps an alternative start site. But that would disrupt the reading frame, leading to a shorter protein.

Wait, the plus strand starts with ATG, and then later another ATG (eighth codon), which is in frame. So the second ATG is the 8th codon: let's count.

1. ATG
2. TAC
3. CCC
4. ATA
5. CGA
6. TGT
7. TCC
8. AGA
9. TTA
10. CGC
11. CAA
12. ATG

So at position 12, another ATG. That's a methionine again. So the ribosome would have read through the first ATG, then at codon 12, it would see another ATG, but as it's in the same reading frame, it would continue. But why would that cause a problem? Because the ribosome doesn't usually start at internal ATG unless there's a uORF or something, but typically, the first ATG is the start. So perhaps more importantly, the presence of TGA in the sequence is the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence has a TAA, TAG, or TGA, which would cause a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's sequence has a TGA in the DNA, that would be a problem.

But I don't think the HA tag is that long, so perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the stop codon is in the HA tag's DNA, causing the protein to terminate before GADD45G is expressed.

But according to the sequence provided, the HA is at the N-terminus, so if the HA's DNA has an in-frame stop codon, the entire construct would produce a short HA peptide and then stop, without producing GADD45G.

But looking at the given DNA sequence, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so perhaps the HA's sequence is the first few codons. So if the HA has a stop codon, the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so the coding sequence for HA should be before any stop codon. Let me check the first few codons:

ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCC (P), ATA (I), CGA (R), TGT (C), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (M), ACT (T), CTG (L), GAA (E), GAA (E), GTC (V), CGC (R), GGC (G), CAG (Q), GAC (D), ACA (T), GTT (V), CCG (P), GAA (E), AGC (S), A...

Wait, that's a lot of codons. The HA tag is probably the first few. Let me think: HA is a short peptide, say 11 amino acids. So the DNA sequence for HA would be about 33 nucleotides.

Looking at the start:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, that's 16 codons so far. That seems longer than the typical HA tag. So perhaps the HA tag extends beyond that, but the main issue is whether there's a stop codon in the HA's DNA.

But if the HA's DNA includes a TGA, then the mRNA would have UGA, causing a stop. So let me check the first 11 codons.

The first 11 codons:

1. ATG (M)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCC (P)
4. ATA (I)
5. CGA (R)
6. TGT (C)
7. TCC (S)
8. AGA (R)
9. TTA (L)
10. CGC (R)
11. CAA (Q)

No stop codons here. The next codon is ATG (M) again. So perhaps the HA tag is longer than 11, but even so, if there's a stop codon after that, it would cause the problem.

Wait, looking further, the 12th codon is ATG (M), 13th ACT (T), 14th CTG (L), 15th GAA (E), 16th GAA (E), etc. So no TGA in the first 16 codons.

Hmm, so the TGA is somewhere else in the sequence.

Earlier, I noticed that the sequence includes a TGA in the middle. Let's find that.

Looking through the sequence, I spot 'TGA' in this part: ...GTCGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Ah, wait, the 'TGA' appears in the middle of the construct. Let me count the codons from the start.

Wait, that's a bit tedious, but perhaps I can note the position.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence of the construct includes a TGA, which is a stop codon, so the mRNA has UGA, causing the ribosome to stop. So the protein is not being expressed beyond that point, leading to no overexpression.

So the issue is that the construct has a TGA codon in the coding sequence, leading to a premature stop. Thus, the ribosome terminates early, so the protein isn't made, hence no overexpression.

So the correct answer is B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence was analyzed for potential issues. The sequence represents the plus strand of the construct, which includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The key issue lies in the presence of an in-frame stop codon within the sequence.

### Analysis of the Sequence
1. **Start Codon**: The sequence begins with `ATG`, the standard start codon for translation.
2. **Stop Codon Identification**: The mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is complementary to the plus strand. Therefore, the mRNA sequence is identical to the plus strand but with `T` replaced by `U`. In the mRNA, stop codons are `UAA`, `UAG`, and `UGA`. These correspond to `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA` in the DNA plus strand.
3. **Presence of TGA**: Scanning the sequence revealed that the triplet `TGA` appears in the middle of the coding region. This corresponds to `UGA` in the mRNA, which is a stop codon. The presence of this stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein and preventing proper overexpression of the GADD45G protein.

### Evaluation of Options
- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: This is unlikely because the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and its sequence does not appear to include a stop codon. Additionally, a missense mutation would not necessarily prevent overexpression.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This is correct. The presence of the `TGA` codon in the DNA sequence leads to `UGA` in the mRNA, which is a stop codon. This causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing full-length protein production.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: Proteolysis typically occurs post-translationally and is not relevant here. The issue is with translation termination, not protein degradation.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This is incorrect because the stop codon in the sequence is `UGA`, not `UAA`. Additionally, the absence of tRNA for `UAA` would not explain the observed problem.

### Conclusion
The inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein is due to the premature termination of translation caused by the `TGA` codon in the DNA sequence, which corresponds to the stop codon `UGA` in the mRNA. This prevents the full-length protein from being synthesized.

**Answer: B**

First part: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in triplets.

Looking through:

- TAC TCC TAT ... no.
- ...ATG TAC GAT G...
Wait, let's find all the TGA triplets:

Looking for TGA in the sequence. Let me check:

...AGTCTTGAACGTGGAC...

Wait, here's a part: ...CTTGAACG... So the triplet is TGA, but in the context of the reading frame.

Wait, let's get the exact position. Let's look for 'TGA' in the sequence.

Looking again, I spot 'TGA' in the middle.

Wait, here's a segment: ...TTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, in the segment: ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA in the sequence. Let me see:

I think I found a TGA here: ...CGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, let me look for 'TGA' as a triplet. So in the sequence, I'm looking for three letters in a row: T, G, A.

Looking through the sequence:

...ACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Ah, I see 'TGA' at the very end. The last part is 'CGAGTGA'. So the last six nucleotides are GCTGCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is 'GAGTGA', which is in the sequence as ...GCTGCGAGTGA.

Wait, but let me look at the triplet:

The last part is 'GAGTGA3' (since the sequence ends with TGA).

So the triplet is TGA. So in the DNA plus strand, there's a TGA codon. That would correspond to UGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon.

So if the DNA has a TGA in the reading frame, the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation there, leading to a truncated protein.

So where is this TGA located? Let me see. It's somewhere in the middle of the sequence, not at the very end. Because the very end is GAGTGA, but that's the last part.

Wait, perhaps the GADD45G is followed by the HA tag, but the HA tag's sequence is part of the construct. Oh, wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the construct is GADD45G coding sequence plus HA. But wait, no. The description says "introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein."

So the HA tag is at the beginning, so the construct would start with HA coding sequence, then GADD45G.

Wait, but in the plus strand, the first codon is ATG, which is the start, then the HA sequence. Suppose the HA sequence is correctly included, but perhaps in the provided DNA sequence, the HA is followed by GADD45G.

But the problem is that there's a TGA in the sequence, which is a stop codon in the DNA, leading to UGA in mRNA, which is a stop.

So the presence of a TGA codon in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop, leading to a truncated protein. So the overexpression isn't happening because the protein isn't being made beyond that point; it's either not produced or only a short version.

So the possible reasons are that there's an early stop codon in the DNA sequence, which is causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Well, if the HA tag's sequence is wrong, it might affect the protein's structure but not necessarily cause a premature stop. Unless the mutation creates a stop codon. But the question is about the HA sequence, not about a stop codon in the HA itself.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

This is the result of a stop codon in the mRNA, which would be due to a TGA, TAG, or TAA in the DNA coding sequence.

C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

A linker sequence missing might cause the protein to be cleaved, but I'm not sure. Proteolysis usually occurs post-translationally, unless a specific cleavage site exists. But the question is about the inability to overexpress, which could be due to the protein not being made correctly.

D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Wait, UAA is a stop codon in mRNA. The DNA would have TAA. But in the sequence, the stop codon is TGA, leading to UGA in mRNA. So D is about UAA, which isn't the case here.

So the issue is that the DNA has a TGA codon, which leads to UGA in mRNA, a stop codon. Therefore, the ribosome stops early, so the protein isn't overexpressed.

Which option corresponds to this? Option B says the ribosome terminated early, which seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the construct has an early stop codon.

So the problem is that the sequence has a TGA in the coding frame, causing a premature stop. The options don't directly say that, but option B is about the ribosome stopping early. Alternatively, another possibility is that the HA tag's sequence has an in-frame stop codon.

Wait, but looking at the HA tag, it's a single determinant. The HA tag is a small peptide, so perhaps it's a short sequence that doesn't include a stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag is from the influenza virus, and it's typically a short sequence. For example, the HA tag is usually around 11 amino acids. So its DNA sequence shouldn't have a stop codon in the middle, especially since it's designed as an antigenic determinant.

So the problem must be elsewhere. The presence of TGA in the DNA sequence is causing the mRNA to have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome stops early, leading to a truncated protein. Since the construct is designed to overexpress the HA-GADD45G fusion, but the ribosome stops early, the protein isn't made in sufficient quantity, hence no overexpression.

So the correct answer is B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says that. However, the presence of a stop codon in the DNA would cause this. So the issue is that the DNA has an in-frame TGA, leading to UGA in the mRNA, causing the ribosome to stop early.

Another thing to consider: perhaps the stop codon is in the HA tag's sequence. But HA is at the beginning. Let me check the initial part of the DNA sequence.

The first part is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A... So the first codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCC (proline), ATA (isoleucine), CGA (arginine), TGT (cysteine), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TTA (leucine), CGC (arg), CAA (glu), ATG (another start? That can't be right).

Wait, wait a minute. The sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then TAC, which is tyrosine. So the HA tag is probably in the first few codons. But the presence of another ATG downstream could be a problem. Because if there's an ATG in the middle, it could serve as a start codon, but then the rest would be a different reading frame.

Wait, no, because the original ATG is the start. Any internal ATG would be in the same frame, so if the sequence doesn't have a stop codon before, it would continue. But in this case, the construct has an ATG in the middle, which is not a start codon for the same frame, but perhaps a frameshift? Or perhaps an alternative start site. But that would disrupt the reading frame, leading to a shorter protein.

Wait, the plus strand starts with ATG, and then later another ATG (eighth codon), which is in frame. So the second ATG is the 8th codon: let's count.

1. ATG
2. TAC
3. CCC
4. ATA
5. CGA
6. TGT
7. TCC
8. AGA
9. TTA
10. CGC
11. CAA
12. ATG

So at position 12, another ATG. That's a methionine again. So the ribosome would have read through the first ATG, then at codon 12, it would see another ATG, but as it's in the same reading frame, it would continue. But why would that cause a problem? Because the ribosome doesn't usually start at internal ATG unless there's a uORF or something, but typically, the first ATG is the start. So perhaps more importantly, the presence of TGA in the sequence is the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence has a TAA, TAG, or TGA, which would cause a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's sequence has a TGA in the DNA, that would be a problem.

But I don't think the HA tag is that long, so perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the stop codon is in the HA tag's DNA, causing the protein to terminate before GADD45G is expressed.

But according to the sequence provided, the HA is at the N-terminus, so if the HA's DNA has an in-frame stop codon, the entire construct would produce a short HA peptide and then stop, without producing GADD45G.

But looking at the given DNA sequence, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so perhaps the HA's sequence is the first few codons. So if the HA has a stop codon, the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so the coding sequence for HA should be before any stop codon. Let me check the first few codons:

ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCC (P), ATA (I), CGA (R), TGT (C), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (M), ACT (T), CTG (L), GAA (E), GAA (E), GTC (V), CGC (R), GGC (G), CAG (Q), GAC (D), ACA (T), GTT (V), CCG (P), GAA (E), AGC (S), A...

Wait, that's a lot of codons. The HA tag is probably the first few. Let me think: HA is a short peptide, say 11 amino acids. So the DNA sequence for HA would be about 33 nucleotides.

Looking at the start:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, that's 16 codons so far. That seems longer than the typical HA tag. So perhaps the HA tag extends beyond that, but the main issue is whether there's a stop codon in the HA's DNA.

But if the HA's DNA includes a TGA, then the mRNA would have UGA, causing a stop. So let me check the first 11 codons.

The first 11 codons:

1. ATG (M)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCC (P)
4. ATA (I)
5. CGA (R)
6. TGT (C)
7. TCC (S)
8. AGA (R)
9. TTA (L)
10. CGC (R)
11. CAA (Q)

No stop codons here. The next codon is ATG (M) again. So perhaps the HA tag is longer than 11, but even so, if there's a stop codon after that, it would cause the problem.

Wait, looking further, the 12th codon is ATG (M), 13th ACT (T), 14th CTG (L), 15th GAA (E), 16th GAA (E), etc. So no TGA in the first 16 codons.

Hmm, so the TGA is somewhere else in the sequence.

Earlier, I noticed that the sequence includes a TGA in the middle. Let's find that.

Looking through the sequence, I spot 'TGA' in this part: ...GTCGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Ah, wait, the 'TGA' appears in the middle of the construct. Let me count the codons from the start.

Wait, that's a bit tedious, but perhaps I can note the position.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence of the construct includes a TGA, which is a stop codon, so the mRNA has UGA, causing the ribosome to stop. So the protein is not being expressed beyond that point, leading to no overexpression.

So the issue is that the construct has a TGA codon in the coding sequence, leading to a premature stop. Thus, the ribosome terminates early, so the protein isn't made, hence no overexpression.

So the correct answer is B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.


To determine why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence was analyzed for potential issues. The sequence represents the plus strand of the construct, which includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The key issue lies in the presence of an in-frame stop codon within the sequence.

### Analysis of the Sequence
1. **Start Codon**: The sequence begins with `ATG`, the standard start codon for translation.
2. **Stop Codon Identification**: The mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is complementary to the plus strand. Therefore, the mRNA sequence is identical to the plus strand but with `T` replaced by `U`. In the mRNA, stop codons are `UAA`, `UAG`, and `UGA`. These correspond to `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA` in the DNA plus strand.
3. **Presence of TGA**: Scanning the sequence revealed that the triplet `TGA` appears in the middle of the coding region. This corresponds to `UGA` in the mRNA, which is a stop codon. The presence of this stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein and preventing proper overexpression of the GADD45G protein.

### Evaluation of Options
- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: This is unlikely because the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and its sequence does not appear to include a stop codon. Additionally, a missense mutation would not necessarily prevent overexpression.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This is correct. The presence of the `TGA` codon in the DNA sequence leads to `UGA` in the mRNA, which is a stop codon. This causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing full-length protein production.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: Proteolysis typically occurs post-translationally and is not relevant here. The issue is with translation termination, not protein degradation.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This is incorrect because the stop codon in the sequence is `UGA`, not `UAA`. Additionally, the absence of tRNA for `UAA` would not explain the observed problem.

### Conclusion
The inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein is due to the premature termination of translation caused by the `TGA` codon in the DNA sequence, which corresponds to the stop codon `UGA` in the mRNA. This prevents the full-length protein from being synthesized.
