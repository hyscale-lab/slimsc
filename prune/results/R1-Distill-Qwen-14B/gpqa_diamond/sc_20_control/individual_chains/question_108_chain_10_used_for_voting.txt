Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. It mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but I remember that m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, where l is the orbital quantum number. Small m probably means that the splitting due to the magnetic field isn't too large, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays into this.

The main thing I need to compare is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the wavelength of the Balmer series for hydrogen, right? Specifically, the Balmer-alpha line, which is around 656 nm when converted to nanometers. Oh wait, the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. Wait no, wait: 1 micrometer is 1000 nanometers. So 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nanometers. Hmm, that's actually the Balmer-beta line. Or maybe I'm mixing up the lines. Anyway, the exact line isn't too important; what matters is the energy difference ΔE.

I think the energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The transition energy can be calculated using the wavelength. The formula relates the energy difference between two levels to the inverse of the wavelength. The formula is ΔE = hc / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Let me compute ΔE first. I know that hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. Since λ is 486.1 nm, ΔE ≈ 1240 / 486.1 ≈ let me calculate that. 1240 divided by 486 is roughly 2.55 eV. Wait, that seems high because I remember that the Balmer series transitions are in the visible range, so the energy should be around 3-4 eV? No, wait, visible light has lower energy. Wait no, visible photons are in the range of about 1.5eV to 3eV. Wait, 486 nm is blue-green, so the energy would be higher. Let me double-check the calculation. 1240 / 486.1 ≈ 2.55 eV, yes. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake because I remember that the hydrogen Balmer-alpha transition is about 1.89 eV. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the Rydberg constant. Oh, wait: The Rydberg constant is about 13.6 eV for the ground state, but the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So the transition from n=2 to n=1 would give energy ΔE = E_1 - E_2 = (-13.6) - (-3.4) = -10.2 eV? Wait, that doesn't make sense because that's for the Lyman series. Oh wait, no, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So, let's say the transition from n=3 to n=2. E3 = -13.6 / 9 ≈ -1.51 eV, E2 ≈ -3.4 eV. So ΔE would be E3 - E2 = (-1.51) - (-3.4) = 1.89 eV. Oh wait, the wavelength for this transition is about 656 nm (Balmer-alpha, H-alpha line). So if the wavelength given is 486 nm, that's Balmer-beta, which is n=4 to n=2. E4 = -13.6 / 16 ≈ -0.85 eV. So ΔE would be (-0.85) - (-3.4) = 2.55 eV. That makes sense with the initial calculation from hc/λ.

So ΔE is approximately 2.55 eV. Got it.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being considered here. Paramagnetism in atoms arises from the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electrons and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -g μ_B m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the question is referring to the orbital magnetic moment or the spin. Since the question mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m, I think it's the orbital contribution. So the expectation value of the Hamiltonian would be ⟨H⟩ = -μ_B B m. But wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L_z)/(ħ) ) * m, which simplifies to μ_orbital = μ_B * m. So the Hamiltonian is H = -μ_B B m.

Wait, but the actual expression is H = -μ·B, and μ = g μ_B m, but for orbital angular momentum, g is approximately 1. So H = -μ_B B m. But since the magnetic field is along Oz, which is the quantization axis, the expectation value is simply the diagonal term.

But wait, the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think refers to the term in the Hamiltonian due to the external magnetic field. So the expectation value of H would be proportional to m. But for hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can be 0, 1, etc. For the ground state, l=0, but higher states have l=1, 2, etc. But wait, small m implies that m could be 0, ±1 (since m can't be larger than l). Wait, but the problem says small m, but for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So m is small, but not zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem is about the splitting due to the magnetic field. In the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split according to the Zeeman effect. The energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B B m. So the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field is μ_B B m. But wait, the question says 'paramagnetic coupling term'—so this would be the energy shift due to the magnetic interaction.

But wait, the paramagnetic effect is usually about the spin, but the question here is specifically about the orbital term. Hmm. Maybe the orbital contribution is what's being considered. So let's calculate the magnitude of this term.

Let me compute μ_B. The Bohr magneton is about 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T. So when you multiply by B=1 T, you get μ_B * B ≈ 9.274e-24 J.

But wait, what about the unit conversion? Because we're comparing energies in eV. So 1 J is about 6.242e18 eV. So 9.274e-24 J multiplied by 6.242e18 eV/J gives approximately 5.78e-5 eV. Hmm, that's 5.78e-5 eV.

But wait, the energy shift is ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B B m. For m=1, that would be 5.78e-5 eV. But wait, the transition energy ΔE we calculated earlier is about 2.55 eV. So the Zeeman term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but this is the energy shift for a single m. But in the hydrogen atom, the energy levels split into multiple levels based on m. So the paramagnetic term (Zeeman term) is much smaller than the transition energy. So the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field is much less than the ΔE of the transition.

Wait, but wait. Let's double-check the numbers. μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T. B is 1 T. So μ_B * B = 9.27e-24 J. Converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 9.27e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 5.79e-5 eV. So 5.79e-5 eV. For m=1, the shift is 5.79e-5 eV. But for higher m, say m=100, it would be 5.79e-3 eV, but the question says small m, so m is likely 1 or so.

So the paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV, and ΔE is about 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but let me think again. Because in the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are much larger in magnitude than the Zeeman shifts. So the paramagnetic term is indeed much smaller.

So the question is asking which is bigger: the paramagnetic coupling term (⟨H⟩) or the transition energy ΔE. Well, in this case, ⟨H⟩ is much smaller. So the correct option would be option C: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \))**:  
   The wavelength of the transition is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu m = 486.1 \, nm \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( hc \approx 1240 \, \text{eV·nm} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{1240}{486.1} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is given by \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B B m \), where \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton (\( \mu_B \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \)), \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number.  
   Converting \( \mu_B B \) to electron volts:  
   \[
   \mu_B B \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \times 1 \, \text{T} \times \frac{1 \, \text{eV}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \approx 5.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   For small \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 1 \)), the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( 5.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \).

3. **Comparison**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term is \( 5.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Clearly, the paramagnetic coupling term is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

Thus, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom.
