Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Let me break down each step to understand what's happening.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone has a six-membered ring with one ketone group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane with a carbonyl group on one carbon.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. I think when a ketone reacts with bromine, it's probably an addition reaction. Wait, but wait—no, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Oh, right! I think this is a bromination via the enolate. Or wait, maybe it's some kind of addition. Or perhaps it's a diels-alder scenario? No, bromine addition to a ketone... Hmm. Oh wait, no. Maybe it's a radical bromination. No, wait, that's more for alkanes. Wait, actually, no—when ketones react with bromine in a certain condition, they undergo a reaction. Another thought: cyclohexanone can undergo a bromination via the enol intermediate. So, when treated with Br2, perhaps it forms a dienol bromide or adds across the carbonyl. Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone, so adding bromine might not just be addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination of the cyclohexane ring. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a benzene ring, so it's not aromatic. So, maybe the cyclohexane ring undergoes bromination via some mechanism—like maybe via a radical mechanism if it's light, but bromine (Br2) alone? Or perhaps it's a di- addition to the ketone. Wait, wait, another approach. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group; adding Br2 could be a dibromination on the carbonyl. Oh wait, but if you add bromine to a ketone, you might get a bromohydrin. But wait, I think the more common reaction is the addition of Br2 to ketones to form a bromohydrin, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromination via an enolate. When you have a ketone and treat it with a base, like maybe Br2 and a base, the enolate could form and attack Br2. But in this case, the first step is just cyclohexanone treated with Br2. So, perhaps it's adding Br across the carbonyl group. Let me think: the carbonyl is O=C-. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, but wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. So, adding Br2 would lead to a dibromide. No, wait, the carbonyl is C=O, so adding Br2 would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane derivative? Or perhaps it's a diastereomeric addition. So, the product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. But wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a bromine substituent. Wait, but where would it add?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another thought: the reaction of ketones with bromine water is a known reaction for testing ketones. They add across the carbonyl, forming a bromohydrin. So, product 1 would have a Br and OH added across the carbonyl. But wait, is it possible that the bromine adds to the carbonyl, leading to a geminal dihalide? No, because adding Br2 would be a vicinal addition (addition across the double bond). So, the carbonyl group (O=C-) would become CBr-OH or something? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromination of cyclohexane via a radical mechanism, but I don't think so because cyclohexanone is more reactive at the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about each reagent and what they do.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Another possibility: maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group. The carbonyl in cyclohexanone isn't a great leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-bromination via the enolate. Wait, maybe when cyclohexanone is treated with Br2, it's an example of the Favorskii reaction, which is when a ketone is brominated to form a diester. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromination on the ring, but I'm confused because cyclohexanone is a six-membered chair with a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps the bromine adds to the ring. But in that case, how?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think again. Maybe it's an addition reaction. The carbonyl group (C=O) in cyclohexanone could react with Br2. When alkenes react with Br2, it's an addition across the double bond. So, if the C=O is treated with Br2, perhaps a similar addition occurs. So, O=C- becomes O-CBr2-? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe the Br adds to the carbonyl carbon and the other Br to the oxygen? But that would form a bromide ester. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, actually, I think I'm mixing up reactions. Let me recall: When ketones react with HBr, they form bromoalkanes via nucleophilic addition. But Br2 is a dienophile, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a cycloaddition? No, that's usually with dienes and dienophiles like Br2, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a conjugated diene.

Hmm. I'm stuck on step 1. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the product after step 1 is a brominated cyclohexanol. Wait, but how? Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-bromo-cyclohexanone. But how would that form? Unless it's a substitution, but I don't see a good leaving group on the ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should think beyond the first step for a moment. Suppose product 1 is something that upon heating with NaOH (step 2) becomes product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine (step 3), leading to product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, to form product 4.

Wait, so let's think about each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Suppose product 1 is 1-bromo-cyclohexanone. But wait, where would the Br attach? Maybe on the ring carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. But how?

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone. But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a bromohydrin formation. So, cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane. So, the carbonyl is converted into a CH(OH)Br group. So, the product 1 would have a Br and an OH on the same carbon.

But then step 2 is heating with NaOH. Heating a diol (like a bromo alcohol) with NaOH would likely lead to elimination, forming an alkene. So, product 2 would be cyclohexene with a substituent? Let me see: the starting material is 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane. When heated with NaOH, it would undergo elimination, losing H2O and HBr, forming a double bond. So, the product would be cyclohexene with a substituent—wait, where?

Wait, the initial structure after step 1 is a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)Br group. Upon elimination, the H from the adjacent carbon and the OH would leave, forming a double bond. So, the product would be 1,2-cyclohexene with a substituent? Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C1 and C2, making cyclohexene. But I'm a bit confused about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is cyclohexene. But I need to visualize this.

Wait, another approach: in step 1, adding Br2 to cyclohexanone forms a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Then, in step 2, heating with NaOH would cause the dibromide to undergo elimination. For example, a vicinal dihalide (1,2-dibromocyclohexane) when treated with a base like NaOH would eliminate Br- and form a double bond, producing cyclohexene.

So, product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: product 2 (cyclohexene) is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, but for alkenes, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: cyclohexene with thionyl chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is more commonly used to convert alcohols to chlorides, but with alkenes, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, I think when alkenes are treated with SOCl2, it can lead to chlorination via an electrophilic addition. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrochlorination. But wait, SOCl2 and pyridine might be used to make chlorides. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is reacting in a way to form a chlorohydrin. Wait, but chlorohydrin formation usually involves SOCl2 and water, but in this case, pyridine is present. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a chlorohydrin formation. When an alkene reacts with SOCl2, it can form a chlorohydrin. So, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 3-chlorocyclohexanol? Or maybe 1-chlorocyclohexene-1-ol? Wait, not exactly, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding Cl across the double bond. So, cyclohexene would react with SOCl2 to form 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a chlorination to form a chlorocyclohexane.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about the steps again. Product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent. It's used for ketone reductions, but also for esters and other carbonyl groups. Wait, but if product 3 is something like an acyl chloride, then LiAlH would reduce it to an alcohol. Alternatively, if product 3 is an ester, the same applies.

Wait, let me try again. After step 3, product 3 is treated with this strong reducing agent. So, what reactions would involve that reagent? For example, if product 3 is an ester, the LiAlH would reduce it to a diol (if it's an ester) but wait, no, esters are reduced to alcohols. Alternatively, if product 3 is a ketone, it would be reduced to an alcohol.

But wait, let's try to outline each step again:

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Assuming product 1 is 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane (bromohydrin).

Step 2: Product 1 heated with NaOH → product 2.

Heating a bromohydrin with base leads to elimination, forming an alkene.

So, product 2 is cyclohexene with a substituent. Wait, no. Wait, the bromohydrin is 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane, which upon elimination (like E2) would lose H2O and HBr, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but in cyclohexane, the carbons are all connected in a ring. So, if the Br and OH are on C1, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohexene with a substituent?

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure: the starting cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the carbonyl group on C1. When Br2 is added, the bromohydrin would have Br and OH on C1. So, when heated with NaOH, elimination occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohexene. So, product 2 is cyclohexene.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, product 2 is cyclohexene.

Step 3: product 2 (cyclohexene) treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine → product 3.

Cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine. I'm not entirely sure about this reaction, but I'll try to recall. I think that alkenes can react with SOCl2 in an addition reaction. For example, propene reacting with SOCl2 would form an chloro compound. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is converted into a di-substituted chloro compound.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a hydrochlorination reaction. But under what conditions? SOCl2 is more of a chlorinating agent, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it adds across the double bond, making a dichloride. So, cyclohexene would add two Cl atoms across the double bond, forming 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a chlorohydrin formation. Chlorohydrins are formed when an alkene reacts with a chlorinated water or HCl in presence of H2O. But in this case, the reagent is SOCl2 and pyridine. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, another reaction: when alkenes react with SOCl2, it can form a chloroalkane. For example, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → cyclohexyl chloride. But I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexene reacts with SOCl2 to form 1-chlorocyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclopropane formation? No, that's with something else like carbonyl chloride and a base. Hmm, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-chlorination. So, the cyclohexene would add two Cl atoms across the double bond, giving 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. This is a strong reducing agent. Typically, it's used to reduce esters, amides, and other carbonyl-containing compounds. But if product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, how would this reagent affect it? I don't think LiAlH would reduce dichlorides; maybe it's something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3. Let me think again. If product 2 is cyclohexene, and in step 3 it reacts with SOCl2 and pyridine, perhaps it's a chloroalkane formation. For example, adding Cl across the double bond, making 1-chlorocyclohexane. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexene is converted into cyclohexyl chloride. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a ring-opening addition. When an epoxide is treated with SOCl2, it forms a chloro compound, but cyclohexene isn't an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible product after step 4, product 4, to see what it's like and then backtrack.

Product 4 is formed by treating product 3 with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. So, what does this reagent do? It's a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols, but it can also reduce ketones. Wait, but if product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, then this reagent wouldn't reduce it. So, maybe product 3 is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3. Let's think: if product 2 is cyclohexene, and step 3 is treatment with SOCl2 and pyridine, maybe it's a process to form a chlorinated cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is converted into a di-substituted chlorinated compound.

Wait, maybe the reaction is converting cyclohexene into 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. So, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: treating with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Hmm, but that's a strong hydride reducing agent. It can reduce esters, nitriles, amides, but I don't think it reduces alkanes. So, if product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, I don't see a reaction with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. So, maybe I'm wrong in my earlier steps.

Alternative approach: perhaps step 1 is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. So, product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: heating with NaOH. Vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromocyclohexane) upon treatment with NaOH would eliminate to form an alkene. So, product 2 is cyclohexene.

Step 3: cyclohexene treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. So, maybe the double bond reacts with SOCl2 to form a chlorinated cyclohexane. For example, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 1-chlorocyclohexane. But wait, I'm not sure about the mechanism here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a chlorohydrin formation, but without water, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-chlorination, leading to 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Step 4: treating 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Hmm, this seems confusing. Wait, LiAlH can sometimes reduce chlorides, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps.

Wait, maybe step 3 is converting the alkene into a ketone. How? If product 2 is cyclohexene, and then treated with a reagent that forms an epoxide, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diels-alder, but I don't see a dienophile here.

Wait, maybe step 3 is a hydrohalogenation of the alkene. So, cyclohexene + HCl → chlorocyclohexane. But how does SOCl2 fit into this?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition of HCl to the cyclohexene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of alternative possibilities. Let's consider that step 3 converts the alkene into a di-substituted chloride. So, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, product 4 is treated with a strong reducing agent. But I don't see how LiAlH(t-Bu)3 would act on that. Maybe I'm wrong about product 3.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is converting the alkene into an epoxide. But I don't think SOCl2 does that. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening epoxidation, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 2. Let me think again.

If product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, then heating with NaOH would eliminate to form cyclohexene.

So, product 2 is cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: treating cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine. Maybe this is an addition reaction, where Cl adds across the double bond. So, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: treating 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. But, again, this reagent is for reducing carbonyl groups, not for reducing chlorides. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is cyclohexyl chloride, and the LiAlH would reduce it. But I'm not sure if it reduces chlorides.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think about the overall process. The starting material is cyclohexanone. After four steps, the product is something that has a certain number of chemically distinct hydrogens.

Another approach: maybe the final product is cyclohexanol. Let me see how that would fit.

But how? Let me think:

Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1: maybe 1-bromo-cyclohexanone? Then, step 2: heating with NaOH could be a substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone reduction, but NaOH is a base, not a reducing agent.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is cyclohexyl bromide, and step 2 is elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each step's possible products:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1,2-dibromocyclohexane (product 1).

2. Product 1 heated with NaOH → elimination (E2) to form cyclohexene (product 2).

3. Cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine → 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane (product 3).

4. Product 3 treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → ?

But I don't see a reaction for step 4. So, perhaps I'm wrong about product 3.

Alternative possibility: step 3 is converting the alkene into a ketone. How? Maybe via ozonolysis, but that doesn't fit with SOCl2.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is cyclohexanone again? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe step 3 is a hydrohalogenation. So, cyclohexene adds HCl to form chlorocyclohexane. Then, product 3 is chlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. But I don't think LiAlH reduces chlorides to alkanes. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck because I don't correctly understand step 3. Let me think differently. Maybe step 3 is introducing a carbonyl group. For example, if product 2 is cyclohexene, and step 3 is a dihydroxylation, but that would require something like OsO4, not SOCl2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 2 is cyclohexene, and step 3 is epoxidation. But SOCl2 isn't used for that; it's more for chlorinations.

Wait, perhaps in step 3, the alkene is converted into a chlorinated epoxide? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine is an acid-catalyzed addition of Cl across the double bond, forming 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

So, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4 is treating this with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. But I'm not sure what reaction would occur here. Maybe the chloride is a leaving group, but under what conditions? Alternatively, perhaps the LiAlH is a strong enough reducing agent to break the C-Cl bond, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene. Then, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 could reduce the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 3 is cyclohexyl chloride. Then, LiAlH reduces it to cyclohexane, but I don't think LiAlH does that.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try to think of each step again, but maybe in a different order.

Another approach: The overall process.

Cyclohexanone → product 1 (bromination) → product 2 (elimination) → product 3 (chlorination) → product 4 (reduction).

What could product 4 be? It's after a strong reduction. So, perhaps something with an alcohol group or an amine.

Wait, let me think of the steps again.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1. Maybe this is a benzoin condensation or some addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination on the ring.

Wait, wait! Oh, wait a minute. Maybe the first step is not adding Br to the carbonyl but rather brominating the ring. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The ring is a cyclohexane with a ketone group. If we brominate the ring, where would the Br add? In the meta position relative to the ketone? But since it's a six-membered ring, adding Br in a certain position.

Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ketone, which is an electron-withdrawing group. So, the bromination would occur at the position para to the carbonyl. But wait, in a six-membered ring, the positions are meta and para?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in a six-membered ring with a substituent, bromination typically occurs at the most substituted position. But the carbonyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring. So, bromination would occur para to the carbonyl. So, product 1 would be 4-bromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a benzene ring, so electrophilic substitution (bromination) isn't possible. Oh! Right, cyclohexanone is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group, but the ring is not aromatic. So, it's not susceptible to electrophilic substitution like benzene. So, bromination under such conditions (like Br2) would not substitute on the ring, unless it's a radical mechanism, but that requires light and a different setup.

So, going back, the initial assumption that step 1 is an addition reaction to the carbonyl is more likely.

So, product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: elimination to form cyclohexene.

Step 3: cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine. I think I've read that alkenes can react with SOCl2 to form chloroalkanes, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's adding Cl across the double bond.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cyclohexene is treated with SOCl2 in a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but that doesn't fit because cyclohexene isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrochlorination. So, cyclohexene + HCl → chlorocyclohexane. But then, where is the Cl added? The most substituted position, so maybe the Cl is added to the less substituted carbon.

Wait, but SOCl2 is more commonly used to convert alcohols into chlorides. So, perhaps the steps are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in step 3 is a chlorohydrin formation, but without water, that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe I should accept that step 3 produces 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, and then step 4 reduces it.

But then, how does the reducing agent affect product 3? LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent. Maybe it can reduce the C-Cl bonds? I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is an ester, which would then be reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3. Let me think, product 2 is cyclohexene. Maybe step 3 is converting the double bond into a carbonyl group. How? Ozonolysis would do that, but the reagent is SOCl2 and pyridine. Alternatively, maybe it's a Prins reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is cyclohexanone again. But that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should think about the final product. Suppose product 4 is cyclohexanol. Then, how many distinct hydrogens would it have?

Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group. The chair conformation would have axial and equatorial positions. So, the OH would be either axial or equatorial, leading to different environments.

But the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. So, in cyclohexanol, the hydrogens adjacent to the OH are different from those opposite or next to substituents.

Wait, but cyclohexanol has multiple equivalent hydrogens. Let me think: the chair conformation of cyclohexanol would have the OH in the axial position (or equatorial). If it's axial, then the adjacent hydrogens are all equivalent in a certain way, but perhaps some are equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, but I might need to draw this.

Alternatively, maybe product 4 is a diol, which would have more distinct hydrogens.

Wait, another possibility: product 4 is benzyl alcohol or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is cyclohexane with multiple substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step more systematically.

Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Assuming that Br2 adds to the carbonyl, making a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. So, product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: product 1 (1,2-dibromocyclohexane) is heated with NaOH. Vicinal dihalide elimination: E2 mechanism, forming cyclohexene.

Product 2: cyclohexene.

Step 3: cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine. This is a typical condition for converting alcohols to chlorides, but cyclohexene is an alkene.

Wait, I think I found a reaction: the addition of SOCl2 to alkenes can form chlorinated alkanes. Specifically, it can add across the double bond, leading to a di-substituted chloro compound. So, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

So, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Step 4: product 3 (1,2-dichlorocyclohexane) is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. What does this reagent do? I know that LiAlH typically reduces carbonyl groups, but it can also reduce some other functional groups. However, 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane is an alkane with two Cl substituents. I don't think LiAlH would react with this.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product 3. Maybe the reaction in step 3 is different.

Alternative approach: perhaps step 3 is a hydrohalogenation, adding HCl across the double bond of cyclohexene. So, product 3 would be 1-chlorocyclohexane.

But then, step 4: treating with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 3 is an epoxide. Then, product 4 would be the opening of the epoxide with LiAlH. But how?

Wait, but the reagents in step 3 don't suggest epoxidation. So, perhaps that's not the case.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Perhaps, the overall process is a dihydroxylation followed by some reaction.

Wait, another approach: maybe product 4 is cyclohexanol. So, how would that happen? Let's see:

1. Br2 adds to cyclohexanone to form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.
2. Heating with NaOH forms cyclohexene via elimination.
3. Treating cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine forms chlorinated cyclohexane.
4. Treating with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 reduces the Cl to something else. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is forming an acid chloride. But cyclohexene isn't a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe I'm missing the context. Let me think about the reagents again.

LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent, more selective than LiAlH4. It's used for the reduction of esters, ketones, and other carbonyl-containing compounds. It might not reduce alkanes, but perhaps if product 3 is an ester, then product 4 would be an alcohol.

Wait, but product 3 is derived from cyclohexene. How could it be an ester?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are as follows:

Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → forms a bromide on the ring? But I don't think so.

Perhaps I'm stuck and should think of the possible answer based on the number of distinct hydrogens.

Assuming product 4 is cyclohexanol. How many distinct H?

In cyclohexanol, the chair conformation has the OH in axial or equatorial position. The six-membered ring would have different environments:

- The OH-bearing carbon: has two adjacent hydrogens (if axial, they're in a certain environment).
- The adjacent carbons (two on either side of the OH) would have different H's.
- The opposite carbon would have a different set.

But wait, in cyclohexanol, the chair conformation leads to axial and equatorial hydrogens, but the substituents create different environments.

Wait, considering that, cyclohexanol has several distinct H's. Let's count:

- The carbon with the OH: two H's (but in a chair, they are both axial or equatorial? No, the OH is on one carbon, which has two H's in axial and equatorial positions, but for cyclohexanol, the substituent is axial. So, the neighboring carbons would have H's in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the symmetry of the molecule.

Wait, cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group. The molecule isn't symmetric because the OH breaks the symmetry. So, the hydrogens on the ring would be in different environments based on their proximity to the OH group.

In the chair conformation, the OH is axial. Then:

- The carbon adjacent to OH (C2 and C6) each have two axial H's (but in a different environment than the others) and two equatorial H's.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to count the distinct H environments:

1. The OH-bearing carbon (C1): has two H's (axial and equatorial? No, in cyclohexanol, the OH is axial, so the axial H's are pointing up, and the equatorial H's are down. Wait, no, in the chair, the OH is axial, and the H's on C1 are both axial? No, each C has two H's in a chair. Wait, no, each carbon in cyclohexane has two H's attached. If C1 has the OH group, the two H's on C1 are in the axial position. Wait, no, in a chair, each axial substituent is pointing up or down. So, in cyclohexanol, the OH is axial, pointing down. Then, the two H's on C1 would be axial (pointing up?), but wait, that can't be because the OH is substituting one of the positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this.

In the chair conformation, each carbon has two H's. If the OH is axial (pointing down), then the two H's on C1 are axial (pointing up) and equatorial (pointing down). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the substituent (OH) is axial, so the H's would be in the opposite axial direction.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Each carbon in the cyclohexane ring has two H's. In the chair conformation, one H is axial (pointing up) and the other equatorial (pointing down for that carbon). So, for C1, which has the OH, perhaps the axial H is pointing up, and the equatorial is pointing down. But since the OH is axial, maybe the axial H is pointing in a different direction.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the conformations. Let me think about the number of distinct H's in cyclohexanol.

In cyclohexanol, there are several types of H:

- The two H's on the carbon bearing the OH (C1). Are they equivalent? In the chair conformation, if the OH is axial, the two H's on C1 are both axial, pointing in opposite axial directions. Wait, no, each carbon in cyclohexane has two H's, one axial and one equatorial.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of unique H's. Let's consider the molecule:

- C1: OH group. The two H's on C1: one axial, one equatorial. Are they equivalent? No, because the OH is axial. So, the axial H (same as OH's direction) would be in a different environment than the equatorial H.

- C2 and C6: these are the adjacent carbons. Each has two H's. The axial H's on C2 and C6 are pointing away from the OH, while the equatorial H's are closer.

- C3 and C5: these are meta to the OH. Their axial H's are opposite to the OH, and equatorial H's are in between.

- C4: opposite the OH. Its axial H's are directly opposite to the OH.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps I should count the unique H environments.

In cyclohexanol, the OH is in a specific position, breaking the symmetry. So, the ring has the following unique H's:

1. The two H's on C1 (axial and equatorial, but are they equivalent? No, because the axial is near the OH).

2. The two H's on C2 (axial and equatorial).

3. The two H's on C3.

4. The two H's on C4.

5. The two H's on C5.

6. The two H's on C6.

But considering the chair conformation and the OH's position, some H's may be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps in cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the OH and C4. So, the H's on C2 and C6 are mirror images and thus equivalent. Similarly, H's on C3 and C5 are equivalent.

So, the distinct H's would be:

- C1: two distinct H's (axial and equatorial).

- C2: one type (since axial and equatorial are in symmetric positions).

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because the OH breaks the symmetry, the H's on C2 and C6 are not equivalent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in cyclohexanol, the number of distinct H's is 6. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 4 is a different structure altogether.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a diol. How?

If product 3 is a di-substituted epoxide, then product 4 would be a diol. But I don't see how that happens in the given steps.

Alternatively, maybe product 3 is a ketone, which is reduced to an alcohol in step 4.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.

If product 3 is a ketone, then LiAlH would reduce it to an alcohol.

But how would product 3 be a ketone?

Perhaps in step 3, the cyclohexene is converted into a ketone via some reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps step 3 is a dihydroxylation, forming a diol, but that doesn't fit with SOCl2.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a bromohydrin formation, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the possible answers. The options are 6, 8, 10, or 7.

If product 4 is cyclohexanol, which has 6 carbons, but how many distinct H's?

Alternatively, maybe product 4 is 1,2-diol cyclohexane. Then, the number of distinct H's would be higher.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the steps result in a bicyclic compound.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the possible product 4.

Wait, another possibility: the final product is 1,2-cyclohexanediol. How?

If product 3 is a di-substituted epoxide, which is then opened by LiAlH(t-Bu)3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a carbonyl compound. Let's say, product 3 is a ketone, which is reduced to an alcohol in step 4.

But how would product 3 be a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane (bromohydrin).

2. Heating with NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexene.

3. Cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine → forms something else.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is a chlorohydrin formation. So, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 1-chlorocyclohexanol.

Then, product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexanol.

Step 4: treating with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → reduction. LiAlH can reduce the Cl to something else? Or perhaps the LiAlH is a strong enough base to eliminate.

Wait, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. If product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexanol, perhaps the Cl is replaced by a hydride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the LiAlH reduces the ketone to an alcohol, but product 3 isn't a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it this way:

If product 4 is a cyclohexane derivative with multiple substituents, the number of distinct H's depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is cyclohexane with a substituent that creates several unique H environments.

Wait, another approach: the final product is benzene, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a benzyl-type structure, but I don't see how.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the answer based on the options.

The options are 6, 8, 10, or 7.

If product 4 is cyclohexanol, the number of distinct H's would be 6? Or more.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, which has three sets of H's: axial, equatorial, and adjacent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm not making progress here. Maybe I'll have to make an educated guess.

Another approach: the initial steps convert cyclohexanone into cyclohexene, then into a di-substituted compound, and finally into something with multiple substituents.

Wait, perhaps the final product is 1,2-diol cyclohexane. So, product 4 would be 1,2-cyclohexanediol.

In that case, the ring has two adjacent OH groups. How many distinct H's?

In 1,2-cyclohexanediol, the chair conformation would have the two OH groups either axial or equatorial. The molecule would have several distinct H environments.

Counting the H's:

- C1 and C2 have OH groups.

- C3 and C6 are adjacent to both OH groups.

- C4 is opposite the diol.

Each position would have unique H's.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a bicyclic compound with bridgehead hydrogens, leading to more distinct H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to count.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a benzene ring, but that's unlikely.

Another thought: maybe after all steps, product 4 is benzaldehyde, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 8. Because in some cyclohexane derivatives, there are 8 distinct H's.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, which has 8 distinct H's. Hmm, but earlier steps don't seem to lead to that.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a di-substituted cyclohexane with multiple substituents, leading to 8 distinct H's.

But I'm not confident.

Given that I've thought through all possible steps and reactions but can't pinpoint the exact structure, I'll have to make an educated guess. The most plausible scenario is that product 4 has 8 distinct H's, so the answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 after a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, likely via addition across the carbonyl group, forming 1,2-dibromocyclohexane (Product 1).

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heating) → Product 2**  
   The vicinal dihalide (1,2-dibromocyclohexane) undergoes elimination (E2 mechanism) to form cyclohexene (Product 2).

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**  
   Cyclohexene reacts with thionyl chloride and pyridine, likely via electrophilic addition, forming 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane (Product 3).

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)₃ → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (a strong reducing agent) reduces 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. While the exact mechanism is unclear, it is reasonable to assume that the reduction results in a cyclohexane derivative with distinct hydrogen environments.

### Analysis of Product 4:
The final product is a cyclohexane derivative with substituents that break symmetry, leading to multiple chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the reasoning and the options provided, the most plausible number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 is **8**.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Let me break down each step to understand what's happening.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone has a six-membered ring with one ketone group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane with a carbonyl group on one carbon.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. I think when a ketone reacts with bromine, it's probably an addition reaction. Wait, but wait—no, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Oh, right! I think this is a bromination via the enolate. Or wait, maybe it's some kind of addition. Or perhaps it's a diels-alder scenario? No, bromine addition to a ketone... Hmm. Oh wait, no. Maybe it's a radical bromination. No, wait, that's more for alkanes. Wait, actually, no—when ketones react with bromine in a certain condition, they undergo a reaction. Another thought: cyclohexanone can undergo a bromination via the enol intermediate. So, when treated with Br2, perhaps it forms a dienol bromide or adds across the carbonyl. Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone, so adding bromine might not just be addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination of the cyclohexane ring. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a benzene ring, so it's not aromatic. So, maybe the cyclohexane ring undergoes bromination via some mechanism—like maybe via a radical mechanism if it's light, but bromine (Br2) alone? Or perhaps it's a di- addition to the ketone. Wait, wait, another approach. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group; adding Br2 could be a dibromination on the carbonyl. Oh wait, but if you add bromine to a ketone, you might get a bromohydrin. But wait, I think the more common reaction is the addition of Br2 to ketones to form a bromohydrin, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromination via an enolate. When you have a ketone and treat it with a base, like maybe Br2 and a base, the enolate could form and attack Br2. But in this case, the first step is just cyclohexanone treated with Br2. So, perhaps it's adding Br across the carbonyl group. Let me think: the carbonyl is O=C-. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, but wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. So, adding Br2 would lead to a dibromide. No, wait, the carbonyl is C=O, so adding Br2 would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane derivative? Or perhaps it's a diastereomeric addition. So, the product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. But wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a bromine substituent. Wait, but where would it add?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another thought: the reaction of ketones with bromine water is a known reaction for testing ketones. They add across the carbonyl, forming a bromohydrin. So, product 1 would have a Br and OH added across the carbonyl. But wait, is it possible that the bromine adds to the carbonyl, leading to a geminal dihalide? No, because adding Br2 would be a vicinal addition (addition across the double bond). So, the carbonyl group (O=C-) would become CBr-OH or something? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromination of cyclohexane via a radical mechanism, but I don't think so because cyclohexanone is more reactive at the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about each reagent and what they do.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Another possibility: maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group. The carbonyl in cyclohexanone isn't a great leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-bromination via the enolate. Wait, maybe when cyclohexanone is treated with Br2, it's an example of the Favorskii reaction, which is when a ketone is brominated to form a diester. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromination on the ring, but I'm confused because cyclohexanone is a six-membered chair with a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps the bromine adds to the ring. But in that case, how?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think again. Maybe it's an addition reaction. The carbonyl group (C=O) in cyclohexanone could react with Br2. When alkenes react with Br2, it's an addition across the double bond. So, if the C=O is treated with Br2, perhaps a similar addition occurs. So, O=C- becomes O-CBr2-? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe the Br adds to the carbonyl carbon and the other Br to the oxygen? But that would form a bromide ester. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, actually, I think I'm mixing up reactions. Let me recall: When ketones react with HBr, they form bromoalkanes via nucleophilic addition. But Br2 is a dienophile, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a cycloaddition? No, that's usually with dienes and dienophiles like Br2, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a conjugated diene.

Hmm. I'm stuck on step 1. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the product after step 1 is a brominated cyclohexanol. Wait, but how? Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-bromo-cyclohexanone. But how would that form? Unless it's a substitution, but I don't see a good leaving group on the ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should think beyond the first step for a moment. Suppose product 1 is something that upon heating with NaOH (step 2) becomes product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine (step 3), leading to product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, to form product 4.

Wait, so let's think about each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Suppose product 1 is 1-bromo-cyclohexanone. But wait, where would the Br attach? Maybe on the ring carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. But how?

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone. But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a bromohydrin formation. So, cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane. So, the carbonyl is converted into a CH(OH)Br group. So, the product 1 would have a Br and an OH on the same carbon.

But then step 2 is heating with NaOH. Heating a diol (like a bromo alcohol) with NaOH would likely lead to elimination, forming an alkene. So, product 2 would be cyclohexene with a substituent? Let me see: the starting material is 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane. When heated with NaOH, it would undergo elimination, losing H2O and HBr, forming a double bond. So, the product would be cyclohexene with a substituent—wait, where?

Wait, the initial structure after step 1 is a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)Br group. Upon elimination, the H from the adjacent carbon and the OH would leave, forming a double bond. So, the product would be 1,2-cyclohexene with a substituent? Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C1 and C2, making cyclohexene. But I'm a bit confused about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is cyclohexene. But I need to visualize this.

Wait, another approach: in step 1, adding Br2 to cyclohexanone forms a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Then, in step 2, heating with NaOH would cause the dibromide to undergo elimination. For example, a vicinal dihalide (1,2-dibromocyclohexane) when treated with a base like NaOH would eliminate Br- and form a double bond, producing cyclohexene.

So, product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: product 2 (cyclohexene) is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, but for alkenes, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: cyclohexene with thionyl chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is more commonly used to convert alcohols to chlorides, but with alkenes, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, I think when alkenes are treated with SOCl2, it can lead to chlorination via an electrophilic addition. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrochlorination. But wait, SOCl2 and pyridine might be used to make chlorides. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is reacting in a way to form a chlorohydrin. Wait, but chlorohydrin formation usually involves SOCl2 and water, but in this case, pyridine is present. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a chlorohydrin formation. When an alkene reacts with SOCl2, it can form a chlorohydrin. So, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 3-chlorocyclohexanol? Or maybe 1-chlorocyclohexene-1-ol? Wait, not exactly, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding Cl across the double bond. So, cyclohexene would react with SOCl2 to form 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a chlorination to form a chlorocyclohexane.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about the steps again. Product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent. It's used for ketone reductions, but also for esters and other carbonyl groups. Wait, but if product 3 is something like an acyl chloride, then LiAlH would reduce it to an alcohol. Alternatively, if product 3 is an ester, the same applies.

Wait, let me try again. After step 3, product 3 is treated with this strong reducing agent. So, what reactions would involve that reagent? For example, if product 3 is an ester, the LiAlH would reduce it to a diol (if it's an ester) but wait, no, esters are reduced to alcohols. Alternatively, if product 3 is a ketone, it would be reduced to an alcohol.

But wait, let's try to outline each step again:

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Assuming product 1 is 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane (bromohydrin).

Step 2: Product 1 heated with NaOH → product 2.

Heating a bromohydrin with base leads to elimination, forming an alkene.

So, product 2 is cyclohexene with a substituent. Wait, no. Wait, the bromohydrin is 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane, which upon elimination (like E2) would lose H2O and HBr, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but in cyclohexane, the carbons are all connected in a ring. So, if the Br and OH are on C1, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohexene with a substituent?

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure: the starting cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the carbonyl group on C1. When Br2 is added, the bromohydrin would have Br and OH on C1. So, when heated with NaOH, elimination occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohexene. So, product 2 is cyclohexene.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, product 2 is cyclohexene.

Step 3: product 2 (cyclohexene) treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine → product 3.

Cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine. I'm not entirely sure about this reaction, but I'll try to recall. I think that alkenes can react with SOCl2 in an addition reaction. For example, propene reacting with SOCl2 would form an chloro compound. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is converted into a di-substituted chloro compound.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a hydrochlorination reaction. But under what conditions? SOCl2 is more of a chlorinating agent, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it adds across the double bond, making a dichloride. So, cyclohexene would add two Cl atoms across the double bond, forming 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a chlorohydrin formation. Chlorohydrins are formed when an alkene reacts with a chlorinated water or HCl in presence of H2O. But in this case, the reagent is SOCl2 and pyridine. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, another reaction: when alkenes react with SOCl2, it can form a chloroalkane. For example, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → cyclohexyl chloride. But I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexene reacts with SOCl2 to form 1-chlorocyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclopropane formation? No, that's with something else like carbonyl chloride and a base. Hmm, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-chlorination. So, the cyclohexene would add two Cl atoms across the double bond, giving 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. This is a strong reducing agent. Typically, it's used to reduce esters, amides, and other carbonyl-containing compounds. But if product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, how would this reagent affect it? I don't think LiAlH would reduce dichlorides; maybe it's something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3. Let me think again. If product 2 is cyclohexene, and in step 3 it reacts with SOCl2 and pyridine, perhaps it's a chloroalkane formation. For example, adding Cl across the double bond, making 1-chlorocyclohexane. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexene is converted into cyclohexyl chloride. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a ring-opening addition. When an epoxide is treated with SOCl2, it forms a chloro compound, but cyclohexene isn't an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible product after step 4, product 4, to see what it's like and then backtrack.

Product 4 is formed by treating product 3 with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. So, what does this reagent do? It's a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols, but it can also reduce ketones. Wait, but if product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, then this reagent wouldn't reduce it. So, maybe product 3 is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3. Let's think: if product 2 is cyclohexene, and step 3 is treatment with SOCl2 and pyridine, maybe it's a process to form a chlorinated cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is converted into a di-substituted chlorinated compound.

Wait, maybe the reaction is converting cyclohexene into 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. So, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: treating with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Hmm, but that's a strong hydride reducing agent. It can reduce esters, nitriles, amides, but I don't think it reduces alkanes. So, if product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, I don't see a reaction with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. So, maybe I'm wrong in my earlier steps.

Alternative approach: perhaps step 1 is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. So, product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: heating with NaOH. Vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromocyclohexane) upon treatment with NaOH would eliminate to form an alkene. So, product 2 is cyclohexene.

Step 3: cyclohexene treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. So, maybe the double bond reacts with SOCl2 to form a chlorinated cyclohexane. For example, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 1-chlorocyclohexane. But wait, I'm not sure about the mechanism here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a chlorohydrin formation, but without water, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-chlorination, leading to 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Step 4: treating 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Hmm, this seems confusing. Wait, LiAlH can sometimes reduce chlorides, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps.

Wait, maybe step 3 is converting the alkene into a ketone. How? If product 2 is cyclohexene, and then treated with a reagent that forms an epoxide, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diels-alder, but I don't see a dienophile here.

Wait, maybe step 3 is a hydrohalogenation of the alkene. So, cyclohexene + HCl → chlorocyclohexane. But how does SOCl2 fit into this?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition of HCl to the cyclohexene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of alternative possibilities. Let's consider that step 3 converts the alkene into a di-substituted chloride. So, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, product 4 is treated with a strong reducing agent. But I don't see how LiAlH(t-Bu)3 would act on that. Maybe I'm wrong about product 3.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is converting the alkene into an epoxide. But I don't think SOCl2 does that. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening epoxidation, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 2. Let me think again.

If product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, then heating with NaOH would eliminate to form cyclohexene.

So, product 2 is cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: treating cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine. Maybe this is an addition reaction, where Cl adds across the double bond. So, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: treating 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. But, again, this reagent is for reducing carbonyl groups, not for reducing chlorides. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is cyclohexyl chloride, and the LiAlH would reduce it. But I'm not sure if it reduces chlorides.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think about the overall process. The starting material is cyclohexanone. After four steps, the product is something that has a certain number of chemically distinct hydrogens.

Another approach: maybe the final product is cyclohexanol. Let me see how that would fit.

But how? Let me think:

Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1: maybe 1-bromo-cyclohexanone? Then, step 2: heating with NaOH could be a substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone reduction, but NaOH is a base, not a reducing agent.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is cyclohexyl bromide, and step 2 is elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each step's possible products:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1,2-dibromocyclohexane (product 1).

2. Product 1 heated with NaOH → elimination (E2) to form cyclohexene (product 2).

3. Cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine → 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane (product 3).

4. Product 3 treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → ?

But I don't see a reaction for step 4. So, perhaps I'm wrong about product 3.

Alternative possibility: step 3 is converting the alkene into a ketone. How? Maybe via ozonolysis, but that doesn't fit with SOCl2.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is cyclohexanone again? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe step 3 is a hydrohalogenation. So, cyclohexene adds HCl to form chlorocyclohexane. Then, product 3 is chlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. But I don't think LiAlH reduces chlorides to alkanes. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck because I don't correctly understand step 3. Let me think differently. Maybe step 3 is introducing a carbonyl group. For example, if product 2 is cyclohexene, and step 3 is a dihydroxylation, but that would require something like OsO4, not SOCl2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 2 is cyclohexene, and step 3 is epoxidation. But SOCl2 isn't used for that; it's more for chlorinations.

Wait, perhaps in step 3, the alkene is converted into a chlorinated epoxide? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine is an acid-catalyzed addition of Cl across the double bond, forming 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

So, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4 is treating this with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. But I'm not sure what reaction would occur here. Maybe the chloride is a leaving group, but under what conditions? Alternatively, perhaps the LiAlH is a strong enough reducing agent to break the C-Cl bond, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene. Then, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 could reduce the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 3 is cyclohexyl chloride. Then, LiAlH reduces it to cyclohexane, but I don't think LiAlH does that.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try to think of each step again, but maybe in a different order.

Another approach: The overall process.

Cyclohexanone → product 1 (bromination) → product 2 (elimination) → product 3 (chlorination) → product 4 (reduction).

What could product 4 be? It's after a strong reduction. So, perhaps something with an alcohol group or an amine.

Wait, let me think of the steps again.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1. Maybe this is a benzoin condensation or some addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination on the ring.

Wait, wait! Oh, wait a minute. Maybe the first step is not adding Br to the carbonyl but rather brominating the ring. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The ring is a cyclohexane with a ketone group. If we brominate the ring, where would the Br add? In the meta position relative to the ketone? But since it's a six-membered ring, adding Br in a certain position.

Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ketone, which is an electron-withdrawing group. So, the bromination would occur at the position para to the carbonyl. But wait, in a six-membered ring, the positions are meta and para?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in a six-membered ring with a substituent, bromination typically occurs at the most substituted position. But the carbonyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring. So, bromination would occur para to the carbonyl. So, product 1 would be 4-bromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a benzene ring, so electrophilic substitution (bromination) isn't possible. Oh! Right, cyclohexanone is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group, but the ring is not aromatic. So, it's not susceptible to electrophilic substitution like benzene. So, bromination under such conditions (like Br2) would not substitute on the ring, unless it's a radical mechanism, but that requires light and a different setup.

So, going back, the initial assumption that step 1 is an addition reaction to the carbonyl is more likely.

So, product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: elimination to form cyclohexene.

Step 3: cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine. I think I've read that alkenes can react with SOCl2 to form chloroalkanes, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's adding Cl across the double bond.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cyclohexene is treated with SOCl2 in a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but that doesn't fit because cyclohexene isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrochlorination. So, cyclohexene + HCl → chlorocyclohexane. But then, where is the Cl added? The most substituted position, so maybe the Cl is added to the less substituted carbon.

Wait, but SOCl2 is more commonly used to convert alcohols into chlorides. So, perhaps the steps are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in step 3 is a chlorohydrin formation, but without water, that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe I should accept that step 3 produces 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, and then step 4 reduces it.

But then, how does the reducing agent affect product 3? LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent. Maybe it can reduce the C-Cl bonds? I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is an ester, which would then be reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3. Let me think, product 2 is cyclohexene. Maybe step 3 is converting the double bond into a carbonyl group. How? Ozonolysis would do that, but the reagent is SOCl2 and pyridine. Alternatively, maybe it's a Prins reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is cyclohexanone again. But that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should think about the final product. Suppose product 4 is cyclohexanol. Then, how many distinct hydrogens would it have?

Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group. The chair conformation would have axial and equatorial positions. So, the OH would be either axial or equatorial, leading to different environments.

But the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. So, in cyclohexanol, the hydrogens adjacent to the OH are different from those opposite or next to substituents.

Wait, but cyclohexanol has multiple equivalent hydrogens. Let me think: the chair conformation of cyclohexanol would have the OH in the axial position (or equatorial). If it's axial, then the adjacent hydrogens are all equivalent in a certain way, but perhaps some are equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, but I might need to draw this.

Alternatively, maybe product 4 is a diol, which would have more distinct hydrogens.

Wait, another possibility: product 4 is benzyl alcohol or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is cyclohexane with multiple substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step more systematically.

Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Assuming that Br2 adds to the carbonyl, making a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. So, product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: product 1 (1,2-dibromocyclohexane) is heated with NaOH. Vicinal dihalide elimination: E2 mechanism, forming cyclohexene.

Product 2: cyclohexene.

Step 3: cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine. This is a typical condition for converting alcohols to chlorides, but cyclohexene is an alkene.

Wait, I think I found a reaction: the addition of SOCl2 to alkenes can form chlorinated alkanes. Specifically, it can add across the double bond, leading to a di-substituted chloro compound. So, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

So, product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Step 4: product 3 (1,2-dichlorocyclohexane) is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. What does this reagent do? I know that LiAlH typically reduces carbonyl groups, but it can also reduce some other functional groups. However, 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane is an alkane with two Cl substituents. I don't think LiAlH would react with this.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product 3. Maybe the reaction in step 3 is different.

Alternative approach: perhaps step 3 is a hydrohalogenation, adding HCl across the double bond of cyclohexene. So, product 3 would be 1-chlorocyclohexane.

But then, step 4: treating with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 3 is an epoxide. Then, product 4 would be the opening of the epoxide with LiAlH. But how?

Wait, but the reagents in step 3 don't suggest epoxidation. So, perhaps that's not the case.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Perhaps, the overall process is a dihydroxylation followed by some reaction.

Wait, another approach: maybe product 4 is cyclohexanol. So, how would that happen? Let's see:

1. Br2 adds to cyclohexanone to form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.
2. Heating with NaOH forms cyclohexene via elimination.
3. Treating cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine forms chlorinated cyclohexane.
4. Treating with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 reduces the Cl to something else. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is forming an acid chloride. But cyclohexene isn't a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe I'm missing the context. Let me think about the reagents again.

LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent, more selective than LiAlH4. It's used for the reduction of esters, ketones, and other carbonyl-containing compounds. It might not reduce alkanes, but perhaps if product 3 is an ester, then product 4 would be an alcohol.

Wait, but product 3 is derived from cyclohexene. How could it be an ester?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are as follows:

Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → forms a bromide on the ring? But I don't think so.

Perhaps I'm stuck and should think of the possible answer based on the number of distinct hydrogens.

Assuming product 4 is cyclohexanol. How many distinct H?

In cyclohexanol, the chair conformation has the OH in axial or equatorial position. The six-membered ring would have different environments:

- The OH-bearing carbon: has two adjacent hydrogens (if axial, they're in a certain environment).
- The adjacent carbons (two on either side of the OH) would have different H's.
- The opposite carbon would have a different set.

But wait, in cyclohexanol, the chair conformation leads to axial and equatorial hydrogens, but the substituents create different environments.

Wait, considering that, cyclohexanol has several distinct H's. Let's count:

- The carbon with the OH: two H's (but in a chair, they are both axial or equatorial? No, the OH is on one carbon, which has two H's in axial and equatorial positions, but for cyclohexanol, the substituent is axial. So, the neighboring carbons would have H's in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the symmetry of the molecule.

Wait, cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group. The molecule isn't symmetric because the OH breaks the symmetry. So, the hydrogens on the ring would be in different environments based on their proximity to the OH group.

In the chair conformation, the OH is axial. Then:

- The carbon adjacent to OH (C2 and C6) each have two axial H's (but in a different environment than the others) and two equatorial H's.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to count the distinct H environments:

1. The OH-bearing carbon (C1): has two H's (axial and equatorial? No, in cyclohexanol, the OH is axial, so the axial H's are pointing up, and the equatorial H's are down. Wait, no, in the chair, the OH is axial, and the H's on C1 are both axial? No, each C has two H's in a chair. Wait, no, each carbon in cyclohexane has two H's attached. If C1 has the OH group, the two H's on C1 are in the axial position. Wait, no, in a chair, each axial substituent is pointing up or down. So, in cyclohexanol, the OH is axial, pointing down. Then, the two H's on C1 would be axial (pointing up?), but wait, that can't be because the OH is substituting one of the positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this.

In the chair conformation, each carbon has two H's. If the OH is axial (pointing down), then the two H's on C1 are axial (pointing up) and equatorial (pointing down). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the substituent (OH) is axial, so the H's would be in the opposite axial direction.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Each carbon in the cyclohexane ring has two H's. In the chair conformation, one H is axial (pointing up) and the other equatorial (pointing down for that carbon). So, for C1, which has the OH, perhaps the axial H is pointing up, and the equatorial is pointing down. But since the OH is axial, maybe the axial H is pointing in a different direction.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the conformations. Let me think about the number of distinct H's in cyclohexanol.

In cyclohexanol, there are several types of H:

- The two H's on the carbon bearing the OH (C1). Are they equivalent? In the chair conformation, if the OH is axial, the two H's on C1 are both axial, pointing in opposite axial directions. Wait, no, each carbon in cyclohexane has two H's, one axial and one equatorial.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of unique H's. Let's consider the molecule:

- C1: OH group. The two H's on C1: one axial, one equatorial. Are they equivalent? No, because the OH is axial. So, the axial H (same as OH's direction) would be in a different environment than the equatorial H.

- C2 and C6: these are the adjacent carbons. Each has two H's. The axial H's on C2 and C6 are pointing away from the OH, while the equatorial H's are closer.

- C3 and C5: these are meta to the OH. Their axial H's are opposite to the OH, and equatorial H's are in between.

- C4: opposite the OH. Its axial H's are directly opposite to the OH.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps I should count the unique H environments.

In cyclohexanol, the OH is in a specific position, breaking the symmetry. So, the ring has the following unique H's:

1. The two H's on C1 (axial and equatorial, but are they equivalent? No, because the axial is near the OH).

2. The two H's on C2 (axial and equatorial).

3. The two H's on C3.

4. The two H's on C4.

5. The two H's on C5.

6. The two H's on C6.

But considering the chair conformation and the OH's position, some H's may be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps in cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the OH and C4. So, the H's on C2 and C6 are mirror images and thus equivalent. Similarly, H's on C3 and C5 are equivalent.

So, the distinct H's would be:

- C1: two distinct H's (axial and equatorial).

- C2: one type (since axial and equatorial are in symmetric positions).

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because the OH breaks the symmetry, the H's on C2 and C6 are not equivalent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in cyclohexanol, the number of distinct H's is 6. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 4 is a different structure altogether.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a diol. How?

If product 3 is a di-substituted epoxide, then product 4 would be a diol. But I don't see how that happens in the given steps.

Alternatively, maybe product 3 is a ketone, which is reduced to an alcohol in step 4.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.

If product 3 is a ketone, then LiAlH would reduce it to an alcohol.

But how would product 3 be a ketone?

Perhaps in step 3, the cyclohexene is converted into a ketone via some reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps step 3 is a dihydroxylation, forming a diol, but that doesn't fit with SOCl2.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a bromohydrin formation, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the possible answers. The options are 6, 8, 10, or 7.

If product 4 is cyclohexanol, which has 6 carbons, but how many distinct H's?

Alternatively, maybe product 4 is 1,2-diol cyclohexane. Then, the number of distinct H's would be higher.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the steps result in a bicyclic compound.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the possible product 4.

Wait, another possibility: the final product is 1,2-cyclohexanediol. How?

If product 3 is a di-substituted epoxide, which is then opened by LiAlH(t-Bu)3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a carbonyl compound. Let's say, product 3 is a ketone, which is reduced to an alcohol in step 4.

But how would product 3 be a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane (bromohydrin).

2. Heating with NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexene.

3. Cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine → forms something else.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is a chlorohydrin formation. So, cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 1-chlorocyclohexanol.

Then, product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexanol.

Step 4: treating with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → reduction. LiAlH can reduce the Cl to something else? Or perhaps the LiAlH is a strong enough base to eliminate.

Wait, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. If product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexanol, perhaps the Cl is replaced by a hydride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the LiAlH reduces the ketone to an alcohol, but product 3 isn't a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it this way:

If product 4 is a cyclohexane derivative with multiple substituents, the number of distinct H's depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is cyclohexane with a substituent that creates several unique H environments.

Wait, another approach: the final product is benzene, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a benzyl-type structure, but I don't see how.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the answer based on the options.

The options are 6, 8, 10, or 7.

If product 4 is cyclohexanol, the number of distinct H's would be 6? Or more.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, which has three sets of H's: axial, equatorial, and adjacent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm not making progress here. Maybe I'll have to make an educated guess.

Another approach: the initial steps convert cyclohexanone into cyclohexene, then into a di-substituted compound, and finally into something with multiple substituents.

Wait, perhaps the final product is 1,2-diol cyclohexane. So, product 4 would be 1,2-cyclohexanediol.

In that case, the ring has two adjacent OH groups. How many distinct H's?

In 1,2-cyclohexanediol, the chair conformation would have the two OH groups either axial or equatorial. The molecule would have several distinct H environments.

Counting the H's:

- C1 and C2 have OH groups.

- C3 and C6 are adjacent to both OH groups.

- C4 is opposite the diol.

Each position would have unique H's.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a bicyclic compound with bridgehead hydrogens, leading to more distinct H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to count.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a benzene ring, but that's unlikely.

Another thought: maybe after all steps, product 4 is benzaldehyde, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 8. Because in some cyclohexane derivatives, there are 8 distinct H's.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, which has 8 distinct H's. Hmm, but earlier steps don't seem to lead to that.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a di-substituted cyclohexane with multiple substituents, leading to 8 distinct H's.

But I'm not confident.

Given that I've thought through all possible steps and reactions but can't pinpoint the exact structure, I'll have to make an educated guess. The most plausible scenario is that product 4 has 8 distinct H's, so the answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 after a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, likely via addition across the carbonyl group, forming 1,2-dibromocyclohexane (Product 1).

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heating) → Product 2**  
   The vicinal dihalide (1,2-dibromocyclohexane) undergoes elimination (E2 mechanism) to form cyclohexene (Product 2).

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**  
   Cyclohexene reacts with thionyl chloride and pyridine, likely via electrophilic addition, forming 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane (Product 3).

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)₃ → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (a strong reducing agent) reduces 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. While the exact mechanism is unclear, it is reasonable to assume that the reduction results in a cyclohexane derivative with distinct hydrogen environments.

### Analysis of Product 4:
The final product is a cyclohexane derivative with substituents that break symmetry, leading to multiple chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the reasoning and the options provided, the most plausible number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 is **8**.

Answer: B
