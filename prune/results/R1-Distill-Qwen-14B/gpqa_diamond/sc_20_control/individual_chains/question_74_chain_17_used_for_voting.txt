Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay and probabilities. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, but it follows certain statistical rules. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, that's the decay probability given. Now, they're saying that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. They're asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait a second. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? So the decay probability isn't a simple addition. I think the key here is that the decay process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decaying in the next time interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay.

So initially, the probability of decaying within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. I remember that the decay probability can be modeled using the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time.

But wait, we're told the 32% is for 100 minutes. So I can find λ using that information. Let's set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Rearranging that, e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Calculating ln(0.68), I think ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so ln(0.68) would be a bit more negative. Let me think, maybe around -0.3857? So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. But wait, 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Since the process is memoryless, the remaining time doesn't reset. That is, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period, regardless of previous time.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because the decay process is memoryless, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the future probabilities. So the remaining time to consider is 150 minutes, but starting now. So the total time from the current point is 150 minutes.

So the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Let me compute that.

Using the λ I found earlier, 0.003857 per minute. So 0.003857 * 150 = 0.57855. So e^-0.57855 is approximately what? Let me think, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's do a linear approximation maybe. But perhaps I should remember that ln(0.56) is about -0.5798. Wait, e^-0.57855 is approximately 1 / e^0.57855. Let me compute e^0.57855.

Wait, e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.57855 is higher. Maybe around 1.78? Because e^0.6 is about 1.8221. So 0.57855 is 0.6 - 0.02145. So e^0.57855 ≈ e^0.6 * e^-0.02145 ≈ 1.8221 * (1 - 0.02145) ≈ 1.8221 * 0.97855 ≈ approximately 1.781. So 1 / 1.781 ≈ 0.561. So e^-0.57855 ≈ 0.561.

So P(150) = 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, or 43.9%. Looking at the options, the closest is option D:48%, but wait, that's higher. Hmm, maybe my approximation was off.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me find a better way to calculate e^(-0.57855).

Another approach: let's compute 100 minutes gives P=32%, so the decay constant λ is such that 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32, so e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → 100λ = -ln(0.68) → λ = [ -ln(0.68) ] / 100.

Calculating ln(0.68):

I remember that ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, and ln(0.68) is about -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, for 150 minutes, t=150.

So λt = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So e^-0.57849 is approximately:

We can use the Taylor series approximation for e^x around x=0. But since 0.578 is a bit far, maybe a better approach is to use known values.

We know that:

ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, so e^-0.6931 ≈ 0.5.

But 0.57849 is less than ln(2), so e^-0.57849 is higher than 0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator-like approach:

e^0.57849 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.07849.

e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

e^0.07849: 0.07849 is approximately 0.08, so e^0.08 ≈ 1.0833. So 1.64872 * 1.0833 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0833 ≈ let's compute: 1.6487 * 1 = 1.6487, 1.6487 * 0.0833 ≈ approximately 0.1374. So total is about 1.6487 + 0.1374 ≈ 1.7861.

Wait, that gives e^0.57849 ≈ 1.7861. So 1/1.7861 ≈ 0.56.

So 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%. So the probability is approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but the answer options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

Hmm, that would point to option A. But wait, I thought the decay is memoryless, so the probability for any time period is independent of previous time. So if the probability in 100 minutes is 32%, what is it for 150 minutes? But in this case, the 150 minutes includes the initial 50 minutes. Wait, no, that's not the case. Because the 50 minutes have already passed without decay, so the remaining time is 150 minutes from now.

Wait, but the process is memoryless. So the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it hasn't decayed in the past 50 minutes and then decays in the next 150? Or is it the same as the probability that it decays in any consecutive 150-minute period, regardless of prior time.

Wait, no, the probability is the chance that it decays during the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. But since it's memoryless, the probability is the same as if we started a fresh 150-minute period. So the probability is simply P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Wait, but in the question, the 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the atom's age is now 50 minutes, and we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which would be the same as the probability of decaying in a 150-minute interval starting now.

So the calculation we did earlier, which gives approximately 44%, would be correct, leading to option A.

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total time as 200 minutes (50 + 150), but that's not correct because it's the next 150 minutes, not the total.

Wait, no, no, because the 50 minutes have already passed, and we're monitoring from that point. So the next 150 minutes is the time frame to consider.

Wait another thought—when you have a decay probability over a certain time, the way to model it isn't by addition but by considering the decay constant. So the correct approach is to find the decay constant based on the 100-minute probability, then compute the probability for 150 minutes.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to model it as the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. So the survival probability in 100 minutes is 68% (1-0.32).

In the case where 50 minutes have passed, the survival probability up to 50 minutes is (0.68)^(50/100) = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Because the decay probability is based on the half-life model, but wait, actually, the decay formula is P_survive(t) = e^(-λ t). So for t=100, P_survive is 0.68. So for t=50, P_survive(50) = e^(-λ *50) = (e^(-λ 100))^(0.5) )= 0.68^0.5 ≈ sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. So the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is 82.46%.

Now, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. So the probability is P(50 to 200) = P_survive(50) * [1 - P_survive(200)].

Wait, because P_survive(200) is the probability that it survives 200 minutes. So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50, multiplied by (1 - probability it hasn't decayed by 200).

So let me compute that.

First, compute P_survive(200) = e^(-λ *200). Since P_survive(100) = e^(-λ *100) = 0.68 → λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ * 200 = 0.0038566 * 200 ≈ 0.77132.

e^-0.77132 ≈ 0.462. So P_survive(200) ≈ 0.462.

So the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is P_survive(50) * (1 - P_survive(200)).

P_survive(50) is 0.8246, so 0.8246 * (1 - 0.462) = 0.8246 * 0.538 ≈ 0.444, so 44.4%.

So that's around 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, that would be P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈ 0.44 as before.

Hmm, so that aligns with the previous calculation.

But wait, in the question, the initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance. So 100 minutes: 32% decay. So using the decay constant λ, the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. Then, for 150 minutes, the probability is 44%.

So the correct answer should be A)44%.

Wait, but the options are given, and option A is 44%, which matches our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because when the time is longer, the decay probability should be higher than 32% for 150 minutes if 100 minutes is 32%. But 150 minutes is longer than 100, so the decay probability should be higher than 32%.

Wait, hold on. Because the 32% is for 100 minutes. For 150 minutes, the probability would be higher, right? Because the decay probability is cumulative. But according to our calculation, it's 44%, which is higher than 32%. That makes sense.

So the answer is 44%, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, which states that the probability of an atom decaying in a given time period is memoryless and follows the formula:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( t \) is the time.

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using the formula:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the current time, not the past.

The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57855
\]

\[
e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%, which corresponds to option **A**.

### Final Answer
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is **44%**.

Using the λ I found earlier, 0.003857 per minute. So 0.003857 * 150 = 0.57855. So e^-0.57855 is approximately what? Let me think, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's do a linear approximation maybe. But perhaps I should remember that ln(0.56) is about -0.5798. Wait, e^-0.57855 is approximately 1 / e^0.57855. Let me compute e^0.57855.

Wait, e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.57855 is higher. Maybe around 1.78? Because e^0.6 is about 1.8221. So 0.57855 is 0.6 - 0.02145. So e^0.57855 ≈ e^0.6 * e^-0.02145 ≈ 1.8221 * (1 - 0.02145) ≈ 1.8221 * 0.97855 ≈ approximately 1.781. So 1 / 1.781 ≈ 0.561. So e^-0.57855 ≈ 0.561.

So P(150) = 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, or 43.9%. Looking at the options, the closest is option D:48%, but wait, that's higher. Hmm, maybe my approximation was off.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me find a better way to calculate e^(-0.57855).

Calculating ln(0.68):

Now, for 150 minutes, t=150.

So λt = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So e^-0.57849 is approximately:

We can use the Taylor series approximation for e^x around x=0. But since 0.578 is a bit far, maybe a better approach is to use known values.

We know that:

ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, so e^-0.6931 ≈ 0.5.

But 0.57849 is less than ln(2), so e^-0.57849 is higher than 0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator-like approach:

e^0.57849 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.07849.

e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

e^0.07849: 0.07849 is approximately 0.08, so e^0.08 ≈ 1.0833. So 1.64872 * 1.0833 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0833 ≈ let's compute: 1.6487 * 1 = 1.6487, 1.6487 * 0.0833 ≈ approximately 0.1374. So total is about 1.6487 + 0.1374 ≈ 1.7861.

Wait, that gives e^0.57849 ≈ 1.7861. So 1/1.7861 ≈ 0.56.

So 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%. So the probability is approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but the answer options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

Hmm, that would point to option A. But wait, I thought the decay is memoryless, so the probability for any time period is independent of previous time.

So the calculation we did earlier, which gives approximately 44%, would be correct, leading to option A.

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total time as 200 minutes (50 + 150), but that's not correct because it's the next 150 minutes, not the total.

Now, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. So the probability is P(50 to 200) = P_survive(50) * [1 - P_survive(200)].

Wait, because P_survive(200) is the probability that it survives 200 minutes. So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50, multiplied by (1 - probability it hasn't decayed by 200).

So let me compute that.

First, compute P_survive(200) = e^(-λ *200). Since P_survive(100) = e^(-λ *100) = 0.68 → λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ * 200 = 0.0038566 * 200 ≈ 0.77132.

e^-0.77132 ≈ 0.462. So P_survive(200) ≈ 0.462.

So the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is P_survive(50) * (1 - P_survive(200)).

P_survive(50) is 0.8246, so 0.8246 * (1 - 0.462) = 0.8246 * 0.538 ≈ 0.444, so 44.4%.

So that's around 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, that would be P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈ 0.44 as before.

Hmm, so that aligns with the previous calculation.

But wait, in the question, the initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance. So 100 minutes: 32% decay. So using the decay constant λ, the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. Then, for 150 minutes, the probability is 44%.

So the correct answer should be A)44%.

Wait, but the options are given, and option A is 44%, which matches our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because when the time is longer, the decay probability should be higher than 32% for 150 minutes if 100 minutes is 32%. But 150 minutes is longer than 100, so the decay probability should be higher than 32%.

Wait, hold on. Because the 32% is for 100 minutes. For 150 minutes, the probability would be higher, right? Because the decay probability is cumulative. But according to our calculation, it's 44%, which is higher than 32%. That makes sense.

So the answer is 44%, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, which states that the probability of an atom decaying in a given time period is memoryless and follows the formula:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( t \) is the time.

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using the formula:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the current time, not the past.

The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57855
\]

\[
e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%, which corresponds to option **A**.

### Final Answer
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is **44%**.

Answer: A
