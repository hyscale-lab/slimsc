Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, it's about particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds in a detector. The detector is spherical with a radius of 30 meters. Oh right, the setup is that when particles collide, they produce new particles that decay quickly. 

The question says that on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. But they want to find the Lorentz factor needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls. Oh wait, so the original setup has a Lorentz factor of about 20, and one third reach. Now we need to find a different gamma (Lorentz factor) where two-thirds reach. 

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So higher gamma means higher velocity. But how does that relate to the particles reaching the detector walls? I think it has to do with time dilation and the lifetime of the particles.

Right, the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, so their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in their rest frame). The distance they can travel before decaying is velocity times their lifetime, which depends on gamma. 

So, the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. The distance they travel is v * gamma tau. But wait, the particles are produced at the center of the detector, right? So the maximum distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. 

So for a particle to reach the wall, the distance it travels must be equal to the radius, which is 30 meters. So v * gamma tau = 30 m. 

But wait, the initial condition says that with gamma = 20, one third reach the wall. So let me think: when a particle's lifetime is such that it can travel up to 30 meters in the lab frame, only a fraction f of them reach the wall. I think this is because the decay is exponential. 

Wait, no, maybe it's about the decay probability. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma tau. So the probability that it hasn't decayed when it reaches time t, where t is the time it takes to reach the wall. 

The time t is distance divided by velocity. But wait, the particles are moving at velocity v, so the time to reach the wall is R/(v). But R is 30 m. So t = R/(v). 

But wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed before time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). Substituting t = R/(v), which is (30 m) / v. 

But wait, v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles. Because gamma is about 20, which is high but not extremely high. Let's see, gamma is 20. So v ≈ c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

Wait, for gamma ≈ 20, 1/(gamma^2) is about 1/400, which is 0.0025. So sqrt(1 - 0.0025) is approximately 0.99975, so v is 0.99975 c. So for practical purposes, v is almost c. 

Therefore, t ≈ R/(c). So the time is 30 meters / speed of light. Let's calculate that. The speed of light is about 3e8 meters per second. So t ≈ 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. 

But then tau is the proper lifetime. Gamma is 20, so tau_lab = 20 tau. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed is exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = exp(- (30/(v)) / (gamma tau) ) 

Wait, let's think again. The proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = R / v. 

The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)), because the decay follows an exponential distribution with mean lifetime gamma tau in the lab frame. 

Wait, but wait. The decay probability is such that the probability of decay before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability of not decaying (i.e., reaching the wall) is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

But wait, the problem says that with gamma ~20, one third of the particles reach the wall. So P = 1/3. 

So setting up the equation: 

1/3 = exp(- t/(gamma tau)) 

But t is R/(v), and since v ≈ c, t ≈ R/(c) = 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.

So substituting, 1/3 = exp( - (30/(v))/(gamma tau) )

But wait, since v is approximately c, we can write:

1/3 = exp( - (30/(c)) / (gamma tau) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (30)/(c gamma tau) 

So:

- ln(3) = - 30/(c gamma tau) 

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = 30/(c gamma tau)

Which rearranges to:

gamma tau = 30/(c ln(3))

But we can write gamma tau as gamma * tau. Let me see if I can find another equation. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate gamma1 and gamma2 for two different scenarios.

Wait, the initial condition is gamma1 =20, and P1=1/3. We need to find gamma2 where P2=2/3.

So for the initial case:

P1 = 1/3 = exp( - (30/(v1)) / (gamma1 tau) )

For the desired case:

P2 = 2/3 = exp( - (30/(v2)) / (gamma2 tau) )

Assuming that in both cases, the velocity is approximately c, which is a valid approximation for gamma around 20. Because for gamma=20, v is approximately 0.99975c, which is very close to c. So v ≈ c for both cases.

Therefore, the equations simplify to:

1/3 = exp( - (30/(c)) / (gamma1 tau) )

And 

2/3 = exp( - (30/(c)) / (gamma2 tau) )

Let me take the natural logs:

ln(1/3) = - (30/(c gamma1 tau) )

ln(2/3) = - (30/(c gamma2 tau) )

Let me compute the two equations. Let me denote (30/(c tau)) as a constant, say K.

So equation 1: ln(1/3) = - K gamma1^{-1}

Equation 2: ln(2/3) = - K gamma2^{-1}

Wait, because the equations are:

ln(1/3) = - (30/(c tau)) * (1/gamma1) )

Similarly for equation 2: ln(2/3) = - (30/(c tau)) * (1/gamma2) )

Let me write equation 1 as:

ln(3^{-1}) = - K / gamma1

=> - ln(3) = - K / gamma1

=> ln(3) = K / gamma1 

Similarly, equation 2:

ln(2/3) = - K / gamma2 

Which can be written as:

ln(2) - ln(3) = - K / gamma2 

But from equation 1, K = gamma1 * ln(3) 

So substituting into equation 2:

ln(2) - ln(3) = - (gamma1 ln(3)) / gamma2 

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) - ln(2) = (gamma1 ln(3)) / gamma2 

Wait, ln(3) - ln(2) is ln(3/2) = 0.4055 approximately. 

So:

ln(3/2) = (gamma1 ln(3)) / gamma2 

Solving for gamma2:

gamma2 = (gamma1 ln(3)) / ln(3/2) 

Let me compute this.

Gamma1 is 20.

So:

gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

So 20 * (1.0986)/(0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16 

Hmm, the options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

So the calculated gamma is approximately 54.16, which is close to option A)54.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the reasoning. Did I set up the equations correctly?

Another way: because the velocities are high, v ≈ c. So the time to reach the wall is the same in both cases. So the only variable is gamma, the Lorentz factor.

The probability of surviving is exp( - t/(gamma tau) )

So for the first case, gamma1=20, P1=1/3.

So:

1/3 = exp( - t/(gamma1 tau) )

Take ln, get:

ln(1/3) = - t/(gamma1 tau)

=> t = - gamma1 tau ln(1/3) = gamma1 tau ln(3)

Similarly, for the second case:

2/3 = exp( - t/(gamma2 tau) )

Take ln:

ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma2 tau)

=> t = - gamma2 tau ln(2/3) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2)

Wait, but t is the same for both cases because the radius and velocity (≈c) are the same. So:

gamma1 tau ln(3) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2)

Tau cancels out.

gamma1 ln(3) = gamma2 ln(3/2)

So gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3)/ln(3/2)

Which brings us back to the same equation as before.

So plugging in gamma1=20, same as before.

So gamma2 ≈ 20 * (1.0986)/(0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

So the answer should be option A, 54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the probability of particles reaching the walls, and the exponential decay process.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decay Probability**:  
   The probability that a particle has not decayed by the time it reaches the detector wall is given by:  
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right)
   \]  
   where \(t\) is the time taken to reach the wall, \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, and \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

2. **Time to Reach the Wall**:  
   Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (\(v \approx c\)), the time to reach the wall is:  
   \[
   t = \frac{R}{v} \approx \frac{R}{c}
   \]  
   Substituting \(R = 30 \, \text{m}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we find:  
   \[
   t \approx 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
   \]

3. **Initial Condition**:  
   For \(\gamma_1 = 20\), one-third of the particles reach the wall, so:  
   \[
   P_1 = \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}\right).
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(\ln(1/3) = -\ln(3)\), we get:  
   \[
   \ln(3) = \frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}.
   \]

4. **Desired Condition**:  
   For \(\gamma_2\), two-thirds of the particles reach the wall, so:  
   \[
   P_2 = \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}\right).
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(\ln(2/3) = \ln(2) - \ln(3)\), we get:  
   \[
   \ln(2) - \ln(3) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}.
   \]

5. **Relating \(\gamma_1\) and \(\gamma_2\)**:  
   From the two equations, we equate \(t/\tau\) for consistency:  
   \[
   \gamma_1 \ln(3) = \gamma_2 \ln(3/2).
   \]  
   Solving for \(\gamma_2\):  
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(3/2)}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(\gamma_1 = 20\), \(\ln(3) \approx 1.0986\), and \(\ln(3/2) \approx 0.4055\):  
   \[
   \gamma_2 \approx 20 \times \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \times 2.708 \approx 54.16.
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately 54. Among the given options, the closest value is **54**.
