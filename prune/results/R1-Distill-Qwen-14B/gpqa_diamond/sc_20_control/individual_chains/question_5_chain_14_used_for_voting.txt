Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, right? And I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. Hmm, okay, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement of that observable is made.

The operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So that means n has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. But wait, the problem says n is arbitrary, so I might need to express the operator in terms of nx and nz.

Wait, the problem gives me the components of the operator P in the X, Y, and Z directions. So P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I think the operator P along an arbitrary direction n can be written as a combination of these components. So P = nx P_x + nz P_z, since the Y-component is zero.

So first, I need to construct the matrix form of the operator P along direction n. Let's write down each component:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Since P = nx P_x + nz P_z, substituting the matrices:

nx P_x would be nx * ħ/2 multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]], same for nz P_z. So the total P is:

P = nx*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + nz*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this. Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Wait, let me check that. The nx P_x part adds to the diagonal elements? Actually, P_x contributes to the off-diagonal elements, and P_z contributes to the diagonal. So:

Diagonal elements are (nz)*(ħ/2) in the first row, first column, and (-nz)*(ħ/2) in the second row, second column. The off-diagonal elements are nx*(ħ/2) each.

So the matrix form of P is:

[ [ (nz ħ/2), (nx ħ/2) ],
  [ (nx ħ/2), (-nz ħ/2) ] ]

So, P is a 2x2 matrix with those elements.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Let me denote the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b]. Then, applying P to it should give (ħ/2) times [a; b].

So the equation is:

(nz ħ/2) a + (nx ħ/2) b = (ħ/2) a
(nx ħ/2) a + (-nz ħ/2) b = (ħ/2) b

I can divide both sides by ħ/2 since it's non-zero. So the equations become:

nz a + nx b = a
nx a - nz b = b

Simplify each equation.

First equation: nz a + nx b = a → (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0.

Second equation: nx a - nz b = b → nx a - (nz + 1) b = 0.

So now I have a system of equations:

( nz - 1 ) a + nx b = 0   --> (1)
nx a - (nz +1 ) b = 0    --> (2)

I need to solve this for a and b. Since it's an eigenvector, the equations shouldn't be contradictory, so the determinant should be zero. But maybe I can express one variable in terms of another.

From equation (1):

( nz - 1 ) a = - nx b → a = [ - nx / (nz -1 ) ] b.

Let me substitute this into equation (2):

nx [ (-nx/(nz-1)) b ] - (nz +1 ) b = 0.

Factor out b:

[ (-nx²/(nz-1)) - (nz +1) ] b = 0.

Since b can't be zero (else the vector would be trivial), the term in brackets must be zero.

So:

- nx²/(nz-1) - (nz + 1) = 0 → 

Multiply both sides by (nz -1):

- nx² - (nz +1)(nz -1) = 0

Wait, (nz +1)(nz -1) = nz^2 -1.

So:

- nx² - (nz² -1) = 0 → 

- nx² - nz² +1 = 0 → 

nx² + nz² = 1.

Ah, because n is a direction vector, and since it's in the x-z plane, its components satisfy nx² + nz² = 1.

So that makes sense. So the equations are consistent, and we can proceed.

So going back to a = [ -nx/(nz-1) ] b.

Now, I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me pick a parameter θ since the direction n is in the x-z plane. Let me assume that n can be written in terms of spherical coordinates, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero, but I think the direction can be expressed in terms of θ from the z-axis.

Wait, the direction vector n in the x-z plane can be represented as ( sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ ), but since φ=0 because it's in x-z plane, perhaps. Wait, maybe it's better to express it as ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, wait, actually, the standard spherical coordinates have θ as the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ as the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, but in any case, for an arbitrary direction in x-z, it's better to think of n as ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait no, because in the x-z plane, the direction can have any angle from the x or z axes. Alternatively, it's better to parameterize n in terms of θ, where θ is the angle between n and the z-axis. So, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then n can be written as ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), since θ=0 would be along z, and θ=π/2 would be along x.

So, in terms of this parameterization:

nx = sinθ

nz = cosθ

So, substituting into a and b:

a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b → [ - sinθ / ( cosθ -1 ) ] b.

Simplify the denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) → So denominator is - (1 - cosθ).

So:

a = [ - sinθ / ( - (1 - cosθ) ) ] b → [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Hmm, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

sinθ / (1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2)

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the ratio a/b = cot(θ/2).

Therefore, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

We can write the eigenvector as (a, b) = ( cot(θ/2) * b, b ).

To normalize the eigenvector, we need to compute the norm squared: |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Since eigenvectors can be complex, but in this case, the operator is Hermitian (since it's a component of angular momentum, which is Hermitian), so the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the operator P is actually the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, right? Because the given P_x, P_y, P_z are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices are (for X, Y, Z):

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yes, P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, etc.

So the operator P is (n · σ ) (ħ/2), because P is nx P_x + nz P_z, which is (nx σ_x + nz σ_z) (ħ/2).

Wait, I think σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices, so n · σ is the vector of Pauli matrices dotted with n.

So the operator is (n · σ) (ħ/2), which is a spin-1/2 operator.

In any case, the eigenvectors for spin-1/2 in direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states, which have the form:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]

|-> = [ -i sin(θ/2), e^{iφ} cos(θ/2) ]

But since the problem is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so the eigenvectors become real, right? Because e^{i 0} = 1.

Wait, in the x-z plane, the direction n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so φ=0. Therefore, the spin-up state would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, that's for the eigenstate in the direction of n. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, in the problem statement, the operator is P = (n · σ) (ħ/2). So the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down along n.

The spin-up state along n has eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvector should be:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

But wait, I thought it might have e^{iφ} in there, but since φ is zero in this case, it simplifies.

But wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again. The spin-up state in direction n is ( cosθ/2, sinθ/2 e^{iφ} ), but when n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so it's ( cosθ/2, sinθ/2 ), but wait, maybe I should adjust θ here.

Wait, perhaps the angle is defined as the angle from the z-axis, so the state would be ( sinθ/2, cosθ/2 ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the spin-up state for direction n is ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ), where θ is the polar angle.

Wait, in the standard spin-1/2 notation, when you have a state along the z-direction, the eigenstates are (1, 0) for spin-up and (0,1) for spin-down. If you rotate this state into a new direction n, which makes an angle θ from the z-axis, the eigenstates become:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]

|-> = [ -e^{iφ} sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ]

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so the state is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but if θ is measured from the z-axis, then for a direction in the x-z plane, the spin-up state would be along that direction. So the components would be cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but perhaps I should think about this a bit more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of theta and phi, but in this case, phi is zero since it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector components. So the normalized eigenvector would be a column vector [a; b], where a and b are complex numbers, but in this case, since we are in the x-z plane, maybe they are real.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

We found earlier that a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) * b.

But since the eigenvector can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, we can set b=1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2).

But wait, the eigenvector is [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Wait, but that would make the vector [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Wait, but let's compute the normalization. The norm squared is a^2 + b^2.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cot^2(theta/2) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2) → which is 1/sin^2(theta/2).

So to normalize, the vector should be multiplied by sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ sin(theta/2) * cot(theta/2), sin(theta/2) * 1 ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Because cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so when multiplied by sin(theta/2), it becomes cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that makes sense. So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2/2 )).

Wait, no, option D says (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C. But the problem says the operator is along n, which is in the x-z plane. So the answer would be either C or D.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, in the problem, the operator is (n · P) where P is the vector of Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states. So for spin-up, the state is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in the problem, each component of P is given as ħ/2 multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So the operator P is (n · σ) (ħ/2), where n is the direction vector.

So the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2), and the eigenvectors are as I described.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is exactly that: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is a spherical harmonic form but for a different parametrization. Option C's choice is more in line with the spin-1/2 state.

Wait, but the problem asks for "the normalized eigenvector", so the components should be normalized. Our calculation shows that [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is normalized, since cos^2 + sin^2 = 1.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option C is written as (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)).

Yes. So that's what we have.

Wait, but looking at the problem again, the eigenvector is for eigenvalue +ħ/2, so it's the spin-up state.

But why is option D an option? Let me look at option D: [√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ]

Hmmm. So why would there be a factor of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) there? That would imply a specific direction for n, perhaps. Because if the direction is along, say, the x-z plane at some angle, maybe theta is such that the coefficients are these sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3).

Wait, but the problem says the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So our solution must be in terms of theta, not specific numerical coefficients. So option C is the only one that fits.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the operator P is given as a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z, but the direction n is lying in the x-z plane. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and the eigenvector is in terms of theta, which is the polar angle from the z-axis. So the components are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So that's option C.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane. So the eigenvector is not specific to any particular direction, but is expressed in terms of theta. So the answer must be option C.

But looking back at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems to be a general spherical harmonic form, but for a different parametrization (maybe for higher spins), but in this case, for spin-1/2, it's option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the eigenvectors are not unique, they can be multiplied by a phase factor. So perhaps other options could also represent the same state.

But looking at the options, option C is the only one that matches the form we derived.

Wait, but why is option D present? Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the problem involves a specific direction for n. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, another approach: let me express P in terms of theta, since n is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

So the operator P is (ħ/2) [ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ], [sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ]

Wait, wait, earlier I had P as:

P = (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Which, with nz = cos(theta) and nx = sin(theta), gives:

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ], [ sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ]

So the matrix is:

[ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ], [ sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ cos(theta) (ħ/2), sin(theta) (ħ/2) ],
  [ sin(theta) (ħ/2), -cos(theta) (ħ/2) ] ] . [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

[ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ],
  [ sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ] . [a; b] = [a; b]

So the equations are:

cos(theta) a + sin(theta) b = a → (cos(theta) -1) a + sin(theta) b =0

sin(theta) a - cos(theta) b = b → sin(theta) a - (cos(theta) +1) b = 0

So from the first equation:

( cos(theta) -1 ) a + sin(theta) b =0 → a = [ sin(theta) / (1 - cos(theta) ) ] b.

As before, this simplifies to a = cot(theta/2) b.

So again, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But wait, I want to normalize this, so [a, b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So this brings us back to the same conclusion. So the normalized eigenvector is option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Other options: option B has cos(theta) and sin(theta), which I think is incorrect. Option D has some factors with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't seem to fit unless theta is a specific angle.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as a combination of its components:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
P = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting $P$ into the eigenvalue equation and simplifying, we find the system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \, b = 0$,  
2. $\sin\theta \, a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0$.

From the first equation, we solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation confirms the consistency of the system. The eigenvector is therefore proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sin\theta / \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor. The normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the form of option C. The other options are inconsistent with the derived eigenvector:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not match the derived form.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it corresponds to a different parametrization (likely for higher spins or spherical harmonics).  
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces specific coefficients $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the general solution.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, right? And I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. Hmm, okay, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement of that observable is made.

The operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So that means n has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. But wait, the problem says n is arbitrary, so I might need to express the operator in terms of nx and nz.

Wait, the problem gives me the components of the operator P in the X, Y, and Z directions. So P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I think the operator P along an arbitrary direction n can be written as a combination of these components. So P = nx P_x + nz P_z, since the Y-component is zero.

So first, I need to construct the matrix form of the operator P along direction n. Let's write down each component:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Since P = nx P_x + nz P_z, substituting the matrices:

nx P_x would be nx * ħ/2 multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]], same for nz P_z. So the total P is:

P = nx*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + nz*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this. Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Wait, let me check that. The nx P_x part adds to the diagonal elements? Actually, P_x contributes to the off-diagonal elements, and P_z contributes to the diagonal. So:

Diagonal elements are (nz)*(ħ/2) in the first row, first column, and (-nz)*(ħ/2) in the second row, second column. The off-diagonal elements are nx*(ħ/2) each.

So the matrix form of P is:

[ [ (nz ħ/2), (nx ħ/2) ],
  [ (nx ħ/2), (-nz ħ/2) ] ]

So, P is a 2x2 matrix with those elements.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Let me denote the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b]. Then, applying P to it should give (ħ/2) times [a; b].

So the equation is:

(nz ħ/2) a + (nx ħ/2) b = (ħ/2) a
(nx ħ/2) a + (-nz ħ/2) b = (ħ/2) b

I can divide both sides by ħ/2 since it's non-zero. So the equations become:

nz a + nx b = a
nx a - nz b = b

Simplify each equation.

First equation: nz a + nx b = a → (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0.

Second equation: nx a - nz b = b → nx a - (nz + 1) b = 0.

So now I have a system of equations:

( nz - 1 ) a + nx b = 0   --> (1)
nx a - (nz +1 ) b = 0    --> (2)

I need to solve this for a and b. Since it's an eigenvector, the equations shouldn't be contradictory, so the determinant should be zero. But maybe I can express one variable in terms of another.

From equation (1):

( nz - 1 ) a = - nx b → a = [ - nx / (nz -1 ) ] b.

Let me substitute this into equation (2):

nx [ (-nx/(nz-1)) b ] - (nz +1 ) b = 0.

Factor out b:

[ (-nx²/(nz-1)) - (nz +1) ] b = 0.

Since b can't be zero (else the vector would be trivial), the term in brackets must be zero.

So:

- nx²/(nz-1) - (nz + 1) = 0 → 

Multiply both sides by (nz -1):

- nx² - (nz +1)(nz -1) = 0

Wait, (nz +1)(nz -1) = nz^2 -1.

So:

- nx² - (nz² -1) = 0 → 

- nx² - nz² +1 = 0 → 

nx² + nz² = 1.

Ah, because n is a direction vector, and since it's in the x-z plane, its components satisfy nx² + nz² = 1.

So that makes sense. So the equations are consistent, and we can proceed.

So going back to a = [ -nx/(nz-1) ] b.

Now, I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me pick a parameter θ since the direction n is in the x-z plane. Let me assume that n can be written in terms of spherical coordinates, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero, but I think the direction can be expressed in terms of θ from the z-axis.

Wait, the direction vector n in the x-z plane can be represented as ( sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ ), but since φ=0 because it's in x-z plane, perhaps. Wait, maybe it's better to express it as ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, wait, actually, the standard spherical coordinates have θ as the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ as the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, but in any case, for an arbitrary direction in x-z, it's better to think of n as ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait no, because in the x-z plane, the direction can have any angle from the x or z axes. Alternatively, it's better to parameterize n in terms of θ, where θ is the angle between n and the z-axis. So, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then n can be written as ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), since θ=0 would be along z, and θ=π/2 would be along x.

So, in terms of this parameterization:

nx = sinθ

nz = cosθ

So, substituting into a and b:

a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b → [ - sinθ / ( cosθ -1 ) ] b.

Simplify the denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) → So denominator is - (1 - cosθ).

So:

a = [ - sinθ / ( - (1 - cosθ) ) ] b → [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Hmm, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

sinθ / (1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2)

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the ratio a/b = cot(θ/2).

Therefore, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

We can write the eigenvector as (a, b) = ( cot(θ/2) * b, b ).

To normalize the eigenvector, we need to compute the norm squared: |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Since eigenvectors can be complex, but in this case, the operator is Hermitian (since it's a component of angular momentum, which is Hermitian), so the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the operator P is actually the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, right? Because the given P_x, P_y, P_z are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices are (for X, Y, Z):

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yes, P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, etc.

So the operator P is (n · σ ) (ħ/2), because P is nx P_x + nz P_z, which is (nx σ_x + nz σ_z) (ħ/2).

Wait, I think σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices, so n · σ is the vector of Pauli matrices dotted with n.

So the operator is (n · σ) (ħ/2), which is a spin-1/2 operator.

In any case, the eigenvectors for spin-1/2 in direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states, which have the form:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]

|-> = [ -i sin(θ/2), e^{iφ} cos(θ/2) ]

But since the problem is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so the eigenvectors become real, right? Because e^{i 0} = 1.

Wait, in the x-z plane, the direction n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so φ=0. Therefore, the spin-up state would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, that's for the eigenstate in the direction of n. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, in the problem statement, the operator is P = (n · σ) (ħ/2). So the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down along n.

The spin-up state along n has eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvector should be:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

But wait, I thought it might have e^{iφ} in there, but since φ is zero in this case, it simplifies.

But wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again. The spin-up state in direction n is ( cosθ/2, sinθ/2 e^{iφ} ), but when n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so it's ( cosθ/2, sinθ/2 ), but wait, maybe I should adjust θ here.

Wait, perhaps the angle is defined as the angle from the z-axis, so the state would be ( sinθ/2, cosθ/2 ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the spin-up state for direction n is ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ), where θ is the polar angle.

Wait, in the standard spin-1/2 notation, when you have a state along the z-direction, the eigenstates are (1, 0) for spin-up and (0,1) for spin-down. If you rotate this state into a new direction n, which makes an angle θ from the z-axis, the eigenstates become:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]

|-> = [ -e^{iφ} sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ]

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so the state is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but if θ is measured from the z-axis, then for a direction in the x-z plane, the spin-up state would be along that direction. So the components would be cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but perhaps I should think about this a bit more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of theta and phi, but in this case, phi is zero since it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector components. So the normalized eigenvector would be a column vector [a; b], where a and b are complex numbers, but in this case, since we are in the x-z plane, maybe they are real.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

We found earlier that a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) * b.

But since the eigenvector can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, we can set b=1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2).

But wait, the eigenvector is [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Wait, but that would make the vector [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Wait, but let's compute the normalization. The norm squared is a^2 + b^2.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cot^2(theta/2) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2) → which is 1/sin^2(theta/2).

So to normalize, the vector should be multiplied by sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ sin(theta/2) * cot(theta/2), sin(theta/2) * 1 ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Because cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so when multiplied by sin(theta/2), it becomes cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that makes sense. So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2/2 )).

Wait, no, option D says (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C. But the problem says the operator is along n, which is in the x-z plane. So the answer would be either C or D.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, in the problem, the operator is (n · P) where P is the vector of Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states. So for spin-up, the state is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in the problem, each component of P is given as ħ/2 multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So the operator P is (n · σ) (ħ/2), where n is the direction vector.

So the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2), and the eigenvectors are as I described.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is exactly that: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is a spherical harmonic form but for a different parametrization. Option C's choice is more in line with the spin-1/2 state.

Wait, but the problem asks for "the normalized eigenvector", so the components should be normalized. Our calculation shows that [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is normalized, since cos^2 + sin^2 = 1.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option C is written as (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)).

Yes. So that's what we have.

Wait, but looking at the problem again, the eigenvector is for eigenvalue +ħ/2, so it's the spin-up state.

But why is option D an option? Let me look at option D: [√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ]

Hmmm. So why would there be a factor of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) there? That would imply a specific direction for n, perhaps. Because if the direction is along, say, the x-z plane at some angle, maybe theta is such that the coefficients are these sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3).

Wait, but the problem says the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So our solution must be in terms of theta, not specific numerical coefficients. So option C is the only one that fits.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the operator P is given as a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z, but the direction n is lying in the x-z plane. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and the eigenvector is in terms of theta, which is the polar angle from the z-axis. So the components are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So that's option C.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane. So the eigenvector is not specific to any particular direction, but is expressed in terms of theta. So the answer must be option C.

But looking back at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems to be a general spherical harmonic form, but for a different parametrization (maybe for higher spins), but in this case, for spin-1/2, it's option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the eigenvectors are not unique, they can be multiplied by a phase factor. So perhaps other options could also represent the same state.

But looking at the options, option C is the only one that matches the form we derived.

Wait, but why is option D present? Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the problem involves a specific direction for n. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, another approach: let me express P in terms of theta, since n is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

So the operator P is (ħ/2) [ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ], [sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ]

Wait, wait, earlier I had P as:

P = (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Which, with nz = cos(theta) and nx = sin(theta), gives:

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ], [ sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ]

So the matrix is:

[ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ], [ sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ cos(theta) (ħ/2), sin(theta) (ħ/2) ],
  [ sin(theta) (ħ/2), -cos(theta) (ħ/2) ] ] . [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

[ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ],
  [ sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ] . [a; b] = [a; b]

So the equations are:

cos(theta) a + sin(theta) b = a → (cos(theta) -1) a + sin(theta) b =0

sin(theta) a - cos(theta) b = b → sin(theta) a - (cos(theta) +1) b = 0

So from the first equation:

( cos(theta) -1 ) a + sin(theta) b =0 → a = [ sin(theta) / (1 - cos(theta) ) ] b.

As before, this simplifies to a = cot(theta/2) b.

So again, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But wait, I want to normalize this, so [a, b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So this brings us back to the same conclusion. So the normalized eigenvector is option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Other options: option B has cos(theta) and sin(theta), which I think is incorrect. Option D has some factors with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't seem to fit unless theta is a specific angle.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as a combination of its components:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
P = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting $P$ into the eigenvalue equation and simplifying, we find the system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \, b = 0$,  
2. $\sin\theta \, a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0$.

From the first equation, we solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation confirms the consistency of the system. The eigenvector is therefore proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sin\theta / \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor. The normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the form of option C. The other options are inconsistent with the derived eigenvector:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not match the derived form.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it corresponds to a different parametrization (likely for higher spins or spherical harmonics).  
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces specific coefficients $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the general solution.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
