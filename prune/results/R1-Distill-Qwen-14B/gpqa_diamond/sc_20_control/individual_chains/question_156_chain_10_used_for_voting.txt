Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each will show.

Hmm. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid and commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is when an alkene reacts with a peracid to form an epoxide. So, in each reaction, the alkene is being converted into an epoxide.

Wait, but the starting materials are E and Z isomers. So, (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, and (Z) is cis. How does the geometry of the starting alkene affect the epoxide formation?

I think that when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxidation occurs with some stereochemistry. Oh right, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a stereospecific manner, leading to the formation of an epoxide with a specific configuration. For cyclic ethers, the stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, I should recall the mechanism. Oh, right, mCPBA reacts with the alkene in a process where the peracid adds across the double bond, forming an intermediate that then loses a proton to form the epoxide. The addition is such that the oxygen atoms add with a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, wait. The addition is concerted, right? The peracid's oxygen adds across the double bond, and the epoxide ring forms. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will have the two new oxygen substituents on the same face or opposite?

Wait, no. Let me think. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are added to the same face of the double bond. So, the endo transition state leads to the formation of the epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. For a trans (E) double bond, the substituents on each carbon are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, the two oxygen atoms from the peracid come from the same face. So, if the starting alkene is E, what happens?

Wait, perhaps the trans double bond leads to a cis epoxide? Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, no, no. mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are added to opposite faces. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to remember. Oh, wait, the epoxidation proceeds with the peracid adding across the double bond in a way that the two oxygen atoms are added to the same face. So, if the starting alkene is cis (Z), the epoxide would have the same configuration, leading to a trans epoxide? Or maybe it's the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For example, when a trans (E) alkene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide forms such that the two new oxygen atoms are cis to each other in the ring.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this: for a trans double bond, the two substituents (on each carbon) are on opposite sides. Adding two oxygen atoms from the same face would result in the epoxide's oxygen atoms being on the same face. So, when the alkene is E, the epoxide would have a trans configuration? Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the groups on C4 and C5 are opposite. Adding mCPBA would add the two O's on the same face. So, the resulting epoxide would have the two O's on the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide?

Alternatively, perhaps the geometry of the starting alkene doesn't affect the epoxide's stereochemistry. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because mCPBA is stereoselective in its addition.

Wait, I think that when mCPBA reacts with a trans (E) alkene, the resulting epoxide is a trans-diepoxide? Or wait, maybe the starting geometry leads to a specific diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the epoxide is not directly determined by the starting alkene's E or Z configuration. Because mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are added to the same face, so the epoxide's configuration would be same as the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think of an example. Take cyclohexene. If it's trans, the substituents are on opposite sides. Wait, but in a simple alkene like oct-4-ene, when you epoxidize, the two oxygens are added on the same face, making a cis epoxide? Or opposite?

Wait, perhaps the key point is that the starting E and Z alkenes will form different epoxide diastereomers when treated with mCPBA.

Wait, no, because the reaction is stereospecific. Let's think: the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene. For example, if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide will have a certain configuration, and if it's Z, another configuration.

Wait, but wait. Let's consider the example of (E)- and (Z)-2-butene. When each reacts with mCPBA, what's the product?

I think that (E)-2-butene would form cis-2,3-epoxybutane, and (Z)-2-butene would form trans-2,3-epoxybutane. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no, wait. Let me visualize. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the oxygen adds across the double bond in a way that the two oxygens are on the same face. So, for (E)-2-butene, the two CH2CH3 groups are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the two oxygens come from the same face, leading to the epoxide where the two oxygen atoms are on the same side, making the epoxide a trans configuration? Or maybe it's the same as the starting alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the transition state. The peracid adds to the same face of the double bond, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the resulting epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the addition of the peracid to the double bond is stereospecific, leading to the same configuration in the epoxide as the starting alkene. For example, if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide will have a trans configuration. If the starting alkene is Z, the epoxide will be cis.

Wait, but that might not be right. Let me think again. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on C4 and C5 are opposite. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds from the same face. So, adding to a trans double bond would result in the epoxide's oxygens being on opposite faces, making the epoxide trans? Or same?

Wait, perhaps this is getting me confused. Let me think about the way epoxidation works. The peracid reacts with the alkene in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are added from the same face of the alkene. So, if the starting alkene is E, the substituents on each carbon are on opposite sides. When the peracid adds from the same face, the oxygens end up on the same face relative to each other, leading to a cis epoxide?

Wait, maybe that's the case. Let's take (E)-oct-4-ene. The substituents on C4 and C5 are opposite. When the peracid adds, the oxygen atoms are added to the same face, so the substituents (from the starting E isomer) on each end would be on opposite sides, leading to the epoxide's oxygens being on the same face, resulting in a trans epoxide? Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the two starting alkenes (E and Z) will produce two different epoxides. So, in Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene gives a trans epoxide, and Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene gives a cis epoxide. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that mCPBA leads to the formation of an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are added to the same face, which is the same as the configuration of the starting alkene. So, if the starting alkene is E (trans), the epoxide would have a certain configuration, and Z would lead to another.

Wait, but what determines whether the epoxide is cis or trans. Let me think of the product. Suppose you have an alkene with substituents A and B on one carbon and substituents C and D on the other. If the alkene is E, A and C are on opposite sides.

When mCPBA adds, it adds two oxygen atoms on the same face. So, if the starting alkene is E, the substituents on each end (A and C) are on opposite sides. Adding O from the same face would result in A and O on one side, C and O on the same side but opposite to A's side. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to consider that epoxidation with mCPBA leads to the formation of a specific diastereomer based on the starting alkene.

Wait, perhaps the key is that each starting alkene (E and Z) leads to a different epoxide, and when treated with aqueous acid, what happens?

Wait, after epoxidation, when the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, what's the next step? Oh right, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. The ring opening typically occurs via a protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group, followed by nucleophilic attack by water.

But wait, the question says that each reaction goes to 100% completion. So, each epoxide is fully converted into a diol after acid treatment.

So, for each starting alkene, the reaction forms a specific epoxide, which upon acid treatment, gives a specific diol.

Wait, but the diol's configuration will depend on the epoxide's configuration and the conditions of the acid treatment. Under acidic conditions, the ring opening of epoxides typically leads to the formation of trans diols because the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group (due to the protonation and transition state).

Wait, let's think: when an epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens in a way that the water attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen. This leads to the formation of a trans diol.

So, the configuration of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

So, the overall process is that each starting alkene (E and Z) leads to a specific epoxide. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide leads to a specific diol.

Wait, so let's break it down.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → Epoxide 1.

Then, acid → Diol 1.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → Epoxide 2.

Then, acid → Diol 2.

Now, what are Diol 1 and Diol 2 like?

Let me imagine the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 but wait, not exactly. Let's correct that.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, more accurately, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct. Let me think: octene is eight carbons, double bond at position 4.

So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, let's write it properly.

Structure for oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me number the carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4,5,6,7,8.

So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Maybe I should write it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense because position 4 would be in the middle. Let me think: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps it's more accurately written as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as a straight chain with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but I think I'm getting stuck here, perhaps I should focus more on the reaction rather than the structure.

So, going back: each starting alkene leads to an epoxide, which upon acid treatment, gives a diol. The diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene: reacts with mCPBA to give Epoxide 1. Then, acid treatment gives Diol 1.

For (Z)-oct-4-ene: reacts to give Epoxide 2. Acid → Diol 2.

Now, what's the relationship between Diol 1 and Diol 2? Are they enantiomers, diastereomers, or the same?

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is formed in a different configuration, leading to diastereomers.

Wait, but when you consider that the starting alkenes are E and Z, and the epoxidation is stereospecific, so each gives a different epoxide, which upon acid treatment leads to different diols.

Wait, but let's think about the diol structure. The diol will have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons. The configuration (cis or trans) of these hydroxyl groups depends on how the epoxide was formed.

So, if the epoxide is formed from an E-alkene, the resulting diol after acid treatment would have a certain configuration, and if from a Z-alkene, another.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently.

Each starting alkene (E and Z) gives a specific epoxide. Each epoxide upon acid treatment gives a specific diol.

Now, how many stereoisomers are possible for each diol?

The diol from each reaction is vicinal (adjacent) diol from the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide.

The number of stereoisomers depends on the number of stereogenic centers in the diol.

In the case of oct-4-ene, the diol would be 4,5-diol in octane.

So, each diol has two adjacent stereogenic centers (the two carbons where OH groups are attached). Each has two OH groups, so the possible stereoisomers are determined by the configuration of these two centers.

In the case of vicinal diols (like 4,5-diol), there are two possibilities: either the hydroxyl groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans) of the C4-C5 bond.

Wait, but in the case of acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, the attack leads to trans diol formation. Because in the ring-opening, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group.

Wait, so regardless of the starting epoxide's configuration, the diol formed under acidic conditions would be trans.

Hmm, but wait, if the epoxide's configuration is cis, then the diol would be trans. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let's consider a simple epoxide. Take ethylene oxide, which is a three-membered ring with an O and two CH2 groups. When treated with acid, water attacks the protonated epoxide. The ring opens, and the nucleophile (water) attacks from the opposite side, leading to trans diol.

Wait, no, wait: for ethylene oxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would lead to a trans-diol, but in reality, ethylene oxide is symmetric, so it forms a racemic mixture of diols, which upon opening would lead to a single product because the epoxide is symmetric. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the scenarios.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the ring-opening leads to a trans-diol regardless of the starting epoxide's configuration. So, the diol's configuration is trans, but the specific stereochemistry depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, but if the epoxide is cis, then the diol would have the two OH groups on the same face. Or perhaps not. Let me think again.

Take a specific example: suppose we have cis-2,3-epoxybutane. When treated with acid, the ring opens, and the nucleophile attacks from the opposite face. So, the resulting diol would have the two OH groups on opposite sides, making a trans diol.

Wait, but wait. If the epoxide is cis, then the two oxygens are on the same face. During ring opening, the attack happens on each carbon from the opposite side, leading to the diol's OH groups on opposite sides, making it trans.

Alternatively, if the epoxide is trans, then the oxygens are on opposite faces. When attacked from opposite sides, the diol could end up as cis or trans?

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find a more straightforward way.

The key point is: each starting alkene leads to a different epoxide. Each epoxide upon acid treatment leads to a diol. The diols from each reaction may or may not be enantiomers, diastereomers, or the same.

Wait, but how many stereoisomers are formed in each reaction?

If the starting alkene is (E), the epoxide formed would be a certain configuration, which upon ring-opening gives a diol with a specific stereochemistry.

If the starting alkene is (Z), the epoxide is another configuration, leading to another diol with a different stereochemistry.

So, each reaction produces a single diol, but whether those diols are enantiomers or diastereomers will determine the number of peaks in the HPLC.

Wait, but when the products are combined, how many distinct compounds are present?

If the diols from each reaction are enantiomers, then in the chiral HPLC, they would appear as two peaks (since the column can separate enantiomers), but in the achiral column, they would merge into one peak (since the column can't distinguish enantiomers).

Alternatively, if the diols are diastereomers, then in both chiral and achiral columns, they would appear as separate peaks.

Wait, but how do the diols from the two reactions relate to each other? Are they enantiomers or diastereomers?

Let me think: if the two starting alkenes (E and Z) give epoxides that upon acid treatment result in diols that are enantiomers, then combining them would give two enantiomers. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are diastereomers. Wait, because each diol has two stereogenic centers, and the configuration of both could be different.

Wait, perhaps each diol has two stereogenic centers. So, for each diol, the two OH groups can be in a cis or trans configuration.

Wait, but in reality, under acidic conditions, the ring-opening of an epoxide leads to the formation of a trans-diol. So, each diol is a trans diol, but their configurations could differ based on the starting epoxide.

Wait, but if each diol is a trans diol, but with different configurations (i.e., R and S configurations on each stereogenic center), then they might be enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps it's best to think of the diols as either enantiomers or the same compound. Let me try to think of a specific case.

Suppose reaction 1 produces an epoxide that leads to a diol where the two OH groups are on the same side (cis), and reaction 2 leads to a diol where the two OH groups are on opposite sides (trans). But wait, earlier thought was that acid treatment leads to trans diols, so both diols would be trans.

Wait, perhaps both diols are trans, but their configurations around the stereogenic centers are mirror images.

Wait, perhaps each diol has two stereogenic centers (C4 and C5), each with a hydroxyl group. The configurations of these centers determine the diastereomerism.

Let me imagine that the diol from reaction 1 has C4 as R and C5 as R, and the diol from reaction 2 has C4 as S and C5 as S. Then, these would be enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps they are diastereomers, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the diols are actually the same compound because the configurations are mirror images, making them enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are different diastereomers.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Each reaction produces a single diol. So, reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide 1 → diol 1.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide 2 → diol 2.

Now, if diol 1 and diol 2 are enantiomers, then when combined, they would form a racemic mixture. In the achiral HPLC, they would appear as a single peak because enantiomers are not separated on achiral columns. On a chiral column, they would appear as two separate peaks.

Alternatively, if diol 1 and diol 2 are diastereomers, then on both achiral and chiral columns, they would appear as separate peaks.

So, the question becomes: are diol 1 and diol 2 enantiomers or diastereomers?

To determine that, I need to find out whether the two diols are non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) or not (diastereomers).

Let me model the diols.

Epoxide 1 from (E)-oct-4-ene: let's say the substituents on C4 and C5 are opposite. So, the epoxide's oxygen atoms are on the same face. Upon acid treatment, the diol forms with a trans configuration.

Epoxide 2 from (Z)-oct-4-ene: substituents on C4 and C5 are same face. So, the epoxide's oxygens are on opposite faces. Upon acid treatment, the diol forms with a trans configuration.

Wait, but wait. So, both diols would be trans, but the arrangement of their stereogenic centers would differ.

Wait, let's imagine that in diol 1, the two OH groups are on the same side of the C4-C5 bond (cis?), but earlier I thought acid treatment leads to trans diols. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, considering that epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene would have the oxygens on the same face. Upon acid treatment, the ring opens with nucleophilic attack from the opposite side. So, for each oxygen in the epoxide, the attack happens from opposite sides, leading to the diol's OH groups being on opposite sides (trans configuration).

Similarly, for the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene, the oxygens are on opposite faces. So, when the attack happens from the opposite sides, the diol's OH groups would be on the same face (cis?) or opposite?

Wait, perhaps this is getting too detailed, but let's proceed.

In the (E)-oct-4-ene-derived epoxide, the oxygens are on the same face. After ring-opening, each OH group is added from the opposite face. So, the two OHs are on opposite faces of the C4-C5 bond, making the diol trans.

In the (Z)-oct-4-ene-derived epoxide, the oxygens are on opposite faces. After ring-opening, each OH is added from the opposite face. So, if the epoxide's oxygens are on opposite faces, the OHs would be on the same face, making the diol cis.

Wait, but earlier I thought that acid treatment leads to trans diols. So, perhaps this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps regardless of the epoxide's configuration, the diol is trans. So, both diols would be trans.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the diols as trans regardless of the starting epoxide. That is, each diol is trans, but their specific configurations (R/S) might be opposite.

Wait, perhaps the diols are enantiomers, making them non-superimposable mirror images, thus two separate peaks in a chiral column but one peak in achiral.

So, if each reaction gives a single diastereomer, and the two diastereomers are enantiomers, then when combined, the mixture has two enantiomers. So, in the achiral HPLC, they would appear as a single peak (since achiral columns can't distinguish enantiomers), and in the chiral HPLC, they would appear as two separate peaks.

But wait, the question says that all reactions go to 100% completion. So, each reaction gives a single product.

Wait, but the possible diastereomers: if the diols are enantiomers, then combining them would lead to a racemic mixture, which in an achiral column would show as a single peak, and in a chiral column, two peaks.

But wait, what if each reaction produces a diastereomer? Let me think: Reaction 1 produces diol A and reaction 2 produces diol B, which are diastereomers. Then, in an achiral column, they would appear as two separate peaks, and in a chiral column, also two peaks.

But the options don't have this scenario. Let me look.

Options:

A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.

C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

Wait, but wait. Each reaction produces a single diol. So, the products of the two reactions are two different diols, each a single compound.

If the diols are enantiomers, then when mixed, they would form a racemic mixture. In achiral HPLC, they would appear as one peak. In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

In the other case, if the diols are diastereomers, then each would be a separate compound, leading to two peaks in both HPLCs.

Wait, but what if each diol has two stereoisomers? For example, each diol is a pair of enantiomers. But that can't be because each reaction goes to 100% completion. So, each reaction produces a single stereoisomer.

So, the products of the two reactions are two different stereoisomers. How are they related?

If the two diols are enantiomers, then in achiral HPLC, they would appear as a single peak. In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

If the two diols are diastereomers, then in both HPLCs, two peaks.

But I'm not sure whether the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. But no, each reaction is 100% complete, so each produces a single diol.

Wait, perhaps the initial epoxide from each reaction has a specific configuration, and upon acid treatment, each leads to a single diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a diastereomer of the other.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try a different approach.

Question: After combining the products, how many distinct compounds are present?

Each reaction produces a single diol. So, if the two diols are enantiomers, the combined sample is a racemic mixture. If they are diastereomers, two separate compounds.

So, how many peaks in each HPLC?

If the two diols are enantiomers:

- On standard (achiral) HPLC: 1 peak (since enantiomers aren't separated).

- On chiral HPLC: 2 peaks (since they are separated).

If the two diols are diastereomers:

- On standard HPLC: 2 peaks.

- On chiral HPLC: 2 peaks.

But the options don't have 2 and 2. Wait, option C is 2 in both.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is itself a pair of enantiomers, but that can't be because each reaction gives a single product.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but since it's 100% conversion, each diol is a single enantiomer.

No, no. Each reaction produces a single diastereomer, so combining them would give two diastereomers.

But wait, perhaps the diols from each reaction are actually the same compound. That would mean only one product after combining, leading to one peak in both columns.

But that doesn't make sense because the starting alkenes are different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, but since each reaction is 100% complete, each produces one diastereomer. So, combining them gives two diastereomers, leading to two peaks in each column.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible answers.

Option B: 2 and 3 peaks. That suggests that in the standard HPLC, two compounds, and in chiral, three. But that doesn't fit with the scenario unless there are more products.

Option C: 2 and 2. So, two compounds that are not enantiomers.

Option D: 3 and 4. That suggests more than two products, which doesn't fit.

Option A: 4 in both, which would require four compounds, which seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps each diol has two enantiomers, making four compounds in total. But no, each reaction produces a single diol, so if they are enantiomers, combining them would give two.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible products.

Each reaction leads to an epoxide, which upon acid treatment gives a diol. Each diol has two stereogenic centers.

The number of possible stereoisomers for a vicinal diol (like 4,5-diol) would be 2^2 =4. But each reaction gives a single product.

Wait, but if the diol from reaction 1 is (R,R) and reaction 2 gives (S,S), then combining them gives a racemic mixture, which would result in two peaks on chiral HPLC and one on achiral.

Alternatively, if reaction 1 gives (R,S) and reaction 2 gives (S,R), they would be enantiomers, again leading to two peaks on chiral and one on achiral.

Wait, but wait. If the diol has two stereogenic centers, the possible configurations are (R,R), (R,S), (S,R), (S,S). But not all of these are possible because the diol is formed with a certain configuration from the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps only two diastereomers are possible.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces one of two possible diastereomers, leading to two products when combined.

So, combining the products would give two diastereomers. Then, in achiral HPLC, they would show as two peaks, and in chiral HPLC, also two peaks.

Which would correspond to option C.

But earlier I thought that each reaction produces a single diastereomer, so combining them would give two, leading to two peaks in both HPLCs.

So, the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but let me think again.

If the two diols are enantiomers, then standard HPLC would show one peak, chiral would show two.

But if they're diastereomers, both would show two peaks.

But the question says that each reaction goes to 100% completion. So, each reaction produces a single diol. So, combining them would give two diols.

If these two diols are diastereomers, then they are two distinct compounds, leading to two peaks in both HPLC columns.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each diol can exist as two enantiomers, but each reaction produces a single enantiomer. So, reaction 1 produces (R,R), reaction 2 produces (S,S). So, when combined, they are enantiomers. In achiral HPLC, they would merge into one peak. In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

That would mean in standard HPLC, one peak, and chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have that scenario. The only option that fits that is B: 2 and 3, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me think of another approach.

The problem states that the products of both reactions are combined. So, the combined product is a mixture of two diols, each a single product from their respective reactions.

If each diol is a single enantiomer, and the two are enantiomers, then in achiral HPLC, they would appear as one peak. In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

If each diol is a single diastereomer, and the two are diastereomers, then in both HPLC columns, two peaks.

Looking back at the options, option C is two peaks in both columns, which would be the case if the two diols are diastereomers.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, leading to the formation of epoxides and subsequent diols. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Epoxidation with mCPBA**:  
   - mCPBA reacts with alkenes in a stereospecific manner, forming epoxides where the oxygen atoms are added to the same face of the double bond.  
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene (trans double bond), the epoxide formed has the oxygens on opposite faces of the ring.  
   - For (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis double bond), the epoxide formed has the oxygens on the same face of the ring.  

2. **Acid-Catalyzed Ring-Opening**:  
   - The epoxides undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening, leading to the formation of vicinal diols.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen, resulting in a trans-diol.  

3. **Products of the Reactions**:  
   - Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide 1 → Diol 1 (trans-diol with a specific stereochemistry).  
   - Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide 2 → Diol 2 (trans-diol with a different stereochemistry).  

4. **Combination of Products**:  
   - The products of the two reactions are combined, resulting in a mixture of two diols. These diols are diastereomers because they have different configurations of the stereogenic centers (C4 and C5).  

5. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers are separated into distinct peaks because achiral columns can distinguish compounds with different physical properties. Thus, two peaks are observed.  
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns can separate enantiomers and diastereomers. Since the two diols are diastereomers, they are also separated into two distinct peaks.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - On both the standard and chiral HPLC columns, two peaks are observed, corresponding to the two diastereomeric diols formed in the reactions.
