Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds, labeled A1 to A5. I need to figure out the molecular weight range of A4 based on the given information.

First, let me read the problem carefully.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C). When it decomposes, it forms A2 and fluorine gas. The oF (I think this stands for the degree of fluorination or maybe oxygen-free fluorine, but more likely it's the weight percent of fluorine) is 31.96% in A2. So, the decomposition reaction must be something like A1 → A2 + F2.

Wait, more accurately, when binary compounds decompose, they usually break down into their constituent elements. Since A1 is a binary compound of Y and F, when it decomposes, it would form Y and F2. But the problem says it decomposes into A2 and F2. That suggests that A2 is another binary compound of Y and F. So perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, like YF3, and upon decomposition, it forms YF2 (A2) and F2 gas. Because, for example, 2 YF3 → 2 YF2 + F2. So in that case, A2 would be YF2.

The fluorine content in A2 is 31.96%. Let me calculate the molar ratio of F to Y in A2. Suppose the formula is YF2. So, the molecular weight (MW) of A2 would be (atomic weight of Y) + 2*(atomic weight of F). Fluorine is about 19 g/mol. So the weight percent of F would be (2*19)/(Y + 38) ) * 100% = 31.96%.

Let me solve for Y. 

So, (38)/(Y + 38) ) = 0.3196 → 38 = 0.3196 * Y + 0.3196*38.

Calculating 0.3196*38: 0.3196 * 38 ≈ 12.1448.

So 38 = 0.3196 Y + 12.1448.

Subtracting 12.1448 from both sides: 38 - 12.1448 = 0.3196 Y → 25.8552 = 0.3196 Y → Y ≈ 25.8552 / 0.3196 ≈ 80.75 g/mol. Hmm, wait, but wait—elements don't usually have such high atomic weights. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating. Let me recheck.

Wait, the formula for the weight percent of F in A2 is (2*19)/(Y + 2*19) ) * 100% = 31.96%. So 38/(Y +38) = 0.3196.

So Y +38 = 38 / 0.3196 → 38 / 0.3196 ≈ 118.83. So Y ≈ 118.83 -38 = 80.83 g/mol. But that's way higher than most elements. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the formula isn't YF2. Maybe A2 is YF3? No, wait, because if A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, perhaps A1 is YF4, which upon decomposition becomes YF2 and F2? Let me think. If A1 is YF4, then decomposition could be 2 YF4 → 2 YF2 + F2. So in this case, A2 would be YF2. Then, let's recalculate the fluorine content.

In YF2, fluorine is 38/(Y +38) = 0.3196. So same calculation as before. Y ≈ 80.83. Still too high. Wait, maybe the formula is YF. Like, if A2 is YF, then the fluorine content is 19/(Y+19) = 0.3196. So Y+19 = 19 /0.3196 ≈ 59.44 → Y ≈ 59.44 -19 =40.44. Hmm, but 40 is around the atomic weight of calcium (Ca is about 40). Let me check. Calcium's atomic weight is about 40.08.

Wait, if Y is Ca, then YF would be CaF. But wait, Ca usually forms CaF2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the formula is YF3. Then, fluorine content is (3*19)/(Y +57) = 0.3196 → 57/(Y+57) =0.3196 → Y +57 = 57/0.3196 ≈ 178.4 → Y ≈ 121.4. Hmm, that's too high.

Wait, maybe I should think of a different approach. Let me think about known binary fluorides that are bright red. One that comes to mind is manganese(II) fluoride, MnF2, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal fluoride. Another possibility is that maybe Y is iodine, but I don't think so because I is a halogen. Wait, perhaps Y is another element, like lead or something. Wait, but let's think about the fluorine content.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the formula. Let me re-express the equation:

Weight percent of F in A2 is 31.96%. So, (mass of F in A2) / (molar mass of A2) ) *100% =31.96%.

Assume A2 is YF_x. So, x *19 / (Y + 19x) = 0.3196.

So, when I thought x=2, that gave Y ≈80.83 which is high. x=1: Y≈40.44, which is about Ca.

Wait, but Ca typically forms CaF2, which is white, not bright red. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's another element. Let me think: another element with atomic weight around 40 is Zr (zirconium) but that's about 91, which is too high. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is barium, but Ba is about 137. So that can't be. Wait, perhaps Y is chlorine? No, because Cl is a halogen and in binary compounds with F, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute Y more accurately. Let me recalculate for x=2.

x=2, so equation is 38/(Y +38) = 0.3196 → Y+38 = 38 /0.3196 → 38 /0.3196 ≈ 118.83 → Y=118.83-38=80.83 g/mol. That's around the atomic weight of mercury (Hg is about 200.59). No, that's way higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula isn't YF2 but YF3. Let's try x=3. So, 57/(Y+57)=0.3196 → Y+57=57 /0.3196 ≈ 178.4 → Y≈178.4-57=121.4. That's around tellurium (Te is about 128), but that's a bit off. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is YF4. Then, x=4: 76/(Y+76) = 0.3196 → Y+76=76/0.3196≈237.5 → Y≈237.5-76=161.5. That's way too high, around lead (Pb is 207.2), but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the decomposition reaction. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So, perhaps A1 is YF3 decomposing into YF2 and F2. Let me write that as 2 YF3 → 2 YF2 + F2. So, in this case, A2 would be YF2. Then, we can calculate the fluorine content.

So, in YF2: (2*19)/(Y +38) = 31.96% → 38/(Y+38)=0.3196 → Y+38 = 38 /0.3196 ≈ 118.83 → Y ≈80.83. Hmm, but that's a high atomic weight.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A1 is YF4 and it decomposes into YF2 and F2. Let's think about that. So, the decomposition would be 2 YF4 → 2 YF2 + F2. Then, A2 is YF2, same as before. So same calculation applies.

Hmm, but Y=80.83 is about 81, which is around the atomic weight of lead (Pb is 207.2)? No, wait, 81 is more like strontium (Sr is about 87.62), or maybe yttrium (Y is about 88.91). Wait, but if Y is about 81, perhaps it's a different element.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think of other possibilities. Suppose A2 is YF, so x=1. Then, 19/(Y+19) =0.3196 → Y +19=19/0.3196 ≈59.44 → Y ≈ 59.44-19=40.44. That's about 40. So what element is around 40? Calcium (Ca) is 40.08. But calcium's common fluoride is CaF2, not CaF. So maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's another group 2 element. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the element Y is iodine (I). No, because iodine is a halogen, and in binary compounds with F, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other clues in the problem to identify Y. Let's read the rest.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, but in some compounds, it can act as a reducing agent. So, if A1 can oxidize xenon, it must be a strong oxidizing agent. That suggests that A1 is a highly oxidized fluoride, perhaps of a transition metal. For example, MnO4^- is a strong oxidizer, but that's in solution. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a fluoride that's a strong oxidizing agent, like ClF3 or something else. Wait, but ClF3 is a compound of Cl and F, not a binary with another element.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is iodine, but as I thought before, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen? No, because O is a non-metal, and fluorine is also a non-metal. So, not binary in that sense.

Wait, let's think about another clue: A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So perhaps A3 is another fluoride of Y. Also, when A3 is treated with Y in a 1:1 molar ratio, it forms A5. So, perhaps A3 is YF5, and adding Y in 1:1 molar ratio would produce YF3 and something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another clue: A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, perhaps A5 is a salt that, when dissolved in water, forms an acid and a base. Alternatively, A5 could be a hydroxide or something else.

Let me try to piece this together. Let me list all substances and their possible identities.

A1 is a bright-red binary fluoride that's a strong oxidizer. Let me think: MnF4 is not a real compound. Alternatively, ClF3 is a known compound, but it's a yellowish liquid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal fluoride. For example, cobalt(III) fluoride (CoF3) is a red solid. Oh, wait! I think CoF3 is a bright red solid. So perhaps A1 is CoF3.

If A1 is CoF3, then when it decomposes, it forms CoF2 and F2 gas. So, A2 would be CoF2. Let's check the fluorine content in CoF2.

Co has an atomic weight of about 58.93 g/mol. F is 19. So, CoF2 has a molar mass of 58.93 + 2*19 = 58.93 +38=96.93 g/mol. The fluorine content is (38)/(96.93) *100% ≈39.2%. But the problem states that the fluorine content is 31.96%. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe CoF3 is not the right choice.

Another possibility: Maybe Y is manganese. Manganese can form MnF2, MnF3, MnF4. MnF4 is a bright red solid. Let me check that. So, A1 could be MnF4. When MnF4 decomposes, it produces MnF3 and F2. So, 2 MnF4 → 2 MnF3 + F2. Then, A2 is MnF3.

Now, let's calculate the fluorine content in MnF3. Mn has an atomic weight of about 54.94. So MnF3's molar mass is 54.94 + 3*19 =54.94 +57=111.94 g/mol. The fluorine content is (57)/(111.94)*100 ≈50.9%. That's higher than the given 31.96%, so that's not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF2, which upon decomposition forms Y and F2. Wait, but that would mean YF2 → Y + F2. But then, A2 would be Y, which is an element, not a compound. That doesn't fit the context. So maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps Y is a transition metal in a high oxidation state. Let's think of another approach. Let's think about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. Let's write a general equation: A1 → A2 + F2. So, the formula of A1 must be such that when it breaks down, it releases F2. So, for example, if A1 is YF3, then it can't produce F2 because F is in -1 oxidation state, but in YF3, F is -1, so decomposition would require F to go to 0, which is possible. Let me think: YF3 → Y + 3/2 F2. But that would require a stoichiometric decomposition, but perhaps in reality, it's more like 2 YF3 → 2 Y + 3 F2.

Wait, but in that case, A2 would be Y, which is an elemental form, not a compound. But the problem says A2 is a binary compound. Hmm, that's a problem. So decomposition must form another binary compound.

Wait, perhaps Y is in a higher oxidation state in A1 than in A2. For example, suppose A1 is YF4 and A2 is YF3. Then, decomposition would be 2 YF4 → 2 YF3 + F2. So, this would make sense. Now, let's calculate fluorine content in YF3.

In YF3, fluorine is (3*19)/(Y + 57) ) *100% =31.96%.

So, 57/(Y +57) = 0.3196 → Y +57 =57 /0.3196 ≈178.4 → Y≈178.4-57=121.4 g/mol. Hmm. What element has an atomic weight around 121.4? That's around tellurium (Te is about 128). Alternatively, maybe it's another element. Let me check the periodic table for elements near 121.4.

Wait, Iodine is about 126.9, which is close. So Y could be iodine? But iodine is a halogen, so it's possible, but I'm not sure if that fits the other clues.

Wait, but if Y is iodine, then A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, A3 would be IF5 or something else. But let's proceed.

If Y is Te (atomic weight ~128), then let's see: YF3's fluorine content is 57/(128+57) =57/185 ≈30.8%. Close to 31.96% but not exact. Maybe rounding differences. Let's accept that for a moment.

Then, A1 is YF4, which upon decomposition gives YF3 (A2) and F2. So, that fits the decomposition part.

Now, moving on. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, Y could be in a lower oxidation state in A3. For example, if Y is Te, then perhaps A3 is TeF4 or another fluoride.

Wait, when you fluorinate Y, you're adding F to it, so perhaps it's YF. Hmm, but for Te, common fluorides include TeF4, TeF6. Let's say A3 is TeF4.

Then, when you add Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, you get A5. So, perhaps the reaction is: A4 + Y → A5.

Wait, the problem says adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. So, perhaps A4 is a fluoride, and adding Y (element) displaces some F.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt that reacts with Y to form another fluoride and perhaps another compound.

Additionally, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, perhaps A5 is a salt that hydrolyzes when in water. For example, if A5 is YF3, but then it would hydrolyze into Y(OH)3 and HF, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A4 is YF5. Let me think: YF5 is a common fluoride for some elements. When you add Y metal to YF5, perhaps it reduces the fluoride. For example, 2 YF5 + Y → 3 YF3. So, A5 would be YF3.

Then, YF3 in water would decompose into Y(OH)3 and HF, but that's two substances. Alternatively, perhaps YF3 is not stable in water and breaks down further.

Wait, but the problem says that A5 decomposes into two substances. So, perhaps A5 is a salt that, when in water, forms an acid and a base. For example, if A5 is NH4NO3, it would decompose into NH4OH and HNO3, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a binary compound that upon hydration forms two products. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible compounds and their properties.

If Y is iodine, then A1 could be IF3, which is a dark red solid. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine, but ClF3 is a known compound, but I'm not sure about its color.

Wait, perhaps Y is molybdenum or another transition metal. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen, but that's unlikely because O and F are both non-metals and form OF2, etc., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a group 14 element, like lead. Let's think: PbF4 is a known compound. When heated, it decomposes into PbF2 and F2. So, if A1 is PbF4, then A2 is PbF2. Let's calculate the fluorine content in PbF2.

Lead's atomic weight is about 207.2. PbF2's molar mass is 207.2 + 2*19=207.2+38=245.2 g/mol. Fluorine content is (38/245.2)*100≈15.5%. But the problem states 31.96%, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach. Let's consider that Y is an element whose common fluorides include YF3, YF4, etc., and that A1 is a higher fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal, like cobalt, and A1 is CoF3, which is a bright red solid. Let's see: Co's atomic weight is about 58.93. So CoF3's molar mass is 58.93 +3*19=58.93+57=115.93 g/mol. Fluorine content is (57/115.93)*100≈49.17%. The problem states 31.96%, so that's higher than needed. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a lighter element. Let me think about Y being calcium. Ca usually forms CaF2, which is a white solid. So, if Y is Ca, then CaF2's fluorine content is (2*19)/(40.08+38)=38/78.08≈48.6%. Again, higher than 31.96%.

Hmm. Maybe Y is a halogen, but that's unlikely because fluorine is already a halogen, and binary compounds would be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a noble gas, but I don't think noble gases form binary fluorides.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the percentages again. 31.96% fluorine in A2. Let me compute the possible x in YF_x.

So, x*19 / (Y +19x) ) =0.3196.

Another approach: Let me compute Y for various x.

x=1: 19/(Y+19)=0.3196 → Y+19=19/0.3196≈59.44 → Y≈40.44 → as before, about 40, which is Ca.

x=2: 38/(Y+38)=0.3196 → Y ≈80.83 → perhaps it's something else.

x=3:57/(Y+57)=0.3196 → Y≈121.4 → Te or I.

x=4:76/(Y+76)=0.3196 → Y≈161.5 → maybe Pb? No, Pb is 207.2.

Hmm. So possible Y values are about 40 (Ca), 80 (maybe mercury? No, Hg is 200.59), 121 (Te), 161 (maybe Praseodymium? No, that's a rare earth element). Alternatively, perhaps Y is around 40, so calcium.

If Y is calcium, then A2 is CaF2. But wait, CaF2 is a white solid, not red. So that doesn't fit A1 being bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal with a higher atomic weight. Let's think again: x=3, Y≈121.4. That's around tellurium (Te is 128). So let's proceed with Y as Te.

So, A2 is TeF3. Let's check its fluorine content.

TeF3: Te (128) + 3*19=57 → molar mass 185. So, (57/185)*100≈30.8%. Close to 31.96%. Hmm, perhaps it's rounded.

So, A1 is TeF4, which upon decomposition gives TeF3 and F2. Let me check the decomposition reaction.

Suppose 2 TeF4 → 2 TeF3 + F2. So, correct stoichiometry?

Wait, let's balance it:

TeF4 → TeF3 + F2.

Balancing Te: 1 on each side.

F: 4 →3 + 2*2 →3+4=7. That's not balanced. Let me try 2 TeF4 → 2 TeF3 + F2.

F: 8 → 6 + 2 →8. Yes, that works.

So, 2 TeF4 → 2 TeF3 + F2. So, A2 is TeF3.

Now, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Te). So, perhaps A3 is TeF6, a higher fluoride. Alternatively, maybe it's TeF2, but fluorinating would likely mean adding more F. So, perhaps A3 is TeF6.

Wait, but when you fluorinate Te, you could form TeF4, TeF6, etc. Let me think: TeF6 is a possible compound, but I'm not sure about its properties.

Then, when you add Y (Te) to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, you get A5.

So, perhaps the reaction is: A4 (which could be a fluoride) reacts with Te metal. Let's suppose A4 is TeF5. Then, adding Te might reduce it to a lower fluoride. For example:

TeF5 + Te → 2 TeF3. But let me check the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is: 2 TeF5 + Te → 3 TeF3.

So, the molar ratio is 1:1 between Te and TeF5 → produces 3 TeF3. So, A5 would be TeF3, which is A2. But that can't be right because A5 is another substance.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is TeF2, and adding Te produces TeF. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a hydrofluoric acid salt. Wait, but hydrofluoric acid is HF, and its salts are not common because F- is a weak base.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of HFO (if such a compound existed), but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a fluoride salt, like NaF. But then adding Te wouldn't make much sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the last clue: A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, perhaps A5 is a salt that when dissolved in water, undergoes hydrolysis. For example, if A5 is Na2SiO3, it would form NaOH and H2SiO3. But I'm not sure how that relates to the fluorides.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a fluoride of a different element. Alternatively, perhaps it's a binary compound that's amphoteric.

Wait, another thought: When Y (say, Te) is added to a solution of A4, perhaps A4 is a fluoride of another element. For example, if A4 is NaF, adding Te might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and adding Y (as metal) displaces F, forming Y's fluoride and another product.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to connect the dots.

If Y is Te, then A1 is TeF4, which upon decomposition gives TeF3 (A2, 30.8% F) and F2. Then, A3 is TeF6 (if formed by further fluorination of Te). Then, when Y (Te) is added to a solution of A4 (maybe TeF5), it produces A5 (perhaps TeF3 again). But then, when A5 (TeF3) is placed in water, it might decompose into TeO (oxide) and HF, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound altogether. Let me think about the reaction where adding Y (Te) to a hot concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. Maybe A4 is a higher fluoride, and adding Y reduces it. So, for example, 2 YF5 + Y → 3 YF3. So, YF5 is A4, and A5 is YF3.

Then, A5 (YF3) decomposes in water. Let's say YF3 + H2O → Y(OH)3 + HF. So, two substances: Y(OH)3 and HF. That fits the clue.

Now, the problem is to find the molecular weight of A4. If A4 is YF5, and Y is Te (atomic weight 128), then the molar mass of TeF5 would be 128 +5*19=128+95=223 g/mol. Looking at the options, option B is 220-240. So that would fit.

So, the molecular weight of A4 (TeF5) is around 223, which falls into option B: 220-240.

Wait, but let me double-check the earlier steps. If Y is Te, then in A2 (TeF3), the fluorine content is about 30.8%, which is close to the given 31.96%. So, that's a reasonable approximation, perhaps considering rounding.

Thus, the molecular weight of A4 (TeF5) is 223, which is within the range 220-240, so option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y, based on the given clues. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information and Clues**:
   - A1 is a bright-red binary compound of Y and F that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and F2 gas.
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y and can also interact with xenon.
   - A4 reacts with Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to form A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Element Y**:
   - The fluorine content in A2 is 31.96%. Assuming A2 is YFₓ, the formula for fluorine content is:
     \[
     \frac{x \cdot 19}{Y + x \cdot 19} \cdot 100\% = 31.96\%
     \]
   - Solving for different values of \(x\), it was found that \(x = 3\) gives a reasonable atomic weight for Y (~121.4 g/mol), which corresponds to tellurium (Te, atomic weight ~128).

3. **Assigning A1 and A2**:
   - A1 is identified as TeF₄, a bright-red compound that decomposes into A2 (TeF₃) and F₂ gas:
     \[
     2 \, \text{TeF}_4 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{TeF}_3 + \text{F}_2
     \]
   - The fluorine content in TeF₃ is approximately 30.8%, which aligns closely with the given 31.96%.

4. **Determining A4**:
   - A4 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Te). A plausible candidate is TeF₅, a known fluoride of tellurium.
   - The molecular weight of TeF₅ is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of TeF}_5 = 128 + 5 \cdot 19 = 223 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]
   - This value falls within the range 220–240.

5. **Verification**:
   - A5 is formed when Y (Te) is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4. A plausible reaction is:
     \[
     2 \, \text{TeF}_5 + \text{Te} \rightarrow 3 \, \text{TeF}_3
     \]
   - A5 (TeF₃) decomposes in water into Te(OH)₃ and HF, consistent with the clue that A5 decomposes into two substances.

Thus, the molecular weight of A4 (TeF₅) is approximately 223 g/mol, which falls within the range 220–240.

**Answer: B**
