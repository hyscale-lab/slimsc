Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

First, the question says that we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and possibly some salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, but the options here have kcal and kJ, so I'll have to be careful with the units.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which typically refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But here, we're mixing three solutions. I think I need to figure out which acids and which base are reacting and how much each contributes.

Let me break it down:

The acids present are HCl and H2SO4. The base is Ba(OH)2. So the HCl and H2SO4 will react with the Ba(OH)2.

I should probably calculate the moles of H+ from both acids and the moles of OH- from the base to see which is in excess. Because whichever is in excess will determine the amount of neutralization.

Wait, no. Actually, the base is Ba(OH)2. Let me think about what each acid contributes. HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ ions completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, wait: the first dissociation is complete, but sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. But I think in dilute solutions, the second H+ might not dissociate completely. But for the sake of this problem, maybe we're considering both H+ ions from H2SO4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem is about neutralization. So the reaction is between the H+ ions from the acids and the OH- ions from the base.

Wait, but wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So, let's calculate the moles of each acid and the base.

First, for HCl:

Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives 1 mole H+.

So HCl contributes 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4:

Volume 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each H2SO4 molecule can donate 2 H+ ions, right? Because it's diprotic, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base: Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles OH-.

So OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy of neutralization is for each mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

Wait, but the total H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So which is the limiting reagent? OH- is less. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: which H+ sources will be used first? The HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is another strong acid; but wait, wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second H+ may not be as strong. But I think for the sake of this problem, since the problem doesn't specify, we can assume that H2SO4 fully donates both H+ ions.

So in any case, the total H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2.

So, the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

Wait, but then what happens to the remaining H+? Because 0.28 -0.2=0.08 moles H+ will be left. Hmm, but in solution, that would mean the solution is still acidic, but since the problem is about the neutralization, I think we only consider the amount that actually neutralizes.

So the enthalpy change is based on the moles that react.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization per mole is typically given as about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases. Wait, but wait: I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) that reacts. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it releases about 57 kJ.

Wait, but wait, HCl and H2SO4 are both strong acids. But H2SO4 is diprotic. So perhaps for each mole of H2SO4 reacting, it contributes two H+ ions, each reacting with an OH-.

But in this case, the OH- is in limited supply. So the neutralization is based on the OH- available.

So the total moles of H+ and OH-:

H+ total: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

So the reaction will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

But wait, how does the H2SO4 factor into this? Because each mole of H2SO4 can provide two H+ ions. But in the reaction with OH-, each H+ only reacts with one OH-.

So for the neutralization, each OH- can only neutralize one H+. So the total moles of H+ that can be neutralized is 0.2.

So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. So if I'm correct, the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options: option D is -16.0 kJ, and option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, I need to be careful with the units.

Wait, because the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given in kJ per mole. 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So if I have -11.4 kJ, that's -11.4 /4.184 ≈ -2.72 kcal. Hmm, that's option A.

Wait, but wait, which unit is the question using? The question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization", but the options have both kJ and kcal. So I need to make sure which unit is correct.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically given as about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of acid, depending on whether it's monoprotic or diprotic). So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ.

In this problem, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized. So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.73 kcal (since 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal). Wait, 11.4 * 0.239 is about 2.72. So -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal.

So the answer would be either -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal. Looking at options, A is -2.72 kcal, and D is -16 kJ.

Wait, but wait, did I calculate the correct number of moles?

Let me recheck:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+ (since diprotic).

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So neutralization is 0.2 mol of H+ and OH-.

So 0.2 mol H+ neutralized → 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have option D as -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and each mole produces two H+, so perhaps the neutralization would be based on that.

Wait, but no, because the moles of OH- are the limiting factor. So regardless of the source of H+, only 0.2 moles can be neutralized.

Wait another thought: perhaps each mole of H2SO4 contributes two H+, but for each mole of H2SO4 that reacts, it would require two moles of OH-.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is only 0.2 moles. So how much H2SO4 can react?

Each H2SO4 can contribute 2 H+, so each mole would require 2 moles of OH-. We have 0.2 moles of OH-.

So moles of H2SO4 that can react completely: 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 moles.

So 0.1 moles of H2SO4 would react, contributing 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait, that's just for the H2SO4. The HCl also contributes H+.

So perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, then the H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, but the order might matter. Which acid is stronger? Both are strong acids, so their H+ would dissociate completely, but the order of neutralization may depend on which H+ is more available.

Wait, but actually, in solution, all H+ ions are available. So the OH- will react with all available H+ until it's used up.

So regardless of which acid contributes, the total H+ available is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ react, giving 0.2 moles of H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. Each provides 2 H+, so 0.18 H+.

Total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, so 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ released, so -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ → 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72). So -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal.

So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, the question says the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So the total would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. So if the options have both, which one is correct?

Looking back at the options:

Option A: -2.72 kcal.

Option B: -11.42 kcal.

Option D: -16.0 kJ.

Hmm. So -11.4 kJ is option D if that's what it says, but option D says -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 moles of OH-, but perhaps the stoichiometry is different. Let me think: Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So when it neutralizes H+, each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize 2 moles of H+.

Wait, no. Each mole of OH- neutralizes one mole of H+. Because H+ + OH- → H2O.

So 0.2 moles of OH- can only neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So the calculation is correct.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the neutralization is per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think again. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of acid reacting. For strong monoprotic acids, it's -57 kJ per mole of acid. For diprotic, like H2SO4, it's -114 kJ per mole of acid (since two H+ are neutralized per mole of acid).

Wait, that's another approach.

So perhaps the way to calculate is:

1. Find moles of each acid and base.
2. Determine how much of each acid can react with the base.

HCl: 0.1 moles. Each needs 1 mole OH-.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles. Each needs 2 moles OH-.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2 moles.

Now, how much acid can react?

First, HCl: 0.1 moles HCl → requires 0.1 moles OH-.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles H2SO4 → requires 0.18 moles OH-.

So the OH- available is 0.2.

HCl needs 0.1, H2SO4 needs 0.18.

Total OH- needed for all acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28. But we only have 0.2.

So we can only use 0.2 OH-.

Which acids can we fully neutralize?

HCl requires 0.1; that's covered by 0.1 of the 0.2 OH-.

The remaining 0.1 OH- can go towards H2SO4.

Each H2SO4 needs 2 OH- per mole. So 0.1 OH- can neutralize 0.05 moles of H2SO4.

So:

HCl: 0.1 moles fully neutralized.

H2SO4: 0.05 moles fully neutralized (each contributing 2 H+ → 0.1 H+ neutralized).

Wait, but then the total H+ neutralized is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.1 (from H2SO4) = 0.2.

So the enthalpy change would be:

HCl: 0.1 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -5.7 kJ.

H2SO4: 0.05 moles × (-114 kJ/mol) = -5.7 kJ.

Total: -5.7 + (-5.7) = -11.4 kJ.

So same result as before. So the total is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, is the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+ or per mole of acid?

Hmm, another thought: The problem states "the enthalpy of neutralization". Neutralization per mole of H+ can be considered, but sometimes, for polyprotic acids, the enthalpy per mole of acid is considered, which would be for complete neutralization.

So in the case of H2SO4, if it's a diprotic acid, the neutralization per mole would be -114 kJ (because two H+ are neutralized).

But in our case, only 0.05 moles of H2SO4 are completely neutralized (since each needs 2 OH- and we have 0.1 OH- left after HCl is neutralized).

So for H2SO4:

0.05 moles × (-114 kJ/mol) = -5.7 kJ.

HCl: 0.1 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -5.7 kJ.

So total is -11.4 kJ.

So again, same result.

Looking at the options again, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ in kcal.

Because 11.4 kJ = 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So the answer would be option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but the options are labeled as A, B, C, D. So:

Option A: -2.72 kcal.

Option B: -11.42 kcal.

Option D: -16.0 kJ.

So which is correct?

The problem says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when... are mixed." So the total enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

So the options have both units. So if the question expects the answer in kJ, then perhaps I should convert to kJ.

Wait, no. The problem doesn't specify the unit for the answer. But the options have both. So looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ.

But another possibility: perhaps the question is using enthalpy per mole of reaction, considering all possible neutralizations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the complete neutralization of all acids and bases, but in reality, there's excess H+ left.

Wait, but in the solution, after neutralization, we have 0.08 moles of H+ left (0.28 total - 0.2 neutralized).

So the solution will be acidic, but the neutralization is only for 0.2 moles.

So the correct enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So the correct option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, looking back, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.6 kJ (since 11.42 kcal ×4.184 ≈47.6 kJ). That's way higher than our calculation.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the standard enthalpy value.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+.

But wait, let me confirm: For a monoprotic strong acid and a strong base, the enthalpy change is about -57 kJ per mole of acid (since each mole of acid provides one mole of H+).

For diprotic acids, like H2SO4, the first H+ is around -57 kJ, and the second is about -50 kJ (since the second H+ is less strong, but in dilute solutions it's considered similar).

Wait, but wait, no. Actually, for the neutralization of the second H+ from H2SO4, the enthalpy is about -50 kJ per mole. So the total for H2SO4 would be about -57 + (-50) = -107 kJ per mole.

But in our calculation, we're only neutralizing 0.05 moles of H2SO4, which would contribute 0.05 * (-107) = -5.35 kJ for the H2SO4 part, and 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ for HCl, totaling about -11.05 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.05 kJ.

So, 11.05 kJ is about 2.64 kcal (11.05 /4.184 ≈ 2.64).

Which is close to option A's -2.72 kcal.

So I think my initial approach is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is option A) -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so total H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to give 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Determine limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
     Each mole of OH⁻ neutralizes 1 mole of H⁺.  
     Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
     OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, and \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ will be neutralized.

4. **Calculate enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
     Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal (if needed):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze options:**
   - **Option A:** \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - **Option B:** \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect, as it does not match the calculation.  
   - **Option D:** \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is incorrect, as it does not match the calculation.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

Answer: A
