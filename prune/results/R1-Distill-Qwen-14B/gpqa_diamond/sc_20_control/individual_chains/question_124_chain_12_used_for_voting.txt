Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. The thing is, only one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector walls.

Hmm, okay. So initially, when the Lorentz factor is 20, only 1/3 make it, and we need to find the Lorentz factor that gets 2/3 to the walls.

I remember that in particle physics, the distance a particle travels before decaying is important. Because if the particle decays before reaching the detector's wall, we won't see it. So the key here is the proper lifetime of the particle and how it's dilated due to relativistic effects.

The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. When the particle is moving at a high velocity (ultra-relativistic), its lifetime as seen in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is longer due to time dilation. The time dilation factor is the Lorentz factor gamma (γ).

So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (τ): t = gamma * τ.

The distance the particle travels before decaying is then v * t. But wait, since these are ultra-relativistic, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So distance D = v * t ≈ c * gamma * τ.

But wait, actually, the exact expression for the mean path length (the average distance a particle travels before decaying) is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Because beta is v/c, so beta is close to 1 for ultra-relativistic particles. So L = gamma * c * tau.

Wait, but because the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, beta is approximately 1, so L ≈ gamma * c * tau.

But the detector's radius is 30 meters. So if the particle's mean path length is longer than 30 meters, it's more likely to reach the wall. Conversely, if the mean path is shorter, it decays before reaching.

Wait, but the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So I think maybe the mean path is such that only 1/3 make it. So perhaps the mean path is longer than the detector's radius, but the distribution might be such that 1/3 are within 30 meters. Or maybe the decay is exponential, so the probability of decaying within a certain distance is a certain fraction.

Right, the decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that a particle has not decayed by time t is exp(-t/(tau)), but in the lab frame, the time is gamma * t0, where t0 is the proper time. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when traveling a distance x is exp( -x/(gamma * beta c tau) ), because x = v t = beta c t, and t = gamma tau' where tau' is the time in the lab frame. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So the distribution of decay lengths is exponential. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed after traveling a distance x is exp( -x / L ), where L is the mean decay length.

So in this problem, when gamma is 20, the mean decay length L is gamma * c * tau. So when L is 30 meters, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when reaching 30 meters is exp( -30/(gamma c tau) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the decay probability.

Wait, I think the mean decay length L is given by L = gamma * beta c tau. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, beta is approximately 1, so L ≈ gamma c tau.

Now, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it reaches the detector's radius (30 meters) is P = exp( -30 / L ). 

Since when gamma is 20, only one third (1/3) reach the wall, that means the probability of survival is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( -30 / (gamma * c * tau) )

But wait, gamma is 20 in that case. So:

1/3 = exp( -30 / (20 * c tau) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. The 30 meters is the radius, and L is in meters, so that should work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write it as 30 / L = ln(1/(1/3)) ) because P = exp(-x/L) => ln(P) = -x/L => x = - L ln(P).

Wait, so if x is the detector radius (30 m), and P is the probability of surviving beyond that, which is 1/3. So,

30 = L * ln(1/(1/3)) ) = L * ln(3).

Because L is the mean decay length, and x is the distance. So:

L = 30 / ln(3)

Wait, but let me think again. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed beyond x is exp(-x/L). So, when x=30 m, P = 1/3 = exp(-30/L). So,

ln(1/3) = -30/L → L = 30 / ln(3)

Compute ln(3): approximately 1.0986. So L ≈ 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.3 meters.

Wait, but that would be the mean decay length for which 30 meters is the 1/3 survival point. But if when gamma is 20, the mean decay length is L = gamma * c tau, so:

gamma * c tau = 27.3 m.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the initial situation (gamma=20) has 1/3 reaching the wall, so the mean decay length must be such that when x=30 m, the survival probability is 1/3.

So, for gamma=20, L = gamma * c tau.

And 30 = L * ln(3), because P = 1/3 = exp(-30/L) → 30/L = ln(3) → L = 30 / ln(3).

So, that would give L = 30 / ln(3) ≈ 27.3 m.

But wait, L is also gamma * c tau. So, for gamma=20:

20 * c tau = 27.3 m → c tau = 27.3 /20 = 1.365 meters.

So, c tau is a constant, because tau is the proper lifetime, which doesn't change with gamma. So for any gamma, L = gamma * c tau.

So when gamma changes, the mean decay length L changes proportionally.

Now, the question is, what gamma will make the survival probability at 30 meters equal to 2/3 (since we want two-thirds of the particles to reach the wall).

So, for gamma = ?, P = 2/3.

Again, using P = exp(-30/(L)), and L = gamma * c tau.

But we know from the previous case, when gamma=20, L=27.3 m, and c tau = 1.365 m.

So, for the new gamma (gamma_new), L_new = gamma_new * c tau = gamma_new * 1.365 m.

The survival probability is 2/3 at x=30 m. So:

2/3 = exp( -30 / (gamma_new * 1.365) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma_new *1.365 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3/2) = 30/(gamma_new *1.365 )

So,

gamma_new = 30/(1.365 * ln(3/2))

Compute ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

gamma_new = 30 / (1.365 * 0.4055 ) ≈ 30 / (0.553) ≈ 54.27.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the approach. Because when gamma increases, L increases, so the survival probability at 30 meters would increase.

In the initial case, gamma=20: survival probability is 1/3. Now we need gamma_new to have survival probability 2/3.

So, the calculation would be as above.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me compute the ratio of the two gammas.

Let me denote gamma_initial = 20, gamma_new = ?

The decay length is proportional to gamma, so L = k * gamma, where k = c tau.

When gamma is 20, L_initial = 20 * k.

At x=30 m, the survival probability is P_initial = 1/3 = exp( -30 / (20k) )

Similarly, when gamma is gamma_new, P_new = 2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma_new *k) )

So, let's take the ratio of the two:

Take (30/(gamma_new k)) = ln(2/3) → ?

Wait, but perhaps taking the ratio of the two equations:

From initial case:

30/(20k) = ln(3) [since 1/3 = exp(-30/(20k)) → ln(1/3)= -30/(20k) → 30/(20k) = ln(3)].

Wait, no, let me think:

1/3 = exp(-30/(20k)) → ln(1/3) = -30/(20k) → 30/(20k) = ln(3) → 3/(2k) = ln(3) → 3/(2k) = 1.0986 → k=3/(2*1.0986) ≈ 3/(2.197) ≈ 1.365 m (matches earlier calculation).

Now, for the new gamma, 2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma_new k) )

Taking ln on both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma_new k) → 30/(gamma_new k) = -ln(2/3) → 30/(gamma_new k) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

gamma_new = 30/(k * 0.4055 )

We have k = 1.365 m, so:

gamma_new = 30 / (1.365 * 0.4055) ≈ 30 / (0.553) ≈ 54.27.

So the closest option is A) 54.

Wait, but wait another point: since the mean decay length is gamma * c tau, and when gamma increases, the mean L increases, so the survival probability at a fixed x (30 m) increases.

So when gamma is higher, more particles survive to reach the wall. So for the survival probability to increase from 1/3 to 2/3, gamma must increase.

Which makes sense, as 54 is higher than 20.

So the correct answer should be option A, 54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the mean decay length, and the survival probability.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Mean Decay Length**: The mean distance a particle travels before decaying is given by:
   \[
   L = \gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

2. **Survival Probability**: The probability that a particle survives beyond a distance \( x \) is:
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L}\right)
   \]
   For \( x = 30 \, \text{m} \), the survival probability is related to the mean decay length \( L \).

### Initial Case (\( \gamma = 20 \)):
When \( \gamma = 20 \), only one-third (\( P = 1/3 \)) of the particles reach the detector's walls. Using the survival probability formula:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{L}\right)
\]
Taking the natural logarithm:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{L}
\]
\[
\frac{30}{L} = \ln(3) \quad \Rightarrow \quad L = \frac{30}{\ln(3)}
\]
Using \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \):
\[
L \approx \frac{30}{1.0986} \approx 27.3 \, \text{m}
\]
Since \( L = \gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau \), we find:
\[
\gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau = 27.3 \, \text{m}
\]
For \( \gamma = 20 \), this gives:
\[
c \cdot \tau = \frac{27.3}{20} \approx 1.365 \, \text{m}
\]

### Desired Case (\( P = 2/3 \)):
We need to find the new Lorentz factor \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \) such that two-thirds (\( P = 2/3 \)) of the particles reach the detector's walls. Using the survival probability formula again:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{L_{\text{new}}}\right)
\]
Taking the natural logarithm:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{L_{\text{new}}}
\]
\[
\frac{30}{L_{\text{new}}} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \quad \Rightarrow \quad L_{\text{new}} = \frac{30}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]
Using \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):
\[
L_{\text{new}} \approx \frac{30}{0.4055} \approx 73.9 \, \text{m}
\]
Since \( L_{\text{new}} = \gamma_{\text{new}} \cdot c \cdot \tau \) and \( c \cdot \tau = 1.365 \, \text{m} \) (from earlier), we solve for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \):
\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{L_{\text{new}}}{c \cdot \tau} = \frac{73.9}{1.365} \approx 54.27
\]

### Conclusion:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's walls is approximately \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \approx 54.27 \). The closest option is **A) 54**.
