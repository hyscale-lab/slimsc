Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, the question says all the planets have the same albedo. Oh right, albedo is the reflectivity, so if they're the same, that shouldn't affect the ratio.

The planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2*P1, Planet_3 is 2.5*P1, Planet_4 is 3.5*P1, and Planet_5 is 5*P1. Wait, but orbital period relates to the distance from the star. I think the formula for orbital period is from Kepler's third law, which is P² proportional to a³, where a is the semi-major axis. So P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. Since all planets orbit the same star, M is the same, so P² is proportional to a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the distance a of each planet is a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is some constant. So the ratio of a for any two planets would be (P_j / P_i)^(2/3).

Now, equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature (T) is T = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2), assuming a blackbody and no greenhouse effect. T_star is the star's effective temperature. But since we're looking for the ratio of T4 to T2, the T_star and R_star terms will cancel out because they're the same for all planets.

So the ratio T4/T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Wait, wait, let me get that right. T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but since L is the same for all planets, and albedo is same, the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ), because T is proportional to (1/sqrt(a)). So T4 = T2 * sqrt( a2 / a4 )?

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. T is proportional to ( (L/(16πσ a²) ) )^(1/4). So, T is inversely proportional to (a)^(1/2), because a² is in the denominator. So T4/T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

Wait, no, wait. If a is larger, T is smaller. So T4 is (a4)^(−½) and T2 is (a2)^(−½). So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2). Yes, that's right.

Now, a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3). Similarly, a4 is proportional to P4^(2/3). So a2 / a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). So (a2/a4)^(1/2) is (P2/P4)^( (2/3)*(1/2) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). Let's compute P2 and P4. From the given ratios, P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5. So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 2/(7/2) )=4/7 ≈0.5714.

So (0.5714)^(1/3) is the ratio T4/T2. Let me compute that. 0.5714 is approximately 4/7.

What's the cube root of 4/7? Let's see, 4/7 is about 0.571. The cube root of 0.571. Well, cube root of 1 is 1. Cube root of 0.512 (which is 0.8^3) is 0.8. 0.7^3 is 0.343. Wait, no, 0.8^3 is 0.512. Wait, 0.8 is 4/5. So 4/7 is a bit less than 4/5. So cube root of 4/7 is a bit less than 0.8.

Wait, wait, let me think again. 0.7^3 is 0.343, which is way below. 0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.82^3: 0.82 *0.82=0.6724, 0.6724 *0.82 ≈0.551. 0.83^3: 0.83^2=0.6889, 0.6889 *0.83 ≈0.571. Oh! Wait a minute. 0.83^3 is approximately 0.571. Because 0.83 * 0.83 is about 0.6889, times 0.83 is approximately 0.571. So cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83.

So T4/T2 ≈0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The question asks for the ratio of Planet_4's equilibrium temperature to Planet_2's. So T4/T2.

Wait, other way around, did I get that right? Let me double-check: the formula was T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈0.571. So cube root of that is about 0.83. So yes, T4 is 0.83 times T2.

Wait, but wait. The cube root of 0.571 is 0.83? Because 0.83^3 is approximately 0.571. Yes. So the ratio is approximately 0.83.

So the correct answer is C, ~0.83.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), where \( a \) is the orbital distance. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given as \( P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5 \). 

From Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures \( T_4 / T_2 \) is therefore proportional to \( \sqrt{a_2 / a_4} \). Substituting \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571.
\]

The cube root of \( 0.571 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures \( T_4 / T_2 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \).

The correct answer is **C) ~0.83**.

So the distance a of each planet is a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is some constant. So the ratio of a for any two planets would be (P_j / P_i)^(2/3).

Now, equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature (T) is T = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2), assuming a blackbody and no greenhouse effect. T_star is the star's effective temperature. But since we're looking for the ratio of T4 to T2, the T_star and R_star terms will cancel out because they're the same for all planets.

So the ratio T4/T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Wait, wait, let me get that right. T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but since L is the same for all planets, and albedo is same, the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ), because T is proportional to (1/sqrt(a)). So T4 = T2 * sqrt( a2 / a4 )?

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. T is proportional to ( (L/(16πσ a²) ) )^(1/4). So, T is inversely proportional to (a)^(1/2), because a² is in the denominator. So T4/T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

Wait, no, wait. If a is larger, T is smaller. So T4 is (a4)^(−½) and T2 is (a2)^(−½). So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2). Yes, that's right.

Now, a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3). Similarly, a4 is proportional to P4^(2/3). So a2 / a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). So (a2/a4)^(1/2) is (P2/P4)^( (2/3)*(1/2) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). Let's compute P2 and P4. From the given ratios, P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5. So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 2/(7/2) )=4/7 ≈0.5714.

So (0.5714)^(1/3) is the ratio T4/T2. Let me compute that. 0.5714 is approximately 4/7.

What's the cube root of 4/7? Let's see, 4/7 is about 0.571. The cube root of 0.571. Well, cube root of 1 is 1. Cube root of 0.512 (which is 0.8^3) is 0.8. 0.7^3 is 0.343. Wait, no, 0.8^3 is 0.512. Wait, 0.8 is 4/5. So 4/7 is a bit less than 4/5. So cube root of 4/7 is a bit less than 0.8.

Wait, wait, let me think again. 0.7^3 is 0.343, which is way below. 0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.82^3: 0.82 *0.82=0.6724, 0.6724 *0.82 ≈0.551. 0.83^3: 0.83^2=0.6889, 0.6889 *0.83 ≈0.571. Oh! Wait a minute. 0.83^3 is approximately 0.571. Because 0.83 * 0.83 is about 0.6889, times 0.83 is approximately 0.571. So cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83.

So T4/T2 ≈0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The question asks for the ratio of Planet_4's equilibrium temperature to Planet_2's. So T4/T2.

Wait, other way around, did I get that right? Let me double-check: the formula was T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈0.571. So cube root of that is about 0.83. So yes, T4 is 0.83 times T2.

Wait, but wait. The cube root of 0.571 is 0.83? Because 0.83^3 is approximately 0.571. Yes. So the ratio is approximately 0.83.

So the correct answer is C, ~0.83.
