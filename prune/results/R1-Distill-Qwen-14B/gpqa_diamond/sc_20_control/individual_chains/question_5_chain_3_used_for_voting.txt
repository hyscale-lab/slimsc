Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. They've given the components of the operator P in terms of their matrix representations.

So, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. 

Let me write down each of these matrices:

P_x is (ħ/2) times:
[0 1]
[1 0]

P_y is (ħ/2) times:
[0 -i]
[i  0]

P_z is (ħ/2) times:
[1 0]
[0 -1]

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are usually defined as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and the spin operators are (ħ/2) times these. So for a spin-½ particle, the spin operator components are (ħ/2)σ_x, etc. So yeah, that matches what's given here.

The operator in question is the vector operator P, but I think the question is about the operator along a direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So the direction n can be represented as having components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle is θ from the z-axis, with φ=0 or something.

Wait, but the operator along an arbitrary direction would be the component of P in that direction. The general formula for an operator in the direction of a unit vector n is P·n̂ = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the direction is determined by θ only; the azimuthal angle φ is zero or 2π, which doesn't affect the components.

So the operator P·n is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ, and n_y is zero.

But wait, in the question, the operator is given as P along n. So the operator is P·n̂, which is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n̂.

So, the operator P·n̂ is:

P·n̂ = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Because P is a vector operator, and n is in x-z plane, so y-component is zero.

So, the matrix for P·n would be (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z )

Let me compute this matrix.

σ_x is [[0,1], [1,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, sinθ σ_x is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and cosθ σ_z is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].

Adding these together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix for P·n̂ is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

The eigenvalue equation is then (P·n̂ ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, we have:

(P·n̂ ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

[ (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b].

We can factor out (ħ/2) on both sides, so the equation simplifies to:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [a; b] = [a; b].

So, the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a,

sinθ a - cosθ b = b.

Let me rewrite these equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0,

2. sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0.

Wait, wait, equation 1: cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

So, the two equations are:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0,

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

We can write this as a homogeneous system:

[ (cosθ - 1)   sinθ         ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ         (-cosθ -1) ] [b] 

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Let me compute the determinant:

D = (cosθ - 1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) 

= [ (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1*(cosθ -1) ] - sin²θ.

Wait, perhaps expanding it would be better.

Alternatively, compute it as:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ * cosθ) + cosθ + (1 * cosθ) -1
= -cos²θ + 2 cosθ -1.

Wait, wait, let me compute (cosθ - 1)(-cosθ - 1):

Multiply term by term:

= cosθ*(-cosθ) + cosθ*(-1) + (-1)*(-cosθ) + (-1)*(-1)

= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1 

= -cos²θ + 1.

Ah, that's easier. So the first term is (-cos²θ +1) = (1 - cos²θ) = sin²θ.

Then, the determinant is sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. So it's indeed zero, which makes sense because the matrix is singular, allowing non-trivial solutions.

So, the two equations are not independent, and we can use one of them to find the relationship between a and b.

Let me take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

We can solve for a in terms of b:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So,

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b → a = cot(θ/2) b.

So, a = cot(θ/2) b.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But we can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

Wait, but we can also write it in terms of sin and cos. Alternatively, perhaps using some substitution.

Wait, I think it's better to express this as [ a, b ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by some factor.

Wait, let me think: cot(θ/2) is cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2). So, a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] b.

So, if we set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2).

So, the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, but wait, let me check. So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, let me see: when θ is the angle in the x-z plane, that would make sense. Because for θ=0, the direction is along z. Then, the eigenvector should be along the z direction, which for spin-½ is [1;0] for +½ eigenvalue.

But when θ=0, cos(θ/2) = 1, sin(θ/2)=0. So the eigenvector is [1,0], which is correct.

Similarly, when θ=π, the direction is along -z. Then, the eigenvalue would be -ħ/2. But the problem is about the +ħ/2 eigenvalue, so direction θ=π would not be part of this eigenvector.

Wait, but I'm considering the direction n in the x-z plane. So, perhaps the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me see another approach. The eigenvalue equation for P·n is (ħ/2) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so the matrix has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

We're looking for the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, so the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation:

det( (ħ/2)[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ ] ] - λ I ) = 0.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the trace and determinant. The trace is (cosθ - cosθ) * (ħ/2) = 0. The determinant is (ħ/2)^2 ( -cos²θ - sin²θ ) = -(ħ/2)^2 (cos²θ + sin²θ ) = -(ħ/2)^2.

So the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2) * sqrt( (cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2 ), but wait, that doesn't look right because the matrix is (ħ/2) times [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ ]].

Wait, the eigenvalues for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, -a]] would be sqrt(a² + b²) and -sqrt(a² + b²).

Because the trace is zero, and determinant is - (a² + b²).

So in our case, a = cosθ and b = sinθ, so the determinant is -(cos²θ + sin²θ) = -1.

So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * sqrt( cos²θ + sin²θ ) = (ħ/2)(1) = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are indeed +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are for each of these.

We're interested in the eigenvector for +ħ/2, so let me write down the eigenvector equation:

( (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] - (ħ/2) I ) [a; b] = 0.

Which can be written as:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ] [a;b] = 0.

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2):

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ] [a;b] = 0.

Which gives the same equations as before.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cosθ -1, sinθ ] and [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ].

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to find the eigenvector directly.

We can write the eigenvector as [a, b]^T, satisfying (P·n̂ - (ħ/2) I ) [a; b] = 0.

So,

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0,

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

From the first equation:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

As I found earlier.

So, let me write the eigenvector as [a; b] = b [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ), 1 ].

But I can factor this as [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ), 1 ] times b.

Hmm, but I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So, substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b = cot(θ/2) * b.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(θ/2) * b, b ].

If we choose b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2).

So the eigenvector becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, let me check: if the direction is along the x-axis (θ=π/2), then the eigenvector should have components [0, 1], since the eigenstate of S_x is (|+> and |->), where |+> is (1,1)/sqrt(2) or something. Wait, no, wait: For σ_x, the eigenstates are (1,1) and (1,-1), but when you have P_x, which is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, for θ=π/2, n is along x. So the eigenvector should correspond to the +ħ/2 eigenvalue.

In that case, the eigenvector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] = [ cos(π/4), sin(π/4) ] = [√2/2, √2/2], but that's not correct because along x, the eigenstate for + should be (1;1)/√2, which would be [1;1] normalized. Hmm, but wait, let's see:

Wait, when θ=π/2, the direction is along x, so n is (1,0,0). Then, according to the formula, the eigenvector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] = [ cos(π/4), sin(π/4) ] = [√2/2, √2/2], which is the same as (1;1)/√2, which is correct for S_x giving +ħ/2.

So that checks out.

Wait, but when θ=0 (along z), the eigenvector would be [1, 0], which is correct for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue of S_z.

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But let me make sure: this is the unnormalized eigenvector. We need to normalize it.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So, |cos(θ/2)|^2 + |sin(θ/2)|^2 = 1, which is correct. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, only option C and D have expressions like cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))

Hmm, but wait, in our calculation, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but looking back, perhaps I missed a scaling factor.

Wait, let me think about the operator P. Each component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, the operator P·n̂ is (ħ/2) times a matrix. So, when we find the eigenvector, it's for the operator (P·n̂ ) which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvector is a unit vector, so the elements should be dimensionless. The options have some with ħ factors, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvector's elements should be pure numbers, not have units of energy or ħ.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) → this has units of ħ, which doesn't make sense for a vector in Hilbert space.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → this looks like spherical harmonics, perhaps for spin-1, but here we have spin-½.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → this is dimensionless.

Option D: ( sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ) → units again, which is incorrect.

So, the correct normalized eigenvector's elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. When we write the eigenvector, it's a column vector, so [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C's answer is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] as a row vector.

So, option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the operator is given as a vector operator, and the eigenvector is along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So the eigenvector should have elements that depend on theta/2, which matches option C.

But let me check the other options. Option B has a complex exponential, which would make sense for spin-½ in some cases, but in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane (phi=0), perhaps the state is real. So the eigenvector would be real.

So, the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are expressed as $\hbar/2$ times the Pauli matrices. The goal is to determine the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Operator Along an Arbitrary Direction**:  
   The operator along the direction $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and $n_y = 0$. Here, $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$ becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \left( \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0,
   \]
   where $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$, the equations simplify to:
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
   \]

3. **Solving for the Eigenvector**:  
   From the first equation, we find:
   \[
   a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
   \]
   Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:
   \[
   a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
   \]
   Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ and $a = \cos(\theta/2)$, the eigenvector becomes:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**:  
   The eigenvector is already normalized, as:
   \[
   |\cos(\theta/2)|^2 + |\sin(\theta/2)|^2 = 1.
   \]

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.  
   - **Option B**: Involves a complex exponential, which is unnecessary for this real eigenvector in the x-z plane.  
   - **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$ and is dimensionless.  
   - **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by Option C: $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. They've given the components of the operator P in terms of their matrix representations.

So, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. 

Let me write down each of these matrices:

P_x is (ħ/2) times:
[0 1]
[1 0]

P_y is (ħ/2) times:
[0 -i]
[i  0]

P_z is (ħ/2) times:
[1 0]
[0 -1]

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are usually defined as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and the spin operators are (ħ/2) times these. So for a spin-½ particle, the spin operator components are (ħ/2)σ_x, etc. So yeah, that matches what's given here.

The operator in question is the vector operator P, but I think the question is about the operator along a direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So the direction n can be represented as having components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle is θ from the z-axis, with φ=0 or something.

Wait, but the operator along an arbitrary direction would be the component of P in that direction. The general formula for an operator in the direction of a unit vector n is P·n̂ = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the direction is determined by θ only; the azimuthal angle φ is zero or 2π, which doesn't affect the components.

So the operator P·n is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ, and n_y is zero.

But wait, in the question, the operator is given as P along n. So the operator is P·n̂, which is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n̂.

So, the operator P·n̂ is:

P·n̂ = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Because P is a vector operator, and n is in x-z plane, so y-component is zero.

So, the matrix for P·n would be (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z )

Let me compute this matrix.

σ_x is [[0,1], [1,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, sinθ σ_x is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and cosθ σ_z is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].

Adding these together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix for P·n̂ is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

The eigenvalue equation is then (P·n̂ ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, we have:

(P·n̂ ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

[ (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b].

We can factor out (ħ/2) on both sides, so the equation simplifies to:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [a; b] = [a; b].

So, the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a,

sinθ a - cosθ b = b.

Let me rewrite these equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0,

2. sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0.

Wait, wait, equation 1: cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

So, the two equations are:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0,

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

We can write this as a homogeneous system:

[ (cosθ - 1)   sinθ         ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ         (-cosθ -1) ] [b] 

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Let me compute the determinant:

D = (cosθ - 1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) 

= [ (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1*(cosθ -1) ] - sin²θ.

Wait, perhaps expanding it would be better.

Alternatively, compute it as:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ * cosθ) + cosθ + (1 * cosθ) -1
= -cos²θ + 2 cosθ -1.

Wait, wait, let me compute (cosθ - 1)(-cosθ - 1):

Multiply term by term:

= cosθ*(-cosθ) + cosθ*(-1) + (-1)*(-cosθ) + (-1)*(-1)

= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1 

= -cos²θ + 1.

Ah, that's easier. So the first term is (-cos²θ +1) = (1 - cos²θ) = sin²θ.

Then, the determinant is sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. So it's indeed zero, which makes sense because the matrix is singular, allowing non-trivial solutions.

So, the two equations are not independent, and we can use one of them to find the relationship between a and b.

Let me take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

We can solve for a in terms of b:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So,

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b → a = cot(θ/2) b.

So, a = cot(θ/2) b.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But we can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

Wait, but we can also write it in terms of sin and cos. Alternatively, perhaps using some substitution.

Wait, I think it's better to express this as [ a, b ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by some factor.

Wait, let me think: cot(θ/2) is cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2). So, a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] b.

So, if we set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2).

So, the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, but wait, let me check. So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, let me see: when θ is the angle in the x-z plane, that would make sense. Because for θ=0, the direction is along z. Then, the eigenvector should be along the z direction, which for spin-½ is [1;0] for +½ eigenvalue.

But when θ=0, cos(θ/2) = 1, sin(θ/2)=0. So the eigenvector is [1,0], which is correct.

Similarly, when θ=π, the direction is along -z. Then, the eigenvalue would be -ħ/2. But the problem is about the +ħ/2 eigenvalue, so direction θ=π would not be part of this eigenvector.

Wait, but I'm considering the direction n in the x-z plane. So, perhaps the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me see another approach. The eigenvalue equation for P·n is (ħ/2) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so the matrix has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

We're looking for the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, so the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation:

det( (ħ/2)[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ ] ] - λ I ) = 0.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the trace and determinant. The trace is (cosθ - cosθ) * (ħ/2) = 0. The determinant is (ħ/2)^2 ( -cos²θ - sin²θ ) = -(ħ/2)^2 (cos²θ + sin²θ ) = -(ħ/2)^2.

So the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2) * sqrt( (cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2 ), but wait, that doesn't look right because the matrix is (ħ/2) times [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ ]].

Wait, the eigenvalues for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, -a]] would be sqrt(a² + b²) and -sqrt(a² + b²).

Because the trace is zero, and determinant is - (a² + b²).

So in our case, a = cosθ and b = sinθ, so the determinant is -(cos²θ + sin²θ) = -1.

So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * sqrt( cos²θ + sin²θ ) = (ħ/2)(1) = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are indeed +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are for each of these.

We're interested in the eigenvector for +ħ/2, so let me write down the eigenvector equation:

( (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] - (ħ/2) I ) [a; b] = 0.

Which can be written as:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ] [a;b] = 0.

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2):

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ] [a;b] = 0.

Which gives the same equations as before.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cosθ -1, sinθ ] and [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ].

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to find the eigenvector directly.

We can write the eigenvector as [a, b]^T, satisfying (P·n̂ - (ħ/2) I ) [a; b] = 0.

So,

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0,

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

From the first equation:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

As I found earlier.

So, let me write the eigenvector as [a; b] = b [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ), 1 ].

But I can factor this as [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ), 1 ] times b.

Hmm, but I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So, substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b = cot(θ/2) * b.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(θ/2) * b, b ].

If we choose b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2).

So the eigenvector becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, let me check: if the direction is along the x-axis (θ=π/2), then the eigenvector should have components [0, 1], since the eigenstate of S_x is (|+> and |->), where |+> is (1,1)/sqrt(2) or something. Wait, no, wait: For σ_x, the eigenstates are (1,1) and (1,-1), but when you have P_x, which is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, for θ=π/2, n is along x. So the eigenvector should correspond to the +ħ/2 eigenvalue.

In that case, the eigenvector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] = [ cos(π/4), sin(π/4) ] = [√2/2, √2/2], but that's not correct because along x, the eigenstate for + should be (1;1)/√2, which would be [1;1] normalized. Hmm, but wait, let's see:

Wait, when θ=π/2, the direction is along x, so n is (1,0,0). Then, according to the formula, the eigenvector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] = [ cos(π/4), sin(π/4) ] = [√2/2, √2/2], which is the same as (1;1)/√2, which is correct for S_x giving +ħ/2.

So that checks out.

Wait, but when θ=0 (along z), the eigenvector would be [1, 0], which is correct for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue of S_z.

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But let me make sure: this is the unnormalized eigenvector. We need to normalize it.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So, |cos(θ/2)|^2 + |sin(θ/2)|^2 = 1, which is correct. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, only option C and D have expressions like cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))

Hmm, but wait, in our calculation, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but looking back, perhaps I missed a scaling factor.

Wait, let me think about the operator P. Each component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, the operator P·n̂ is (ħ/2) times a matrix. So, when we find the eigenvector, it's for the operator (P·n̂ ) which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvector is a unit vector, so the elements should be dimensionless. The options have some with ħ factors, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvector's elements should be pure numbers, not have units of energy or ħ.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) → this has units of ħ, which doesn't make sense for a vector in Hilbert space.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → this looks like spherical harmonics, perhaps for spin-1, but here we have spin-½.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → this is dimensionless.

Option D: ( sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ) → units again, which is incorrect.

So, the correct normalized eigenvector's elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. When we write the eigenvector, it's a column vector, so [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C's answer is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] as a row vector.

So, option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the operator is given as a vector operator, and the eigenvector is along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So the eigenvector should have elements that depend on theta/2, which matches option C.

But let me check the other options. Option B has a complex exponential, which would make sense for spin-½ in some cases, but in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane (phi=0), perhaps the state is real. So the eigenvector would be real.

So, the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are expressed as $\hbar/2$ times the Pauli matrices. The goal is to determine the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Operator Along an Arbitrary Direction**:  
   The operator along the direction $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and $n_y = 0$. Here, $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$ becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \left( \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0,
   \]
   where $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$, the equations simplify to:
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
   \]

3. **Solving for the Eigenvector**:  
   From the first equation, we find:
   \[
   a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
   \]
   Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:
   \[
   a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
   \]
   Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ and $a = \cos(\theta/2)$, the eigenvector becomes:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**:  
   The eigenvector is already normalized, as:
   \[
   |\cos(\theta/2)|^2 + |\sin(\theta/2)|^2 = 1.
   \]

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.  
   - **Option B**: Involves a complex exponential, which is unnecessary for this real eigenvector in the x-z plane.  
   - **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$ and is dimensionless.  
   - **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by Option C: $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
