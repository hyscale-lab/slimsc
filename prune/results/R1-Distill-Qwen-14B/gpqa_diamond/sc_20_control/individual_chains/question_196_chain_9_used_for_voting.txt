Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me think. I know that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass is attached to a spring, and it oscillates. In the non-relativistic case, the speed is maximum when the potential energy is zero, right? But here, it's relativistic, so I guess special relativity comes into play, which changes things like mass and energy.

The problem states that the oscillator is 1-dimensional, with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max², and setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But this is a relativistic problem, so option C might not be correct.

Relativity complicates things because as the speed approaches the speed of light, the relativistic effects like increased mass (from gamma factor) become significant. So maybe I need to consider the total energy including relativistic terms.

In special relativity, the total energy E is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the system is a harmonic oscillator, so the energy should be conserved. At maximum amplitude, the potential energy is maximum, and at the equilibrium point, the kinetic energy is maximum.

Wait, but in a relativistic oscillator, the potential energy would still be (1/2)k A² when at the maximum displacement. But the kinetic energy when the mass passes through the equilibrium point (x=0) would be when the speed is maximum.

So at that point, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, no, because in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy equals the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, no. The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should be conserved. So when x is at maximum (A), the potential is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. When x is zero, potential is zero, kinetic is maximum.

So in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = (gamma) m c² at the equilibrium point, and E = (1/2)k A² + m c² at maximum displacement.

Wait, wait. Because when x=A, the potential is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A² + m c². Because the rest energy is m c², and the potential adds to that.

At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So the total energy is gamma m c².

So set them equal: gamma m c² = (1/2) k A² + m c².

Let me write that equation down:

gamma * m c² = m c² + (1/2) k A².

Subtract m c² from both sides:

gamma m c² - m c² = (1/2) k A².

m c² (gamma - 1) = (1/2) k A².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, gamma is equal to 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), so:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me solve for v. Let's denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, a. So a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma = 1 + a.

But wait, gamma must be greater than 1, which makes sense because the mass is moving at relativistic speeds.

So gamma = 1 + a.

But wait, another approach: Let's solve for v_max. Since gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), let's square both sides:

gamma² = 1/(1 - v²/c²) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

But earlier, gamma = 1 + a, where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So substituting gamma into the expression for v:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ).

Wait, let's compute 1/(1 + a)^2.

So 1/(1 + a)^2 = 1/(1 + 2a + a²).

But wait, if a is small, like when the speed isn't close to c, then a² is negligible. But in this problem, since it's relativistic, a might not be that small. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

So v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2), where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Alternatively, let me express 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 as [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Wait, no:

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

That's equal to [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

(1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a², so (1 + a)^2 -1 = 2a + a².

So 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

So v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 ).

Which simplifies to c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a).

Factor numerator: a(2 + a).

So sqrt(a(2 +a)) / (1+a).

Hmm, but maybe I can simplify this expression more.

Wait, let me substitute a = (k A²)/(2 m c²) into this expression.

So let me plug a into the numerator and denominator.

But perhaps there's another approach. Let's consider expanding the equation:

gamma = 1 + a → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But I might be better off expressing v in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression for v in terms of gamma.

Wait, let's go back to the equation:

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2) k A².

Divide both sides by m c²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So, 1/(gamma - 1) = (2 m c²)/(k A²).

But wait, our goal is to find v_max, which involves gamma.

From gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So, solving for v.

But perhaps I can write gamma in terms of v.

Wait, let me express the equation as:

gamma = [ m c² + (1/2)k A² ] / (m c²) ) → [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ].

Which is the same as before.

So, I can write:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call the term (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a for simplicity.

So gamma = 1 + a.

But from the expression for gamma, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a → sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1+a).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1+a)^2 → v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1+a)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ 1 + 2a + a² -1 ] ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor a from the numerator inside the square root.

2a + a² = a (2 + a).

So,

v = c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( a ) * sqrt(2 +a ) / (1 + a )

But I have to relate this to the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))² )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Option C: v_max = sqrt( kA²/m )

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, let's look at option D. Let's compute what it is.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ] )

Which is exactly what I derived earlier.

Because from earlier steps, v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ), where a is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ).

Which matches my result.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me check other options to make sure.

Option A: 1 - (kA^2)/(2m) in the denominator. That denominator isn't multiplied by c², which makes me think that option A is non-relativistic. Because in our expression, the denominator has 2 m c².

Option B: denominator is 1 - (kA²)/(2 m c²) inside the square root.

Wait, option B's expression is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - term)), which doesn't match. My expression is sqrt(1 - [1/(1+ term)^2 ] ), so option D matches.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, so correct only if the speeds are non-relativistic, which we can't assume here.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) is conserved and includes both the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the potential energy \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) at maximum amplitude. At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy at maximum amplitude and equilibrium gives:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Factoring out \( mc^2 \):

\[
mc^2 (\gamma - 1) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

The relationship between \( \gamma \) and \( v \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression in **Option D**. 

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the denominator lacks the \( c^2 \) term in \( 2mc \), which is inconsistent with the relativistic energy expression.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the expression inside the square root does not match the derived result.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it represents the non-relativistic case and does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it matches the derived relativistic expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
