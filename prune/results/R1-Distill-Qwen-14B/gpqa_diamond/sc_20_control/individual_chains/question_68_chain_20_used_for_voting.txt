Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu = γ S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field. But wait, the magnetic field changes direction here, from Z to Y. So, the spin state will evolve under this new field.

Wait, initially, the magnetic field is in the Z direction. So the spin is aligned with that field. I think that would mean the spin state is an eigenstate of S_z. So, the initial state is probably |+z> or |−z>, but since the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, which is in +Z, it's the |+z> state.

But then, the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, if the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian would change. Without the magnetic field, the spin wouldn't have any Zeeman effect, so the energy levels would be zero? Or perhaps the spin would just stay in its state because there's no external influence. But then another field is applied along Y. Oh, right, so the new Hamiltonian is due to the Y-direction field.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu, so the energy is -mu·B. So when the field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian would be proportional to S_y. But wait, spin is a vector, so the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y, maybe? Or wait, I think the magnetic moment is mu = γ S, so the energy is -mu · B. So for a field in the Y direction, H = -γ B S_y. Wait, but wait, mu is usually given by mu = γ S, so the component would be mu_y = γ S_y. So the energy is -mu · B, so H = -γ B S_y. But wait, actually, I think the Hamiltonian is usually written as H = -γ B S·n, where n is the direction of the magnetic field. So in this case, n is along Y, so H = -γ B S_y. Alternatively, maybe it's H = γ B S_y, depending on the sign convention. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. So if μ is γ S, then H = -γ (S · B). So if B is in the Y direction, H = -γ B S_y. But I'm a bit confused about the signs. Some sources might write it as H = γ B S_y, but I'll have to think.

But regardless, the system will start evolving under this new Hamiltonian. Since the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y. So the time evolution will cause transitions between the spin-up and spin-down states in the Y direction, which would lead to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, <mu_z>. So mu_z is γ S_z. So <mu_z> is γ times <S_z>.

I think that when the Hamiltonian is H = ω S_y (where ω is some frequency), the time evolution will cause transitions between the states |+y> and |−y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |−z>.

Wait, but the initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |−y>. Let me recall the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates are |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) and |−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2). So the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

So when the Hamiltonian is H = ω S_y, where ω is proportional to γ B, the time evolution will cause each component to oscillate. The energy eigenstates are |+y> with energy E+ = (ℏ ω)/2 and |−y> with E- = (-ℏ ω)/2. Wait, no, because H = ω S_y, and S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So E_+ = (ω) (ħ/2), and E_- = - (ω) (ħ/2).

When a state is a superposition of these, the time evolution will cause phase differences, leading to oscillations in expectation values. The time-dependent state after time t would be |ψ(t)> = e^(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>. So |ψ(0)> is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). Applying the time evolution operator:

e^(-i H t / ħ) (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2) = [ e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = (ω) (ħ/2) → E_+ t/ħ = (ω t)/2.

Similarly, E_- = - (ω ħ/2) → E_- t/ħ = - (ω t)/2.

So the state becomes [ e^{-i ω t/2} |+y> + e^{i ω t/2} |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

We can rewrite this as [ e^{-i ω t/2} (|+y> + e^{i ω t} |−y> ) ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, because e^{-i ω t/2} times e^{i ω t} is e^{i ω t/2}? Let me see. 

Wait, let's factor out e^{-i ω t/2}:

= e^{-i ω t/2} [ |+y> + e^{i ω t} |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, but |+y> and |−y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2),
|−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2).

So putting them into the expression:

= e^{-i ω t/2} [ (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{i ω t} (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2).

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= e^{-i ω t/2} [ (1 + e^{i ω t}) |+z> + (1 - e^{i ω t}) |−z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)).

Wait, sqrt(2) times sqrt(2) is 2, so denominator is 2.

So:

= (e^{-i ω t/2} / 2 ) [ (1 + e^{i ω t}) |+z> + (1 - e^{i ω t}) |−z> ].

Simplify the coefficients:

First term: 1 + e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} (e^{-i ω t/2} + e^{i ω t/2} ) ) = 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2).

Similarly, 1 - e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} (e^{-i ω t/2} - e^{i ω t/2}) ) = -2i e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2).

So substituting:

= (e^{-i ω t/2} / 2 ) [ 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) |+z> - 2i e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2) |−z> ]

The e^{-i ω t/2} and e^{i ω t/2} terms cancel for the first part:

= (1/2) [ 2 cos(ω t/2) |+z> - 2i e^{i ω t} sin(ω t/2) |−z> ]

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. Let me compute each part.

After substituting:

( e^{-i ω t/2} ) * ( 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) ) / 2 = [ 2 e^{i 0} cos(ω t/2) ] / 2 = cos(ω t/2).

Similarly, the second term:

e^{-i ω t/2} * ( -2i e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2) ) / 2 = (-2i e^{i0} sin(ω t/2) ) / 2 = -i sin(ω t/2).

So the state |ψ(t)> is:

cos(ω t/2) |+z> - i sin(ω t/2) |−z>.

Wait, that's correct? Let me check. Because when you expand, you have:

= (e^{-i ω t/2}/2) [ 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) |+z> + ... ].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check again.

Original expression after substitution:

= (e^{-i ω t/2} / 2 ) [ (1 + e^{i ω t}) |+z> + (1 - e^{i ω t}) |−z> ].

Wait, 1 - e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} [ e^{-i ω t/2} - e^{i ω t/2} ] = e^{i ω t/2} ( -2i sin(ω t/2) ).

So,

1 + e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} * 2 cos(ω t/2),
1 - e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} * (-2i sin(ω t/2)).

So,

= (e^{-i ω t/2}/2 ) [ 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) |+z> + (-2i e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2) ) |−z> ].

Simplify:

= [ e^{-i ω t/2} * e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) ) |+z> ] - i [ e^{-i ω t/2} * e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2) ) |−z> ] * (2/2 and terms)

e^{-i ω t/2} * e^{i ω t/2} = e^0 = 1.

So,

= cos(ω t/2) |+z> - i sin(ω t/2) |−z>.

Thus, the state at time t is:

|ψ(t)> = cos(ω t/2) |+z> - i sin(ω t/2) |−z>.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Wait, S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, and S_z |−z> = -(ħ/2)|−z>.

So,

<ψ| S_z |ψ> = [ cos(ω t/2) < +z | - i sin(ω t/2) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(ω t/2) |+z> - i sin(ω t/2) |−z> ].

Compute each term:

First term: cos^2 (ω t/2) < +z| S_z |+z> = cos^2(...) (ħ/2).

Second term: -i cos(ω t/2) sin(ω t/2) < +z| S_z |−z> = 0, because |+z> and |−z> are orthogonal.

Third term: -i sin(ω t/2) cos(ω t/2) < -z | S_z |+z> = 0.

Fourth term: (-i)^2 sin^2(ω t/2) < -z| S_z | -z> = (-i^2) sin^2(...) (ħ/2) → since (-i)^2 = (-1)^2 (i^2) = (1)(-1) = -1. So this term is - sin^2(...) (ħ/2).

Thus,

<S_z> = cos^2(ω t/2) (ħ/2) - sin^2(ω t/2) ( ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2 (ω t/2) - sin^2 (ω t/2) ]

But cos^2 a - sin^2 a = cos(2a), so:

= (ħ/2) cos(ω t).

Similarly, the magnetic moment in z is mu_z = γ S_z. So <mu_z> = γ <S_z> = γ (ħ/2) cos(ω t).

So the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine function, which is ω.

Wait, but wait, what is ω? Earlier, I thought H = ω S_y, but let's recheck.

The Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Since mu = γ S, and B is in the y-direction, H = -γ B S_y.

But S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). Wait, no, because H = -gamma B S_y, so when S_y is +ħ/2, E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and when S_y is -ħ/2, E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, that's correct? Let me think again. The Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B, and mu is gamma S. So H = -gamma B S_y. So for |+y>, S_y is +ħ/2, so H|+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>.

So the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = [ -gamma B (ħ/2) ] - [ gamma B (ħ/2) ] = -gamma B ħ.

Wait, but the energy difference is -gamma B ħ, but when we compute the frequency, the energy difference is ħ omega, so omega = (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (-gamma B ħ ) / ħ = -gamma B. But frequency is positive, so omega is gamma B.

Wait, but in our earlier expression for <mu_z>, the oscillation is at frequency omega. So in the expression, <mu_z> = gamma (ħ/2) cos(omega t), so the frequency is omega.

So omega is the energy difference divided by hbar. The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2) - ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) = gamma B ħ.

So the angular frequency is (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference is gamma B ħ, so (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B. So omega = gamma B.

But in the expression for <mu_z>, the oscillation is at omega t, so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but looking back, in the expression for <mu_z>, the time dependence is cos(omega t), so the oscillation frequency is omega, which is gamma B.

So the average z-component oscillates with frequency gamma B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B. But wait, wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation of the expectation value.

Wait, let's double-check the expectation value of S_z.

The state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta/2)|+z> -i sin(theta/2)|-z>, where theta = omega t.

Compute <S_z> as:

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

Which is |c1|^2 (ħ/2) + |c2|^2 (-ħ/2), where c1 and c2 are the coefficients. But wait, because the state is a superposition, perhaps there's interference terms.

Wait, no. Wait, S_z is diagonal in the |+z> and |−z> basis. So the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities times their respective eigenvalues.

So |c1|^2 is cos^2(theta/2), which contributes (ħ/2) * cos^2(theta/2).

|c2|^2 is sin^2(theta/2), which contributes (-ħ/2) * sin^2(theta/2).

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) ].

Which is (ħ/2) cos(theta), since cos^2 a - sin^2 a = cos(2a), and theta = 2*(theta/2) = omega t.

So yes, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(omega t), so the frequency is omega.

But omega is the energy splitting over hbar. The energy splitting between the two states is E_+ and E_-.

Earlier, H = -gamma B S_y. So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Thus, the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ( ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) = gamma B ħ.

The angular frequency is (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B.

So the frequency of oscillation is gamma B. So <mu_z> oscillates at frequency gamma B.

Wait, but the answer options have option B as gamma B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait, let me check again. Because in some cases, when you have a spin transition, the frequency could be related to the Larmor frequency.

Wait, the Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma B. So yes, that makes sense.

But wait, the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z but not of S_y. So when the field is switched to Y, the spin precesses around Y, causing the expectation value of S_z to oscillate with frequency equal to the energy splitting divided by ħ.

Yes, so the energy splitting is gamma B ħ, so omega = gamma B.

Wait, but looking back, I think I may have made a mistake in the sign. Because the time evolution operator is e^(-i H t/ħ). So H is -gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y.

So the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So when writing the time evolution, the phase factors are e^(-i E_+ t/ħ ) for |+y> and e^(-i E_- t/ħ ) for |−y>.

So the phase factors are e^{ i gamma B t/2 } and e^{ -i gamma B t/2 }.

Which when you compute the time evolution, the oscillation frequency comes from the difference in these phases, which is 2 gamma B t.

Wait, no, because when you have two terms with exponents e^{i a t} and e^{-i a t}, their difference leads to 2 sin(a t), which oscillates at frequency a.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me re-express the time evolution.

The time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, and the state can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of H with phases.

In our case, the eigenstates are |+y> and |−y> with energies E_+ and E_-, which are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

So, the time evolution of each eigenstate is |+y> → e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y> = e^{i gamma B t (1/2)} |+y>.

Similarly, |−y> → e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y> = e^{-i gamma B t (1/2)} |−y>.

So, the initial state is (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2).

After time t, the state becomes [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>, this is:

[ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |−z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |−z>) ) ] / (2).

Expanding:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |−z> ) ] / 2.

Simplify each term:

e^{i a} + e^{-i a} = 2 cos(a),
e^{i a} - e^{-i a} = 2i sin(a).

So,

= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z> ] / 2.

Simplify:

= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z>.

Wait, this is different from what I had before. Earlier, I had a negative sign in front of the i. Hmm, wait, perhaps a sign mistake. Let me check:

Wait, when I expressed the initial state as (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2), and after time t, each term gets a phase factor of e^{i gamma B t/2} and e^{-i gamma B t/2} respectively. So, when I substitute into the expression, it's e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |−y>, divided by sqrt(2).

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>, |+y> is (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2), and |−y> is (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2).

So, expanding:

e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2).

Divide all terms by sqrt(2):

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |−z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |−z>) ] / 2.

Factor out |+z> and |−z>:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |−z> ] / 2.

As before, this becomes:

= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z>.

Wait, no, because (e^{i a} - e^{-i a}) = 2i sin a. So the coefficient for |−z> is [ (e^{i a} - e^{-i a}) ] / 2 = [ 2i sin a ] / 2 = i sin a.

So, |ψ(t)> = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z>.

So now, compute the expectation value of S_z.

<S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

|+z> has S_z = ħ/2, |−z> has S_z = -ħ/2.

So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = |c1|^2 (ħ/2) + |c2|^2 (-ħ/2) + cross terms.

Wait, but cross terms involve terms like c1^* c2 < +z | S_z | -z > and c2^* c1 < -z | S_z | +z >.

But S_z |+z> = ħ/2 |+z>, so < +z | S_z | -z > = 0, same for the other way.

So,

< S_z > = |c1|^2 (ħ/2) + |c2|^2 (-ħ/2).

Where c1 = cos(gamma B t/2 ), c2 = i sin(gamma B t/2 ).

|c1|^2 = cos²(...),
|c2|^2 = |i|^2 sin²(...) = sin²(...).

Thus,

< S_z > = [ cos²(gamma B t/2) ] (ħ/2) - [ sin²(gamma B t/2) ] (ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos²(a) - sin²(a) ] where a = gamma B t/2.

Which is (ħ/2) cos(2a) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

So, <mu_z> = gamma < S_z > = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Thus, the frequency is gamma B. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the oscillation frequency was gamma B, so option B. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when the field changes direction, the oscillation frequency might involve a factor of sqrt(2), but in this case, it seems that the frequency is directly gamma B.

Wait, let me think about the energy levels again. The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ). The difference is gamma B ħ.

The time period would be T = 2pi / omega, so omega is gamma B.

So the frequency of oscillation is gamma B, which is option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field in the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and replaced with a magnetic field in the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:  
   The particle's initial state is $|+z\rangle$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is suddenly changed to point along $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$. This causes the spin state to evolve under the new Hamiltonian.

2. **Eigenstates of $S_y$**:  
   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle)$ and $|-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle)$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of these eigenstates:  
   $$|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).$$

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the eigenstates $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ evolve with time-dependent phases:
   $$|+y\rangle \to e^{-iE_+/ħ}|+y\rangle, \quad |-y\rangle \to e^{-iE_-/ħ}|-y\rangle,$$
   where $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar/2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar/2$. Substituting these into the time-evolved state:
   $$|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i\gamma B t/2}|+y\rangle + e^{i\gamma B t/2}|-y\rangle \right).$$

4. **Expressing in $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$ Basis**:  
   Substituting $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ back into $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$:
   $$|\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t/2)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\gamma B t/2)|-z\rangle.$$

5. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is given by:
   $$\langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t)| S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.$$
   Using $S_z|+z\rangle = \hbar/2 |+z\rangle$ and $S_z|-z\rangle = -\hbar/2 |-z\rangle$, and the orthogonality of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$, the result simplifies to:
   $$\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).$$

6. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ occurs at the frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu = γ S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field. But wait, the magnetic field changes direction here, from Z to Y. So, the spin state will evolve under this new field.

Wait, initially, the magnetic field is in the Z direction. So the spin is aligned with that field. I think that would mean the spin state is an eigenstate of S_z. So, the initial state is probably |+z> or |−z>, but since the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, which is in +Z, it's the |+z> state.

But then, the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, if the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian would change. Without the magnetic field, the spin wouldn't have any Zeeman effect, so the energy levels would be zero? Or perhaps the spin would just stay in its state because there's no external influence. But then another field is applied along Y. Oh, right, so the new Hamiltonian is due to the Y-direction field.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu, so the energy is -mu·B. So when the field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian would be proportional to S_y. But wait, spin is a vector, so the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y, maybe? Or wait, I think the magnetic moment is mu = γ S, so the energy is -mu · B. So for a field in the Y direction, H = -γ B S_y. Wait, but wait, mu is usually given by mu = γ S, so the component would be mu_y = γ S_y. So the energy is -mu · B, so H = -γ B S_y. But wait, actually, I think the Hamiltonian is usually written as H = -γ B S·n, where n is the direction of the magnetic field. So in this case, n is along Y, so H = -γ B S_y. Alternatively, maybe it's H = γ B S_y, depending on the sign convention. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. So if μ is γ S, then H = -γ (S · B). So if B is in the Y direction, H = -γ B S_y. But I'm a bit confused about the signs. Some sources might write it as H = γ B S_y, but I'll have to think.

But regardless, the system will start evolving under this new Hamiltonian. Since the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y. So the time evolution will cause transitions between the spin-up and spin-down states in the Y direction, which would lead to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, <mu_z>. So mu_z is γ S_z. So <mu_z> is γ times <S_z>.

I think that when the Hamiltonian is H = ω S_y (where ω is some frequency), the time evolution will cause transitions between the states |+y> and |−y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |−z>.

Wait, but the initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |−y>. Let me recall the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates are |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) and |−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2). So the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

So when the Hamiltonian is H = ω S_y, where ω is proportional to γ B, the time evolution will cause each component to oscillate. The energy eigenstates are |+y> with energy E+ = (ℏ ω)/2 and |−y> with E- = (-ℏ ω)/2. Wait, no, because H = ω S_y, and S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So E_+ = (ω) (ħ/2), and E_- = - (ω) (ħ/2).

When a state is a superposition of these, the time evolution will cause phase differences, leading to oscillations in expectation values. The time-dependent state after time t would be |ψ(t)> = e^(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>. So |ψ(0)> is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). Applying the time evolution operator:

e^(-i H t / ħ) (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2) = [ e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = (ω) (ħ/2) → E_+ t/ħ = (ω t)/2.

Similarly, E_- = - (ω ħ/2) → E_- t/ħ = - (ω t)/2.

So the state becomes [ e^{-i ω t/2} |+y> + e^{i ω t/2} |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

We can rewrite this as [ e^{-i ω t/2} (|+y> + e^{i ω t} |−y> ) ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, because e^{-i ω t/2} times e^{i ω t} is e^{i ω t/2}? Let me see. 

Wait, let's factor out e^{-i ω t/2}:

= e^{-i ω t/2} [ |+y> + e^{i ω t} |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, but |+y> and |−y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2),
|−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2).

So putting them into the expression:

= e^{-i ω t/2} [ (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{i ω t} (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2).

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= e^{-i ω t/2} [ (1 + e^{i ω t}) |+z> + (1 - e^{i ω t}) |−z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)).

Wait, sqrt(2) times sqrt(2) is 2, so denominator is 2.

So:

= (e^{-i ω t/2} / 2 ) [ (1 + e^{i ω t}) |+z> + (1 - e^{i ω t}) |−z> ].

Simplify the coefficients:

First term: 1 + e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} (e^{-i ω t/2} + e^{i ω t/2} ) ) = 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2).

Similarly, 1 - e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} (e^{-i ω t/2} - e^{i ω t/2}) ) = -2i e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2).

So substituting:

= (e^{-i ω t/2} / 2 ) [ 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) |+z> - 2i e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2) |−z> ]

The e^{-i ω t/2} and e^{i ω t/2} terms cancel for the first part:

= (1/2) [ 2 cos(ω t/2) |+z> - 2i e^{i ω t} sin(ω t/2) |−z> ]

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. Let me compute each part.

After substituting:

( e^{-i ω t/2} ) * ( 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) ) / 2 = [ 2 e^{i 0} cos(ω t/2) ] / 2 = cos(ω t/2).

Similarly, the second term:

e^{-i ω t/2} * ( -2i e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2) ) / 2 = (-2i e^{i0} sin(ω t/2) ) / 2 = -i sin(ω t/2).

So the state |ψ(t)> is:

cos(ω t/2) |+z> - i sin(ω t/2) |−z>.

Wait, that's correct? Let me check. Because when you expand, you have:

= (e^{-i ω t/2}/2) [ 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) |+z> + ... ].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check again.

Original expression after substitution:

= (e^{-i ω t/2} / 2 ) [ (1 + e^{i ω t}) |+z> + (1 - e^{i ω t}) |−z> ].

Wait, 1 - e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} [ e^{-i ω t/2} - e^{i ω t/2} ] = e^{i ω t/2} ( -2i sin(ω t/2) ).

So,

1 + e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} * 2 cos(ω t/2),
1 - e^{i ω t} = e^{i ω t/2} * (-2i sin(ω t/2)).

So,

= (e^{-i ω t/2}/2 ) [ 2 e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) |+z> + (-2i e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2) ) |−z> ].

Simplify:

= [ e^{-i ω t/2} * e^{i ω t/2} cos(ω t/2) ) |+z> ] - i [ e^{-i ω t/2} * e^{i ω t/2} sin(ω t/2) ) |−z> ] * (2/2 and terms)

e^{-i ω t/2} * e^{i ω t/2} = e^0 = 1.

So,

= cos(ω t/2) |+z> - i sin(ω t/2) |−z>.

Thus, the state at time t is:

|ψ(t)> = cos(ω t/2) |+z> - i sin(ω t/2) |−z>.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Wait, S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, and S_z |−z> = -(ħ/2)|−z>.

So,

<ψ| S_z |ψ> = [ cos(ω t/2) < +z | - i sin(ω t/2) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(ω t/2) |+z> - i sin(ω t/2) |−z> ].

Compute each term:

First term: cos^2 (ω t/2) < +z| S_z |+z> = cos^2(...) (ħ/2).

Second term: -i cos(ω t/2) sin(ω t/2) < +z| S_z |−z> = 0, because |+z> and |−z> are orthogonal.

Third term: -i sin(ω t/2) cos(ω t/2) < -z | S_z |+z> = 0.

Fourth term: (-i)^2 sin^2(ω t/2) < -z| S_z | -z> = (-i^2) sin^2(...) (ħ/2) → since (-i)^2 = (-1)^2 (i^2) = (1)(-1) = -1. So this term is - sin^2(...) (ħ/2).

Thus,

<S_z> = cos^2(ω t/2) (ħ/2) - sin^2(ω t/2) ( ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2 (ω t/2) - sin^2 (ω t/2) ]

But cos^2 a - sin^2 a = cos(2a), so:

= (ħ/2) cos(ω t).

Similarly, the magnetic moment in z is mu_z = γ S_z. So <mu_z> = γ <S_z> = γ (ħ/2) cos(ω t).

So the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine function, which is ω.

Wait, but wait, what is ω? Earlier, I thought H = ω S_y, but let's recheck.

The Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Since mu = γ S, and B is in the y-direction, H = -γ B S_y.

But S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). Wait, no, because H = -gamma B S_y, so when S_y is +ħ/2, E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and when S_y is -ħ/2, E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, that's correct? Let me think again. The Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B, and mu is gamma S. So H = -gamma B S_y. So for |+y>, S_y is +ħ/2, so H|+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>.

So the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = [ -gamma B (ħ/2) ] - [ gamma B (ħ/2) ] = -gamma B ħ.

Wait, but the energy difference is -gamma B ħ, but when we compute the frequency, the energy difference is ħ omega, so omega = (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (-gamma B ħ ) / ħ = -gamma B. But frequency is positive, so omega is gamma B.

Wait, but in our earlier expression for <mu_z>, the oscillation is at frequency omega. So in the expression, <mu_z> = gamma (ħ/2) cos(omega t), so the frequency is omega.

So omega is the energy difference divided by hbar. The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2) - ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) = gamma B ħ.

So the angular frequency is (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference is gamma B ħ, so (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B. So omega = gamma B.

But in the expression for <mu_z>, the oscillation is at omega t, so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but looking back, in the expression for <mu_z>, the time dependence is cos(omega t), so the oscillation frequency is omega, which is gamma B.

So the average z-component oscillates with frequency gamma B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B. But wait, wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation of the expectation value.

Wait, let's double-check the expectation value of S_z.

The state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta/2)|+z> -i sin(theta/2)|-z>, where theta = omega t.

Compute <S_z> as:

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

Which is |c1|^2 (ħ/2) + |c2|^2 (-ħ/2), where c1 and c2 are the coefficients. But wait, because the state is a superposition, perhaps there's interference terms.

Wait, no. Wait, S_z is diagonal in the |+z> and |−z> basis. So the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities times their respective eigenvalues.

So |c1|^2 is cos^2(theta/2), which contributes (ħ/2) * cos^2(theta/2).

|c2|^2 is sin^2(theta/2), which contributes (-ħ/2) * sin^2(theta/2).

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) ].

Which is (ħ/2) cos(theta), since cos^2 a - sin^2 a = cos(2a), and theta = 2*(theta/2) = omega t.

So yes, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(omega t), so the frequency is omega.

But omega is the energy splitting over hbar. The energy splitting between the two states is E_+ and E_-.

Earlier, H = -gamma B S_y. So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Thus, the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ( ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) = gamma B ħ.

The angular frequency is (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B.

So the frequency of oscillation is gamma B. So <mu_z> oscillates at frequency gamma B.

Wait, but the answer options have option B as gamma B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait, let me check again. Because in some cases, when you have a spin transition, the frequency could be related to the Larmor frequency.

Wait, the Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma B. So yes, that makes sense.

But wait, the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z but not of S_y. So when the field is switched to Y, the spin precesses around Y, causing the expectation value of S_z to oscillate with frequency equal to the energy splitting divided by ħ.

Yes, so the energy splitting is gamma B ħ, so omega = gamma B.

Wait, but looking back, I think I may have made a mistake in the sign. Because the time evolution operator is e^(-i H t/ħ). So H is -gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y.

So the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So when writing the time evolution, the phase factors are e^(-i E_+ t/ħ ) for |+y> and e^(-i E_- t/ħ ) for |−y>.

So the phase factors are e^{ i gamma B t/2 } and e^{ -i gamma B t/2 }.

Which when you compute the time evolution, the oscillation frequency comes from the difference in these phases, which is 2 gamma B t.

Wait, no, because when you have two terms with exponents e^{i a t} and e^{-i a t}, their difference leads to 2 sin(a t), which oscillates at frequency a.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me re-express the time evolution.

The time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, and the state can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of H with phases.

In our case, the eigenstates are |+y> and |−y> with energies E_+ and E_-, which are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

So, the time evolution of each eigenstate is |+y> → e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y> = e^{i gamma B t (1/2)} |+y>.

Similarly, |−y> → e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y> = e^{-i gamma B t (1/2)} |−y>.

So, the initial state is (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2).

After time t, the state becomes [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>, this is:

[ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |−z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |−z>) ) ] / (2).

Expanding:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |−z> ) ] / 2.

Simplify each term:

e^{i a} + e^{-i a} = 2 cos(a),
e^{i a} - e^{-i a} = 2i sin(a).

So,

= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z> ] / 2.

Simplify:

= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z>.

Wait, this is different from what I had before. Earlier, I had a negative sign in front of the i. Hmm, wait, perhaps a sign mistake. Let me check:

Wait, when I expressed the initial state as (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2), and after time t, each term gets a phase factor of e^{i gamma B t/2} and e^{-i gamma B t/2} respectively. So, when I substitute into the expression, it's e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |−y>, divided by sqrt(2).

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>, |+y> is (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2), and |−y> is (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2).

So, expanding:

e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2).

Divide all terms by sqrt(2):

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |−z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |−z>) ] / 2.

Factor out |+z> and |−z>:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |−z> ] / 2.

As before, this becomes:

= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z>.

Wait, no, because (e^{i a} - e^{-i a}) = 2i sin a. So the coefficient for |−z> is [ (e^{i a} - e^{-i a}) ] / 2 = [ 2i sin a ] / 2 = i sin a.

So, |ψ(t)> = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z>.

So now, compute the expectation value of S_z.

<S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

|+z> has S_z = ħ/2, |−z> has S_z = -ħ/2.

So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = |c1|^2 (ħ/2) + |c2|^2 (-ħ/2) + cross terms.

Wait, but cross terms involve terms like c1^* c2 < +z | S_z | -z > and c2^* c1 < -z | S_z | +z >.

But S_z |+z> = ħ/2 |+z>, so < +z | S_z | -z > = 0, same for the other way.

So,

< S_z > = |c1|^2 (ħ/2) + |c2|^2 (-ħ/2).

Where c1 = cos(gamma B t/2 ), c2 = i sin(gamma B t/2 ).

|c1|^2 = cos²(...),
|c2|^2 = |i|^2 sin²(...) = sin²(...).

Thus,

< S_z > = [ cos²(gamma B t/2) ] (ħ/2) - [ sin²(gamma B t/2) ] (ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos²(a) - sin²(a) ] where a = gamma B t/2.

Which is (ħ/2) cos(2a) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

So, <mu_z> = gamma < S_z > = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Thus, the frequency is gamma B. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the oscillation frequency was gamma B, so option B. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when the field changes direction, the oscillation frequency might involve a factor of sqrt(2), but in this case, it seems that the frequency is directly gamma B.

Wait, let me think about the energy levels again. The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ). The difference is gamma B ħ.

The time period would be T = 2pi / omega, so omega is gamma B.

So the frequency of oscillation is gamma B, which is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field in the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and replaced with a magnetic field in the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:  
   The particle's initial state is $|+z\rangle$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is suddenly changed to point along $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$. This causes the spin state to evolve under the new Hamiltonian.

2. **Eigenstates of $S_y$**:  
   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle)$ and $|-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle)$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of these eigenstates:  
   $$|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).$$

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the eigenstates $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ evolve with time-dependent phases:
   $$|+y\rangle \to e^{-iE_+/ħ}|+y\rangle, \quad |-y\rangle \to e^{-iE_-/ħ}|-y\rangle,$$
   where $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar/2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar/2$. Substituting these into the time-evolved state:
   $$|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i\gamma B t/2}|+y\rangle + e^{i\gamma B t/2}|-y\rangle \right).$$

4. **Expressing in $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$ Basis**:  
   Substituting $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ back into $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$:
   $$|\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t/2)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\gamma B t/2)|-z\rangle.$$

5. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is given by:
   $$\langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t)| S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.$$
   Using $S_z|+z\rangle = \hbar/2 |+z\rangle$ and $S_z|-z\rangle = -\hbar/2 |-z\rangle$, and the orthogonality of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$, the result simplifies to:
   $$\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).$$

6. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ occurs at the frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
