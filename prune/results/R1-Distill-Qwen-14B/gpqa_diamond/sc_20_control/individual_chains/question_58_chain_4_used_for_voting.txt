Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question asks which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Regularization, as I remember, is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like when calculations give infinite results. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the infinities, then removing the regularization afterwards.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. Strings are supposed to vibrate at different frequencies, and the theory might avoid some of the problems other quantum theories face. Wait, do I remember if string theory requires regularization? I'm not entirely sure, but I think string theories might have their own ways of handling divergences, maybe through the structure of the theory itself. Or perhaps they don't require the same kind of regularization because they're background-independent or something. So maybe A is a possibility.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD calculations often lead to things like Landau poles, especially at high energies. Wait, no, actually, QCD is asymptotically free, which means the coupling becomes weak at high energies. But wait, regularization is about handling divergences. QCD does require regularization because of things like renormalization. Or maybe not? Wait, isn't regularization a part of the process when you do loop calculations? Like, in QCD, you use methods like lattice regularization or Pauli-Villars, right? So QCD does require regularization. So B is not the answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is the first successful quantum field theory. I remember that QED does require renormalization because of the issues like the electron's self-energy and vacuum polarization leading to divergent integrals. So regularization is definitely used in QED. So C isn't the answer either.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the non-quantum version, right? So in Maxwell's equations and classical theories, do infinities appear? Like, the electric field of a point charge is infinite at the origin, but in classical theory, you can deal with that by considering distributions or using other methods. But do you need regularization? Regularization in the quantum sense isn't part of classical physics. Because regularization is a quantum field theory concept to handle divergences in loop integrals and such. So in classical electrodynamics, you don't really need regularization because you're not doing the same kind of calculations. So D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So if a theory doesn't have the same divergences, or perhaps doesn't use regularization because it's a classical theory without the same divergences.

So going back, the options:

A: Superstring Theory. I'm a bit unsure. Do they need regularization? I think in string theory, especially perturbative string theory, they calculate using Feynman diagrams with strings, but divergences might still occur. However, I remember that string theories can have a kind of "built-in" regularization because the theory is background-dependent and maybe the higher-order terms don't produce the same infinities. Or perhaps since it's a theory that doesn't have the same renormalization issues because of things like the absence of a perturbative unitarity problem, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: regularization is often needed when you have a theory that is not finite. For example, in QED, you have divergences that require renormalization. But if a theory is free from such divergences, it wouldn't need regularization.

Wait, but QED is a renormalizable theory. So it can handle the divergences through renormalization. But renormalization is often done after regularization. So even if the theory is renormalizable, you still need the regularization step.

In the case of a theory that is non-renormalizable, like certain effective theories, you would need more severe regularization. But if a theory is finite, meaning no divergences, then you wouldn't need regularization. But I don't think any of the quantum theories are finite except maybe some trivial cases.

Wait, but the question is about which never requires regularization. So maybe the answer is D, because it's a classical theory, and regularization isn't a concept applied there. Because in quantum theories, you need to regularize, but in classical, you don't.

So the options are:

A) Q: Is Superstring Theory free of requiring regularization? I'm not certain, but I think it's a theory that must deal with divergences, just like QED and QCD. So maybe it does require regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics would not need regularization because regularization is a quantum concept. So the correct answer is D.

So looking at the options, the only one that's a classical theory is D. So the answer should be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options as follows:

1. **Superstring Theory (A):** Superstring Theory is a quantum theory aiming to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. While it addresses divergences differently compared to other quantum field theories, it still involves calculations that can lead to infinities. Techniques like regularization are often used in its perturbative framework, so it likely requires regularization.

2. **Quantum Chromodynamics (B):** QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, involves divergences in loop calculations. Regularization methods, such as lattice or Pauli-Villars regularization, are commonly used to handle these divergences. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.

3. **Quantum Electrodynamics (C):** QED, the theory of electromagnetism, is a well-established quantum field theory. It suffers from divergences in calculations like electron self-energy and vacuum polarization. Regularization is a standard step in QED to manage these infinities, so QED requires regularization.

4. **Classical Electrodynamics (D):** This is a classical theory based on Maxwell's equations. While it deals with idealizations like point charges, which can lead to infinities (e.g., the electric field at a point charge's location), these are handled within the classical framework without requiring regularization. Regularization is a quantum field theory concept, so it is not applicable to classical theories like electrodynamics.

Given this analysis, the only theory that never requires regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
