Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the potential is like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator, so the solutions should be related to the product of one-dimensional solutions.

Wait, the question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. Right, so I need to figure out both parts.

First, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy is given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta, n = n_x + n_y + n_z. But wait, wait. No, wait. Oh wait, another approach: in 3D, each direction (x, y, z) contributes energy levels. Each direction is a 1D SHO, so each has energy levels (n_i + 1/2) ħω, with n_i being 0,1,2,... So the total energy is the sum of the three: E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z, and the energy is (n + 3/2) ħω.

Now, the ground state is when n=0, so E=(0+3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be when n=1, second when n=2, etc. But wait, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the zeroth excited state. So first excited is n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So for third excited state, n=3. So energy E = (3 +3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω.

Wait, let me confirm. Ground state is n=0. So excited states start counting from n=1. So third excited state is n=3. So energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω. So the energy part is 9/2 ħω.

Now, the second part: number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. That is, the degeneracy of the energy level for n=3. So the degeneracy is the number of ways to write n = n_x + n_y + n_z =3, where each n_i is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).

I remember that for a given n, the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n +2)/2. Wait, no, perhaps it's (n+1)(n+2)/2 or something else. Let me think. For each n, the number of triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to n.

For n=3: possible triplets.

n_x, n_y, n_z ≥0 and sum to 3.

The number is the combination with repetition. Formula is (n +3 -1 choose 3-1) )= (n+2 choose 2). So for n=3, (3+2 choose 2) )=5 choose 2 =10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Alternatively, list them: possible values for n_x:

n_x=0: n_y +n_z=3. The possible pairs (n_y, n_z) are (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0) →4 options.

n_x=1: sum is 2 →(0,2), (1,1), (2,0) →3 options.

n_x=2: sum is 1 →(0,1), (1,0) →2 options.

n_x=3: sum is 0 →(0,0) →1 option.

Total: 4+3+2+1=10. So yes, 10 functions.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω and the degeneracy is 10. Looking at the options:

Option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. So that's correct.

Option C says the same energy but 3 eigenfunctions, which is incorrect.

Looking at other options: options B and D have the wrong energy expression, probably about the potential or something else. Since the potential is given as (1/2)mω² r², which is a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized as we discussed, not involving terms with 1/r² or pi^2. So options B and D can be ruled out.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass \( m \) in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are given by \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total number of quanta, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions, respectively.

For the third excited state, the quantum number \( n \) is 3 (since the ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second to \( n = 2 \), and the third to \( n = 3 \)). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the energy level corresponds to the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. This is determined by the number of ways to write \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) as a sum of non-negative integers. For \( n = 3 \), the possible triplets \((n_x, n_y, n_z)\) are:

- \( (0, 0, 3) \), \( (0, 3, 0) \), \( (3, 0, 0) \),
- \( (0, 1, 2) \), \( (0, 2, 1) \), \( (1, 0, 2) \), \( (1, 2, 0) \), \( (2, 0, 1) \), \( (2, 1, 0) \),
- \( (1, 1, 1) \).

Counting these, there are 10 distinct eigenfunctions. Thus, the degeneracy is 10.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \). This matches the calculated energy and degeneracy.
- **Option B**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 10 \). The energy expression is incorrect for a harmonic oscillator.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 3 \). The degeneracy is incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 3 \). Both the energy and degeneracy are incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option A**.
