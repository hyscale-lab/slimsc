Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles and detectors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Oh wait, I remember that when particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. But wait, the problem says that particles are fast-decaying, so maybe their own lifetime is short, but from our frame, it's longer because of gamma (the Lorentz factor).

The question states that at a Lorentz factor of ~20, on average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. Now, they want to find out what Lorentz factor is needed so that two-thirds reach the walls.

Wait, so when the Lorentz factor is higher, the particles live longer from our perspective, right? So they can travel further. Oh, because distance is also affected by Lorentz contraction or something else?

Wait, no, wait. The particles' lifetime is dilated. So in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma times their proper lifetime (tau). So if the proper lifetime is tau, then the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.

The particles need to reach the detector walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is c multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame. So the distance d = gamma * c * tau.

Wait, but wait. The particle's speed is v ≈ c because they're ultra-relativistic. So the time they have to reach the detector is their lifetime in the lab frame, t = gamma * tau.

The distance they can travel is v * t ≈ c * gamma * tau.

So the distance d should be equal to or greater than the detector radius, 30 meters.

So for the particles to reach the inner walls, d >= 30 m.

At gamma =20, only one third reach the walls. So maybe the average distance they travel is such that 30 m is the maximum? Or wait, perhaps the particles are produced in the center, so the maximum possible distance is 30 m.

Wait, the problem says particles are collided at the center of the detector, so the inner walls are 30 meters away. So a particle can only reach the wall if it doesn't decay before traveling 30 meters.

So the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on whether its lifetime is long enough for it to travel 30 meters.

Wait, but particles decay probabilistically. So the average number that reach the wall is based on the average time they live.

Wait, maybe the number that reach the wall depends on the ratio of the distance they can travel on average versus the detector's radius. So the probability P that a particle reaches the wall is proportional to the distance they can travel divided by the detector radius.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the decay is exponential. The number of particles that survive beyond time t is N = N0 * exp(-t/(tau)), but in the lab frame, t is gamma * t0, where t0 is the proper time.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let me think: the proper lifetime is tau. The lab lifetime is gamma tau. The particle's speed is v = beta c ≈ c.

The time it takes to reach the wall is t = 30 m / c. Wait, because it's moving at speed c, so time is 30/(c) seconds.

The probability that the particle doesn't decay before that time is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

So the survival probability P = exp( - (30/(c)) / (gamma tau) )

At gamma=20, P is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( - (30/(c)) / (20 tau) )

So taking the natural log:

ln(1/3) = - (30/(20 c tau)) 

Which is:

- ln(3) = - (3/(2 c tau)) 

So ln(3) = (3/(2 c tau))

Wait, wait, maybe I can express c tau as something. Let me compute it.

But perhaps I can find the ratio when we want P to be 2/3 instead.

Wait, but wait, the question is about changing the gamma to get a higher P. Because higher gamma means longer lab lifetime, so more particles reach the wall.

So at gamma=20, P=1/3. Now, we need to find gamma_x such that P=2/3.

So let's write the same equation for gamma_x:

2/3 = exp( - (30/(c)) / (gamma_x tau) )

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2/3) = - (30)/(gamma_x c tau)

But from the first equation, we know that (30)/(gamma tau c) ) = ln(3) / (gamma=20) ?

Wait, let me re-do the first calculation.

At gamma =20, P=1/3.

ln(1/3) = - (30/(gamma * tau * c) )

So:

- ln(3) = - (30/(20 tau c) )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = 30/(20 tau c )

=> 30/(20 tau c ) = ln(3)

=> 3/(2 tau c) = ln(3)

So 3/(2 tau c) = ln(3) => (1/tau c) = (2 ln(3)) / 3 )

Wait, maybe I should express 30/(gamma tau c) in terms of ln(3).

Wait, maybe it's better to find the ratio of the required gamma_x to gamma=20.

So let me write the two equations:

At gamma1=20:

P1 = 1/3 = exp( - (30/(gamma1 tau c) ) )

At gamma2= x:

P2 = 2/3 = exp( - (30/(gamma2 tau c) ) )

Take the ratio of P2 to P1:

(P2)/(P1) )= (2/3)/(1/3) )= 2 = exp( [ -30/(gamma2 tau c) + 30/(gamma1 tau c) ) ] )

Because:

ln(P2) - ln(P1) = [ -30/(gamma2 tau c) ] - [ -30/(gamma1 tau c) ) ] 

Wait, let me compute ln(P2) = ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma2 tau c )

ln(P1 )= ln(1/3) = -30/(gamma1 tau c )

So ln(P2) - ln(P1 )= [ -30/(gamma2 tau c ) ] - [ -30/(gamma1 tau c ) ] 

= 30/(gamma1 tau c ) - 30/(gamma2 tau c ) 

= (30)/(tau c) (1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 )

And the ratio P2/P1 = exp( ln(P2) - ln(P1) ) = exp( (30)/(tau c) (1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 ) )

We know that P2/P1 = (2/3)/(1/3) )= 2.

So:

2 = exp( (30)/(tau c) (1/20 - 1/x ) )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(2) = (30)/(tau c) (1/20 - 1/x )

We can find (30)/(tau c) from the first condition. When gamma=20,

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 tau c )

=> ln(3) = 30/(20 tau c )

So,

30/(tau c) = 20 ln(3 )

Substituting back into the second equation:

ln(2) = [20 ln(3)] * (1/20 - 1/x )

Simplify:

ln(2) = ln(3) * (1/20 - 1/x )

Divide both sides by ln(3):

ln(2)/ln(3) = (1/20 - 1/x )

So,

1/20 -1/x = ln(2)/ln(3)

Wait, but wait, is ln(2)/ln(3) positive? Let's compute it. ln(2) is about 0.693, ln(3) is about 1.098. So 0.693/1.098 ≈ 0.631.

So,

1/20 - 1/x = 0.631

=> 1/x = (1/20) - 0.631

Wait, wait, 1/20 is 0.05, so 0.05 - 0.631 ≈ -0.581

So,

1/x ≈ -0.581

Hmm, that would mean x is negative, which can't be right because gamma is positive. Wait, that can't be. So I must have made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let's go back. The equation was:

ln(2) = ln(3) * ( (1/20) - (1/x) )

Wait, no, let's re-express:

ln(2) = (30)/(tau c) (1/20 - 1/x )

But we know that (30)/(tau c) )= 20 ln(3 )

So,

ln(2) = (20 ln(3 )) ( (1/20) - (1/x) )

Simplify:

ln(2) = ln(3) (1 - (20/x) )

So,

ln(2) = ln(3) * (1 - (20/x) )

Divide both sides by ln(3):

ln(2)/ln(3) = 1 - 20/x

Rearranged:

20/x = 1 - (ln(2)/ln(3) )

Compute 1 - (ln(2)/ln(3)).

We have ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, ln(3) ≈1.0986.

So ln(2)/ln(3) ≈ 0.6309.

So,

20/x = 1 - 0.6309 ≈ 0.3691

=> x = 20 / 0.3691 ≈ 54.22.

So the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54. So looking at the options, option A is 54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability depends on the exponential decay law, where the probability of a particle surviving long enough to reach the detector walls is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_{\text{lab}}}\right),
\]

where \( t \) is the time it takes for the particle to travel the distance to the detector walls, and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau \) is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame. For ultra-relativistic particles, \( v \approx c \), so \( t = \frac{d}{c} \), where \( d = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the detector radius.

The survival probability can thus be expressed as:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{d}{\gamma \tau c}\right).
\]

At \( \gamma = 20 \), the survival probability is \( P = \frac{1}{3} \). Using this, we solve for the term \( \frac{d}{\tau c} \):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{d}{\gamma \tau c}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 20 \), we find:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{d}{20 \tau c}.
\]

This gives:

\[
\frac{d}{\tau c} = 20 \ln(3).
\]

Next, we seek the Lorentz factor \( \gamma_x \) such that the survival probability is \( P = \frac{2}{3} \). Using the same formula for \( P \), we write:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{d}{\gamma_x \tau c}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{d}{\tau c} = 20 \ln(3) \), we find:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma_x}.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma_x \), we get:

\[
\gamma_x = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}.
\]

Using approximate values \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055 \), we calculate:

\[
\gamma_x \approx \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.22.
\]

Thus, the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \( \gamma_x = 54 \). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
