Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid, four-ringed molecule. 

The first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I think that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably an E2 mechanism. Since the starting material is a dibromide, the elimination would form an alkene. Wait, but where would the double bond form? In adamantane, the structure is such that each bridgehead carbon can only have three bonds, so I think the double bond would form between the two bridgehead carbons. So, the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? No, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on carbons 1 and 3. So eliminating those would form a double bond between C1 and C3? But wait, in the structure of adamantane, the positions are such that the bridgehead carbons are connected in a way that adjacent bridgeheads are connected by a single bond. So, if you have Br on C1 and C3, eliminating HBr from those would form a double bond between C1 and C3. So the product would be 1,3-diene, but in adamantane, that might not be possible because of the structure. Or wait, perhaps the structure is such that after elimination, it becomes a bicyclic diene.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. I'm trying to remember, when vicinal dihalides eliminate, they form alkenes. So the product is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's 1,2-diene? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,3-cyclohexadiene? No, no, adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So elimination would form a bridged diene. But I'm not entirely sure.

But looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Wait, what does that tell me? The 4.79 ppm is probably a triplet of triplets or a quartet. But considering it's 2H, maybe it's an -OH group? Or perhaps an -OCH2O- group. Wait, but the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product after elimination with KOH might be an epoxide? No, wait, KOH is a base, not an acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diepoxide, but that doesn't align with the IR.

Wait, another possibility: elimination of the two bromides could form an alkene, but then the reaction conditions might be for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond, but then what would the structure be. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening, but I don't think so because it's a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH in a high temperature could form an epoxide. Because when dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes they form epoxides. Wait, no, that's when you have vicinal dihalides and a peracid. Wait, no, epoxidation usually requires a peracid. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing an elimination to form an alkene, but how would that lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How does that happen? Oh! Maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's more about carbocation shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl via a neighboring group participation. Wait, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a double dehydrohalogenation, but that would form an alkene. But the IR suggests a carbonyl. Hmm. Another possibility is that KOH is causing a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Each Br is on adjacent carbons? Or are they on the same bridgehead? Wait, in adamantane, the structure has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So the dihalide would have Br on each of those bridgehead carbons.

When heated with KOH, perhaps elimination occurs, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond between those bridgehead carbons. But in the adamantane structure, that would require that the bridgehead carbons form a double bond, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to the Bredt's rule. Oh wait, Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are not stable unless in certain structures, like bicyclo systems with enough flexibility. But adamantane is a rigid structure, so maybe that bridgehead double bond isn't possible. So perhaps the elimination isn't possible, but wait, the reaction did produce a product. So maybe the elimination doesn't occur, and another reaction happens.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a diol via hydrolysis. So, each Br is replaced by an -OH group. So the product would be 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's probably not it.

Hmm. Alternatively, could the dihalide react to form a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, via an elimination? But for that, we usually need a peracid. Alternatively, perhaps the diol could lose water to form an epoxide. But I'm not sure how that would happen with KOH.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a relatively high chemical shift, possibly an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide. Because in epoxides, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, depending on the substituents. So if it's an epoxide, the 4.79 ppm could be those two protons. But wait, wait, in epoxides, each CH₂ group would split into a quartet if adjacent to another CH₂, but if it's a smaller ring, like a three-membered ring, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is due to an -OCH2CH2O- group, but that doesn't fit with an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal. Wait, but where would that come from? Maybe the elimination forms a carbonyl, but then what.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, forming a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminates two HBr molecules, forming a conjugated diene. Wait, but that would require each Br to lose an H and form a double bond, so two double bonds? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Oh, like a dehydrohalogenation but forming a carbonyl.

Wait, when a geminal dihalide (two halogens on the same carbon) is treated with a base, it can eliminate to form a carbonyl. For example, RBr₂ → R=O with strong base. But in this case, the dihalide is vicinal, not geminal. So perhaps that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing the adamantane to undergo a ring-opening. But adamantane is quite stable and doesn't easily undergo ring-opening under normal conditions. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires a catalyst like AlCl3 and an acyl chloride, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is undergoing a nucleophilic substitution. But with KOH, perhaps it's more likely an elimination.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me proceed to the next step to see if that helps.

The second step: product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Then, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.

So the final step is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves double bonds and forms carbonyl groups. The work-up with dimethylsulfide (which is a reductive work-up) would break the ozonides into carbonyl compounds.

So for product 3, the NMR is the key. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

So, perhaps the structure of product 3 will have some protons that are split into a certain coupling pattern.

But let's try to backtrack. Let's go step by step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR at 1720 cm^-1).

IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone or an ester. But considering that KOH is a strong base and not introducing any ester groups, it's more likely a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the initial dihalide, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl. So, perhaps each elimination of HBr forms a double bond, but in this case, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene that could undergo some ring contraction or expansion. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide upon elimination (losing two HBr molecules) forms an alkyne. But 1720 cm^-1 is more indicative of a carbonyl than a triple bond (which would be around 2250 cm^-1).

So, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione? No, that would have two carbonyl groups, but maybe just one.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice (losing two HBr molecules), perhaps forming a conjugated diene. But then, under certain conditions, the diene could undergo a ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is not possible, so maybe the elimination forms a single carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: The NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H).

The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which probably corresponds to CH₂ groups in a rigid structure, like in adamantane. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH₂ group adjacent to something deshielded. The 4.79 (2H) is probably an oxygen-bearing group, like OCH₂O (epoxide) or an -OCH2- group.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So maybe the 4.79 ppm is not an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetal.

Wait, another thought. If the product is a diketone (but that would have two carbonyl peaks in IR), but the IR here shows a single peak at 1720. So it's more likely a single ketone.

So, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, but ends up with a ketone. How? Maybe via a conjugated diene that undergoes some cyclization or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, and each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but then the diol loses water to form a ketone. Wait, that would make sense. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diol (if KOH replaces Br with OH), but then under certain conditions, the diol could lose two water molecules to form a ketone. But wait, that would require the diol to have adjacent OH groups, but 1,3-diol on adamantane would have OH groups on bridgehead carbons, which are not adjacent. So that might not lead to a ketone.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is an elimination to form a carbonyl. Let me think about the structure again.

Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead carbon is connected to two adjacent bridgehead carbons and two other carbons. So, if each bridgehead has a Br, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl group in the middle.

Wait, wait, perhaps the dihalide loses two HBr molecules, and the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a H, leading to a carbonyl group. So, for example, if two adjacent carbons each lose H and Br, the two carbons would each form a double bond, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a [1,2]-elimination, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide, but then the IR doesn't align. Wait, but the IR has a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is an epoxide (with the 4.79 ppm) and a ketone elsewhere. That seems unlikely, unless the elimination forms both.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a lactone, but that would require an ester linkage, which isn't explained by the KOH reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms a ketone and an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. No, that wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a geminal diol, which then undergoes cyclization. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think about the IR. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. How does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, removing two HBr's and forming a double bond. But then, if the structure forms a conjugated diene, which is not possible due to bridgehead structure, or perhaps it forms a cyclopropane ring? No, that doesn't fit.

Another approach: Look at the NMR. Product 1 has 2H at 4.79. That's likely a methylene group attached to an oxygen. So perhaps it's an epoxide. Then, the 4.79 ppm would correspond to the two protons on the epoxide. But then, the IR doesn't show an epoxide peak (which is around 1250 cm^-1 for the C-O stretch), but it does have a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a mix of epoxide and ketone, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is not an epoxide. Maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to a methylene. Wait, but the carbonyl is at 1720, so that's a ketone.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The 2H at 4.79 is probably an -OCH2O- group. So maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit with the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with more than three members, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's think about what comes next. Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide (also known as Al(i-Pr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, commonly used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound or something that can undergo electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't aromatic. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then, using Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation.

But product 1 is a ketone, and if treated with Al(i-Pr)3, maybe it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, so product 1 must have an aromatic ring. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic ketone.

Wait, but how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane become aromatic? Adamantane is all single bonds, so maybe after elimination, it forms a bridgehead double bond, but that's not allowed. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't aromatic but undergoes some kind of cyclization with the Lewis acid.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but that would require an alcohol and acid anhydride, which isn't the case.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the IR peak. 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So it's definitely a ketone or maybe an ester. But since KOH is used, which is a base, an ester is unlikely, as that would require an acid. So it's more likely a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(i-Pr)3. Perhaps it's activating the ketone for some kind of substitution or acylation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and the Al(i-Pr)3 is causing a ring expansion or contraction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but again, the substrate would need an aromatic ring.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclohexenone derivative. Then, Al(i-Pr)3 could facilitate some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the Al(i-Pr)3 is acting as a base, dehydrating the ketone or something similar.

But I'm not making progress here. Let's try to think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3, and the question is about the NMR of product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. But if the diene is symmetric, the products would be the same. So, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and upon ozonolysis, it breaks into two smaller fragments, each with carbonyl groups.

Wait, but product 2 is formed after treatment with Al(i-Pr)3. So maybe product 1 is a ketone, and Al(i-Pr)3 is causing some kind of elimination to form a diene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and Al(i-Pr)3 is causing it to undergo a ring-opening or some elimination to form a diene, which is product 2. Then, ozonolysis would break the diene into smaller carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes a ring-opening to form a diene. Then ozonolysis would cleave that.

But without knowing the structure of product 1, it's hard to say. Let me try to think about the NMR of product 1 again.

The 4.79 ppm is 2H. Let me think of what groups have 2H around that region. An epoxide would have protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but they're typically split into a quartet or a triplet of triplets. But 4.79 is a bit high for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: Could it be an acetylenic proton? But acetylenic protons are usually around 2-3 ppm, and they're typically split into a singlet or a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, R-CO-CH2- something. The CH2 protons next to a ketone could be around 2.1 ppm, but 4.79 is higher. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the 4.79 ppm is a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an ether. Let's say OCH2CH2O, but that's a four-membered ring, which is less common than three-membered. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but then the IR doesn't have the expected C-O stretch.

Wait, the IR only shows a peak at 1720, which is strong, so perhaps the main functional group is the ketone. The 4.79 ppm could be the (CH2) group adjacent to the ketone. But then, why would that be at 4.79?

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is a coupling between two CH2 groups. Wait, but without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should move to the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a diene would form carbonyl groups. If product 3's NMR is being considered, the most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

For example, if a proton is next to a CH₂ group, it might be a quartet. But if it's next to a CH group that's split into multiple peaks, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or another complex pattern.

Wait, the question is asking for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (not those that exchange). So probably, the most deshielded is next to a carbonyl group.

If product 2 is a diene, say 1,3-pentadiene or something similar, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. For a symmetrical diene, the products would be two identical carbonyl compounds.

But let's think about a specific example. Suppose product 2 is something like 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes or ketones, depending on substitution. But wait, in reality, ozonolysis of a cyclohexadiene would give two carbonyl groups that are connected in some way.

Alternatively, product 2 might be a more complex diene, leading to a more complex product upon ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a substituted diene, such as 1,3-pentadiene derivative. Ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have protons adjacent to carbonyls.

In that case, the most deshielded protons would be those on the CH₂ groups next to the carbonyl. Each of these protons would couple with neighboring protons. For example, if a CH₂ is next to a carbonyl and another CH₂, each proton would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, if the carbonyl is at the end of a chain, the adjacent CH₂ would have each proton coupling with two others, leading to a triplet. But if there are two neighboring groups, like being between two CH₂ groups, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another example: if product 3 has a structure like (CH₂)₂(CO)₂, then the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyl would each have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet for each proton. But if the CH₂ is between two other CH₂ groups, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, consider a structure like (CH₂)₂-CO-R. The protons on the CH₂ next to CO would be split by the adjacent CH₂. Each proton would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent group is a CH group with multiple protons, the splitting could be more complex. For instance, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two protons, each proton on the CH₂ would couple with both, leading to a doublet of doublets, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, imagine a scenario where the most deshielded proton is on a CH group that's adjacent to two CH₂ groups. Then, each of these protons would couple with the two on each adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, the key is to identify the structure leading to the coupling pattern. Let's think about the options given:

Options:
A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

So, if the most deshielded proton is a methylene (CH₂) next to a carbonyl group, and adjacent to another CH₂, each of its protons would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂. So each proton would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. So option A would be a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent group is more complex, like a vinyl group or another CH₂ group, the splitting might be different.

Wait, another possibility: the most deshielded proton is on a CH group adjacent to two different CH₂ groups. Then, each proton would couple with two protons from each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets. That would be option B.

Alternatively, if the proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group and a CH group, the splitting could be more complex, perhaps a doublet of triplets (option C) or a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like CH₂-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CHO. The protons on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl (the first CH₂) would be next to another CH₂ group. Each proton on the first CH₂ would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, making option A correct.

But wait, if the structure is more like CH₂=CH-CO-..., then the protons on the CH₂ would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet. But that's in the presence of a double bond, which would have different coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a vinyl group, but that's not adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, another scenario: if the ozonolysis produces a diketone, such as O=C-R-C=O. Then, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be on the R group. If R is a CH₂, then each proton would be split by the two on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in a symmetrical diketone like R-CO-CO-R, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the ketones would be identical, and each would split into a triplet.

Alternatively, if R is a longer chain, the splitting could vary.

Wait, maybe a more concrete example would help. Suppose product 2 is a diene like 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two formaldehyde molecules, but that's in the case of a conjugated diene. Alternatively, if the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, ozonolysis would give two ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substitution.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a substituted diene that, upon ozonolysis, forms a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's imagine product 3 is a diketone with a CH₂ group between two carbonyls. So, (CO)CH₂CH₂(CO). Then, the central CH₂ would have each proton adjacent to two others, but wait, no, the CH₂ is attached to two carbonyls. Each CH₂ proton would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂. Wait, but in this case, the central CH₂ would have protons that are next to two CH₂ groups. Each H would be split by two H's on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets. Because each H is next to two H's on one side and two H's on the other.

No, wait, that's not correct. The CH₂ in the middle would have each proton seeing two protons on each adjacent CH₂. So each proton would couple with four protons in total. That would lead to a quintet (pentet), but that's not one of the options. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the coupling.

Alternatively, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about it: each proton on CH₂ would be adjacent to two protons on one CH₂ and two on the other. So each H would have coupling with J1 and J2. So each H would split into a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but another way: each H on the central CH₂ is split by two H's on the left and two on the right. Each split would be a triplet, so the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

So the answer would be option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: think of the splitting as follows. Each proton on the CH₂ group has two neighboring Hs on one side and two on the other. So each H would couple with four Hs, but in reality, the coupling constants might be similar, leading to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of neighboring Hs. Each H is next to two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. So the splitting would be a doublet of doublets if each coupling is with two Hs, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet, but considering two different couplings, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group, leading to (n+1)(m+1) = (2+1)(2+1) = 9 peaks, which would be a triplet of triplets.

So the correct answer would be B) triplet of triplets.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with KOH, the product (1) is formed, which is identified as a ketone based on the IR spectrum showing a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR data for product 1 includes a signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl group. The other signals (2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H and 1.94 ppm for 2H) suggest a rigid adamantane-like structure.

In the next step, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a Lewis acid, to form product 2. This step likely facilitates the formation of a diene, as ozonolysis in the final step suggests the presence of a double bond in product 2.

Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange with the solvent. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is part of a methylene group (CH₂) flanked by two other CH₂ groups, each proton on the central CH₂ would couple with the two protons on each adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a triplet of triplets coupling pattern due to the interaction with two sets of two equivalent protons.

Given the options:

- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the proton coupled with only two equivalent protons.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This occurs when a proton couples with two sets of two equivalent protons, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This is less likely as it would require coupling with one set of two protons and another set of three protons, which is not consistent with the structure.
- **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the proton coupled with four equivalent protons, which is not supported by the structure.

The most consistent coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**, as described above.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid, four-ringed molecule. 

The first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I think that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably an E2 mechanism. Since the starting material is a dibromide, the elimination would form an alkene. Wait, but where would the double bond form? In adamantane, the structure is such that each bridgehead carbon can only have three bonds, so I think the double bond would form between the two bridgehead carbons. So, the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? No, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on carbons 1 and 3. So eliminating those would form a double bond between C1 and C3? But wait, in the structure of adamantane, the positions are such that the bridgehead carbons are connected in a way that adjacent bridgeheads are connected by a single bond. So, if you have Br on C1 and C3, eliminating HBr from those would form a double bond between C1 and C3. So the product would be 1,3-diene, but in adamantane, that might not be possible because of the structure. Or wait, perhaps the structure is such that after elimination, it becomes a bicyclic diene.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. I'm trying to remember, when vicinal dihalides eliminate, they form alkenes. So the product is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's 1,2-diene? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,3-cyclohexadiene? No, no, adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So elimination would form a bridged diene. But I'm not entirely sure.

But looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Wait, what does that tell me? The 4.79 ppm is probably a triplet of triplets or a quartet. But considering it's 2H, maybe it's an -OH group? Or perhaps an -OCH2O- group. Wait, but the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product after elimination with KOH might be an epoxide? No, wait, KOH is a base, not an acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diepoxide, but that doesn't align with the IR.

Wait, another possibility: elimination of the two bromides could form an alkene, but then the reaction conditions might be for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond, but then what would the structure be. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening, but I don't think so because it's a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH in a high temperature could form an epoxide. Because when dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes they form epoxides. Wait, no, that's when you have vicinal dihalides and a peracid. Wait, no, epoxidation usually requires a peracid. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing an elimination to form an alkene, but how would that lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How does that happen? Oh! Maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's more about carbocation shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl via a neighboring group participation. Wait, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a double dehydrohalogenation, but that would form an alkene. But the IR suggests a carbonyl. Hmm. Another possibility is that KOH is causing a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Each Br is on adjacent carbons? Or are they on the same bridgehead? Wait, in adamantane, the structure has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So the dihalide would have Br on each of those bridgehead carbons.

When heated with KOH, perhaps elimination occurs, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond between those bridgehead carbons. But in the adamantane structure, that would require that the bridgehead carbons form a double bond, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to the Bredt's rule. Oh wait, Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are not stable unless in certain structures, like bicyclo systems with enough flexibility. But adamantane is a rigid structure, so maybe that bridgehead double bond isn't possible. So perhaps the elimination isn't possible, but wait, the reaction did produce a product. So maybe the elimination doesn't occur, and another reaction happens.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a diol via hydrolysis. So, each Br is replaced by an -OH group. So the product would be 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's probably not it.

Hmm. Alternatively, could the dihalide react to form a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, via an elimination? But for that, we usually need a peracid. Alternatively, perhaps the diol could lose water to form an epoxide. But I'm not sure how that would happen with KOH.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a relatively high chemical shift, possibly an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide. Because in epoxides, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, depending on the substituents. So if it's an epoxide, the 4.79 ppm could be those two protons. But wait, wait, in epoxides, each CH₂ group would split into a quartet if adjacent to another CH₂, but if it's a smaller ring, like a three-membered ring, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is due to an -OCH2CH2O- group, but that doesn't fit with an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal. Wait, but where would that come from? Maybe the elimination forms a carbonyl, but then what.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, forming a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminates two HBr molecules, forming a conjugated diene. Wait, but that would require each Br to lose an H and form a double bond, so two double bonds? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Oh, like a dehydrohalogenation but forming a carbonyl.

Wait, when a geminal dihalide (two halogens on the same carbon) is treated with a base, it can eliminate to form a carbonyl. For example, RBr₂ → R=O with strong base. But in this case, the dihalide is vicinal, not geminal. So perhaps that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing the adamantane to undergo a ring-opening. But adamantane is quite stable and doesn't easily undergo ring-opening under normal conditions. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires a catalyst like AlCl3 and an acyl chloride, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is undergoing a nucleophilic substitution. But with KOH, perhaps it's more likely an elimination.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me proceed to the next step to see if that helps.

The second step: product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Then, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.

So the final step is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves double bonds and forms carbonyl groups. The work-up with dimethylsulfide (which is a reductive work-up) would break the ozonides into carbonyl compounds.

So for product 3, the NMR is the key. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

So, perhaps the structure of product 3 will have some protons that are split into a certain coupling pattern.

But let's try to backtrack. Let's go step by step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR at 1720 cm^-1).

IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone or an ester. But considering that KOH is a strong base and not introducing any ester groups, it's more likely a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the initial dihalide, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl. So, perhaps each elimination of HBr forms a double bond, but in this case, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene that could undergo some ring contraction or expansion. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide upon elimination (losing two HBr molecules) forms an alkyne. But 1720 cm^-1 is more indicative of a carbonyl than a triple bond (which would be around 2250 cm^-1).

So, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione? No, that would have two carbonyl groups, but maybe just one.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice (losing two HBr molecules), perhaps forming a conjugated diene. But then, under certain conditions, the diene could undergo a ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is not possible, so maybe the elimination forms a single carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: The NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H).

The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which probably corresponds to CH₂ groups in a rigid structure, like in adamantane. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH₂ group adjacent to something deshielded. The 4.79 (2H) is probably an oxygen-bearing group, like OCH₂O (epoxide) or an -OCH2- group.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So maybe the 4.79 ppm is not an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetal.

Wait, another thought. If the product is a diketone (but that would have two carbonyl peaks in IR), but the IR here shows a single peak at 1720. So it's more likely a single ketone.

So, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, but ends up with a ketone. How? Maybe via a conjugated diene that undergoes some cyclization or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, and each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but then the diol loses water to form a ketone. Wait, that would make sense. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diol (if KOH replaces Br with OH), but then under certain conditions, the diol could lose two water molecules to form a ketone. But wait, that would require the diol to have adjacent OH groups, but 1,3-diol on adamantane would have OH groups on bridgehead carbons, which are not adjacent. So that might not lead to a ketone.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is an elimination to form a carbonyl. Let me think about the structure again.

Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead carbon is connected to two adjacent bridgehead carbons and two other carbons. So, if each bridgehead has a Br, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl group in the middle.

Wait, wait, perhaps the dihalide loses two HBr molecules, and the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a H, leading to a carbonyl group. So, for example, if two adjacent carbons each lose H and Br, the two carbons would each form a double bond, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a [1,2]-elimination, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide, but then the IR doesn't align. Wait, but the IR has a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is an epoxide (with the 4.79 ppm) and a ketone elsewhere. That seems unlikely, unless the elimination forms both.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a lactone, but that would require an ester linkage, which isn't explained by the KOH reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms a ketone and an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. No, that wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a geminal diol, which then undergoes cyclization. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think about the IR. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. How does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, removing two HBr's and forming a double bond. But then, if the structure forms a conjugated diene, which is not possible due to bridgehead structure, or perhaps it forms a cyclopropane ring? No, that doesn't fit.

Another approach: Look at the NMR. Product 1 has 2H at 4.79. That's likely a methylene group attached to an oxygen. So perhaps it's an epoxide. Then, the 4.79 ppm would correspond to the two protons on the epoxide. But then, the IR doesn't show an epoxide peak (which is around 1250 cm^-1 for the C-O stretch), but it does have a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a mix of epoxide and ketone, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is not an epoxide. Maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to a methylene. Wait, but the carbonyl is at 1720, so that's a ketone.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The 2H at 4.79 is probably an -OCH2O- group. So maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit with the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with more than three members, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's think about what comes next. Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide (also known as Al(i-Pr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, commonly used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound or something that can undergo electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't aromatic. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then, using Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation.

But product 1 is a ketone, and if treated with Al(i-Pr)3, maybe it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, so product 1 must have an aromatic ring. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic ketone.

Wait, but how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane become aromatic? Adamantane is all single bonds, so maybe after elimination, it forms a bridgehead double bond, but that's not allowed. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't aromatic but undergoes some kind of cyclization with the Lewis acid.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but that would require an alcohol and acid anhydride, which isn't the case.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the IR peak. 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So it's definitely a ketone or maybe an ester. But since KOH is used, which is a base, an ester is unlikely, as that would require an acid. So it's more likely a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(i-Pr)3. Perhaps it's activating the ketone for some kind of substitution or acylation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and the Al(i-Pr)3 is causing a ring expansion or contraction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but again, the substrate would need an aromatic ring.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclohexenone derivative. Then, Al(i-Pr)3 could facilitate some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the Al(i-Pr)3 is acting as a base, dehydrating the ketone or something similar.

But I'm not making progress here. Let's try to think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3, and the question is about the NMR of product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. But if the diene is symmetric, the products would be the same. So, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and upon ozonolysis, it breaks into two smaller fragments, each with carbonyl groups.

Wait, but product 2 is formed after treatment with Al(i-Pr)3. So maybe product 1 is a ketone, and Al(i-Pr)3 is causing some kind of elimination to form a diene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and Al(i-Pr)3 is causing it to undergo a ring-opening or some elimination to form a diene, which is product 2. Then, ozonolysis would break the diene into smaller carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes a ring-opening to form a diene. Then ozonolysis would cleave that.

But without knowing the structure of product 1, it's hard to say. Let me try to think about the NMR of product 1 again.

The 4.79 ppm is 2H. Let me think of what groups have 2H around that region. An epoxide would have protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but they're typically split into a quartet or a triplet of triplets. But 4.79 is a bit high for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: Could it be an acetylenic proton? But acetylenic protons are usually around 2-3 ppm, and they're typically split into a singlet or a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, R-CO-CH2- something. The CH2 protons next to a ketone could be around 2.1 ppm, but 4.79 is higher. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the 4.79 ppm is a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an ether. Let's say OCH2CH2O, but that's a four-membered ring, which is less common than three-membered. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but then the IR doesn't have the expected C-O stretch.

Wait, the IR only shows a peak at 1720, which is strong, so perhaps the main functional group is the ketone. The 4.79 ppm could be the (CH2) group adjacent to the ketone. But then, why would that be at 4.79?

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is a coupling between two CH2 groups. Wait, but without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should move to the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a diene would form carbonyl groups. If product 3's NMR is being considered, the most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

For example, if a proton is next to a CH₂ group, it might be a quartet. But if it's next to a CH group that's split into multiple peaks, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or another complex pattern.

Wait, the question is asking for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (not those that exchange). So probably, the most deshielded is next to a carbonyl group.

If product 2 is a diene, say 1,3-pentadiene or something similar, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. For a symmetrical diene, the products would be two identical carbonyl compounds.

But let's think about a specific example. Suppose product 2 is something like 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes or ketones, depending on substitution. But wait, in reality, ozonolysis of a cyclohexadiene would give two carbonyl groups that are connected in some way.

Alternatively, product 2 might be a more complex diene, leading to a more complex product upon ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a substituted diene, such as 1,3-pentadiene derivative. Ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have protons adjacent to carbonyls.

In that case, the most deshielded protons would be those on the CH₂ groups next to the carbonyl. Each of these protons would couple with neighboring protons. For example, if a CH₂ is next to a carbonyl and another CH₂, each proton would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, if the carbonyl is at the end of a chain, the adjacent CH₂ would have each proton coupling with two others, leading to a triplet. But if there are two neighboring groups, like being between two CH₂ groups, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another example: if product 3 has a structure like (CH₂)₂(CO)₂, then the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyl would each have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet for each proton. But if the CH₂ is between two other CH₂ groups, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, consider a structure like (CH₂)₂-CO-R. The protons on the CH₂ next to CO would be split by the adjacent CH₂. Each proton would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent group is a CH group with multiple protons, the splitting could be more complex. For instance, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two protons, each proton on the CH₂ would couple with both, leading to a doublet of doublets, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, imagine a scenario where the most deshielded proton is on a CH group that's adjacent to two CH₂ groups. Then, each of these protons would couple with the two on each adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, the key is to identify the structure leading to the coupling pattern. Let's think about the options given:

Options:
A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

So, if the most deshielded proton is a methylene (CH₂) next to a carbonyl group, and adjacent to another CH₂, each of its protons would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂. So each proton would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. So option A would be a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent group is more complex, like a vinyl group or another CH₂ group, the splitting might be different.

Wait, another possibility: the most deshielded proton is on a CH group adjacent to two different CH₂ groups. Then, each proton would couple with two protons from each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets. That would be option B.

Alternatively, if the proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group and a CH group, the splitting could be more complex, perhaps a doublet of triplets (option C) or a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like CH₂-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CHO. The protons on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl (the first CH₂) would be next to another CH₂ group. Each proton on the first CH₂ would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, making option A correct.

But wait, if the structure is more like CH₂=CH-CO-..., then the protons on the CH₂ would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet. But that's in the presence of a double bond, which would have different coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a vinyl group, but that's not adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, another scenario: if the ozonolysis produces a diketone, such as O=C-R-C=O. Then, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be on the R group. If R is a CH₂, then each proton would be split by the two on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in a symmetrical diketone like R-CO-CO-R, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the ketones would be identical, and each would split into a triplet.

Alternatively, if R is a longer chain, the splitting could vary.

Wait, maybe a more concrete example would help. Suppose product 2 is a diene like 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two formaldehyde molecules, but that's in the case of a conjugated diene. Alternatively, if the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, ozonolysis would give two ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substitution.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a substituted diene that, upon ozonolysis, forms a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's imagine product 3 is a diketone with a CH₂ group between two carbonyls. So, (CO)CH₂CH₂(CO). Then, the central CH₂ would have each proton adjacent to two others, but wait, no, the CH₂ is attached to two carbonyls. Each CH₂ proton would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂. Wait, but in this case, the central CH₂ would have protons that are next to two CH₂ groups. Each H would be split by two H's on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets. Because each H is next to two H's on one side and two H's on the other.

No, wait, that's not correct. The CH₂ in the middle would have each proton seeing two protons on each adjacent CH₂. So each proton would couple with four protons in total. That would lead to a quintet (pentet), but that's not one of the options. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the coupling.

Alternatively, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about it: each proton on CH₂ would be adjacent to two protons on one CH₂ and two on the other. So each H would have coupling with J1 and J2. So each H would split into a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but another way: each H on the central CH₂ is split by two H's on the left and two on the right. Each split would be a triplet, so the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

So the answer would be option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: think of the splitting as follows. Each proton on the CH₂ group has two neighboring Hs on one side and two on the other. So each H would couple with four Hs, but in reality, the coupling constants might be similar, leading to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of neighboring Hs. Each H is next to two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. So the splitting would be a doublet of doublets if each coupling is with two Hs, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet, but considering two different couplings, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group, leading to (n+1)(m+1) = (2+1)(2+1) = 9 peaks, which would be a triplet of triplets.

So the correct answer would be B) triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with KOH, the product (1) is formed, which is identified as a ketone based on the IR spectrum showing a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR data for product 1 includes a signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl group. The other signals (2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H and 1.94 ppm for 2H) suggest a rigid adamantane-like structure.

In the next step, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a Lewis acid, to form product 2. This step likely facilitates the formation of a diene, as ozonolysis in the final step suggests the presence of a double bond in product 2.

Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange with the solvent. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is part of a methylene group (CH₂) flanked by two other CH₂ groups, each proton on the central CH₂ would couple with the two protons on each adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a triplet of triplets coupling pattern due to the interaction with two sets of two equivalent protons.

Given the options:

- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the proton coupled with only two equivalent protons.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This occurs when a proton couples with two sets of two equivalent protons, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This is less likely as it would require coupling with one set of two protons and another set of three protons, which is not consistent with the structure.
- **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the proton coupled with four equivalent protons, which is not supported by the structure.

The most consistent coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**, as described above.

Answer: B
