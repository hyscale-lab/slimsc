Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that seems like a mix of acids and a base.

Wait a minute, okay, so the first thing I should do is figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Because when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, right? Like, H+ ions from the acids will react with OH- ions from the base. So the key is to calculate which one is in excess after this neutralization.

Let me list out the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate moles of each component.
2. Find out the total H+ moles from the acids.
3. Find out the total OH- moles from the base.
4. Determine if there's excess H+ or OH-.
5. Calculate the concentration of the excess ions in the total solution volume.
6. Use that concentration to find the pH.

Okay, let's start with the moles.

First, for acetic acid (CH3COOH): It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but for calculating H+ here, I think I can just take the moles as contributing H+ because when mixed with HCl, which is a strong acid, the HCl will dominate, but wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, no, actually, when you mix all these solutions together, you first need to consider the reaction between H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2, then see what's left, and then maybe the acetic acid will contribute if there's any excess H+ or OH-.

Wait, wait. So the HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Let me double-check—yes, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it completely dissociates.

So, let me compute the moles of H+ and OH-.

For HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L, and 0.2 M. So moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Each HCl molecule gives 1 H+ ion, so 0.08 moles H+.

For Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Then, the acetic acid contributes H+ as a weak acid. But wait, when we mix it with HCl and Ba(OH)2, the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react first. Let me think. So, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. So, when they react, H+ + OH- → H2O. So 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-.

So, after the reaction, how much OH- is left? 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait a second. The total volume is the sum of all the solutions, right? So total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Wait, but first, the neutralization of H+ and OH- will leave us with excess OH- in the solution. Because OH- is 0.18, H+ is 0.08. So, OH- is in excess by 0.10 moles.

So, the excess OH- will determine the pH. So, the concentration of OH- is 0.10 moles in 1.2 L.

Wait, but wait—also, what about the acetic acid? Because if there's excess OH- (as in, the solution is basic), the acetic acid is a weak acid and would react with OH- as well. Because in acidic solution, the OH- would react with the H+ from acetic acid.

Hmm, but wait, in this case, after HCl and Ba(OH)2 have reacted, there's excess OH-. So, I think the OH- would react with the acetic acid. Because acetic acid is a weak acid, it can donate H+.

Wait, in a basic solution, the acetic acid (CH3COOH) would dissociate more because of the common ion effect. But wait, when OH- is present, it can deprotonate the acetic acid. So, the OH- would react with CH3COOH, but wait, does that make sense?

Wait a second, another approach. Let's think of all the H+ and OH- in the solution, including the contributions from the weak acid.

But perhaps it's better to consider the net reaction first.

So, the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react completely, leaving some OH-.

But then, the acetic acid will donate some H+.

Wait, maybe I should model the neutralization step by step.

Step 1: H+ from HCl (0.08) and OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18) react. The H+ is in smaller quantity, so it all reacts, leaving 0.10 moles OH-.

But then, the OH- will also react with any available H+ from other sources. The other source is CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. So, when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, how much OH- is left after this reaction?

We have 0.10 moles OH- initially.

The OH- will react with CH3COOH. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 moles (from earlier). So, the OH- can take 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and convert them to acetate ions and water.

So, after this reaction, the OH- would have been consumed by 0.05 moles, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. Each mole of OH- can react with one mole of CH3COOH. So, we have 0.10 moles OH- and 0.05 moles CH3COOH.

So, OH- will take all the CH3COOH, converting it to acetate. So, the OH- is reduced by 0.05, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

So now, the solution has 0.05 moles OH-.

But wait, did I miss anything? Let's see.

So, initial H+ from HCl: 0.08

Initial OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18

They react, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, OH- (0.10) + CH3COOH (0.05) → 0.05 OH- left, and 0.05 CH3COO^-.

Wait, but now, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- left, and some acetate ions.

Wait, but what about the other ions? So, the total volume is 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, the pOH is -log(0.04167). Let me calculate that.

Log(0.04167) is log(4.167e-2). Log(4.167)= about 0.62, so 0.62 - 2 = -1.38? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.04167 is 4.167 × 10^-2. So, the log is log(4.167) + log(10^-2) = 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is 1.38.

Wait, pOH is -log[OH-], so 0.04167 → pOH ≈ 1.38. Then pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that's option A. But wait, I think I made a mistake. Because after the neutralization with acetic acid, any excess OH- would determine the pH. But let me recheck.

Wait, let me recalculate the steps:

1. Moles H+ from HCl: 0.4 L × 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+.

2. Moles OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

3. H+ + OH- → H2O. So, 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-.

4. Now, the solution has 0.10 mol OH- and 0.05 mol CH3COOH.

5. CH3COOH (weak acid) can donate H+; OH- will take H+ from it.

Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, 0.05 mol CH3COOH will react with 0.05 mol OH-.

After reaction:

- OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

- CH3COO^-: 0.05 mol.

So, the solution now has 0.05 mol OH- and the rest is from CH3COO^-.

Wait, but the OH- is a strong base, so it will dominate the solution's pH. So, the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

But wait, another thought: could the acetic acid affect the pH in another way? Because after some OH- reacts with it, the remaining solution is a buffered solution of acetate ions and possibly some undissociated acetic acid. But in this case, all the CH3COOH has been converted into acetate because the OH- was sufficient to deprotonate all of it.

Wait, but wait—after step 4, we have 0.05 moles of OH- left. But the solution also has 0.05 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-), which is the conjugate base of a weak acid. So, in a solution where the acetate ion is present along with OH-, would that have any effect?

Hmm, perhaps not, because the OH- is a strong base and will dominate the pH. So the pH will be determined by the excess OH-.

Wait, but let me think again. The presence of acetate ions could affect the solution's pH if there's any H+ from the water. But in this case, the solution is strongly basic because of the excess OH-, so the acetate is the conjugate base and doesn't contribute much H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution of acetate and some OH-. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the reaction more thoroughly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact concentration of H+ and OH- in the solution, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as a strong base solution, where the OH- concentration is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L, so [OH-] = 0.04167 M, pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62.

But wait, let me think again about the steps. So, initial H+ from HCl is 0.08, OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18. They neutralize each other, leaving 0.10 OH-. Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), so 0.05 moles OH- react, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, giving [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = log(0.04167) = ?

Wait, let me compute that accurately. Let's compute log(0.04167).

I know that log(4) is about 0.602, and log(4.167) is approximately 0.62. So, 0.04167 is 4.167e-2.

So, log(4.167e-2) = log(4.167) + log(1e-2) = 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is 1.38, pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So that's option A: 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix these solutions, do you have to consider the dilution of each component? Because each component is added to the total volume. So, when you mix 500 mL, 400 mL, and 300 mL, the total is 1200 mL, or 1.2 L. So, yes, when calculating concentrations after mixing, you use 1.2 L.

So, all the steps I did account for the total volume. So, the initial moles are correct, and the final concentration calculations are correct.

But wait, another thought: Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So, 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 gives 0.6 M OH- in its solution. But when you mix it, the OH- concentration is spread over the total volume.

But in the earlier steps, I accounted for the moles correctly, so that's fine.

Hmm, so I think the calculation is correct, and the answer is option A, 12.62.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases in the mixture. The solution contains 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **H⁺ from HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **CH₃COOH:**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Neutralization between H⁺ and OH⁻:**  
   The \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) from HCl reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)₂, leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) in excess.

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**  
   The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH, which is a weak acid. Each mole of OH⁻ reacts with one mole of CH₃COOH:
   \[
   \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
   \]
   Since there are \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \), it reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \), leaving:
   \[
   0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^-.
   \]

4. **Determine the concentration of OH⁻:**  
   The total volume of the solution is:
   \[
   500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
   \]
   The concentration of OH⁻ is:
   \[
   [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Calculate pOH and pH:**  
   The pOH is:
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(0.04167)} \approx 1.38.
   \]
   The pH is:
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
   \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that seems like a mix of acids and a base.

Wait a minute, okay, so the first thing I should do is figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Because when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, right? Like, H+ ions from the acids will react with OH- ions from the base. So the key is to calculate which one is in excess after this neutralization.

Let me list out the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate moles of each component.
2. Find out the total H+ moles from the acids.
3. Find out the total OH- moles from the base.
4. Determine if there's excess H+ or OH-.
5. Calculate the concentration of the excess ions in the total solution volume.
6. Use that concentration to find the pH.

Okay, let's start with the moles.

First, for acetic acid (CH3COOH): It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but for calculating H+ here, I think I can just take the moles as contributing H+ because when mixed with HCl, which is a strong acid, the HCl will dominate, but wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, no, actually, when you mix all these solutions together, you first need to consider the reaction between H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2, then see what's left, and then maybe the acetic acid will contribute if there's any excess H+ or OH-.

Wait, wait. So the HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Let me double-check—yes, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it completely dissociates.

So, let me compute the moles of H+ and OH-.

For HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L, and 0.2 M. So moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Each HCl molecule gives 1 H+ ion, so 0.08 moles H+.

For Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Then, the acetic acid contributes H+ as a weak acid. But wait, when we mix it with HCl and Ba(OH)2, the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react first. Let me think. So, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. So, when they react, H+ + OH- → H2O. So 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-.

So, after the reaction, how much OH- is left? 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait a second. The total volume is the sum of all the solutions, right? So total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Wait, but first, the neutralization of H+ and OH- will leave us with excess OH- in the solution. Because OH- is 0.18, H+ is 0.08. So, OH- is in excess by 0.10 moles.

So, the excess OH- will determine the pH. So, the concentration of OH- is 0.10 moles in 1.2 L.

Wait, but wait—also, what about the acetic acid? Because if there's excess OH- (as in, the solution is basic), the acetic acid is a weak acid and would react with OH- as well. Because in acidic solution, the OH- would react with the H+ from acetic acid.

Hmm, but wait, in this case, after HCl and Ba(OH)2 have reacted, there's excess OH-. So, I think the OH- would react with the acetic acid. Because acetic acid is a weak acid, it can donate H+.

Wait, in a basic solution, the acetic acid (CH3COOH) would dissociate more because of the common ion effect. But wait, when OH- is present, it can deprotonate the acetic acid. So, the OH- would react with CH3COOH, but wait, does that make sense?

Wait a second, another approach. Let's think of all the H+ and OH- in the solution, including the contributions from the weak acid.

But perhaps it's better to consider the net reaction first.

So, the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react completely, leaving some OH-.

But then, the acetic acid will donate some H+.

Wait, maybe I should model the neutralization step by step.

Step 1: H+ from HCl (0.08) and OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18) react. The H+ is in smaller quantity, so it all reacts, leaving 0.10 moles OH-.

But then, the OH- will also react with any available H+ from other sources. The other source is CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. So, when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, how much OH- is left after this reaction?

We have 0.10 moles OH- initially.

The OH- will react with CH3COOH. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 moles (from earlier). So, the OH- can take 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and convert them to acetate ions and water.

So, after this reaction, the OH- would have been consumed by 0.05 moles, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. Each mole of OH- can react with one mole of CH3COOH. So, we have 0.10 moles OH- and 0.05 moles CH3COOH.

So, OH- will take all the CH3COOH, converting it to acetate. So, the OH- is reduced by 0.05, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

So now, the solution has 0.05 moles OH-.

But wait, did I miss anything? Let's see.

So, initial H+ from HCl: 0.08

Initial OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18

They react, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, OH- (0.10) + CH3COOH (0.05) → 0.05 OH- left, and 0.05 CH3COO^-.

Wait, but now, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- left, and some acetate ions.

Wait, but what about the other ions? So, the total volume is 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, the pOH is -log(0.04167). Let me calculate that.

Log(0.04167) is log(4.167e-2). Log(4.167)= about 0.62, so 0.62 - 2 = -1.38? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.04167 is 4.167 × 10^-2. So, the log is log(4.167) + log(10^-2) = 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is 1.38.

Wait, pOH is -log[OH-], so 0.04167 → pOH ≈ 1.38. Then pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that's option A. But wait, I think I made a mistake. Because after the neutralization with acetic acid, any excess OH- would determine the pH. But let me recheck.

Wait, let me recalculate the steps:

1. Moles H+ from HCl: 0.4 L × 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+.

2. Moles OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

3. H+ + OH- → H2O. So, 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-.

4. Now, the solution has 0.10 mol OH- and 0.05 mol CH3COOH.

5. CH3COOH (weak acid) can donate H+; OH- will take H+ from it.

Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, 0.05 mol CH3COOH will react with 0.05 mol OH-.

After reaction:

- OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

- CH3COO^-: 0.05 mol.

So, the solution now has 0.05 mol OH- and the rest is from CH3COO^-.

Wait, but the OH- is a strong base, so it will dominate the solution's pH. So, the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

But wait, another thought: could the acetic acid affect the pH in another way? Because after some OH- reacts with it, the remaining solution is a buffered solution of acetate ions and possibly some undissociated acetic acid. But in this case, all the CH3COOH has been converted into acetate because the OH- was sufficient to deprotonate all of it.

Wait, but wait—after step 4, we have 0.05 moles of OH- left. But the solution also has 0.05 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-), which is the conjugate base of a weak acid. So, in a solution where the acetate ion is present along with OH-, would that have any effect?

Hmm, perhaps not, because the OH- is a strong base and will dominate the pH. So the pH will be determined by the excess OH-.

Wait, but let me think again. The presence of acetate ions could affect the solution's pH if there's any H+ from the water. But in this case, the solution is strongly basic because of the excess OH-, so the acetate is the conjugate base and doesn't contribute much H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution of acetate and some OH-. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the reaction more thoroughly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact concentration of H+ and OH- in the solution, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as a strong base solution, where the OH- concentration is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L, so [OH-] = 0.04167 M, pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62.

But wait, let me think again about the steps. So, initial H+ from HCl is 0.08, OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18. They neutralize each other, leaving 0.10 OH-. Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), so 0.05 moles OH- react, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, giving [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = log(0.04167) = ?

Wait, let me compute that accurately. Let's compute log(0.04167).

I know that log(4) is about 0.602, and log(4.167) is approximately 0.62. So, 0.04167 is 4.167e-2.

So, log(4.167e-2) = log(4.167) + log(1e-2) = 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is 1.38, pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So that's option A: 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix these solutions, do you have to consider the dilution of each component? Because each component is added to the total volume. So, when you mix 500 mL, 400 mL, and 300 mL, the total is 1200 mL, or 1.2 L. So, yes, when calculating concentrations after mixing, you use 1.2 L.

So, all the steps I did account for the total volume. So, the initial moles are correct, and the final concentration calculations are correct.

But wait, another thought: Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So, 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 gives 0.6 M OH- in its solution. But when you mix it, the OH- concentration is spread over the total volume.

But in the earlier steps, I accounted for the moles correctly, so that's fine.

Hmm, so I think the calculation is correct, and the answer is option A, 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases in the mixture. The solution contains 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **H⁺ from HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **CH₃COOH:**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Neutralization between H⁺ and OH⁻:**  
   The \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) from HCl reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)₂, leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) in excess.

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**  
   The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH, which is a weak acid. Each mole of OH⁻ reacts with one mole of CH₃COOH:
   \[
   \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
   \]
   Since there are \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \), it reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \), leaving:
   \[
   0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^-.
   \]

4. **Determine the concentration of OH⁻:**  
   The total volume of the solution is:
   \[
   500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
   \]
   The concentration of OH⁻ is:
   \[
   [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Calculate pOH and pH:**  
   The pOH is:
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(0.04167)} \approx 1.38.
   \]
   The pH is:
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
   \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
