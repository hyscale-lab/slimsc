Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, let me understand the terms here. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. Constitutional isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms, like how the bonds are made. Stereoisomers, on the other hand, have the same arrangement but differ in the 3D arrangement—like geometric isomerism or optical isomerism (which is about chirality, I think).

Now, the compounds in question are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A. The others are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate for part B.

Starting with part A: which doesn't show tautomerism. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between structures with the movement of hydrogen and electrons, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For example, in a carbonyl compound, an alpha hydrogen can move, leading to an enol form.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, no—benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone (oxygen) groups attached. But wait, benzoquinone actually has two double bonds, right? Because quinones are cyclic with two ketone groups. So the structure is cyclic with two keto groups. So, does it have any alpha hydrogens? Because for tautomerism, a compound needs alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl group. If the carbonyl is part of a ring, like in benzene, maybe the hydrogens are not alpha. Wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, but in a ring. So, I'm not sure if there are any alpha hydrogens. Oh wait, the carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So, if the carbon next to the carbonyl is part of the ring, maybe there are no hydrogens attached to that carbon. Because in benzene rings, the carbons are bonded to each other, not to hydrogens. So, no alpha hydrogens—so no possibility for tautomerism. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Then, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Each ketone is on a carbon, so the carbons adjacent to each carbonyl would be the ones next in the ring. Those carbons would have two other ring bonds and maybe a hydrogen. So each of these positions would have an alpha hydrogen. So, the compound would have alpha hydrogens, so it can undergo tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait: if the ring has three ketone groups, are the adjacent carbons each bearing a hydrogen? So like, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have each of those carbonyl groups. The adjacent carbons (like 2,4,6 positions) would be CH2 groups? Or wait, no. Let me think about the structure. Each carbonyl is at C1, C3, C5. The ring is six-membered. So each of those carbons is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (like C2 adjacent to C1) would have two ring bonds, so CH2 groups. So yes, each of those positions would have two hydrogens. So, the alpha hydrogens (on C2, C4, C6) are present, so the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

So part A: the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A = benzoquinone.

Wait, but I thought benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. No, wait, in benzoquinone, each keto group is on a benzene ring. So the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, which are sp² hybridized. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are each connected to two other benzene carbons and an oxygen? No, wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H3-C(=O)-C6H4? No, wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in the ring, each as ketones. Wait, no, the structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in positions 1 and 4, making it a 1,4-benzoquinone, for example. Each oxygen is double-bonded to the ring. So the carbons next to the carbonyl are part of the ring, and each of those carbons is connected to two other ring carbons and a hydrogen? Or are they all part of the conjugated ring, so perhaps without any hydrogen on the adjacent carbons?

Wait, no. In a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen if it's not part of a substituent. Wait, if a benzene ring has two oxygen substituents in the 1 and 4 positions, then each of those carbons is doubly bonded to O, and the adjacent carbons (2 and 3 for the first O, and 5 and 6 for the second O) would each have a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me think. For benzene, each substituent is attached to a carbon. So in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4-C(=O)-. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two double bonds to O. So each of the carbonyl groups is in the ring. So, each of those carbons (C1 and C4) is double-bonded to O, and their adjacent carbons (C2 and C6 for C1; C3 and C5 for C4) are each connected to another ring carbon. So, for C2: it's connected to C1 (double-bonded to O), C3, and maybe a hydrogen. So, in that case, C2 would have a hydrogen. So, if there's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, then it can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but in the case of benzene rings, the adjacent carbons (like C2) are part of the aromatic ring, so they are sp² hybridized. So, the C2 would have one hydrogen, right? Because in benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen except where substituents are attached. So, in 1,4-benzoquinone, each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (C2, C3, C5, C6) would have a hydrogen. Wait, but wait, in the case of a carbonyl group in a ring, is the adjacent carbon part of the ring with a hydrogen?

Wait, let me think of cyclohexanone. It's a six-membered ring with one ketone group. The adjacent carbons (like C2) would each have two hydrogens because they are CH2 groups. But for a benzene ring, each carbon is CH in the parent compound. So, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So the adjacent carbons would be CH, each with one hydrogen.

So, if the carbonyl is at C1, then C2 is CH, adjacent to C1's carbonyl. So, the C2 has a hydrogen. Therefore, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens (on C2, C3, etc.), so it can undergo tautomerism. But wait, wait—tautomerism usually involves the movement of a hydrogen from an alpha carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, forming an enol. But in the case of a conjugated system like a benzene ring, does this movement lead to a different structure? Because in aromatic compounds, the enol form might be resonance-stabilized and not a distinct tautomer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should think about specific examples. For example, para-benzoquinone. Does it exhibit keto-enol tautomerism? I think that aromatic compounds can sometimes delocalize the electrons, so the enol form might be a resonance structure rather than a distinct tautomer. So maybe the tautomerism isn't observed as a separate form because the enol form is just part of the resonance structure of the molecule. So in that case, benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because the enol form is not a distinct structure.

Alternatively, if the compound can form a different structure upon tautomerism, then it does show it. But for benzoquinone, perhaps the enol form is just a resonance structure, so it doesn't count as a distinct tautomer. So in that case, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the enol form is not a separate molecule or a different isomer but part of the same resonance structure.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Each adjacent carbon (like the 2,4,6 positions) would have two hydrogens (since they're CH2 groups). So, when a hydrogen moves from the alpha carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, the enol form is formed. So, this compound can undergo tautomerism because the enol form is a distinct structure from the keto form.

Therefore, for part A, the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A is benzoquinone.

Now, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's figure out its structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)COHCOOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, wait: carboxylic acid is RCOOH. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but that's not right. Let me correct: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are CH3-CH2-COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, right?

So when it's esterified with methanol, the -OH on the carboxylic acid becomes OMe. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, wait: the carboxylic acid is at the end. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Looking at the carbon chain: the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2. Wait, no, let me number the carbons. The carboxylic acid is on C3. So, 2-hydroxy would be on C2. So the structure is:

C1: CH3 (from CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is:

O
|
O-C-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOH group.
Carbon 2: CH2.
Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? That can't be right. No, the correct structure is CH3CH2COOH, which is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3?

No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, that's butanoic acid. Wait, no. Propanoic acid: the formula is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Let me get this right. Propanoic acid has three carbons, right? So it's CH2CH2COOH? No, that's four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, correct structure: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, that's butanoic acid. Wait, no, butanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, no, wait. No, wait: the formula for propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the chain is:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH3

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it becomes methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, looking at the central carbon (carbon 2, which is CH2 in the acid): in the ester, it's CH(OH) attached to what? Wait, in the ester, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3. So carbon 2 (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to a CH2 group on one side and a COOCH3 group on the other. Wait, no: carbon 2 is connected to:

- carbon 1: which is CH2OH
- carbon 3: the COOCH3 group
- and two CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. It's an ester, so it's formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-OH?

No, wait. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, looking at the molecule, the central carbon (the second carbon) has:

- one bond to the hydroxyl (OH)
- one bond to the adjacent CH2
- one bond to the carbonyl group (COOCH3)
- and one bond to another CH2?

Wait, no, how many substituents does that carbon have? Let me number the carbons in the ester:

1: COOCH3 group (the carbonyl)
2: the carbon attached to COOCH3 and CH2OH
Wait, no. Structure:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2OH

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 group, which is attached to an OH.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, carbon 2 (the one in the middle) is connected to:

- carbon 1: CH2(OH)
- carbon 3: CH2COOCH3
- two hydrogens?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with the CH2) is connected to:

- one CH2(OH) group
- one CH2-CO-OCH3 group
- and two hydrogens.

So, the central carbon is CH2. Wait, so it's CH2 connected to CH2(OH), CH2(CO-OCH3), and two H's. So it's a CH2 group, meaning it has two H's. So, the central C is CH2, so it's not a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not have a chiral center, so it can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: maybe the ester group is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Maybe it's CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, that would be a different structure. No, wait, the formula of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is C3H6O3? No, wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is C3H6O3? Maybe not. Let me compute: propanoic acid is C3H6O2. Adding an OH would make it C3H8O3. Wait, methyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3, so the formula becomes C4H8O3.

But perhaps that's getting me away from the main point. The key is whether there's a chiral center. So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

The central CH2 group is attached to:

- One CH2(OH)
- One CH2-CO-OCH3
- Two H's.

So, four substituents: CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, H, H. So two H's are same, so the substituents are not all different. Therefore, the central carbon is not a chiral center. So, the compound is not chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Next, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid has the structure HO2CCH=CHCO2H, while maleic acid has HO2C(C)=C(COOH)2, but arranged differently. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, and maleic is cis.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Or more accurately, the structure is (Z)- or (E)-? Wait, fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
C=C
    /
COOCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, can this molecule exhibit optical isomerism? For that, it needs a chiral center. But wait, the molecule itself is symmetric. Let me think: if the double bond is symmetric, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think of dimethyl fumarate: the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. Wait, no: fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, but in the trans configuration. So the diester would be OCH2CH2O(COOCH3) connected by a double bond? No, wait, perhaps it's (E)-butenedioic acid, which becomes (E)-butenedioate when esterified.

So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)CH2CH2C(O)OCH3? No, wait, the double bond is between the two carbons bearing the ester groups. So, maybe it's O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH group, which is connected via a double bond to another CH group attached to O=C-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - C = C - O-C-OCH3
|
O

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively:

The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on each end of the double bond.

Wait, no: fumaric acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, so when esterified, it becomes OCH2CH2O(COOCH3) across a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each attached to a COOCH3 group.

But in that case, the molecule is symmetric because each end is the same. So, if the molecule is symmetric, does it have any chiral centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups.

Wait, but wait: in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not correct because the double bond would be between the two CH2 groups, each bearing a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, CH2-C double bond C-CH2, each attached to O-C-OCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, that can't be, because double bonds can't be between two CH2 groups, as that would make it CH2-CH2, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the correct structure is:

Each of the two middle carbons (connected by a double bond) has a COOCH3 group attached.

So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that's not right because each CH would have two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. Alternatively, each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group. Wait, no, that would make it CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of dimethyl fumarate as the diester of fumaric acid. So, fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, which has the structure HO2CCH=CHCO2H. The diester would replace both -OH groups with OCH3, so it becomes OCH2CH=CHCO2OCH3? No, wait, more accurately:

Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH in trans? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, where the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans).

So, the diester dimethyl fumarate would be (MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me), with the double bond in the trans configuration.

So, looking at the structure:

The molecule has a central double bond, with each of the two carbons in the double bond attached to a COOCH3 group. So, each of those carbons has two substituents: COOCH3 and the other part of the double bond.

But wait, each of those carbons is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group
- The double bond (so one bond to another carbon)
- And perhaps a hydrogen or a methyl group?

Wait, no, in the structure of fumarate, the two carbons of the double bond each have a COOCH3 group attached. So, each of those carbons is bonded to:

Carbon 1: COOCH3, double bond to Carbon 2, and two other substituents?

Wait, no. Wait, in the structure of fumaric acid, it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So each of the CH groups in the double bond is attached to a COOH group. When esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is OCH2C(=O)OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, structure would be:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Each C in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no, because that would require each C to have two substituents besides the double bond, but each C in a double bond has two substituents. So, in this case, each C in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 from the other side? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each C in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond instead of a single bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Wait, that can't be right because each CH has only two substituents. Each of those carbons is double-bonded to each other, so they have two substituents each: COOCH3 and the other CH.

Wait, but in that case, each of those carbons is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and the two bonds in the double bond. That's not possible because each carbon in a double bond has two other substituents. So, if each is bonded to a COOCH3 group and another substituent, perhaps it's arranged such that each has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. But that might not be right.

I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let's approach it from another angle. Does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? For a molecule to have a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four different groups.

In dimethyl fumarate, the central double bond is between two carbons, each attached to a COOCH3 group and perhaps another group. If those carbons are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen, that would make each have two identical substituents, so the carbon wouldn't be chiral.

Wait, but if the structure is such that each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group attached, then each would have two identical substituents, so no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, what about the possibility of geometric isomerism? Well, that's not about optical isomers, but about E and Z isomerism.

But the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chiral centers. So, if a compound has a chiral center, it can show optical isomerism.

Wait, so in dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? Let's look again. If the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But each carbon in the double bond is attached to two substituents: COOCH3 and another group.

Wait, if each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, then maybe not. Alternatively, if each carbon is bonded to COOCH3 and a CH3 group, but that probably isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because the molecule is symmetric. So, in that case, it doesn't show optical isomerism. But wait, that can't be right because I thought maleic anhydride can form chiral derivatives, but fumarate is the trans isomer.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of fumaric acid. So, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, each of those carbons has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each carbon is connected to COOCH3, H, and the two bonds in the double bond. Wait, that can't be right because each carbon in the double bond has two substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each carbon is connected to COOCH3 and another substituent. Let me try to imagine the structure:

The molecule is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two central CH2 groups. So, it's CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, each of the central carbons is attached to COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. But that doesn't fit the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each of the double-bonded carbons has two COOCH3 groups attached. But that would make each carbon have two same substituents, so no chiral center.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? If yes, then it can't be chiral because a plane of symmetry would mean it's superimposable on its mirror image.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a central double bond with two ester groups on opposite ends. So, the structure would be symmetric. If you draw a plane through the double bond, each side mirrors the other. So, the molecule is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetric, it can't have a chiral center. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought that maleic anhydride can form chiral derivatives, but fumarate is the trans isomer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl maleate would have a chiral center because of the cis arrangement, but fumarate is trans and symmetric. So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate is symmetric and doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. If the molecule is symmetric, then it can't be chiral. So, for example, something like meso-tartaric acid is symmetric and therefore not chiral, despite having stereogenic centers.

So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. So, even though each of the double-bonded carbons has two substituents, the overall molecule is symmetric. Therefore, it doesn't have any optical isomerism.

But wait, the question is about dimethyl fumarate. So, if it doesn't have any chiral centers, then it doesn't show optical isomerism. So, among the two compounds, which one shows optical isomerism?

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, that can't be right because one of them must show optical isomerism. Did I make a mistake in my analysis?

Alternatively, perhaps I got it wrong and dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the structure again. Let me think of the structure of dimethyl fumarate as (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but no, that can't be because that would imply single bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. But that would mean each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each of those carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group (which is connected to the other double-bonded C)
- and maybe a hydrogen.

But in that case, each carbon would have:

- COOCH3
- two CH2 groups (one on each side?)
Wait, no, for each double-bonded C:

C1: bonded to COOCH3, double-bonded to C2, and two H's (since it's CH2).

C2: bonded to COOCH3, double-bonded to C1, and two H's.

So, each of those carbons is CH2, so they have two H's. So, each has substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond. So, each carbon is attached to two H's, a COOCH3, and a double bond.

Wait, but in that case, each C is CH2, not a stereocenter. So, no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. If it has two stereogenic centers but is superimposable on its mirror image due to a plane of symmetry, then it won't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's reevaluate that.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- two H's.

So, substituents are: CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, H, H. Since two substituents are the same (H), the carbon isn't a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate. If it's symmetric, it can't have a chiral center. So, neither of them shows optical isomerism? But that can't be right because the options given have one of them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think of another approach. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate actually has a chiral center.

Wait, wait. Let me draw the structure again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to:

- one CH2(OH) group
- one CH2COOCH3 group
- two H's.

So, substituents are:

1. CH2(OH)
2. CH2COOCH3
3. H
4. H

So two substituents are the same (H). Therefore, the central carbon isn't a chiral center.

Wait, but what if the structure is different? For example, if the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group. Let me think: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- COOCH3
- OH
- CH3
- and another substituent.

Wait, that would make it a chiral center. So, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another substituent.

Wait, but then what's the fourth substituent? The structure would be:

(CH3)-(C(OH)-COOCH3)-something. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2. So, substituents are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, two H's. Not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I had the wrong structure. Another possibility is that the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group. So, the structure is CH2COOCH3 attached to a CH(OH)CH3 group. That would make the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) attached to:

- CH2COOCH3
- CH3
- OH
- and another substituent.

Wait, that would require the structure to be CH2COOCH3 attached to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So, the structure would be CH2COOCH3-CH(OH)CH3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense for 2-hydroxypropanoate. Because propanoate has three carbons: COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another substituent, which would be a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because that would be four substituents, making it a chiral center. So, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, that can't be because it's propanoate. Let me count the carbons. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: three carbons, with hydroxyl on C2.

So, the structure is:

Carboxylic acid group: COOH
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

So, when esterified, it becomes:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another substituent, which is a CH2 group?

Wait, no, because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, C2 (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and a single bond to another carbon (C1?), but that would require four substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3

So, the central carbon (C2) has:

- CH3 (from C3)
- OH (on C2)
- COOCH3 (from C1)
- and a single bond to C1, which is the COOCH3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because C1 is the carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group.

So, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the substituents on C2.

In the correct structure, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from C3)
2. OH
3. COOCH3 (from C1)
4. another CH group, which is part of the chain.

Wait, no, that can't be. Another approach: for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH3? Wait, that would make it (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, which isn't the case for 2-hydroxypropanoate.

This is getting really confusing. Maybe I should just accept that I'm stuck and try to think of known compounds. Dimethyl fumarate is known to have geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism because it's symmetric. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, on the other hand, if it has a chiral center, would show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center because the central carbon isn't attached to four different groups. But if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is attached to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's attached to four different groups.

Wait, in the correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3 (from C3)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from C1)
- and a single bond to C1, which is part of the COOCH3 group. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
    |
CH2-C-OH
    |
CH3

In this case, the central C (C2) is connected to:

- COOCH3
- OH
- CH2CH3 (from C3)
Wait, no, because propanoate has three carbons.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me think: which of the two compounds has a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the central carbon is attached to four different groups, then yes. If not, no.

Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral center because symmetric.

So, if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, then it shows optical isomerism. Otherwise, dimethyl fumarate would be the one.

But earlier I thought methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's central carbon isn't a chiral center, so dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. Perhaps the methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups.

Structure: CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central C (C2) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from C3)
2. OH
3. COOCH3 (from C1)
4. CH2 group (from C1), which is connected to another CH3. Wait, no, the C1 is the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH2CH3

No, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate. I'm getting myself in circles.

Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the central C (C2) is CH2. So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, two H's. So, not a chiral center.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

So, among the options, which compound shows optical isomerism? Well, if neither does, but the question says one of them does, perhaps I'm wrong about one of them.

Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate can have a chiral center due to the arrangement of substituents around the double bond. But I thought it was symmetric.

Another approach: think about the possibility of fumarate being a meso compound. If it has two stereogenic centers but a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

But in dimethyl fumarate, the two carbons in the double bond each have a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, each C is CH, attached to COOCH3 and H. So, each C could potentially be a chiral center if they have four different substituents. But in this case, each C has COOCH3, H, and two substituents from the double bond.

Wait, each C in the double bond is attached to:

- COOCH3
- H
- double bond to the other C.

Wait, but each C in a double bond is connected to two other carbons via double bonds, so each has two substituents besides the double bond. So, perhaps each C is attached to COOCH3, H, and two more substituents, making four in total.

But I'm getting stuck again. Maybe it's time to consider that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so the correct answer is that neither shows optical isomerism, but that can't be because the options have one.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again. The options are:

A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

Wait, no, looking at the options, option D says A is benzoquinone and B is dimethyl fumarate. Let me look at the options:

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So, the question is which option correctly pairs A and B.

As per our analysis, A is benzoquinone (which doesn't show tautomerism), and B is dimethyl fumarate (which doesn't show optical isomerism? But that can't be right because the options must have one of them showing it).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not right. Alternatively, it's (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond instead of a single bond.

Wait, if the structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each C is connected to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group
- H (if any)
- and the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons is CH, so each has a hydrogen. So substituents for each C would be:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group (with another substituent)
- H
- and the double bond.

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each C is attached to COOCH3 and two CH2 groups, making them CH2 groups, which can't be chiral.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think about other possibilities. Perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center because the two substituents on each double-bonded carbon are different.

Wait, if the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible because each C would have two COOCH3 groups, making them not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that one C is attached to COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and the other C is attached to COOCH3 and a CH3 group. But that would require the molecule to have substituents that aren't symmetric, leading to a chiral center.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Since the options pair A as either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and B as either methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate.

From earlier analysis, A is benzoquinone because it doesn't show tautomerism. So, looking at the options, options B and D have A as benzoquinone.

Now, for part B, which shows optical isomerism.

If dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, then methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate must have one. But earlier analysis suggested it doesn't. Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Then the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH3 (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, no, that would be (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, which would have a chiral center. So, in that case, the central C has four different groups: two methyl groups? No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Then, the central C (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH (from C3? No, C3 is CH3).

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons:

C1: COOCH3
C2: CH(OH)
C3: CH3

So, C2 is connected to:

- C1: COOCH3
- OH
- C3: CH3
- and another bond to where? To C2's own structure.

Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and has two more bonds: one to OH and one to H?

Wait, no. Structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central C (C2) has:

- CH3 (from C3)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from C1)
- and a single bond to C1, which is part of the COOCH3 group.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, C2 is connected to:

- CH3 (C3)
- OH
- COOCH3 (C1)
- and another CH2 group (from C1? No, C1 is COOCH3).

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe the conclusion is that neither compound shows optical isomerism, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center. So, if it has a chiral center, it would show optical isomerism, making option B the correct answer.

Given the confusion, I'll proceed with the initial thought that A is benzoquinone, and B is dimethyl fumarate, which doesn't show optical isomerism. But this leads to a problem because the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Maybe it doesn't have a chiral center, so the correct answer is that neither shows optical isomerism, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does. So, option B would be correct.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's central carbon isn't a chiral center.

I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option D: A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate. But wait, that would mean dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism, which I thought it didn't.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. So, the structure is such that each C in the double bond is attached to different groups, making them chiral centers.

In that case, dimethyl fumarate would have two chiral centers, but because the molecule is symmetric, it's a meso compound, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, the correct answer would be that neither shows optical isomerism, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another angle. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can form enol tautomers, but that's about tautomerism, not optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: A is benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism), and B is dimethyl fumarate (which doesn't show optical isomerism. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but that would mean that neither shows optical isomerism, which can't be.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Perhaps I'll have to go with my initial analysis: A is benzoquinone, and B is dimethyl fumarate, which doesn't show optical isomerism. But that leaves me without a correct option.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, according to my analysis, A is correct (benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism). As for part B, if dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, then perhaps the correct answer is that neither shows it, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. So, the answer would be option D: A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to conclude that the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between structures through the movement of hydrogen and electrons, typically involving alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and lack alpha hydrogens. Additionally, the enol form of benzoquinone is resonance-stabilized and not a distinct tautomer. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (positions 2, 4, and 6) have alpha hydrogens. These alpha hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to:
   - CH3 (from C3),
   - OH,
   - COOCH3 (from C1),
   - and another CH (from C1).  
   This makes the central carbon a chiral center, allowing the compound to show optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). The molecule is symmetric, with identical groups on both sides of the double bond. Due to this symmetry, it does not have any chiral centers and does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, let me understand the terms here. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. Constitutional isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms, like how the bonds are made. Stereoisomers, on the other hand, have the same arrangement but differ in the 3D arrangement—like geometric isomerism or optical isomerism (which is about chirality, I think).

Now, the compounds in question are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A. The others are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate for part B.

Starting with part A: which doesn't show tautomerism. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between structures with the movement of hydrogen and electrons, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For example, in a carbonyl compound, an alpha hydrogen can move, leading to an enol form.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, no—benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone (oxygen) groups attached. But wait, benzoquinone actually has two double bonds, right? Because quinones are cyclic with two ketone groups. So the structure is cyclic with two keto groups. So, does it have any alpha hydrogens? Because for tautomerism, a compound needs alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl group. If the carbonyl is part of a ring, like in benzene, maybe the hydrogens are not alpha. Wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, but in a ring. So, I'm not sure if there are any alpha hydrogens. Oh wait, the carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So, if the carbon next to the carbonyl is part of the ring, maybe there are no hydrogens attached to that carbon. Because in benzene rings, the carbons are bonded to each other, not to hydrogens. So, no alpha hydrogens—so no possibility for tautomerism. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Then, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Each ketone is on a carbon, so the carbons adjacent to each carbonyl would be the ones next in the ring. Those carbons would have two other ring bonds and maybe a hydrogen. So each of these positions would have an alpha hydrogen. So, the compound would have alpha hydrogens, so it can undergo tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait: if the ring has three ketone groups, are the adjacent carbons each bearing a hydrogen? So like, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have each of those carbonyl groups. The adjacent carbons (like 2,4,6 positions) would be CH2 groups? Or wait, no. Let me think about the structure. Each carbonyl is at C1, C3, C5. The ring is six-membered. So each of those carbons is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (like C2 adjacent to C1) would have two ring bonds, so CH2 groups. So yes, each of those positions would have two hydrogens. So, the alpha hydrogens (on C2, C4, C6) are present, so the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

So part A: the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A = benzoquinone.

Wait, but I thought benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. No, wait, in benzoquinone, each keto group is on a benzene ring. So the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, which are sp² hybridized. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are each connected to two other benzene carbons and an oxygen? No, wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H3-C(=O)-C6H4? No, wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in the ring, each as ketones. Wait, no, the structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in positions 1 and 4, making it a 1,4-benzoquinone, for example. Each oxygen is double-bonded to the ring. So the carbons next to the carbonyl are part of the ring, and each of those carbons is connected to two other ring carbons and a hydrogen? Or are they all part of the conjugated ring, so perhaps without any hydrogen on the adjacent carbons?

Wait, no. In a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen if it's not part of a substituent. Wait, if a benzene ring has two oxygen substituents in the 1 and 4 positions, then each of those carbons is doubly bonded to O, and the adjacent carbons (2 and 3 for the first O, and 5 and 6 for the second O) would each have a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me think. For benzene, each substituent is attached to a carbon. So in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4-C(=O)-. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two double bonds to O. So each of the carbonyl groups is in the ring. So, each of those carbons (C1 and C4) is double-bonded to O, and their adjacent carbons (C2 and C6 for C1; C3 and C5 for C4) are each connected to another ring carbon. So, for C2: it's connected to C1 (double-bonded to O), C3, and maybe a hydrogen. So, in that case, C2 would have a hydrogen. So, if there's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, then it can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but in the case of benzene rings, the adjacent carbons (like C2) are part of the aromatic ring, so they are sp² hybridized. So, the C2 would have one hydrogen, right? Because in benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen except where substituents are attached. So, in 1,4-benzoquinone, each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (C2, C3, C5, C6) would have a hydrogen. Wait, but wait, in the case of a carbonyl group in a ring, is the adjacent carbon part of the ring with a hydrogen?

Wait, let me think of cyclohexanone. It's a six-membered ring with one ketone group. The adjacent carbons (like C2) would each have two hydrogens because they are CH2 groups. But for a benzene ring, each carbon is CH in the parent compound. So, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So the adjacent carbons would be CH, each with one hydrogen.

So, if the carbonyl is at C1, then C2 is CH, adjacent to C1's carbonyl. So, the C2 has a hydrogen. Therefore, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens (on C2, C3, etc.), so it can undergo tautomerism. But wait, wait—tautomerism usually involves the movement of a hydrogen from an alpha carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, forming an enol. But in the case of a conjugated system like a benzene ring, does this movement lead to a different structure? Because in aromatic compounds, the enol form might be resonance-stabilized and not a distinct tautomer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should think about specific examples. For example, para-benzoquinone. Does it exhibit keto-enol tautomerism? I think that aromatic compounds can sometimes delocalize the electrons, so the enol form might be a resonance structure rather than a distinct tautomer. So maybe the tautomerism isn't observed as a separate form because the enol form is just part of the resonance structure of the molecule. So in that case, benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because the enol form is not a distinct structure.

Alternatively, if the compound can form a different structure upon tautomerism, then it does show it. But for benzoquinone, perhaps the enol form is just a resonance structure, so it doesn't count as a distinct tautomer. So in that case, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the enol form is not a separate molecule or a different isomer but part of the same resonance structure.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Each adjacent carbon (like the 2,4,6 positions) would have two hydrogens (since they're CH2 groups). So, when a hydrogen moves from the alpha carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, the enol form is formed. So, this compound can undergo tautomerism because the enol form is a distinct structure from the keto form.

Therefore, for part A, the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A is benzoquinone.

Now, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's figure out its structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)COHCOOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, wait: carboxylic acid is RCOOH. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but that's not right. Let me correct: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are CH3-CH2-COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, right?

So when it's esterified with methanol, the -OH on the carboxylic acid becomes OMe. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, wait: the carboxylic acid is at the end. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Looking at the carbon chain: the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2. Wait, no, let me number the carbons. The carboxylic acid is on C3. So, 2-hydroxy would be on C2. So the structure is:

C1: CH3 (from CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is:

O
|
O-C-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOH group.
Carbon 2: CH2.
Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? That can't be right. No, the correct structure is CH3CH2COOH, which is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3?

No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, that's butanoic acid. Wait, no. Propanoic acid: the formula is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Let me get this right. Propanoic acid has three carbons, right? So it's CH2CH2COOH? No, that's four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, correct structure: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, that's butanoic acid. Wait, no, butanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, no, wait. No, wait: the formula for propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the chain is:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH3

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it becomes methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, looking at the central carbon (carbon 2, which is CH2 in the acid): in the ester, it's CH(OH) attached to what? Wait, in the ester, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3. So carbon 2 (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to a CH2 group on one side and a COOCH3 group on the other. Wait, no: carbon 2 is connected to:

- carbon 1: which is CH2OH
- carbon 3: the COOCH3 group
- and two CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. It's an ester, so it's formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-OH?

No, wait. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, looking at the molecule, the central carbon (the second carbon) has:

- one bond to the hydroxyl (OH)
- one bond to the adjacent CH2
- one bond to the carbonyl group (COOCH3)
- and one bond to another CH2?

Wait, no, how many substituents does that carbon have? Let me number the carbons in the ester:

1: COOCH3 group (the carbonyl)
2: the carbon attached to COOCH3 and CH2OH
Wait, no. Structure:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2OH

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 group, which is attached to an OH.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, carbon 2 (the one in the middle) is connected to:

- carbon 1: CH2(OH)
- carbon 3: CH2COOCH3
- two hydrogens?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with the CH2) is connected to:

- one CH2(OH) group
- one CH2-CO-OCH3 group
- and two hydrogens.

So, the central carbon is CH2. Wait, so it's CH2 connected to CH2(OH), CH2(CO-OCH3), and two H's. So it's a CH2 group, meaning it has two H's. So, the central C is CH2, so it's not a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not have a chiral center, so it can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: maybe the ester group is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Maybe it's CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, that would be a different structure. No, wait, the formula of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is C3H6O3? No, wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is C3H6O3? Maybe not. Let me compute: propanoic acid is C3H6O2. Adding an OH would make it C3H8O3. Wait, methyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3, so the formula becomes C4H8O3.

But perhaps that's getting me away from the main point. The key is whether there's a chiral center. So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

The central CH2 group is attached to:

- One CH2(OH)
- One CH2-CO-OCH3
- Two H's.

So, four substituents: CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, H, H. So two H's are same, so the substituents are not all different. Therefore, the central carbon is not a chiral center. So, the compound is not chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Next, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid has the structure HO2CCH=CHCO2H, while maleic acid has HO2C(C)=C(COOH)2, but arranged differently. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, and maleic is cis.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Or more accurately, the structure is (Z)- or (E)-? Wait, fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
C=C
    /
COOCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, can this molecule exhibit optical isomerism? For that, it needs a chiral center. But wait, the molecule itself is symmetric. Let me think: if the double bond is symmetric, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think of dimethyl fumarate: the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. Wait, no: fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, but in the trans configuration. So the diester would be OCH2CH2O(COOCH3) connected by a double bond? No, wait, perhaps it's (E)-butenedioic acid, which becomes (E)-butenedioate when esterified.

So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)CH2CH2C(O)OCH3? No, wait, the double bond is between the two carbons bearing the ester groups. So, maybe it's O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH group, which is connected via a double bond to another CH group attached to O=C-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - C = C - O-C-OCH3
|
O

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively:

The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on each end of the double bond.

Wait, no: fumaric acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, so when esterified, it becomes OCH2CH2O(COOCH3) across a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each attached to a COOCH3 group.

But in that case, the molecule is symmetric because each end is the same. So, if the molecule is symmetric, does it have any chiral centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups.

Wait, but wait: in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not correct because the double bond would be between the two CH2 groups, each bearing a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, CH2-C double bond C-CH2, each attached to O-C-OCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, that can't be, because double bonds can't be between two CH2 groups, as that would make it CH2-CH2, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the correct structure is:

Each of the two middle carbons (connected by a double bond) has a COOCH3 group attached.

So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that's not right because each CH would have two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. Alternatively, each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group. Wait, no, that would make it CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of dimethyl fumarate as the diester of fumaric acid. So, fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, which has the structure HO2CCH=CHCO2H. The diester would replace both -OH groups with OCH3, so it becomes OCH2CH=CHCO2OCH3? No, wait, more accurately:

Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH in trans? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, where the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans).

So, the diester dimethyl fumarate would be (MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me), with the double bond in the trans configuration.

So, looking at the structure:

The molecule has a central double bond, with each of the two carbons in the double bond attached to a COOCH3 group. So, each of those carbons has two substituents: COOCH3 and the other part of the double bond.

But wait, each of those carbons is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group
- The double bond (so one bond to another carbon)
- And perhaps a hydrogen or a methyl group?

Wait, no, in the structure of fumarate, the two carbons of the double bond each have a COOCH3 group attached. So, each of those carbons is bonded to:

Carbon 1: COOCH3, double bond to Carbon 2, and two other substituents?

Wait, no. Wait, in the structure of fumaric acid, it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So each of the CH groups in the double bond is attached to a COOH group. When esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is OCH2C(=O)OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, structure would be:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Each C in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no, because that would require each C to have two substituents besides the double bond, but each C in a double bond has two substituents. So, in this case, each C in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 from the other side? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each C in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond instead of a single bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Wait, that can't be right because each CH has only two substituents. Each of those carbons is double-bonded to each other, so they have two substituents each: COOCH3 and the other CH.

Wait, but in that case, each of those carbons is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and the two bonds in the double bond. That's not possible because each carbon in a double bond has two other substituents. So, if each is bonded to a COOCH3 group and another substituent, perhaps it's arranged such that each has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. But that might not be right.

I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let's approach it from another angle. Does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? For a molecule to have a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four different groups.

In dimethyl fumarate, the central double bond is between two carbons, each attached to a COOCH3 group and perhaps another group. If those carbons are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen, that would make each have two identical substituents, so the carbon wouldn't be chiral.

Wait, but if the structure is such that each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group attached, then each would have two identical substituents, so no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, what about the possibility of geometric isomerism? Well, that's not about optical isomers, but about E and Z isomerism.

But the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chiral centers. So, if a compound has a chiral center, it can show optical isomerism.

Wait, so in dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? Let's look again. If the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But each carbon in the double bond is attached to two substituents: COOCH3 and another group.

Wait, if each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, then maybe not. Alternatively, if each carbon is bonded to COOCH3 and a CH3 group, but that probably isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because the molecule is symmetric. So, in that case, it doesn't show optical isomerism. But wait, that can't be right because I thought maleic anhydride can form chiral derivatives, but fumarate is the trans isomer.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of fumaric acid. So, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, each of those carbons has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each carbon is connected to COOCH3, H, and the two bonds in the double bond. Wait, that can't be right because each carbon in the double bond has two substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each carbon is connected to COOCH3 and another substituent. Let me try to imagine the structure:

The molecule is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two central CH2 groups. So, it's CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, each of the central carbons is attached to COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. But that doesn't fit the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each of the double-bonded carbons has two COOCH3 groups attached. But that would make each carbon have two same substituents, so no chiral center.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? If yes, then it can't be chiral because a plane of symmetry would mean it's superimposable on its mirror image.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a central double bond with two ester groups on opposite ends. So, the structure would be symmetric. If you draw a plane through the double bond, each side mirrors the other. So, the molecule is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetric, it can't have a chiral center. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought that maleic anhydride can form chiral derivatives, but fumarate is the trans isomer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl maleate would have a chiral center because of the cis arrangement, but fumarate is trans and symmetric. So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate is symmetric and doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. If the molecule is symmetric, then it can't be chiral. So, for example, something like meso-tartaric acid is symmetric and therefore not chiral, despite having stereogenic centers.

So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. So, even though each of the double-bonded carbons has two substituents, the overall molecule is symmetric. Therefore, it doesn't have any optical isomerism.

But wait, the question is about dimethyl fumarate. So, if it doesn't have any chiral centers, then it doesn't show optical isomerism. So, among the two compounds, which one shows optical isomerism?

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, that can't be right because one of them must show optical isomerism. Did I make a mistake in my analysis?

Alternatively, perhaps I got it wrong and dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the structure again. Let me think of the structure of dimethyl fumarate as (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but no, that can't be because that would imply single bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. But that would mean each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each of those carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group (which is connected to the other double-bonded C)
- and maybe a hydrogen.

But in that case, each carbon would have:

- COOCH3
- two CH2 groups (one on each side?)
Wait, no, for each double-bonded C:

C1: bonded to COOCH3, double-bonded to C2, and two H's (since it's CH2).

C2: bonded to COOCH3, double-bonded to C1, and two H's.

So, each of those carbons is CH2, so they have two H's. So, each has substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond. So, each carbon is attached to two H's, a COOCH3, and a double bond.

Wait, but in that case, each C is CH2, not a stereocenter. So, no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. If it has two stereogenic centers but is superimposable on its mirror image due to a plane of symmetry, then it won't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's reevaluate that.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- two H's.

So, substituents are: CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, H, H. Since two substituents are the same (H), the carbon isn't a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate. If it's symmetric, it can't have a chiral center. So, neither of them shows optical isomerism? But that can't be right because the options given have one of them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think of another approach. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate actually has a chiral center.

Wait, wait. Let me draw the structure again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to:

- one CH2(OH) group
- one CH2COOCH3 group
- two H's.

So, substituents are:

1. CH2(OH)
2. CH2COOCH3
3. H
4. H

So two substituents are the same (H). Therefore, the central carbon isn't a chiral center.

Wait, but what if the structure is different? For example, if the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group. Let me think: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- COOCH3
- OH
- CH3
- and another substituent.

Wait, that would make it a chiral center. So, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another substituent.

Wait, but then what's the fourth substituent? The structure would be:

(CH3)-(C(OH)-COOCH3)-something. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2. So, substituents are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, two H's. Not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I had the wrong structure. Another possibility is that the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group. So, the structure is CH2COOCH3 attached to a CH(OH)CH3 group. That would make the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) attached to:

- CH2COOCH3
- CH3
- OH
- and another substituent.

Wait, that would require the structure to be CH2COOCH3 attached to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So, the structure would be CH2COOCH3-CH(OH)CH3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense for 2-hydroxypropanoate. Because propanoate has three carbons: COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another substituent, which would be a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because that would be four substituents, making it a chiral center. So, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, that can't be because it's propanoate. Let me count the carbons. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: three carbons, with hydroxyl on C2.

So, the structure is:

Carboxylic acid group: COOH
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

So, when esterified, it becomes:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another substituent, which is a CH2 group?

Wait, no, because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, C2 (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and a single bond to another carbon (C1?), but that would require four substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3

So, the central carbon (C2) has:

- CH3 (from C3)
- OH (on C2)
- COOCH3 (from C1)
- and a single bond to C1, which is the COOCH3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because C1 is the carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group.

So, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the substituents on C2.

In the correct structure, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from C3)
2. OH
3. COOCH3 (from C1)
4. another CH group, which is part of the chain.

Wait, no, that can't be. Another approach: for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH3? Wait, that would make it (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, which isn't the case for 2-hydroxypropanoate.

This is getting really confusing. Maybe I should just accept that I'm stuck and try to think of known compounds. Dimethyl fumarate is known to have geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism because it's symmetric. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, on the other hand, if it has a chiral center, would show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center because the central carbon isn't attached to four different groups. But if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is attached to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's attached to four different groups.

Wait, in the correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3 (from C3)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from C1)
- and a single bond to C1, which is part of the COOCH3 group. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
    |
CH2-C-OH
    |
CH3

In this case, the central C (C2) is connected to:

- COOCH3
- OH
- CH2CH3 (from C3)
Wait, no, because propanoate has three carbons.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me think: which of the two compounds has a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the central carbon is attached to four different groups, then yes. If not, no.

Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral center because symmetric.

So, if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, then it shows optical isomerism. Otherwise, dimethyl fumarate would be the one.

But earlier I thought methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's central carbon isn't a chiral center, so dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. Perhaps the methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups.

Structure: CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central C (C2) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from C3)
2. OH
3. COOCH3 (from C1)
4. CH2 group (from C1), which is connected to another CH3. Wait, no, the C1 is the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH2CH3

No, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate. I'm getting myself in circles.

Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the central C (C2) is CH2. So, substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, two H's. So, not a chiral center.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

So, among the options, which compound shows optical isomerism? Well, if neither does, but the question says one of them does, perhaps I'm wrong about one of them.

Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate can have a chiral center due to the arrangement of substituents around the double bond. But I thought it was symmetric.

Another approach: think about the possibility of fumarate being a meso compound. If it has two stereogenic centers but a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

But in dimethyl fumarate, the two carbons in the double bond each have a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, each C is CH, attached to COOCH3 and H. So, each C could potentially be a chiral center if they have four different substituents. But in this case, each C has COOCH3, H, and two substituents from the double bond.

Wait, each C in the double bond is attached to:

- COOCH3
- H
- double bond to the other C.

Wait, but each C in a double bond is connected to two other carbons via double bonds, so each has two substituents besides the double bond. So, perhaps each C is attached to COOCH3, H, and two more substituents, making four in total.

But I'm getting stuck again. Maybe it's time to consider that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so the correct answer is that neither shows optical isomerism, but that can't be because the options have one.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again. The options are:

A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

Wait, no, looking at the options, option D says A is benzoquinone and B is dimethyl fumarate. Let me look at the options:

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So, the question is which option correctly pairs A and B.

As per our analysis, A is benzoquinone (which doesn't show tautomerism), and B is dimethyl fumarate (which doesn't show optical isomerism? But that can't be right because the options must have one of them showing it).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not right. Alternatively, it's (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond instead of a single bond.

Wait, if the structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each C is connected to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group
- H (if any)
- and the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons is CH, so each has a hydrogen. So substituents for each C would be:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group (with another substituent)
- H
- and the double bond.

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each C is attached to COOCH3 and two CH2 groups, making them CH2 groups, which can't be chiral.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think about other possibilities. Perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center because the two substituents on each double-bonded carbon are different.

Wait, if the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible because each C would have two COOCH3 groups, making them not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that one C is attached to COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and the other C is attached to COOCH3 and a CH3 group. But that would require the molecule to have substituents that aren't symmetric, leading to a chiral center.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Since the options pair A as either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and B as either methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate.

From earlier analysis, A is benzoquinone because it doesn't show tautomerism. So, looking at the options, options B and D have A as benzoquinone.

Now, for part B, which shows optical isomerism.

If dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, then methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate must have one. But earlier analysis suggested it doesn't. Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Then the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH3 (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, no, that would be (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, which would have a chiral center. So, in that case, the central C has four different groups: two methyl groups? No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Then, the central C (C2) is connected to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH (from C3? No, C3 is CH3).

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons:

C1: COOCH3
C2: CH(OH)
C3: CH3

So, C2 is connected to:

- C1: COOCH3
- OH
- C3: CH3
- and another bond to where? To C2's own structure.

Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and has two more bonds: one to OH and one to H?

Wait, no. Structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central C (C2) has:

- CH3 (from C3)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from C1)
- and a single bond to C1, which is part of the COOCH3 group.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, C2 is connected to:

- CH3 (C3)
- OH
- COOCH3 (C1)
- and another CH2 group (from C1? No, C1 is COOCH3).

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe the conclusion is that neither compound shows optical isomerism, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center. So, if it has a chiral center, it would show optical isomerism, making option B the correct answer.

Given the confusion, I'll proceed with the initial thought that A is benzoquinone, and B is dimethyl fumarate, which doesn't show optical isomerism. But this leads to a problem because the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Maybe it doesn't have a chiral center, so the correct answer is that neither shows optical isomerism, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does. So, option B would be correct.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's central carbon isn't a chiral center.

I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option D: A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate. But wait, that would mean dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism, which I thought it didn't.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. So, the structure is such that each C in the double bond is attached to different groups, making them chiral centers.

In that case, dimethyl fumarate would have two chiral centers, but because the molecule is symmetric, it's a meso compound, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, the correct answer would be that neither shows optical isomerism, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another angle. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can form enol tautomers, but that's about tautomerism, not optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: A is benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism), and B is dimethyl fumarate (which doesn't show optical isomerism. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but that would mean that neither shows optical isomerism, which can't be.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Perhaps I'll have to go with my initial analysis: A is benzoquinone, and B is dimethyl fumarate, which doesn't show optical isomerism. But that leaves me without a correct option.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, according to my analysis, A is correct (benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism). As for part B, if dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, then perhaps the correct answer is that neither shows it, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. So, the answer would be option D: A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to conclude that the correct answer is option D.


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between structures through the movement of hydrogen and electrons, typically involving alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and lack alpha hydrogens. Additionally, the enol form of benzoquinone is resonance-stabilized and not a distinct tautomer. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (positions 2, 4, and 6) have alpha hydrogens. These alpha hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to:
   - CH3 (from C3),
   - OH,
   - COOCH3 (from C1),
   - and another CH (from C1).  
   This makes the central carbon a chiral center, allowing the compound to show optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). The molecule is symmetric, with identical groups on both sides of the double bond. Due to this symmetry, it does not have any chiral centers and does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.
