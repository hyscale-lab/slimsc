Okay, so I have this metric given and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because I see dx² and dy². So the spacetime is two-dimensional, maybe like a surface embedded in higher dimensions or something else. 

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm not sure how that directly ties into the metric given. Maybe I need to analyze the metric to find out what kind of geometry it represents.

The metric looks like it's in the form of conformally flat coordinates. Conformally flat means it's a scaling of flat spacetime (like Minkowski or Euclidean) by a function. In this case, it's scaled by 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the line element is conformally related to the flat metric.

Wait, but for a pseudosphere, the metric would have a negative curvature. So the Gaussian curvature should be negative. How do I relate the given metric to the Gaussian curvature?

I remember that for a two-dimensional metric in the form ds² = e^{2f(x,y)}(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by the negative of the Laplacian of f. So K = -Δf, where Δ is the Laplacian in two dimensions. Alternatively, if the metric is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), then the Gaussian curvature can be found using some formula involving derivatives of g.

Wait, let me think about the formula. The Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(4g)) [ (∂²g/∂x²) + (∂²g/∂y²) ]

Wait, no, maybe I should look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I don't have my notes here. Another approach: maybe the given metric is similar to that of a hyperbolic space or some other space with constant curvature.

The given metric is for a 2D surface. The standard metric for a space of constant curvature in 2D can be written in isothermal coordinates as ds² = (2/(a(1 + (x² + y²)/(4a²))))² (dx² + dy²), where a is a constant related to the curvature. Wait, no, maybe I should recall the general form.

Wait, another thought: for a hyperbolic plane, the metric is often written in Poincaré coordinates, but that's usually in terms of a different scaling. Alternatively, the metric can be expressed in terms of a function that depends on the radius. Wait, but in any case, the given metric might be conformally flat, so I can compute the Gaussian curvature from it.

Given that the metric is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where g(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So first, I need to compute the Gaussian curvature K.

The formula for the Gaussian curvature K in terms of the conformal factor g is:

K = -(1/(4g)) [ (∂²g/∂x²) + (∂²g/∂y²) ]

Wait, or is it another formula? Let me make sure. Another approach is using the formula for Gaussian curvature when the metric is ds² = e^{2h} (dx² + dy²), then K = -e^{-2h} [ (h_xx + h_yy) ].

Wait, yes, so if h is the function such that g = e^{2h}, then K = -e^{-2h} (Laplacian of h). So let's apply that here.

First, let's express the given metric in that form. The given g is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me write this as:

g = 32 (4 - (x² + y²))^{-1}

So that can be written as e^{2h} where h = ln(g^{1/2})? Wait, no, because g is scaling the metric. Wait, actually, let me see: the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²), which is the same as e^{2h} (dx² + dy²), where h = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Wait, no, wait. Actually, since the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²), that is equal to e^{ln(32/(4 - x² - y²))} which is e^{ln(32)} - e^{ln(4 - x² - y²)}? No, that doesn't split. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me take h as (1/2) * ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Wait, no, because e^{2h} would be e^{ln(32/(4 - x² - y²))} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), which matches the given g. So yes, h = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Wait, but I can factor out the 32 as a constant. So 32 is 2^5, so maybe that's not essential. The main thing is the denominator, 4 - (x² + y²). So the scaling depends on r² = x² + y², where r is the radial coordinate. So it's a function of r.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = -e^{-2h} [ (h_xx + h_yy) ]

So let's compute h_xx and h_yy.

h = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)) = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - (x² + y²)) ]

So h = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ], where r² = x² + y².

Since ln(a - b) is involved, and we're going to take derivatives with respect to x and y.

Compute the first derivatives. Let me compute the derivatives with respect to x.

h = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r^2) ]

h_x = (1/2) * [ 0 - (1/(4 - r^2)) * (-2x) ) ] 

Wait, because the derivative of ln(4 - r²) with respect to x is ( -2x ) / (4 - r² ), so:

h_x = (1/2) * ( 2x / (4 - r²) ) ) = x/(4 - r²)

Similarly, h_y = y/(4 - r²)

Now the second derivatives:

h_xx is the derivative of h_x with respect to x.

h_x = x/(4 - r²) = x/(4 - x² - y² )

So derivative with respect to x:

h_xx = [ (1)(4 - x² - y²) - x*(-2x) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

Simplify numerator:

(4 - x² - y²) + 2x² = 4 + x² - y²

So,

h_xx = (4 + x² - y²) / (4 - x² - y²)^2

Similarly, h_yy:

h_y = y/(4 - x² - y² )

Derivative with respect to y:

h_yy = [ (1)(4 - x² - y²) - y*(-2y) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

Numerator:

(4 -x² -y²) + 2y² = 4 -x² + y²

So,

h_yy = (4 -x² + y²) / (4 - x² - y²)^2

Now, sum h_xx + h_yy:

(4 +x² - y² +4 - x² + y²) / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

The x² and -x², -y² and +y² cancel out.

So numerator is 4 +4 =8. Denominator is (4 -x² -y²)^2.

So h_xx + h_yy = 8/(4 - r^2)^2.

Now, e^{-2h} is equal to (32/(4 - r²))^{-1} }.

Because h = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)), so 2h is ln(32/(4 - r²)), so e^{2h} is 32/(4 - r²). Therefore, e^{-2h} is (4 - r²)/32.

So, K = - e^{-2h} * (h_xx + h_yy) = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ]

Simplify this:

The (4 - r²) in denominator and numerator will cancel one power. So:

(4 - r²) cancels once from numerator and denominator.

So,

K = - [ 1/(32) ] * [8/(4 - r^2) ]

Which is:

K = - [8/(32(4 - r^2)) ] = - [1/(4(4 - r^2)) ]

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature should be negative everywhere, which this is because of the negative sign. But the denominator (4 - r^2) could be positive or negative, depending on r.

Wait, but the domain of the metric is where 4 - x² - y² >0, because the denominator can't be zero, and the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). So the region is x² + y² <4. So r is less than 2. So (4 - r^2) is positive.

So K = - [1/(4(4 - r^2)) ].

Hmm. Wait, but for a pseudosphere, I thought the Gaussian curvature would be a constant. But here, K depends on r. That seems odd. So perhaps this isn't a pseudosphere but another kind of surface.

Wait, but wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe I should think about what the area would be on such a pseudosphere.

Wait, but wait, a pseudosphere (tractricoid) has constant negative curvature. So if the Gaussian curvature is not constant, perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere. But the question says it's a pseudosphere, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing K. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let's recompute K.

h = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r^2)).

h_xx + h_yy: we found that it's 8/(4 - r^2)^2.

e^(-2h) = [32/(4 - r^2)]^{-1} = (4 - r^2)/32.

So K = - e^{-2h} (h_xx + h_yy) = - [ (4 - r^2)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r^2)^2 ]

Which is: - [ ( (4 - r^2) * 8 ) / (32 (4 - r^2)^2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 - r^2 in numerator and denominator cancels once, 8/32 is 1/4.

So K = - [1/(4 (4 - r^2) ) ]

Hmm. So K is not constant. So that suggests that this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. So perhaps the question is in error, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps I should compute the area on this metric when r=2. Wait, but r=2 is the edge of the domain, because at r=2, the denominator becomes zero. So r can't reach 2; it approaches it asymptotically.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2". Wait, maybe I'm confusing the radius in the metric with the radius of curvature.

Wait, the pseudosphere has a certain radius, which relates to its Gaussian curvature. Remember that for a surface with constant negative curvature K, the radius of curvature R is related by K = -1/R².

In the case of a pseudosphere, the tractricoid, the curvature is K = -1/a², where a is the radius of the pseudosphere. So for a pseudosphere of radius r=2, K would be -1/(2²) = -1/4.

But in the given metric, the Gaussian curvature K is not constant. So perhaps this metric isn't a pseudosphere? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is conformally flat, and the pseudosphere is embedded in this space. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of the surface described by this metric. Because the metric is given, maybe the area is infinite or zero or something else.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0

B)4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² - y²)

D) +∞

Wait, but these options are functions of x and y, except A and D. So the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface with infinite area, I think. Because its Gaussian curvature is negative everywhere, so it's non-compact, and its area is infinite. So the area would be infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric provided has a certain area when integrated.

Wait, the area of a surface in 2D is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric over the surface. Since this is a 2D metric, area is computed as ∫∫ sqrt(g_xy) dx dy.

Wait, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 -x² -y²))^2, so sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 -x² -y²).

Wait, no, wait: the metric is ds² = g (dx² + dy²), so the determinant is g², and the area element is sqrt(g²) dx dy, which is |g| dx dy. But since g is positive (since denominator is positive in the domain), it's g dx dy.

So the area is the integral over the domain (where 4 -x² - y² >0) of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but integrating this over the entire disk x² + y² <4 would give a finite or infinite result?

Let me compute this integral.

Change to polar coordinates: x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So dx dy = r dr dθ.

The integral becomes ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area A = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

The θ integral is 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution u=4 - r², then du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) = ∫ [32 (-du/2) ] / u.

Which is -16 ∫ du/u.

The limits: when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ from u=4 to u=0 [du/u] = -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. So let's compute this:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = -16 [ (-infinity) - ln4 ] = -16 ( -infinity ), which is positive infinity.

Wait, but wait, the substitution gives us:

∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr = 32 ∫0^2 r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me compute as substitution:

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → (-du/2) = r dr.

So,

32 ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] =32 * ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] =32*(-1/2) ∫ du/u = -16 ∫ du/u.

Limits from u=4 to u=0.

So,

-16 [ ln u ] from 4 to 0 = -16 ( ln 0 - ln4 ) = -16 ( (-infty) - ln4 ) = -16 ( -infty ) = +infty.

So the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. But earlier, I thought the Gaussian curvature isn't constant in this metric. So perhaps this isn't a pseudosphere, but the question says it is.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something else. But according to the metric, the area is infinite. So the answer would be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. This is a conformally flat metric, where the conformal factor is \( g(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of the metric is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), ensuring that the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) remains positive.

To compute the area of the surface, we use the formula for the area element in a 2D metric:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy.
\]

For a diagonal metric \( ds^2 = g \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right), \) the determinant of the metric tensor is \( \det g = g^2 \), so the area element becomes:

\[
dA = g \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), where \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then given by:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) gives \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), which gives \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

Reversing the limits of integration:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) is \( \ln|u| \), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[ \ln u \right]_0^4 = 16 \left( \ln 4 - \ln 0 \right).
\]

Since \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the area of the surface described by the given metric is infinite.

The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but the given metric does not describe a pseudosphere because the Gaussian curvature \( K \) depends on \( r \) and is not constant. However, regardless of the interpretation, the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
