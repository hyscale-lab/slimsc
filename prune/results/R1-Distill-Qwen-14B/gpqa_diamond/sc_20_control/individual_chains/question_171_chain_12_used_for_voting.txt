Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Hmm, electrophilic substitution... I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. 

The substances given are all benzene derivatives, right? Each has a different substituent attached. Let's list them out:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyl ethyl ester?)
Wait, no, maybe it's phthalic anhydride or something. Wait, actually, looking at the structure, it's C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh, that's benzyl acetate? No, wait, acetate would be OAc. Maybe it's phenyl acetate. Wait, no, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So, the substituent is a CO-O-C2H5 group. That would be an ester group. So, acetyloxy or something? Like, the substituent is an ester, which is an electron-withdrawing group.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

So, each substituent will activate or deactivate the ring and direct the incoming bromine. The key here is to determine whether each substituent is ortho/para-directing or meta-directing because that affects where the bromine adds.

Wait, but since it's an electrophilic substitution, the directing depends on whether the substituent is activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing). 

Let's go through each substituent:

1) CH3: This is a methyl group, which is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group, donates electrons via +I effect). So, it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So, when bromine adds, the major products would be the para isomer (since para is more stable due to less steric hindrance compared to ortho).

2) CO-O-C2H5 (ester group): Ester is a substituent that is deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. But wait, the ester group is an ortho/para-directing group. Because the oxygen has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making it an activating group? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ester groups are deactivating, right? Because they have electron-withdrawing groups. Let me think. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because the carbonyl is more electronegative. So, it deactivates the ring. But as for directing, esters are meta directors? Or ortho/para? Hmm, wait, in nitration reactions, for example, substituents like ester (like in phenyl acetate) are ortho/para directors. Because the ester group is an activating group? No, wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the ester group is deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, but it's still an ortho/para director because the oxygen can donate electrons through resonance. So, the activating substituents are ortho/para directors. But wait, esters are deactivating, so they're meta directors? No, wait, wait. Let me get this straight.

Ah, activating groups are ortho/para directors. Deactivating can be meta or ortho/para. For example, nitro groups are deactivating and meta directors. But groups like -OCH3 (methoxy) are activating and ortho/para directors. Ester groups, like -COOR, are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, but they're ortho/para directors because the lone pairs on the oxygen can donate electrons through resonance. So, they activate the ring in certain positions but deactivate overall. So, in this case, substituent 2 would direct incoming groups to ortho and para positions.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a substituent with a deactivating effect because of its electronegativity (electron-withdrawing via inductive effect), but it's also ortho/para-directing. Because even though it's deactivating, the lone pairs on Cl can donate electrons through resonance, making the ring more reactive in ortho and para positions.

4) NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating group (due to strong electron withdrawal) and is a meta director. So, in nitrobenzene, the incoming electrophile will add at the meta position.

5) C2H5 (ethyl group): Similar to methyl, it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

6) COOH: Carboxylic acid group. This is a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl and the -OH group (which is also EWG). Since it's deactivating, it's a meta director.

So, the substituents and their directing effects are:

1) CH3: activating, o/p
2) COOEt: deactivating, o/p (since ester is o/p)
3) Cl: deactivating, o/p
4) NO2: deactivating, meta
5) C2H5: activating, o/p
6) COOH: deactivating, meta

Wait, but wait. For substituent 2, the ester group (COOEt), does it direct meta or ortho/para? I think ester groups are deactivating but ortho/para directors. So, they're like the nitro group but direct ortho/para.

So, when the substituent is ortho/para-directing, the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add to the ortho and para positions more than the meta. But in the case of meta-directors, the Br adds to the meta position.

Now, the problem is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent, we need to determine how much of the product is para. The para isomer is typically the major product when the substituent is ortho/para-directing, but sometimes when there's steric hindrance, ortho can be less favored, so para is dominant.

But when the substituent is meta-directing, the para isomer isn't a major product. So, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer—so which substituents give the least amount of para, and which give the most.

Wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Wait, that's confusing. Oh, but that can't be right because when you have substituents that are ortho/para directors, you get multiple products. Unless the substituent is such that only one position is possible. Hmm, perhaps the question is assuming that for each substituent, the bromine adds in a single position, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the question is about the para-isomer's yield compared to others. So, for each substituent, what's the percentage of para in the mixture.

But wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed"—so perhaps the substituent has such a strong directing effect that only one product is formed. Oh, but that's not possible because even meta directors can have some, but perhaps in some cases, like with strong meta directors, the para isomer isn't formed.

Wait, maybe the question is considering that in some cases, the para isomer is the only one formed. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the para-isomer of the monobromo derivative."

Wait, so each substance when brominated in electrophilic substitution gives a mixture of products. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer in each case. So, for each substituent, how much of the product is the para isomer. Then, arrange them from the lowest to the highest percentage of para isomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the para isomer is the major one in some cases and not in others.

So, let's think about each substituent:

1) CH3: o/p-directing. So, the Br can add at ortho, meta, or para positions. Wait, no, wait. If the substituent is o/p-directing, the Br will add to ortho and para positions. So the major products are para and ortho. But wait, in reality, for toluene, the para is the major product, and ortho is minor because of steric hindrance. So, in toluene bromination, the para isomer is major.

So, the para fraction is high for substituent 1.

2) COOEt: o/p-directing, deactivating. So, the Br will add to ortho and para. But since the ring is deactivating, the rate may be slower than benzene, but the main products are o and p.

In this case, the para isomer would be a major product.

3) Cl: o/p-directing. So, Br adds to o and p. Again, steric hindrance may make para the major.

4) NO2: meta-directing. So, Br adds to meta position. So, the meta is major, and para is a minor component. Hence, the para-isomer's weight fraction would be low.

5) C2H5: same as CH3, o/p-directing. Para is major.

6) COOH: meta-directing. So, Br adds to meta, making the para isomer's fraction low.

Wait, but let's think about each substituent's effect on the para isomer:

- For substituents that are meta-directing (4 and 6), the para is not a major product. So, their weight fractions of para would be low.

For substituents that are o/p-directing (1,2,3,5), the para is a major product, but the extent depends on the substituent's ability to direct and the steric factors.

But wait, some substituents may have more para product than others.

Wait, let's think about the steric hindrance. For substituents that are bulky, the para position might be more favored over ortho because of less steric hindrance.

So, substituent 5 is ethyl (C2H5), which is a larger substituent than methyl (CH3). So, when the substituent is ethyl, the para product would be more favored than ortho, so higher para fraction.

Similarly, substituent 3 is Cl—so maybe Cl is more bulky than CH3? Chlorine is a larger atom, so in chlorobenzene, when bromine adds, the para product is major, but maybe more so than in toluene.

Wait, but in general, for substituents that are o/p-directing, the para isomer tends to be the major product due to steric factors.

So, looking at each substituent:

Substituent | Type    | Directing | Para fraction
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 (CH3) | activating | o/p | high
2 (COOEt) | deactivating | o/p | high
3 (Cl) | deactivating | o/p | high
4 (NO2) | deactivating | meta | low
5 (C2H5) | activating | o/p | high
6 (COOH) | deactivating | meta | low

Wait, so substituents 1,2,3,5 are o/p directors, so their para fractions are higher. Substituents 4 and 6 are meta directors, so their para fractions are low.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, among the o/p directors, which have the highest or lowest para fractions.

Wait, but how does the deactivating nature affect the para fraction? For example, if the substituent is deactivating but o/p-directing, but the ring is less reactive. But the question is about the distribution of products, not the overall reactivity.

So, for substituents 1,2,3,5, the para would be major. But how much exactly?

Wait, I think that for substituents that are activating, the ring is more reactive, but the para preference is similar regardless.

But in terms of steric hindrance. Let's think:

Substituent 5 is ethyl (bigger than methyl). So, when adding Br, the ortho position is more hindered, so less ortho product, so more para. So, substituent 5 might have the highest para fraction among the o/p directors.

Substituent 3 is Cl, which is a larger substituent than CH3. So, steric hindrance is more than CH3, so para is more favored.

Substituent 1 is CH3, which is small. So, ortho substitution is possible, but less than para. So, the para fraction may be lower than substituent 3 but higher than substituent 2.

Wait, substituent 2 is an ester group. How big is that? COOEt is larger than Cl or CH3. So, in substituent 2, steric hindrance might make the ortho position less favored, so para is more.

Wait, but the substituent's size would affect the steric effects. Let me order the substituents by their size:

The substituents on benzene are:

3) Cl: larger than CH3 (1) but smaller than ethyl (5) and the ester (2) group.

2) COOEt: the substituent is a carbonyl attached to an OEt group, which is larger than Cl.

5) C2H5: ethyl group, which is bigger than methyl but smaller than COOEt.

Wait, not sure about the exact size, but I can imagine that substituent 2's group is larger than Cl and ethyl.

So, the substituents in order of size (from smallest to largest):

CH3 (1) < Cl (3) < C2H5 (5) < COOEt (2) < COOH (6?) Wait, no, substituent 6 is COOH, which is even larger.

Wait, substituent 6 is COOH, which is a -COOH group. That's a larger substituent than COOEt because COOEt is like CO-O-R, where R is ethyl, whereas COOH is a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but wait, substituent 2 is CO-O-C2H5 (ester), which is larger than COOH? Or the other way around? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact substituent sizes, but I think the COOEt group is larger than COOH. Because COOH has a hydroxyl group which is smaller than an ester group with ethyl.

Wait, perhaps size-wise:

Smallest substituent: CH3 (1) < Cl (3) < C2H5 (5) < COOH (6) < COOEt (2) ?

Wait, that's speculative. But perhaps the larger the substituent, the more the ortho positions are hindered, so more para.

So, the substituent that is the largest will have the highest para fraction.

Wait, but substituent 2 is an ester group, which is big. So, the para fraction would be higher in substituent 2 than in 5? Or is 5 larger?

Alternatively, maybe not. Let me think of the substituents:

CH3 (methyl): small.

Cl: medium.

C2H5 (ethyl): larger than CH3.

COOEt: ester group (like -OOCR), which is larger than ethyl.

COOH: larger than COOEt, perhaps, because it's a carboxylic acid group which is more bulky.

Wait, but maybe the order is: CH3 < Cl < C2H5 < COOEt < COOH.

So, substituent 6 (COOH) is the largest, then 2 (COOEt), then 5 (C2H5), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3).

So, the substituent size from largest to smallest: 6 >2>5>3>1.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain, but let's proceed with this assumption.

Now, the larger the substituent, the more the ortho positions are hindered, so the higher the para fraction.

So, substituent 6 (COOH) has the highest para fraction among the o/p directors, then 2, then 5, then 3, then 1.

Wait, but substituent 6 is a meta director, so that's not correct. Oh wait, substituent 6 is COOH, which is a meta director, so its para fraction is low, not high.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's reorganize.

Substituents that are o/p directors:

1) CH3: activating, o/p. Para is major.

2) COOEt: deactivating, o/p. Para is major.

3) Cl: deactivating, o/p. Para is major.

5) C2H5: activating, o/p. Para is major.

Substituents that are meta directors:

4) NO2: meta.

6) COOH: meta.

So, among the o/p directors, the para fraction is high, but some may have higher than others.

So, the question is to arrange all six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of para isomer.

So, the order would be: the lower para fractions first, then higher as we move to the right.

The substituents with meta directing (4 and 6) have lower para fractions. Among o/p directors, their para fractions are higher. So, the lowest para fractions are in 4 and 6. Then, the o/p directors have higher.

But within o/p directors, what's their para fraction order?

Which o/p director has the lowest para fraction, and which has the highest?

Wait, for o/p directors, the para fraction is usually higher than ortho because of steric reasons, but how does the substituent's nature affect the ratio?

For example, activating groups (like CH3 and C2H5) may have higher reactivity, but the substituent size may influence where the Br adds.

Wait, but the main point is that in o/p directors, the para is the major product. So, substituents 1,2,3,5 will have higher para fractions than substituents 4 and 6.

So, the overall order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

Substituents 4 and 6 (meta directors) have the lowest para fractions. So they come first.

Between substituents 4 and 6, which has a lower para fraction?

Wait, substituent 4 is NO2 (nitro group), which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, the para isomer is not formed much. Similarly, substituent 6 is COOH, which is also a deactivating, meta-directing group, so para is not formed much.

But which between 4 and 6 has a lower para fraction? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is more deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, but the directing is meta. So, the para isomer would be negligible in 4. Similarly, in 6, the ring is also deactivating, but perhaps COOH is less deactivating than NO2? Or more?

Wait, nitro is a stronger deactivating group than COOH. So, in nitrobenzene, the para product is less than in benzoic acid? No, wait, both are meta directors, so the para is not the major product. Wait, but the question is about the fraction of the para isomer, regardless of the overall reactivity.

So, substituents 4 and 6 both are meta directors, so their para fractions are low.

Which of them has a lower para fraction? I'm not sure. Maybe substituent 4 (NO2) is a stronger deactivator, but how does that affect the para fraction?

Wait, perhaps substituent 4 has a lower para fraction because the ring's reactivity is lower, so the bromination doesn't happen much? Or maybe it's the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction is independent of the substituent's strength as deactivator, but depends solely on whether it's meta or o/p.

Wait, perhaps substituents 4 and 6 have about the same para fractions, but I'm not certain.

But looking at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2<1<5<3.

Wait, so according to that, substituent 4 (NO2) has the lowest para fraction, then 6 (COOH), then 2, then 1, then 5, then 3.

But why would substituent 6 have a lower para fraction than 4? Wait, perhaps because substituent 6 is a stronger meta director, so para is even less likely, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 6 (COOH) is a better o/p director than I thought. No, wait, COOH is a meta director. So it's not o/p.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's list each substituent's para isomer fraction:

1) CH3: high para.

2) COOEt: high para.

3) Cl: high para.

4) NO2: low para.

5) C2H5: high para.

6) COOH: low para.

So, all substituents except 4 and 6 have high para fractions. Now, the question is to arrange them in order of increasing para fraction.

So the order would be:

Lowest para fraction: substituents 4 and 6, then the o/p directors.

But which is lower between 4 and 6?

Wait, substituent 4 is NO2, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, the para isomer would be negligible, perhaps less than substituent 6.

Substituent 6's substituent is COOH, which is also meta-directing and deactivating. So, the para fraction would be low but perhaps not as low as substituent 4.

Wait, no. The para fraction depends on the substituent's direction. If the substituent is a meta director, then the major product is meta, so the para product is minor. But how much minor? It's possible that substituent 4's para fraction is lower than 6's.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 4's para fraction is lower than substituent 6's.

Wait, maybe substituent 4 is more deactivating, leading to less para product. Wait, no, the substituent's deactivating effect doesn't change the direction. It just affects the overall ring reactivity, not the product distribution between para and meta.

Wait, perhaps substituent 4 and 6 have similar para fractions, but looking at the options, options have 4 <6 <2< etc.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 6 has a higher para fraction than 4. That would place 4 first (lower), then 6.

So, the order for the substituents from lowest to highest para fraction:

4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5) <3 (Cl)

Wait, but why is 2 (COOEt) before 1 and 5?

Because substituent 2 is a deactivating o/p director. So, the para fraction would be high, but perhaps less than substituents 1 and 5 because of being deactivating.

Wait, but substituent 1 is activating, so the ring is more reactive, but the directing is o/p. So, substitution at para is more likely, making the para fraction higher.

Wait, but the substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity might influence the amount of para product. For example, a more reactive ring (activating substituents) may lead to more para product.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction depends more on the substituent's directing effect rather than activating or deactivating. Because activating groups make the ring more reactive, leading to more substitution, but the para is more favored due to steric reasons.

Wait, but regardless of activation, if a substituent is o/p directing, the para is a major product.

So, substituent 2 is a deactivating o/p director, so the para fraction is high, but perhaps lower than substituents 1 and 5 which are activating, making the para fraction higher.

So, the order would be:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5) <3 (Cl)

Because substituent 5 is ethyl, a larger substituent than CH3, so para fraction is higher than substituent 1.

Wait, no, substituent 5 is ethyl, which is larger than CH3, so the para fraction would be higher than CH3. So, substituent 5 has a higher para fraction than 1.

So, in this case, substituent 5 would have a higher para fraction than 1.

So, putting them in order from lowest to highest:

4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3

Which would correspond to option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

So, the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, but why is substituent 2 (COOEt) ahead of 1 and 5 in the order?

Because substituent 2 is deactivating, so even though it's o/p directing, the ring is less reactive, leading to less substitution, but the para fraction may not be as high as in activating groups.

Alternatively, the para fraction depends on steric factors more than activation. So, substituent 2 is larger than 1 and 5.

Wait, substituent 2 is COOEt, which is a larger substituent than methyl (1) and ethyl (5). So, the steric hindrance is more, making the para fraction higher.

Wait, but if substituent 2 is an ester group, which is larger than CH3 and C2H5, then perhaps the para fraction is higher in 2 than in 1 and 5.

Hmm, conflicting thoughts here.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction is highest in substituent 3 (Cl), then 5 (C2H5), then 2 (COOEt), then 1 (CH3), then 6 (COOH), then 4 (NO2).

Wait, but that would reverse the order. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction is influenced by both the substituent's directing and its size.

So, substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p directing and larger than CH3, so higher para fraction.

Substituent 5 (C2H5) is o/p directing and larger than CH3, so higher than 1.

Substituent 2 is o/p directing and larger than 5, so higher than 1 and 5.

Wait, but that would make substituent 2 having the highest para fraction.

So, the order would be:

4 <6 <1 <5 <2 <3.

But looking at the options, none of them fit that exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction is determined by the substituent's ability to direct, regardless of deactivating or activating.

So, substituent 4 and 6 have the lowest para fractions. Then, the o/p directors have higher.

Within o/p directors, which have higher para fractions? The activating groups (1 and 5) would have higher para fractions than the deactivating (2 and 3).

So, substituent 5 (activating, ethyl) has higher para than 1 (methyl), because ethyl is bigger.

Substituent 3 (Cl, deactivating, o/p) has higher para than substituent 2 (ester, deactivating, o/p).

So, order: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Which matches option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer in their monobromo derivatives, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring during electrophilic substitution. Substituents can either be activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing), and they can direct incoming electrophiles to ortho, para, or meta positions.

### Substituent Analysis:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**:  
   - **Substituent**: Methyl (-CH3)  
   - **Effect**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.  
   - **Para Fraction**: High, as steric hindrance at the ortho position favors para substitution.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Phenyl Acetate)**:  
   - **Substituent**: Ester (-COOEt)  
   - **Effect**: Deactivating (electron-withdrawing via carbonyl), ortho/para-directing.  
   - **Para Fraction**: High, as the ortho position is sterically hindered, favoring para substitution.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**:  
   - **Substituent**: Chlorine (-Cl)  
   - **Effect**: Deactivating (electron-withdrawing via inductive effect), ortho/para-directing.  
   - **Para Fraction**: High, as steric hindrance at the ortho position favors para substitution.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**:  
   - **Substituent**: Nitro (-NO2)  
   - **Effect**: Strongly deactivating (electron-withdrawing via resonance and inductive effects), meta-directing.  
   - **Para Fraction**: Low, as the nitro group directs substitution to the meta position.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**:  
   - **Substituent**: Ethyl (-C2H5)  
   - **Effect**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.  
   - **Para Fraction**: High, as steric hindrance at the ortho position favors para substitution. Ethyl is bulkier than methyl, so the para fraction is higher than in toluene.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic Acid)**:  
   - **Substituent**: Carboxylic acid (-COOH)  
   - **Effect**: Strongly deactivating (electron-withdrawing via resonance and inductive effects), meta-directing.  
   - **Para Fraction**: Low, as the carboxylic acid group directs substitution to the meta position.

### Order of Increasing Para Fraction:
- **Lowest Para Fraction**: Substituents 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH) are meta-directing, so their para fractions are the lowest.  
- **Next**: Substituent 2 (COOEt) is deactivating but ortho/para-directing, so its para fraction is higher than 4 and 6 but lower than the activating groups.  
- **Higher**: Substituent 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5) are activating and ortho/para-directing. The para fraction is higher for 5 (C2H5) than 1 (CH3) due to steric hindrance at the ortho position.  
- **Highest Para Fraction**: Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but ortho/para-directing, and steric hindrance at the ortho position makes the para fraction the highest among the o/p directors.

### Final Order:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < 3 (Cl)

This corresponds to **Option C**.

ANSWER: C
