Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that the state |3,0,0⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions are governed by the selection rules. Right, the dipole selection rules for the H-atom are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, when an electron transitions from one state to another, its angular momentum (l) can change by 1, and its magnetic quantum number (m) can change by 0, 1, or -1.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So, n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n drops from 3 to 1, but wait, that's a big change in n. Oh, because it's two transitions, so each transition would be a single dipole step.

So from n=3 to n=2, then n=2 to n=1. Because each dipole transition can change n by 1, right? Because if you go from 3 to 1 in one step, that's Δn=2, which isn't allowed for a dipole transition—I think it can only change by ±1 in each step.

So the first transition is from 3,0,0 to 2, something, something. Now, what about l? Initially, l=0 (s orbital). So the first transition must change l by ±1. Since l was 0, it can go to l=1.

So after the first transition, the state is |2,1, m⟩. Now m can change by 0, ±1. So m=0 can go to m=0, +1, or -1. So possible m values after first transition are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the initial m is 0. So the next state must have m=0,1, or -1. So possible states after first transition are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition goes from n=2 to n=1. So again, l must change by ±1. But in the final state, l is 0. So from l=1 in the second state, it can go to l=0 or l=2. But the final state has l=0, so the second transition must change l from 1 to 0. That's allowed.

So the second transition's l changes from 1 to 0, which is Δl=-1, which is allowed.

So the possible first transitions are to |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Now, for each possibility, can the second transition happen?

Let's take each case:

Case 1: First transition to |2,1,1⟩.

Then, the second transition must go from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0, m_final⟩.

Wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m_final here should be 0. So in the second step, m changes from 1 to 0. That's a Δm of -1, which is allowed.

But wait, can the second state l=1 go to l=0? Oh yes, because Δl is -1.

So that's allowed.

Case 2: First transition to |2,1,0⟩.

Then, the second transition would go to |1,0,0⟩. Because m is already 0, so Δm=0, which is allowed. So that's a possible path.

Case 3: First transition to |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition would be from m=-1 to m=0, Δm=+1, which is allowed.

So all three paths are allowed. But wait, what are the probabilities of each transition?

I think the probability is related to the square of the transition dipole moment, which involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something like that. But for hydrogen, I think the transition probability is proportional to the square of the integral of the product of the initial, intermediate, and final state wavefunctions.

Alternatively, another approach: the transition from |n', l', m'| to |n, l, m> is allowed if the matrix element <n l m | r | n' l' m'> is non-zero. The selection rules for dipole transitions are Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1.

But for the transition probabilities, the rate depends on the transition strength. For the hydrogen atom, the transition probability from an initial state to a lower state via two steps would involve each transition's probability multiplied.

Wait, but in this question, the options give the probability as 1/3, 1/4, etc. So perhaps the number of possible paths is involved.

In the first step, from |3,0,0> to any of the |2,1, m> states, where m can be 1, 0, -1. So there are three possible intermediate states.

Each of these intermediate states then can transition to |1,0,0> in the second step.

Wait, but the transition from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0> must satisfy the selection rules again. So for each |2,1, m>, can it transition to |1,0,0>?

Yes, because for each, in the second step, l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl= -1), and m changes from m to 0 (so Δm= -m). So that is allowed.

So there are three such possible two-step paths: 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0; 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0; 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0.

Now, if each of these three paths has the same probability, then the total probability would be the sum of their individual probabilities. Wait, but the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability".

Wait, perhaps each possible first transition has a certain probability, and the second step as well. So the total probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the three possible first steps has a probability of 1/3 each, and each of those leads to a 1/3 chance in the second step? But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> has certain possible m values. The matrix elements for the dipole transitions depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

In the initial state, l=0, so m=0. The dipole operator has components proportional to rY_1^m, so its matrix elements connect states where l changes by 1, and m changes by m.

So the first transition is |3,0,0> → |2,1, m>, where m can be 0, ±1.

Wait, wait, but for the dipole selection rules, the integral is non-zero only when m' = m + m_dipole, but the dipole has m from -1 to +1. So for the initial m=0, the possible m' are 0 + (-1), 0, +1, so 0,1,-1. So yes, the possible first steps are m'=0,1,-1.

Each of these m' would have a certain transition probability.

In hydrogen, the transition probability from |n l m> to |n' l' m'> is proportional to (2l +1)δ_{l±1, l'} and other factors. But for the hydrogen atom, the probability also depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transition. But perhaps for the initial state with m=0, the transition to m' =0,1,-1 would have different probabilities.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l'=1. Hmm, wait, the initial state is l=0, m=0. The dipole operator has l=1. So the transition is 0 →1.

The matrix element <2,1,m | r |3,0,0> is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m}^* Y_0^0 Y_{2}^m ? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_1^m, so the matrix element is ∫ Y_{l', m'}^* Y_{1, m''} Y_{l, m} dΩ.

In our case, the initial state is l=0, m=0. So the matrix element is <2,1,m' | r | 3,0,0>.

Which is proportional to <2,1,m' | Y_1^m'' | 3,0,0>.

Wait, but Y_0^0 is the initial state. So the integral becomes ∫ Y_{1,m''}^* Y_{2,1,m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the spherical harmonics addition. The product Y_{l=0}^0 * Y_{l'=1}^{m''} = something involving Y_{l=1}^{m''}, but the integral will be non-zero only if certain conditions are met.

Wait, but perhaps the selection rule is that the integral is non-zero only if m' = m'' + 0. Because the initial m is 0, and the dipole has m''.

Wait, perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m'' = m'.

Wait, no, because the dipole components have m'' from -1 to +1. So for each dipole component, m'' is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The integral for the matrix element would involve the product of Y_{l=0}^0 and Y_{l'=1}^m''.

The product Y_0^0 Y_1^m'' is proportional to Y_1^m'' plus some other terms from the spherical harmonics multiplication.

Wait, no. The product of two spherical harmonics can be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics with l ranging from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2.

So Y_0^0 * Y_1^m'' is proportional to Y_1^{m''} + ... other terms. So when we integrate Y_{2,1,m'}^* multiplied by this product, the integral will be non-zero only if m' = m''.

So that suggests that for each m', the matrix element is non-zero only when m'' = m'. So for each m', the dipole operator component that contributes is Y_1^{m'}, so the transition is allowed.

So that means for each m' in the first transition, the dipole selection would allow that m'.

But for the probability, the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient will determine the weight. So the transition probabilities for the first step from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m> would be proportional to the square of the CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

Wait, the CG coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is... Hmm, I think when combining two angular momenta, j1 and j2, the CG coefficient for m = m1 + m2 is non-zero only if certain conditions hold.

Wait, in this case, the initial state has l=0, so m=0. The dipole operator has l=1, so m'' can be -1, 0, +1. So the product Y_0^0 Y_1^{m''} would have terms with l from 1 to 1 (since l=0 + l'=1, so l can be 1 only).

So when you take the integral over angles of Y_{2,1,m'}^* Y_0^0 Y_{1,m''}, it's non-zero only if m' = m'' because the product Y_0^0 Y_1^{m''} has m= m''.

Thus, the integral is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So for each m', the transition is allowed only if the dipole operator component Y_1^{m'} is used.

But wait, maybe the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So the first transition can have m' = 0, +1, -1, and each has a certain probability.

But what is the relative probability of each m'?

I think the transition probabilities are given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the l and m transitions.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l=0 (s orbital) and l=1 (p orbital) to get l=1. The CG coefficients for this are known.

The combination of l=0 and l=1 (m=0 and m=1, m=-1) into l=1, m=0,1,-1.

So for each m' in |2,1,m'>, the CG coefficient is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/(4π) ) * something? Wait, I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, for the 3→2 transition, the possible m' are -1, 0, +1.

The square of the CG coefficients for each m' would determine the transition probability.

The CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 are as follows:

For m =1: CG is sqrt( (1)(1+1) ) / sqrt(2(2+1)) )? No, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way. When adding two angular momenta, l1 and l2, to get l = l1 + l2, the CG coefficients are given by:

< l1 m1; l2 m2 | l m >.

In our case, l1=0, m1=0; l2=1, m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

We are adding to get l=1.

So for each m2, what is the CG coefficient?

For m= m1 + m2 = 0 + m2 = m2.

So when l=1, the possible m are -1, 0, +1.

So for each m':

m' = m2, since m = m1 + m2.

Wait, that would suggest that each m' is just m2.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you combine l=0 and l=1, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients for each m' is just 1, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of squares would have to add up to 1.

Wait, perhaps for l=0 and l=1 combining to get l=1:

The CG coefficients for m=1 is 1/sqrt(2), for m=0 is 1/sqrt(2), and for m=-1 is 0? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the possible terms.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m=1) to get l=1, m=1 is 1, because 0 +1=1. Similarly, combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m=0) gives l=1, m=0. And combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m=-1) gives l=1, m=-1.

Wait, but that would imply that each CG coefficient is 1, but the sum of squares must be 1.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again. The CG coefficients for l=0 and l=1 are as follows:

When combining l1=0, m1=0 with l2=1, m2=m', the possible l is 1, and m=l.

So the CG coefficients for each m' are:

For m'=1: <0 0; 1 1 | 1 1> = 1.

For m'=0: <0 0; 1 0 | 1 0> = 1.

For m'=-1: <0 0; 1 -1 | 1 -1> =1.

Wait, but that can't be because then the sum would be 3, which contradicts the normalizations.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the CG coefficients for coupling and recoupling.

Wait, another approach: when combining l1=0 and l2=1, the possible total l are |1-0| to 1+0 → l=1. So the only possible l is 1.

The possible m for l=1 are m=-1, 0, +1.

The CG coefficients for each case would be:

For m=1: the only way is l2=1, m2=1. So CG is 1.

Similarly, for m=0: l2=1, m2=0. CG is 1.

For m=-1: l2=1, m2=-1. CG is 1.

But then the sum of squares would be 3, which is impossible because CG coefficients should normalize to 1.

Wait, so clearly that's not correct. I must be misunderstanding the CG coefficients here. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) for some of them.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the CG coefficients for different couplings. Let me try to look it up in my notes.

Oh wait, I remember that when adding angular momenta, the CG coefficients can be found using recursion relations or known tables. For example, < l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M> where M = m1 + m2, L is the total angular momentum.

In our case, l1=0, m1=0; l2=1, m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

The possible L is 1, and M can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each M:

Case 1: M=1. Then m1=0, m2=1 → M=1.

So CG coefficient <0,0;1,1|1,1> is 1.

Case 2: M=0. Then m1=0, m2=0 → M=0.

So CG coefficient <0,0;1,0|1,0> is 1.

Case3: M=-1. Then m1=0, m2=-1 → M=-1.

So CG coefficient <0,0;1,-1|1,-1> is 1.

But wait, that can't be because each CG coefficient is 1, and when you sum the squares, it would be 3, which is not possible.

Ah, I think I'm making a mistake here. The total number of states for each L must be (2L+1), so for L=1, it's 3 states. But when you combine l1=0 and l2=1, you can only get L=1, and each state is a combination of the product states.

Wait, perhaps the actual CG coefficients are as follows:

For M=1: the only possibility is l2=1, m2=1. So the coefficient is 1.

For M=0: the product states are l2=1, m2=0. So coefficient is 1.

For M=-1: product state is l2=1, m2=-1. Coefficient is 1.

But wait, that would imply that each CG coefficient is 1, which would sum to 3, which is impossible because the CG coefficients must form an orthonormal basis.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of it another way.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The first transition is to |2,1, m⟩. The probability of each transition is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that m.

If the CG coefficients for m=1, 0, -1 are all (1/√3), then each transition would have a probability of 1/3. Because (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are such that the sum of squares is 1.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients for each m' are as follows:

For m'=1: √(2/3)

For m'=0: √(1/3)

For m'=-1: √(0) → no, that can't be.

Wait, another approach: The possible ways to combine l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

The state |1,1⟩ can be formed by |0,0⟩ ⊗ |1,1⟩ multiplied by 1.

The state |1,0⟩ can be formed by |0,0⟩ ⊗ |1,0⟩ multiplied by 1.

The state |1,-1⟩ can be formed by |0,0⟩ ⊗ |1,-1⟩ multiplied by 1.

So each of these states is orthogonal and normalized. So the CG coefficients for each are 1. But that can't be because you can't have three states each with coefficient 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong, and the CG coefficients actually are 1, but that's impossible because the states would not be normalized. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are all 1/√3.

Ah, perhaps each CG coefficient is 1/√3 because there are three possible m's, each equally likely. So the probability for each m' would be (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So each of the three possible first transitions (m=1, 0, -1) would have a probability of 1/3.

So if that's the case, then for each of these three first steps, the probability is 1/3.

Then, in the second step, each of these intermediate states (|2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,-1⟩) must transition to |1,0,0⟩.

What's the probability for each of these second steps?

Again, applying the same logic.

The transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> must follow the selection rules. So l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl = -1), and m changes from m to 0 (Δm = -m).

So for each m in the intermediate state:

- If m=1, then Δm = -1. So the transition is allowed.

- If m=0, Δm=0. Allowed.

- If m=-1, Δm=+1. Allowed.

So each of these transitions is allowed.

Now, the probability for each second transition would depend on the CG coefficients as well.

So the second transition is from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

The matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=1 (m) and l=1 (dipole, m''') to get l=0.

Wait, wait. The dipole operator has l=1, so the second transition is from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

The matrix element would involve the integral of Y_{0,0}^* Y_{1, m''} Y_{1, m}.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the matrix element as:

⟨1,0,0 | r | 2,1,m⟩

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_1^m''.

So the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,m} Y_{2}^{m'}.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the dipole operator has components Y_1^m, so the second transition is allowed when the matrix element <1,0,0 | Y_1^m | 2,1,m>.

Wait, perhaps this is similar to the first transition, but now, the initial state for the second transition is |2,1,m>, and the final is |1,0,0>.

So the matrix element would be proportional to the integral ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,m} Y_{2,1, m'} dΩ.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the exact expression here, but perhaps I can reason based on the CG coefficients.

The transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> is allowed because l changes by -1, and m changes by -m (since 0 - m = -m).

The probability here would again depend on the square of the CG coefficient for this transition.

In this case, the CG coefficient for combining l=1, m and l=1 (dipole) to get l=0, m=0.

Wait, but l=0 can only be formed by combining l=1 and l=1 when their m's sum to 0.

So for each m in |2,1,m>, what is the CG coefficient for transitioning to |1,0,0>?

In this case, dipole operator has components with m'' = -m (since initial m is m, and final m is 0, so Δm = -m).

So for the second transition:

The initial state is |2,1,m>, so m can be 1,0,-1.

The dipole operator has m'' = -m, because the final m is 0.

So the CG coefficient for this transition would be something.

Wait, when combining l=1 (initial) and l=1 (dipole), the possible total l is |1-1|=0 or 1 or 2.

But in the case of a transition to l=0, the CG coefficient for combining l=1 (m) and l=1 (m'') to get l=0, m=0.

The only possible way for m + m'' = 0. Since the final m is 0, m'' = -m.

So for each m in the initial state, the dipole component that contributes is Y_1^{-m}.

So for m=1 in the initial state, the dipole component is Y_1^{-1}.

The CG coefficient for combining Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1} to get Y_{0,0}.

Wait, the CG coefficient for combining (l1=1, m1=1) and (l2=1, m2=-1) to get (l=0, m=0) is 1/sqrt(2) because:

Y_0^0 = (Y_1^1 Y_1^{-1} + Y_1^{-1} Y_1^1 ) / something?

Wait, another approach: when l1=1, m1=1 and l2=1, m2=-1, their product can form a state with L=0, M=0.

The CG coefficient for this is 1/sqrt(2) because:

The state |0,0> can be expressed as (|1,1> |1,-1> + |1,-1> |1,1> ) / sqrt(2), but I'm not quite sure.

Wait, no, the CG coefficient for combining two angular momenta to get a total state is given by:

< l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M >.

In this case, l1=1, m1=1; l2=1, m2=-1.

We're interested in L=0, M=0.

The CG coefficient here is 1/sqrt(2) because:

The state |0,0> can be written as 1/sqrt(2) ( |1,1> |1,-1> - |1,-1> |1,1> ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think the CG coefficient for combining m1=1 and m2=-1 to get M=0 is 1/sqrt(2), because the only way to get M=0 is to have m1 + m2 =0.

So for the transition where the initial m is 1, the dipole component is m''=-1. The CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for initial m=0 in |2,1,0⟩, the dipole component is m''=0. So the CG coefficient is 1 because combining m=0 and m''=0 with L=0.

Wait, no. Because L=0, M=0 can only be formed in one way: combining m=0 and m''=0. So the CG coefficient would be 1.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the two states |1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩ combine to form |0,0⟩, but I'm not sure about the coefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps for m=0, the CG coefficient is 1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to make a table.

For the second transition (from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>):

- If m=1:

The transition requires dipole component m'' = -1.

The CG coefficient for combining m=1 and m''=-1 to get M=0 is 1/sqrt(2).

So the transition probability would be (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but the matrix element would be proportional to that, so the probability would be 1/2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct.

- If m=0:

The dipole component is m'' = 0.

The CG coefficient is 1 because combining m=0 and m''=0 gives M=0.

So the transition probability is 1^2 =1.

- If m=-1:

The dipole component is m''=1.

The CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2) because combining m=-1 and m''=1 gives M=0.

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So now, putting it all together:

The first step has three possible transitions, each with probability 1/3.

Each of these leads to a second step with probabilities:

- For m=1 in the first step: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

- For m=0 in the first step: 1/3 * 1 = 1/3.

- For m=-1 in the first step: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the total probability is the sum of these: 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/6.

Which is (1 + 2 + 1)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.

Wait, but that can't be right because two of the transitions contribute 1/6 each, and the middle one contributes 1/3 (which is 2/6).

So 1/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.

So the total probability is 2/3.

But looking at the options, option D says the probability is 2/3, with the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.

But wait, that's just one possible path. The question states that the transition is via two dipole transitions, implying that it's a two-step process, but which path is taken? Because the options list specific paths.

Wait, the options are giving the transition routes and the probabilities. So which option correctly represents a possible path and has the correct total probability.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1>, then → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1>, then → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option D: → |2,1,0>, then → |1,0,0>, probability 2/3.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that the total probability for all possible paths is 2/3 when considering all possible first steps.

But the options suggest that each option is a specific path, not the sum of all possible paths.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking about a particular transition route, not the sum of all possible routes. So perhaps each option represents a specific route, and the probability given is for that specific route.

In that case, the probabilities of each route are as follows:

- Route via |2,1,1>:

Probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

- Route via |2,1,0>:

Probability is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.

- Route via |2,1,-1>:

Probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the probabilities for each route are 1/6, 1/3, and 1/6.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says the route is via |2,1,0> and the probability is 2/3.

But the route via |2,1,0> only contributes 1/3 to the total probability. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that each first transition has equal probability.

Wait, perhaps the first transition's probabilities are not all 1/3. Maybe the CG coefficients for the first transition are different.

Earlier, I assumed each first transition (m=1,0,-1) has probability 1/3 because the CG coefficients were all (1/√3). But maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient for m=0 is different. Let me think: when combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

The state |1,0> would be a combination of Y_0^0 * Y_1^0. But wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients for m=0 is higher because it's the only m that doesn't change the m value.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe a better approach is to think about the possible dipole transitions and the selection rules.

But perhaps another approach: in the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, what is the possible m and their probabilities?

The dipole operator can cause the transition for any m' = m + m_dipole, where m_dipole can be -1,0,+1.

Wait, but the initial state has m=0. So the possible m's after the transition are 0,1,-1.

Each of these has an equal probability because the dipole operator is symmetric in m.

So each m' has a probability of 1/3.

So the probability for each first transition is 1/3.

Then, in the second transition, the probability depends on the m of the intermediate state.

As calculated earlier, the transition probabilities are:

- For m=1: 1/2.

- For m=0: 1.

- For m=-1: 1/2.

So the total probability for each path is:

- Path 1→2,1,1 →1,0,0: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

- Path 1→2,1,0 →1,0,0: (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.

- Path 1→2,1,-1 →1,0,0: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Thus, the total probability is 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/3.

But the question seems to be asking about the specific route and the probability for that route, not the total.

Looking back at the question: it says "the transition route and the corresponding probability".

So the options are giving specific routes (i.e., specific intermediate states) and their probabilities.

So for each option, I need to calculate the probability for that particular two-step path.

Option D: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>. The probability is 2/3.

But earlier, I calculated that the probability for this specific route is 1/3.

So the option with this route and probability 1/3 would be correct, but none of the options say that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> with probability 1/3.

Yes, that's what I calculated for this specific route.

So for option A, the probability is 1/3.

Similarly, options B and C have probabilities 1/4, which doesn't match my calculation.

Option D has probability 2/3 for the same route as option A, which would be incorrect.

So the correct option would be option A, which states the route via |2,1,0> and has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but the question states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions. So the probability given in the option is the probability for that specific two-step path.

So the correct answer would be option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Wait, but earlier I thought the total probability including all paths is 2/3, but the question is about the specific path's probability, not the total.

So if the question is asking which transition route (specific intermediate state) and its probability, then option A is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A) The route is via |2,1,0>, with probability 1/3.

Which matches my calculation for that specific path.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions, with the goal of identifying the correct transition route and its corresponding probability. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Selection Rules**: Dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom follow the selection rules:
   - Δl = ±1 (change in angular momentum).
   - Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number).

2. **First Transition**: The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0). The first transition must satisfy Δl = ±1, so the intermediate state must have l=1. Additionally, Δm = 0, ±1, so the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. Each of these transitions is equally likely, with a probability of 1/3 for each.

3. **Second Transition**: From the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the second transition must satisfy Δl = ±1, so the final state must have l=0. Additionally, Δm = -m (to reach m=0 in the final state |1,0,0⟩). The probabilities for the second transition depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:
   - For |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the probability is 1/2.
   - For |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the probability is 1.
   - For |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the probability is 1/2.

4. **Total Probability for Each Route**:
   - |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: Total probability = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6.
   - |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: Total probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.
   - |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: Total probability = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6.

5. **Interpretation of the Question**: The question asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability for that specific route, not the total probability across all routes. Among the options, only option A correctly identifies the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and assigns it the correct probability of 1/3.

6. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Correct. The route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a probability of 1/3.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a probability of 1/6, not 1/4.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a probability of 1/6, not 1/4.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is correct, the probability is 1/3, not 2/3.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that the state |3,0,0⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions are governed by the selection rules. Right, the dipole selection rules for the H-atom are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, when an electron transitions from one state to another, its angular momentum (l) can change by 1, and its magnetic quantum number (m) can change by 0, 1, or -1.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So, n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n drops from 3 to 1, but wait, that's a big change in n. Oh, because it's two transitions, so each transition would be a single dipole step.

So from n=3 to n=2, then n=2 to n=1. Because each dipole transition can change n by 1, right? Because if you go from 3 to 1 in one step, that's Δn=2, which isn't allowed for a dipole transition—I think it can only change by ±1 in each step.

So the first transition is from 3,0,0 to 2, something, something. Now, what about l? Initially, l=0 (s orbital). So the first transition must change l by ±1. Since l was 0, it can go to l=1.

So after the first transition, the state is |2,1, m⟩. Now m can change by 0, ±1. So m=0 can go to m=0, +1, or -1. So possible m values after first transition are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the initial m is 0. So the next state must have m=0,1, or -1. So possible states after first transition are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition goes from n=2 to n=1. So again, l must change by ±1. But in the final state, l is 0. So from l=1 in the second state, it can go to l=0 or l=2. But the final state has l=0, so the second transition must change l from 1 to 0. That's allowed.

So the second transition's l changes from 1 to 0, which is Δl=-1, which is allowed.

So the possible first transitions are to |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Now, for each possibility, can the second transition happen?

Let's take each case:

Case 1: First transition to |2,1,1⟩.

Then, the second transition must go from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0, m_final⟩.

Wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m_final here should be 0. So in the second step, m changes from 1 to 0. That's a Δm of -1, which is allowed.

But wait, can the second state l=1 go to l=0? Oh yes, because Δl is -1.

So that's allowed.

Case 2: First transition to |2,1,0⟩.

Then, the second transition would go to |1,0,0⟩. Because m is already 0, so Δm=0, which is allowed. So that's a possible path.

Case 3: First transition to |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition would be from m=-1 to m=0, Δm=+1, which is allowed.

So all three paths are allowed. But wait, what are the probabilities of each transition?

I think the probability is related to the square of the transition dipole moment, which involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something like that. But for hydrogen, I think the transition probability is proportional to the square of the integral of the product of the initial, intermediate, and final state wavefunctions.

Alternatively, another approach: the transition from |n', l', m'| to |n, l, m> is allowed if the matrix element <n l m | r | n' l' m'> is non-zero. The selection rules for dipole transitions are Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1.

But for the transition probabilities, the rate depends on the transition strength. For the hydrogen atom, the transition probability from an initial state to a lower state via two steps would involve each transition's probability multiplied.

Wait, but in this question, the options give the probability as 1/3, 1/4, etc. So perhaps the number of possible paths is involved.

In the first step, from |3,0,0> to any of the |2,1, m> states, where m can be 1, 0, -1. So there are three possible intermediate states.

Each of these intermediate states then can transition to |1,0,0> in the second step.

Wait, but the transition from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0> must satisfy the selection rules again. So for each |2,1, m>, can it transition to |1,0,0>?

Yes, because for each, in the second step, l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl= -1), and m changes from m to 0 (so Δm= -m). So that is allowed.

So there are three such possible two-step paths: 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0; 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0; 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0.

Now, if each of these three paths has the same probability, then the total probability would be the sum of their individual probabilities. Wait, but the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability".

Wait, perhaps each possible first transition has a certain probability, and the second step as well. So the total probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the three possible first steps has a probability of 1/3 each, and each of those leads to a 1/3 chance in the second step? But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> has certain possible m values. The matrix elements for the dipole transitions depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

In the initial state, l=0, so m=0. The dipole operator has components proportional to rY_1^m, so its matrix elements connect states where l changes by 1, and m changes by m.

So the first transition is |3,0,0> → |2,1, m>, where m can be 0, ±1.

Wait, wait, but for the dipole selection rules, the integral is non-zero only when m' = m + m_dipole, but the dipole has m from -1 to +1. So for the initial m=0, the possible m' are 0 + (-1), 0, +1, so 0,1,-1. So yes, the possible first steps are m'=0,1,-1.

Each of these m' would have a certain transition probability.

In hydrogen, the transition probability from |n l m> to |n' l' m'> is proportional to (2l +1)δ_{l±1, l'} and other factors. But for the hydrogen atom, the probability also depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transition. But perhaps for the initial state with m=0, the transition to m' =0,1,-1 would have different probabilities.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l'=1. Hmm, wait, the initial state is l=0, m=0. The dipole operator has l=1. So the transition is 0 →1.

The matrix element <2,1,m | r |3,0,0> is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m}^* Y_0^0 Y_{2}^m ? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_1^m, so the matrix element is ∫ Y_{l', m'}^* Y_{1, m''} Y_{l, m} dΩ.

In our case, the initial state is l=0, m=0. So the matrix element is <2,1,m' | r | 3,0,0>.

Which is proportional to <2,1,m' | Y_1^m'' | 3,0,0>.

Wait, but Y_0^0 is the initial state. So the integral becomes ∫ Y_{1,m''}^* Y_{2,1,m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the spherical harmonics addition. The product Y_{l=0}^0 * Y_{l'=1}^{m''} = something involving Y_{l=1}^{m''}, but the integral will be non-zero only if certain conditions are met.

Wait, but perhaps the selection rule is that the integral is non-zero only if m' = m'' + 0. Because the initial m is 0, and the dipole has m''.

Wait, perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m'' = m'.

Wait, no, because the dipole components have m'' from -1 to +1. So for each dipole component, m'' is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The integral for the matrix element would involve the product of Y_{l=0}^0 and Y_{l'=1}^m''.

The product Y_0^0 Y_1^m'' is proportional to Y_1^m'' plus some other terms from the spherical harmonics multiplication.

Wait, no. The product of two spherical harmonics can be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics with l ranging from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2.

So Y_0^0 * Y_1^m'' is proportional to Y_1^{m''} + ... other terms. So when we integrate Y_{2,1,m'}^* multiplied by this product, the integral will be non-zero only if m' = m''.

So that suggests that for each m', the matrix element is non-zero only when m'' = m'. So for each m', the dipole operator component that contributes is Y_1^{m'}, so the transition is allowed.

So that means for each m' in the first transition, the dipole selection would allow that m'.

But for the probability, the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient will determine the weight. So the transition probabilities for the first step from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m> would be proportional to the square of the CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

Wait, the CG coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is... Hmm, I think when combining two angular momenta, j1 and j2, the CG coefficient for m = m1 + m2 is non-zero only if certain conditions hold.

Wait, in this case, the initial state has l=0, so m=0. The dipole operator has l=1, so m'' can be -1, 0, +1. So the product Y_0^0 Y_1^{m''} would have terms with l from 1 to 1 (since l=0 + l'=1, so l can be 1 only).

So when you take the integral over angles of Y_{2,1,m'}^* Y_0^0 Y_{1,m''}, it's non-zero only if m' = m'' because the product Y_0^0 Y_1^{m''} has m= m''.

Thus, the integral is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So for each m', the transition is allowed only if the dipole operator component Y_1^{m'} is used.

But wait, maybe the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So the first transition can have m' = 0, +1, -1, and each has a certain probability.

But what is the relative probability of each m'?

I think the transition probabilities are given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the l and m transitions.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l=0 (s orbital) and l=1 (p orbital) to get l=1. The CG coefficients for this are known.

The combination of l=0 and l=1 (m=0 and m=1, m=-1) into l=1, m=0,1,-1.

So for each m' in |2,1,m'>, the CG coefficient is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/(4π) ) * something? Wait, I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, for the 3→2 transition, the possible m' are -1, 0, +1.

The square of the CG coefficients for each m' would determine the transition probability.

The CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 are as follows:

For m =1: CG is sqrt( (1)(1+1) ) / sqrt(2(2+1)) )? No, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way. When adding two angular momenta, l1 and l2, to get l = l1 + l2, the CG coefficients are given by:

< l1 m1; l2 m2 | l m >.

In our case, l1=0, m1=0; l2=1, m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

We are adding to get l=1.

So for each m2, what is the CG coefficient?

For m= m1 + m2 = 0 + m2 = m2.

So when l=1, the possible m are -1, 0, +1.

So for each m':

m' = m2, since m = m1 + m2.

Wait, that would suggest that each m' is just m2.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you combine l=0 and l=1, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients for each m' is just 1, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of squares would have to add up to 1.

Wait, perhaps for l=0 and l=1 combining to get l=1:

The CG coefficients for m=1 is 1/sqrt(2), for m=0 is 1/sqrt(2), and for m=-1 is 0? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the possible terms.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m=1) to get l=1, m=1 is 1, because 0 +1=1. Similarly, combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m=0) gives l=1, m=0. And combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m=-1) gives l=1, m=-1.

Wait, but that would imply that each CG coefficient is 1, but the sum of squares must be 1.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again. The CG coefficients for l=0 and l=1 are as follows:

When combining l1=0, m1=0 with l2=1, m2=m', the possible l is 1, and m=l.

So the CG coefficients for each m' are:

For m'=1: <0 0; 1 1 | 1 1> = 1.

For m'=0: <0 0; 1 0 | 1 0> = 1.

For m'=-1: <0 0; 1 -1 | 1 -1> =1.

Wait, but that can't be because then the sum would be 3, which contradicts the normalizations.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the CG coefficients for coupling and recoupling.

Wait, another approach: when combining l1=0 and l2=1, the possible total l are |1-0| to 1+0 → l=1. So the only possible l is 1.

The possible m for l=1 are m=-1, 0, +1.

The CG coefficients for each case would be:

For m=1: the only way is l2=1, m2=1. So CG is 1.

Similarly, for m=0: l2=1, m2=0. CG is 1.

For m=-1: l2=1, m2=-1. CG is 1.

But then the sum of squares would be 3, which is impossible because CG coefficients should normalize to 1.

Wait, so clearly that's not correct. I must be misunderstanding the CG coefficients here. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) for some of them.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the CG coefficients for different couplings. Let me try to look it up in my notes.

Oh wait, I remember that when adding angular momenta, the CG coefficients can be found using recursion relations or known tables. For example, < l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M> where M = m1 + m2, L is the total angular momentum.

In our case, l1=0, m1=0; l2=1, m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

The possible L is 1, and M can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each M:

Case 1: M=1. Then m1=0, m2=1 → M=1.

So CG coefficient <0,0;1,1|1,1> is 1.

Case 2: M=0. Then m1=0, m2=0 → M=0.

So CG coefficient <0,0;1,0|1,0> is 1.

Case3: M=-1. Then m1=0, m2=-1 → M=-1.

So CG coefficient <0,0;1,-1|1,-1> is 1.

But wait, that can't be because each CG coefficient is 1, and when you sum the squares, it would be 3, which is not possible.

Ah, I think I'm making a mistake here. The total number of states for each L must be (2L+1), so for L=1, it's 3 states. But when you combine l1=0 and l2=1, you can only get L=1, and each state is a combination of the product states.

Wait, perhaps the actual CG coefficients are as follows:

For M=1: the only possibility is l2=1, m2=1. So the coefficient is 1.

For M=0: the product states are l2=1, m2=0. So coefficient is 1.

For M=-1: product state is l2=1, m2=-1. Coefficient is 1.

But wait, that would imply that each CG coefficient is 1, which would sum to 3, which is impossible because the CG coefficients must form an orthonormal basis.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of it another way.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The first transition is to |2,1, m⟩. The probability of each transition is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that m.

If the CG coefficients for m=1, 0, -1 are all (1/√3), then each transition would have a probability of 1/3. Because (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are such that the sum of squares is 1.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients for each m' are as follows:

For m'=1: √(2/3)

For m'=0: √(1/3)

For m'=-1: √(0) → no, that can't be.

Wait, another approach: The possible ways to combine l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

The state |1,1⟩ can be formed by |0,0⟩ ⊗ |1,1⟩ multiplied by 1.

The state |1,0⟩ can be formed by |0,0⟩ ⊗ |1,0⟩ multiplied by 1.

The state |1,-1⟩ can be formed by |0,0⟩ ⊗ |1,-1⟩ multiplied by 1.

So each of these states is orthogonal and normalized. So the CG coefficients for each are 1. But that can't be because you can't have three states each with coefficient 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong, and the CG coefficients actually are 1, but that's impossible because the states would not be normalized. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are all 1/√3.

Ah, perhaps each CG coefficient is 1/√3 because there are three possible m's, each equally likely. So the probability for each m' would be (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So each of the three possible first transitions (m=1, 0, -1) would have a probability of 1/3.

So if that's the case, then for each of these three first steps, the probability is 1/3.

Then, in the second step, each of these intermediate states (|2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,-1⟩) must transition to |1,0,0⟩.

What's the probability for each of these second steps?

Again, applying the same logic.

The transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> must follow the selection rules. So l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl = -1), and m changes from m to 0 (Δm = -m).

So for each m in the intermediate state:

- If m=1, then Δm = -1. So the transition is allowed.

- If m=0, Δm=0. Allowed.

- If m=-1, Δm=+1. Allowed.

So each of these transitions is allowed.

Now, the probability for each second transition would depend on the CG coefficients as well.

So the second transition is from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

The matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=1 (m) and l=1 (dipole, m''') to get l=0.

Wait, wait. The dipole operator has l=1, so the second transition is from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

The matrix element would involve the integral of Y_{0,0}^* Y_{1, m''} Y_{1, m}.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the matrix element as:

⟨1,0,0 | r | 2,1,m⟩

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_1^m''.

So the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,m} Y_{2}^{m'}.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the dipole operator has components Y_1^m, so the second transition is allowed when the matrix element <1,0,0 | Y_1^m | 2,1,m>.

Wait, perhaps this is similar to the first transition, but now, the initial state for the second transition is |2,1,m>, and the final is |1,0,0>.

So the matrix element would be proportional to the integral ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,m} Y_{2,1, m'} dΩ.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the exact expression here, but perhaps I can reason based on the CG coefficients.

The transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> is allowed because l changes by -1, and m changes by -m (since 0 - m = -m).

The probability here would again depend on the square of the CG coefficient for this transition.

In this case, the CG coefficient for combining l=1, m and l=1 (dipole) to get l=0, m=0.

Wait, but l=0 can only be formed by combining l=1 and l=1 when their m's sum to 0.

So for each m in |2,1,m>, what is the CG coefficient for transitioning to |1,0,0>?

In this case, dipole operator has components with m'' = -m (since initial m is m, and final m is 0, so Δm = -m).

So for the second transition:

The initial state is |2,1,m>, so m can be 1,0,-1.

The dipole operator has m'' = -m, because the final m is 0.

So the CG coefficient for this transition would be something.

Wait, when combining l=1 (initial) and l=1 (dipole), the possible total l is |1-1|=0 or 1 or 2.

But in the case of a transition to l=0, the CG coefficient for combining l=1 (m) and l=1 (m'') to get l=0, m=0.

The only possible way for m + m'' = 0. Since the final m is 0, m'' = -m.

So for each m in the initial state, the dipole component that contributes is Y_1^{-m}.

So for m=1 in the initial state, the dipole component is Y_1^{-1}.

The CG coefficient for combining Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1} to get Y_{0,0}.

Wait, the CG coefficient for combining (l1=1, m1=1) and (l2=1, m2=-1) to get (l=0, m=0) is 1/sqrt(2) because:

Y_0^0 = (Y_1^1 Y_1^{-1} + Y_1^{-1} Y_1^1 ) / something?

Wait, another approach: when l1=1, m1=1 and l2=1, m2=-1, their product can form a state with L=0, M=0.

The CG coefficient for this is 1/sqrt(2) because:

The state |0,0> can be expressed as (|1,1> |1,-1> + |1,-1> |1,1> ) / sqrt(2), but I'm not quite sure.

Wait, no, the CG coefficient for combining two angular momenta to get a total state is given by:

< l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M >.

In this case, l1=1, m1=1; l2=1, m2=-1.

We're interested in L=0, M=0.

The CG coefficient here is 1/sqrt(2) because:

The state |0,0> can be written as 1/sqrt(2) ( |1,1> |1,-1> - |1,-1> |1,1> ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think the CG coefficient for combining m1=1 and m2=-1 to get M=0 is 1/sqrt(2), because the only way to get M=0 is to have m1 + m2 =0.

So for the transition where the initial m is 1, the dipole component is m''=-1. The CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for initial m=0 in |2,1,0⟩, the dipole component is m''=0. So the CG coefficient is 1 because combining m=0 and m''=0 with L=0.

Wait, no. Because L=0, M=0 can only be formed in one way: combining m=0 and m''=0. So the CG coefficient would be 1.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the two states |1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩ combine to form |0,0⟩, but I'm not sure about the coefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps for m=0, the CG coefficient is 1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to make a table.

For the second transition (from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>):

- If m=1:

The transition requires dipole component m'' = -1.

The CG coefficient for combining m=1 and m''=-1 to get M=0 is 1/sqrt(2).

So the transition probability would be (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but the matrix element would be proportional to that, so the probability would be 1/2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct.

- If m=0:

The dipole component is m'' = 0.

The CG coefficient is 1 because combining m=0 and m''=0 gives M=0.

So the transition probability is 1^2 =1.

- If m=-1:

The dipole component is m''=1.

The CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2) because combining m=-1 and m''=1 gives M=0.

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So now, putting it all together:

The first step has three possible transitions, each with probability 1/3.

Each of these leads to a second step with probabilities:

- For m=1 in the first step: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

- For m=0 in the first step: 1/3 * 1 = 1/3.

- For m=-1 in the first step: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the total probability is the sum of these: 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/6.

Which is (1 + 2 + 1)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.

Wait, but that can't be right because two of the transitions contribute 1/6 each, and the middle one contributes 1/3 (which is 2/6).

So 1/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.

So the total probability is 2/3.

But looking at the options, option D says the probability is 2/3, with the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.

But wait, that's just one possible path. The question states that the transition is via two dipole transitions, implying that it's a two-step process, but which path is taken? Because the options list specific paths.

Wait, the options are giving the transition routes and the probabilities. So which option correctly represents a possible path and has the correct total probability.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1>, then → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1>, then → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option D: → |2,1,0>, then → |1,0,0>, probability 2/3.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that the total probability for all possible paths is 2/3 when considering all possible first steps.

But the options suggest that each option is a specific path, not the sum of all possible paths.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking about a particular transition route, not the sum of all possible routes. So perhaps each option represents a specific route, and the probability given is for that specific route.

In that case, the probabilities of each route are as follows:

- Route via |2,1,1>:

Probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

- Route via |2,1,0>:

Probability is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.

- Route via |2,1,-1>:

Probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the probabilities for each route are 1/6, 1/3, and 1/6.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says the route is via |2,1,0> and the probability is 2/3.

But the route via |2,1,0> only contributes 1/3 to the total probability. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that each first transition has equal probability.

Wait, perhaps the first transition's probabilities are not all 1/3. Maybe the CG coefficients for the first transition are different.

Earlier, I assumed each first transition (m=1,0,-1) has probability 1/3 because the CG coefficients were all (1/√3). But maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient for m=0 is different. Let me think: when combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

The state |1,0> would be a combination of Y_0^0 * Y_1^0. But wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients for m=0 is higher because it's the only m that doesn't change the m value.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe a better approach is to think about the possible dipole transitions and the selection rules.

But perhaps another approach: in the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, what is the possible m and their probabilities?

The dipole operator can cause the transition for any m' = m + m_dipole, where m_dipole can be -1,0,+1.

Wait, but the initial state has m=0. So the possible m's after the transition are 0,1,-1.

Each of these has an equal probability because the dipole operator is symmetric in m.

So each m' has a probability of 1/3.

So the probability for each first transition is 1/3.

Then, in the second transition, the probability depends on the m of the intermediate state.

As calculated earlier, the transition probabilities are:

- For m=1: 1/2.

- For m=0: 1.

- For m=-1: 1/2.

So the total probability for each path is:

- Path 1→2,1,1 →1,0,0: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

- Path 1→2,1,0 →1,0,0: (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.

- Path 1→2,1,-1 →1,0,0: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Thus, the total probability is 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/3.

But the question seems to be asking about the specific route and the probability for that route, not the total.

Looking back at the question: it says "the transition route and the corresponding probability".

So the options are giving specific routes (i.e., specific intermediate states) and their probabilities.

So for each option, I need to calculate the probability for that particular two-step path.

Option D: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>. The probability is 2/3.

But earlier, I calculated that the probability for this specific route is 1/3.

So the option with this route and probability 1/3 would be correct, but none of the options say that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> with probability 1/3.

Yes, that's what I calculated for this specific route.

So for option A, the probability is 1/3.

Similarly, options B and C have probabilities 1/4, which doesn't match my calculation.

Option D has probability 2/3 for the same route as option A, which would be incorrect.

So the correct option would be option A, which states the route via |2,1,0> and has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but the question states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions. So the probability given in the option is the probability for that specific two-step path.

So the correct answer would be option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Wait, but earlier I thought the total probability including all paths is 2/3, but the question is about the specific path's probability, not the total.

So if the question is asking which transition route (specific intermediate state) and its probability, then option A is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A) The route is via |2,1,0>, with probability 1/3.

Which matches my calculation for that specific path.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions, with the goal of identifying the correct transition route and its corresponding probability. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Selection Rules**: Dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom follow the selection rules:
   - Δl = ±1 (change in angular momentum).
   - Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number).

2. **First Transition**: The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0). The first transition must satisfy Δl = ±1, so the intermediate state must have l=1. Additionally, Δm = 0, ±1, so the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. Each of these transitions is equally likely, with a probability of 1/3 for each.

3. **Second Transition**: From the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the second transition must satisfy Δl = ±1, so the final state must have l=0. Additionally, Δm = -m (to reach m=0 in the final state |1,0,0⟩). The probabilities for the second transition depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:
   - For |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the probability is 1/2.
   - For |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the probability is 1.
   - For |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the probability is 1/2.

4. **Total Probability for Each Route**:
   - |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: Total probability = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6.
   - |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: Total probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.
   - |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: Total probability = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6.

5. **Interpretation of the Question**: The question asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability for that specific route, not the total probability across all routes. Among the options, only option A correctly identifies the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and assigns it the correct probability of 1/3.

6. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Correct. The route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a probability of 1/3.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a probability of 1/6, not 1/4.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a probability of 1/6, not 1/4.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is correct, the probability is 1/3, not 2/3.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
