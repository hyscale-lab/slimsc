Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. The question is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Each compound is an aromatic with substituents. Let me think—since each compound is C10H14 and the mixture is 1:1, but the NMR shows two singlets for the aromatic protons. Oh, right, because each compound contributes their own aromatic signals, but in the mixture, they're each a singlet because their protons are equivalent in their own structure.

Wait, but the aromatic region. So for each compound, all the aromatic protons are equivalent, so each would show as a singlet. So the two singlets in the NMR (each integrating to 1:1) probably correspond to the two different compounds. Because if, say, one compound had more aromatic protons, but here both have the same integration ratio as they're in a 1:1 mixture. So each of the two compounds has only one type of aromatic proton, leading to two singlets.

Now, looking at the options. Let's list each compound's structure.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. So for 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, that's a benzene ring with four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, but that's a crowded structure—is that even possible? Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta arrangement. Wait, no, 1,2,3,4 would be adjacent in a ring, but that's four substituents next to each other. Hmm, maybe it's a 1,2,3,4 positions, but that's four substituents in a row, which is maybe a para arrangement? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl structure, which is a naphthalene derivative? No, wait, wait—the molecular formula is C10H14. Each compound is C10H14? Wait, no—the molecular formula of each compound is C10H14, right? So each is a benzene ring with four substituents, each a methyl group. Because benzene is C6H6. Adding four methyl groups (each CH3) gives 6 + 4*1 = 10 carbons, and 6 H from benzene minus 4 H (since each CH3 adds 3 H) plus 4*3 H. Let me calculate: Benzene has 6 H. Each methyl adds 3 H, but replaces one H on the ring. So 4 methyl groups would replace 4 H. So total H: 6 -4 +4*3= 6-4+12=14. Yes, that matches C10H14. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, with four methyl groups.

Wait, but tetramethylbenzene could have different substitution patterns. Let's think about each option.

The NMR aromatic signals are two singlets, each integrating to 1:1 ratio, which suggests that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton. If that's the case, each compound must have some symmetry where all aromatic protons are equivalent.

So for a tetramethylbenzene, when would all the aromatic protons be equivalent? Let me think about the possible structures.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,4,5 would have methyl groups around the ring. Let me visualize. Positions 1,2,4,5: so that's positions 1,2, then 4 and 5. So 1 is next to 2 and 6; 2 is next to 1,3; 4 is next to 3,5; 5 is next to 4 and 6. Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that each aromatic proton is equivalent. Alternatively, maybe the structure is para-substituted in some way.

Wait, but for a tetramethylbenzene with all aromatic protons equivalent, the substituents must be arranged symmetrically. Like, for example, if the four methyl groups are placed symmetrically, such that the ring has a certain symmetry, making all remaining protons equivalent.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are arranged such that the ring becomes a certain symmetry. For example, if they are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making all the remaining H equivalent.

Let me think about each of the options.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

1,2,4,5: So positions 1,2,4,5 on the benzene. Let me draw this. 1,2 are adjacent, then 4 and 5 are adjacent. So 1,2 are next to each other, and 4,5 are next to each other. So the structure would have two pairs of adjacent substituents. What's the symmetry?

Wait, maybe the molecule is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl benzene. Let me imagine the benzene ring: positions 1,2,4,5. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, then positions 4 and 5 are adjacent. So between 2 and 3 is a H, then 3 and 4 are adjacent? Wait, perhaps it's a ring where substituents are at 1,2,4,5, which are in a way that creates a certain symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl benzene, which is a 2,3-dimethyl and 4,5-dimethyl arrangement? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the symmetry. For each compound, the aromatic protons would be equivalent only if the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Let me think about each option:

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

What's the structure of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene? Let me number the ring:

Positions 1, 2, 4,5 have methyl groups.

So imagine a benzene ring:

1: methyl

2: methyl

3: H

4: methyl

5: methyl

6: H

Wait, so the substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So the substituents are adjacent in two pairs. Is this structure symmetric? Let me check.

If you draw it, between positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 4 and 5 are adjacent. So the substituents are at 1,2 and 4,5.

Now, what's the symmetry here? Let me imagine a mirror plane. If I imagine a vertical mirror through the center, perhaps from position 6 to position 3. Would that cause any symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a four-fold symmetry. No, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the ring's H's are at equivalent positions.

Wait, but in this structure, the H's would be at positions 3 and 6. Are they equivalent?

Yes, because the substituents are in a symmetric arrangement. Because the structure is symmetric along an axis that passes through positions 3 and 6. So, the H at 3 and 6 would be equivalent, so the NMR would show a singlet.

So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic protons are at positions 3 and 6, which are equivalent. So in the NMR, this would show as a singlet integrating for two H. But wait, wait, the mixture is 1:1, so each compound contributes their own aromatic protons. So if each compound has two aromatic H (but they're equivalent), each would show a singlet with integration 2:1 ratio (since each is 1:1 in the mixture). Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm, each integrating to 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet with integral 1 (since the mixture is 1:1). So each compound must have two equivalent aromatic protons, each. Because each would contribute 2 H, but in the NMR, each would be a singlet integrating to 1 (because 2 H per compound, but each is 50% of the mixture, so 2 * 0.5 = 1).

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each compound has two aromatic protons, which are equivalent, so each would give a singlet integrating to 2 H. But since both compounds are present in a 1:1 ratio, the overall integration would be 2 for each, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, the question says: two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio. So the integration of each is 1. That would suggest that each compound has one equivalent aromatic proton, but that can't be right because each benzene ring with four substituents would have two H's. Unless I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps each compound has four substituents, so each ring has two H. So each compound contributes a singlet with 2 H, and since the mixture is 1:1, each would be 2 H, but the NMR shows two singlets each integrating to 1 H. That doesn't add up.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The NMR shows two singlets, each integrating to 1:1. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each singlet would correspond to one of the compounds. So each compound must contribute an equal number of aromatic H's, and each would integrate to 1 in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps each compound has two equivalent aromatic H, so each singlet integrates to 2, but the two compounds together would be 4 H. But the question says the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet would be 1 H. That suggests each compound has one H, which can't be, because four substituents would leave two H's on the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituents are in such a way that all the aromatic H's are equivalent but there are four substituents, so that each ring has two H's. So each compound contributes 2 H, each as a singlet. But in the NMR, the two singlets would each have integration 2, but since the mixture is 1:1, each would be 1, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons, so each would show as a singlet integrating to 2 H. But the problem says the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio, so each would integrate to 1. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the other part of the NMR: the three signals at 2.2 ppm. They are all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

So these are likely the methyl groups attached to the ring. Let me think. Each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, so four methyl substituents. Each methyl would be a singlet if they are attached to a symmetric position, so all their protons are equivalent.

So when the two compounds are mixed, their methyl groups would give different signals, depending on their substitution patterns.

Hmm, 2.2 ppm is typical for CH3 groups attached to an aromatic ring. So each CH3 group would be a singlet if all their protons are equivalent. So for each compound, the methyl groups would split into different signals based on their symmetry.

So let's take each option and see how the methyl groups would look.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:

The substituents are at 1,2,4,5. Let me imagine the structure. So positions 1,2,4,5 have methyl groups. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent? Let me see: positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 4 and 5 are adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, a mirror plane between positions 1 and 6, or something else. Maybe it's better to look for symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are in two pairs of adjacent positions. So maybe two pairs of equivalent methyl groups.

Wait, if the substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 2 are equivalent in some way, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups are in such a way that two of them are equivalent.

Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetric with methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. So imagine a ring where 1 and 4 are opposite each other, and 2 and5 are adjacent to those. Hmm, but that might not create equivalent methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent.

Wait, let me think about the structure. If we number the ring as positions 1,2,3,4,5,6, then substituents are at 1,2,4,5.

So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 4 and 5 are adjacent. So positions 1 and 4 are across from each other, perhaps?

Wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are arranged in a hexagon. So position 1 is opposite position 4. So substituents at 1 and 4 are para to each other.

Similarly, substituents at 2 and 5 are para to each other. So 1,2,4,5 would have substituents at positions 1,2 (adjacent), 4 (para to 1), and 5 (adjacent to 4 and para to 2).

Hmm, perhaps this creates some symmetry.

Wait, if substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then each substituent at 1 and 5 are adjacent to substituents at 2 and 4, respectively.

But perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let me check.

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, is there a center of inversion? Let's say the center is at the center of the ring. So each substituent would have a corresponding substituent on the opposite side.

Position 1 would be opposite to position 4. So substituent at 1 and 4. So in this case, 1 and 4 are substituents, so their opposite positions have substituents. Similarly, substituents at 2 and 5 would be opposite each other. So 2 and 5 are also substituents. So in this case, the molecule has a center of symmetry.

Wait, that's possible. So in that case, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. So each would be a pair of equivalent methyl groups.

So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the structure would have two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. Each set would give a singlet in the NMR, because all their protons are equivalent.

So for this compound, the methyl groups would split into two signals. Each signal would correspond to two methyl groups, each with 3 H. So the integration would be 6 H for each signal (since two groups ×3 H each), but since the compound is present in a 1:1 ratio with another compound, each would contribute 3 H for each signal. Wait, no, the compound is present in a 1:1 mixture, so each contributes their own methyl groups.

Wait, but let's get back to the NMR data. The three signals at 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the integrations are 2, 1, 1 for the three singlets.

Each of these signals corresponds to a set of equivalent methyl groups from either of the two compounds.

So, for each compound, the number and equivalence of methyl groups determines how many signals they produce.

Let's analyze each option:

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, as discussed, has two equivalent methyl groups at 1 and 4, and two equivalent at 2 and 5. So in the NMR, this compound would have two methyl signals. Each would be a singlet because the groups are equivalent. So each would have 6 H in total (each set has two CH3).

But wait, each of these two sets would contribute to the NMR as separate signals. So from this compound, two methyl signals.

Second compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Let me draw this. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So positions 1,2,3 have methyl groups, and position 5.

Wait, so substituents at 1,2,3,5. Let me imagine the ring. 1,2,3 are consecutive, and 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6.

Hmm, would this structure have any symmetry?

Wait, substituents at 1,2,3,5. So, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Let me check for any symmetry.

Is there a mirror plane or a center of inversion?

If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then the structure may not be symmetric. Because positions 1,2,3 are adjacent, and position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6.

Wait, maybe it's more symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the methyl groups.

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are at 1,2,3,5.

So, substituents at 1,2,3 are all adjacent, and 5 is across from 2? Let me think.

Wait, benzene has six positions. 1 is next to 2 and 6. 2 is next to 1 and 3. 3 is next to 2 and 4. 4 is next to 3 and 5. 5 is next to 4 and 6. 6 is next to 5 and 1.

So in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So 1: methyl, 2: methyl, 3: methyl, 5: methyl.

So, methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. What's the symmetry here?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric across a certain axis. For example, maybe the axis passes through position 4 and position 6. No, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each methyl group is unique. So in this case, each of the four methyl groups would be in a different environment. Wait, but that's not possible because the structure must have some symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents at 1 and 5 are equivalent because of the molecule's symmetry. Let's check.

If the substituent is at 1 and 5, are they equivalent?

In a benzene ring, substituents across from each other (para) are equivalent. But 1 is next to 2 and 6; 5 is next to 4 and 6. So 1 and 5 are not para; 1's para is 4. Wait, no. Wait, in benzene, position 1's para is position 4. So 1 and 4 are para. Similarly, 2 and 5 are para, 3 and 6 are para.

So in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So 1's para is 4 (no substituent here), 2's para is 5 (substituent here), 3's para is 6 (no substituent). So substituents are at 2 and 5 (para), and 1 and 3 (adjacent).

Wait, maybe the substituents at 2 and 5 are para, so they are equivalent. Similarly, substituents at 1 and 3 may not be equivalent. So this would mean that in the NMR, the methyl groups at 2 and 5 would be a singlet, and the methyl groups at 1 and 3 would be another singlet. Because the substituents at 2 and 5 are equivalent, and substituents at 1 and 3 are equivalent.

Wait, but wait: substituents at 1 and 3 are not para to anything. Let me think: substituents at 1 and 3 are adjacent to substituents. So perhaps they are in different environments, meaning their methyl groups would be non-equivalent, leading to different signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituents at 1 and 3 are not equivalent, but the substituents at 2 and 5 are equivalent. So in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, we'd have two sets of methyl groups: one set at 2 and 5 (equivalent) and another set at 1 and 3 (equivalent?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in this structure, the substituents at 1 and 3 are not equivalent, so their methyl groups would be separate signals.

But if that's the case, then the methyl groups would split into three signals: two for substituents at 2 and 5 (equivalent), and each of 1 and 3 would be different.

Wait, no, because if substituents at 1 and 3 are not equivalent, their methyl groups would be separate. So this would lead to three methyl signals for this compound: the 2 and 5 (one signal), and 1 and 3 (two signals, but maybe they are equivalent? Or not? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents at 1 and 3 are not equivalent, so each would have their own signal. But that would mean three signals from this compound, which doesn't fit with the given NMR data. Because the NMR shows three signals in total for the methyl groups, with a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, perhaps each of the two compounds contributes their own methyl signals, combining to form the three signals.

Let me think again.

In the NMR, the methyl signals are three, with a 2:1:1 ratio.

Each compound contributes their own set of methyl signals. So, if the first compound contributes two signals (like two singlets) and the second contributes one, that would give three signals.

Wait, but let me think about each option.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound (1,2,4,5): has two types of methyl groups. Let's say two methyl groups each with 3 H, giving two signals, each integral 2 (because each has two CH3 groups). So for this compound, two signals, each integrating to 2 H.

Second compound (1,2,3,5): perhaps three types of methyl groups. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, maybe the substituents are arranged such that two of the methyl groups are equivalent, and the other two are also equivalent but different from the first two.

Wait, substituents at 2 and 5 are para, so their methyl groups are equivalent. Substituents at 1 and 3 are adjacent. Are 1 and 3 equivalent?

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, perhaps the substituents at 1 and 3 are mirror images, making their methyl groups equivalent. So in this case, substituents at 1 and 3 would be equivalent, and substituents at 2 and 5 would be equivalent. So this would give two methyl signals for this compound.

So, two compounds: one gives two methyl signals, the other gives two. So total four signals? But the NMR shows three signals. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, but perhaps the two compounds have some methyl groups that are equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

Let me think: the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl) has two methyl signals: one for substituents 1 and 4 (each 3 H), and another for substituents 2 and 5 (each 3 H), but perhaps substituents 1 and 4 are not equivalent to substituents 2 and 5.

Wait, but wait a second. The first compound is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me imagine substituent positions. 1 and 4 are para; 2 and 5 are para. So substituents at 1 and 4 are equivalent? Or are they different because they're attached to different positions?

Wait, no. Because if you have substituents at 1 and 4, which are para, and substituents at 2 and 5, which are also para, but the substituents are in a different arrangement. So substituents at 1 and 4 are in a para position, each attached to methyl groups. Similarly, substituents at 2 and 5 are para.

But in this case, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 may not be equivalent to those at 2 and 5, so each would be a separate signal.

So the first compound contributes two methyl signals, each integrating to 2 H (since it has two sets of two CH3 groups each). But in the mixture, since the two compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, each of their signals would be half the integral of the other. Wait, no, because the NMR data is a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes their own signals.

Wait, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two methyl signals, each with 2 H (two CH3 groups), and the second compound (1,2,3,5) has two methyl signals, each with 2 H.

But the NMR shows three signals. So perhaps one of the signals is from both compounds. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has three types of methyl groups, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which options lead to exactly three methyl signals when the two compounds are mixed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5.

First compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

This would have substituents at 1,2,3,4. Let me imagine the ring. Substituents at four consecutive positions.

In this case, is there any symmetry? For example, if the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, substituents at 1,2,3,4: positions 1,2,3,4 are adjacent. So the molecule would have substituents on four adjacent positions, which leaves positions 5 and 6 as H.

Wait, but this would mean that the substituents are all on one side of the ring. So perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Alternatively, maybe it's symmetric across a certain axis.

Alternatively, perhaps substituents are at 1,2,3,4, which are four in a row, leading to a certain symmetry.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about the methyl groups.

In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent because they're in symmetric positions. Similarly, methyl groups at 2 and 3 would be equivalent.

So that would give two methyl signals for this compound.

The second compound is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. As discussed earlier, perhaps this has two methyl signals: substituents at 2 and 5 (equivalent) and substituents at 1 and 3 (equivalent). So two signals.

So in the mixture, the first compound contributes two signals, the second also contributes two, leading to four signals. But the NMR shows three. So perhaps this option is not correct.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

First compound: 1,2,4,5 (two methyl signals).

Second compound: 1,2,3,4 (two methyl signals).

So the mixture would have four signals. But NMR shows three. So option B is probably incorrect.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Wait, wait—1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check. Benzene (6 C) plus two ethyl groups: each ethyl is C2H5, so two would contribute 4 C and 10 H. So total 6 +4=10 C, 6 H (benzene) +10 H (ethyl) =16 H. But the formula is C10H14. So this can't be right. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have formula C8H14. But the given formula is C10H14. So this option is invalid. So option C is probably incorrect.

So option D is the only remaining one. Let me re-examine it.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.

As discussed, this would have two methyl signals: substituents at 1 and 4 (one signal), and substituents at 2 and 5 (another signal).

Second compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

In this structure, substituents are at 1,2,3,5.

Are any of these methyl groups equivalent? Let me think.

Substituents at 2 and 5 are para, so their methyl groups might be equivalent. Substituents at 1 and 3 are adjacent, but are they equivalent?

Perhaps because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine a mirror plane between position 4 and 6.

Alternatively, perhaps substituents at 1 and 3 are not equivalent, but substituents at 2 and 5 are.

So for the second compound, methyl groups at 2 and 5 would be equivalent, and those at 1 and 3 would be another set.

Wait, but in this case, substituents at 1 and 3 may not be equivalent, leading to two methyl signals for this compound.

So, the first compound contributes two signals, the second contributes two, leading to four signals. But the NMR shows three signals. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, but perhaps one of the substituents in one compound is equivalent to a substituent in the other.

Let me think: the first compound has substituents at 1 and 4 (each a methyl), and 2 and 5 (each a methyl). The second compound has substituents at 2 and 5 (each methyl), and 1 and 3 (each methyl).

So perhaps, the methyl groups at 2 and 5 in the first compound are the same as those in the second compound, leading to a combined signal.

But that would happen only if the substituents are in the same position relative to the ring, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents at 2 and 5 in the first compound are equivalent to those at 2 and 5 in the second compound, but that's because they're both at the same positions.

Wait, no. Because in the first compound, substituents are at 1,2,4,5; in the second, at 1,2,3,5.

So substituent at 2 and 5 are present in both compounds, but their environments are different.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the other part of the NMR data.

The aromatic signals are two singlets. Each integrating to 1 H (since 1:1 ratio and each compound contributes 1 H equivalent? Or each contributes 2 H, but each is 1 in the ratio. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons, so each would contribute a singlet of 2 H. But in the mixture, they are 1:1, so each would be 2 H, but the total would be 4 H. But the question says the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio, which would imply each is 1 H. That doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps each compound has one aromatic proton. No, because four substituents would leave two H.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons, each. But in the NMR, each would be a singlet integrating to 2 H. Since the mixture is 1:1, the two signals would each integrate to 2, but the question states they're in a 1:1 ratio, implying 1 each. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the integration.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has four substituents, leading to two equivalent aromatic protons. Each of these would contribute a singlet integrating to 2 H. But in a 1:1 mixture, each would contribute 2 H, leading to each signal integrating to 2. But the question says they're in a 1:1 ratio, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic signals are each integrating to 2 H, and the ratio is 1:1 between the two compounds. So each singlet is 2 H, but since each compound contributes 2 H, the ratio is 1:1 (each at 2 H, but it's a 1:1 mixture). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons, so each contributes a singlet of 2 H. Then, the two signals in the NMR would each be 2 H, but for a 1:1 mixture, each would be 2 H, leading to 4 H in total. But the question states the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio, so each would be 2 H, but that's an overall 4 H.

But the question says "two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio." So the ratio is the same as the mixture, so each is 1:1. Which would imply each singlet is integrating to 2 H (since each has 2 H, and the mixture is 1:1, so each is 2 H). But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each aromatic proton in the compounds is equivalent, but each has only two H. So each compound contributes 2 H, and in the mixture, each is 2 H, so each singlet is 2 H, and the ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. That makes sense.

So, for the aromatic region, each compound contributes 2 H in a singlet, and the NMR shows two singlets each integrating to 2 H, but in a 1:1 ratio because the mixture is 1:1. Wait, but 2 H each would make the ratio 2:2 or 1:1.

So that fits.

Now, back to the methyl groups. The NMR shows three signals at 2.2 ppm, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

So, the three signals are integral of 4, 2, 2, but wait, that's 8 H. Wait, but each compound has four methyl groups (each CH3). So each compound contributes 12 H (4 × 3 H), but in the NMR, the three signals sum to 8 H. That can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. Each compound is tetramethyl, so four CH3 groups, each with 3 H. So 12 H per compound. But the mixture is 1:1, so total 24 H. But the NMR shows three signals, summing to 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 H. That doesn't add up. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about the substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14 for each compound. Each is a benzene ring with four substituents.

Each substituent is a methyl group (since the formula is C10H14), so each substituent is a CH3.

So each compound has four CH3 groups. Hence, 12 H from CH3 groups.

But the NMR shows three signals for the CH3 groups, with integrals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the total would be 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 H. But each compound contributes 12 H. So perhaps the three signals are summing to 8 H each? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the NMR is showing the three signals for both compounds together, so the three signals would account for all the CH3 protons from both compounds.

But each compound has four CH3 groups (12 H), so two compounds would contribute 24 H. So the three signals must account for 24 H.

So the integrating ratio would be 2:1:1, meaning the total is 4 parts (2+1+1), each part being 8 H. So the signals would be 16 H, 8 H, 8 H. That can't be right because the maximum would be 24 H.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is 2:1:1, but the actual integrations are 8, 4, 4, totaling 16 H. But that's not matching the 24 H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Each CH3 group in a compound is either equivalent to others or not. The three signals suggest that in total, there are three types of CH3 groups across both compounds.

So, each of the two compounds contributes some number of CH3 signals, and together they sum to three.

For this to happen, perhaps one of the compounds contributes two CH3 signals, and the other contributes one.

So, for example, compound A has two CH3 signals (say, two sets of equivalent CH3), and compound B has one CH3 signal (all four CH3 are equivalent). But is that possible?

Wait, let's look at the options.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

In the first compound (1,2,4,5), the methyl groups could be in two sets: 1 and 4 (equivalent), and 2 and 5 (equivalent). So two signals.

The second compound (1,2,3,5) could have three sets: 1 and 3 (not equivalent), 2 and 5 (equivalent). Wait, but that would be two signals for the second compound. So together, both would contribute four signals, but the NMR shows three.

Hmm, unless the 2 and 5 methyl groups in the first compound are equivalent to those in the second compound, leading to a single signal.

Ah! That's a possibility. So, if the 2 and 5 methyl groups in both compounds are in the same environment, their signals would overlap. So the two CH3 groups (from first compound) at 2 and 5 would be equivalent to the two (from the second) at 2 and 5, leading to a single signal in the NMR.

Then, the first compound has another set of CH3 at 1 and 4, which may be equivalent within themselves but not equivalent to any in the second compound. The second compound has another set at 1 and 3, which are not equivalent to any others.

So, in the NMR, the three signals would be:

1. CH3 at 2 and 5 from both compounds → one signal with integral 4 (since each compound contributes 2 CH3 groups, each 3 H → 2×3×2 = 12 H? Wait, no, each compound contributes 2 CH3 groups (2 and 5), each 3 H → 6 H per compound. Two compounds → 12 H. So the signal would integrate to 12 H, but the ratio would be 2:2 for the two compounds, which is 1:1.

Wait, but the NMR shows three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the integrals would be 8, 4, 4 (summing to 16 H). But each compound has 12 H from CH3, so two compounds would have 24 H. So that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the integrals are 8, 4, 4, but that's 16 H. Where's the other 8 H? I'm getting more confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps the three signals are from different types of CH3 groups, and their integrals are 8, 8, 8. No, that's 24 H.

Wait, perhaps the three signals are from the first compound (two signals) and the second (one). So, for example, the first compound contributes two signals (each 6 H: 2×3×2?), and the second contributes one (4×3=12 H?), but that sums to 6+6+12=24 H, which matches. So the integration ratio would be 6:6:12 → 1:1:2. But the question says 2:1:1.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about another angle.

The three signals at 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the integrals are, say, 8,4,4 (summing to 16). But each compound has 12 CH3 H, so two compounds give 24 H. So this doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the ratio as the number of H in the signals, not their areas. No, the integration in NMR is the area, proportional to the number of H.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake earlier about the number of substituents. Let me recheck the molecular formula.

The molecular formula is C10H14 for each compound. Benzene is C6H6. Each CH3 adds (CH3 - H) = each substitution replaces a H and adds 3 H, so net +2 H per substituent. So four substituents would add 4×2=8 H, giving C6H6 + 8 H = C6H14, which doesn't match. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, each substitution replaces one H and adds three, so net +2 per substituent. So four substituents would add 4×2=8 H. So benzene (6 H) +8=14 H. So yes, each compound has 14 H. So CH3 groups contribute 4×3=12 H, and the aromatic H contribute 2 H (since four substituents → two aromatic H left). So the total is 12 +2=14 H. That matches.

So, each compound contributes 12 H from CH3 groups. So, in the NMR, the three signals would sum to 24 H (12 from each compound). The ratio 2:1:1 → 8,8,8. But 8×3=24, which fits. So each signal has 8 H.

Wait, but how would that happen? Each signal would correspond to a group of CH3's from both compounds. For example:

- One signal from four CH3's (each 3 H, 4×3=12 H → but that's not matching 8 H.

Wait, perhaps each signal corresponds to some CH3 groups from one or both compounds.

Wait, perhaps the three signals are as follows:

- One signal from the two CH3 groups (from each compound) → 2×3×2=12 H? No, that's 12 H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about which options would lead to three CH3 signals when the two compounds are mixed.

Looking again at the options, option D:

First compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl → two CH3 signals.

Second compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl → two CH3 signals.

But in the NMR, when mixed, perhaps some of these signals overlap.

So, for example, if the first compound's CH3 at 2 and 5 are in the same environment as the second compound's CH3 at 2 and 5, their signals would merge. Similarly, the first compound's CH3 at 1 and 4 might not overlap with any of the second compound's.

So:

- The first compound's CH3 at 2 and 5 → 2×3=6 H.

- The second compound's CH3 at 2 and 5 → 2×3=6 H.

So, when mixed, these two would combine into a single signal of 12 H.

Then, the first compound's CH3 at 1 and 4 → 2×3=6 H → second signal.

The second compound's CH3 at 1 and 3 → 2×3=6 H. Are these equivalent to any others?

If in the second compound, the CH3 at 1 and 3 are not equivalent to any others, they would form a third signal of 6 H.

So, signals would be:

1. 12 H (from 2 and 5 of both compounds)

2. 6 H (from 1 and 4 of first compound)

3. 6 H (from 1 and 3 of second compound)

But the NMR shows three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the integrals would be 8,4,4. But in this scenario, the integrals are 12,6,6.

So the ratio would be 12:6:6 → simplifies to 2:1:1. Ah! That's exactly what the question states.

So, the first signal (12 H) is in a 2:1:1 ratio compared to the others (6 H each). So 12:6:6 → 2:1:1.

So this fits perfectly.

So, the three signals at 2.2 ppm are:

- 12 H from the CH3 groups at 2 and 5 of both compounds.

- 6 H from the CH3 groups at 1 and 4 of the first compound.

- 6 H from the CH3 groups at 1 and 3 of the second compound.

But wait, the ratio is 2:1:1, meaning the first is twice the others. So 12 H is twice 6 H. So that fits.

So, the three signals are 12 H, 6 H, 6 H → ratio 2:1:1.

Thus, option D is the correct choice.

Now, checking the aromatic signals. Each compound contributes two aromatic H, which are equivalent in each compound.

So each would show as a singlet at around 6.7 ppm. Since the mixture is 1:1, each singlet would integrate to 2 H.

So, the two aromatic signals would each integrate to 2 H, and their ratio is 1:1, which the question states.

So, everything fits for option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula **C₁₀H₁₄** that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produce the described NMR signals. The aromatic region shows **two singlets at 6.7 ppm** in a 1:1 ratio, and the aliphatic region shows **three singlets at 2.2 ppm** in a 2:1:1 ratio. Each compound is a tetramethylbenzene derivative, meaning the benzene ring has four methyl substituents.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Aromatic Region (6.7 ppm):**
   - Each compound contributes one type of aromatic proton, as all aromatic protons are equivalent due to symmetry.
   - The two singlets in the NMR correspond to the two compounds, each integrating to 2 H (since each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons and the mixture is 1:1).

2. **Aliphatic Region (2.2 ppm):**
   - The three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest three distinct types of methyl groups across the two compounds.
   - Each compound has four methyl groups, contributing a total of 12 H (4 × 3 H) per compound. The mixture contributes 24 H in total.
   - The 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to integrations of **8 H, 8 H, and 8 H**, which sum to 24 H.

### Option Analysis:

#### **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The molecule lacks symmetry, leading to non-equivalent methyl groups and more than two aliphatic signals.
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5. Similarly, the molecule lacks sufficient symmetry to produce only three aliphatic signals.
- **Conclusion:** This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. This compound has symmetry, with two sets of equivalent methyl groups (1 and 4, 2 and 5), contributing two aliphatic signals.
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. This compound lacks symmetry, leading to non-equivalent methyl groups and more than two aliphatic signals.
- **Conclusion:** This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5. This compound has symmetry, with two sets of equivalent methyl groups (2 and 5, 1 and 3), contributing two aliphatic signals.
- **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Substituents at positions 1 and 4 are ethyl groups, not methyl groups. The molecular formula of this compound is **C₈H₁₄**, not **C₁₀H₁₄**.
- **Conclusion:** This option is invalid due to the incorrect molecular formula of 1,4-diethylbenzene.

#### **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. This compound has symmetry, with two sets of equivalent methyl groups (1 and 4, 2 and 5), contributing two aliphatic signals.
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5. This compound has symmetry, with two sets of equivalent methyl groups (2 and 5, 1 and 3), contributing two aliphatic signals.
- **Combined Aliphatic Signals:** 
  - The methyl groups at 2 and 5 in both compounds are equivalent, combining into a single signal (12 H).
  - The methyl groups at 1 and 4 in the first compound form a second signal (6 H).
  - The methyl groups at 1 and 3 in the second compound form a third signal (6 H).
  - The resulting integrations are **12:6:6**, which simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**, matching the NMR data.
- **Aromatic Signals:** 
  - Each compound contributes one type of aromatic proton, producing two singlets at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, consistent with the NMR data.
- **Conclusion:** This option matches the NMR data.
