Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on neutralization reactions, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that neutralization reactions involve an acid reacting with a base to produce water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is typically measured in kilojoules per mole. Oh wait, but the options here mix kJ and kcal. I'll have to be careful about the units.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. They're all being mixed together. I think I need to figure out how much acid and base are reacting and which one is the limiting reagent.

Let's break down each solution:

1. 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The moles of HCl would be Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is H+ and Cl- ions, each mole gives one mole of H+.

2. 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, but since it's diprotic, each mole gives 2 moles of H+. So the moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So the H+ contributed is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but doesn't the second dissociation (HSO4- to SO4^2-) maybe not be 100% strong? Or does it depend? Oh wait, in aqueous solution, H2SO4 usually donates both protons. I think for the purpose of neutralization, we consider both H+ ions. So yeah, 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

3. 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Therefore, OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait, the neutralization reaction between an acid and a base produces water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ from acids is HCl + H2SO4, which is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. Since H+ is in excess, OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and the H+ remaining will be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is acid + base → salt + water. The enthalpy change depends on the moles of H+ and OH- reacting. So the amount of H+ and OH- determine how much enthalpy is released.

Wait, but wait again. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting. I think the standard value is about -57 kJ/mol (or about -24 kcal/mol) for strong acids and strong bases, since they dissociate completely.

Wait, wait, let me get my numbers right. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So, per mole of H+ reacting, about -57 kJ.

Wait, but sometimes it's given per mole of acid or per mole of base. I need to be clear. Oh yes, when you mix an acid and a base, each mole of H+ that reacts with a mole of OH- releases about 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative). So the total enthalpy change is moles of H+ reacting multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

But wait, in this case, the H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 are available. So the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 mol of water. The remaining 0.08 mol of H+ will stay in solution, but since we're calculating the neutralization enthalpy, we only consider the reaction that occurs upon mixing.

So the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 mol. So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the options have some in kcal and others in kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm. My calculation gives -11.4 kJ, which is close to option D, but D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of acid, but wait, H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole contributes two H+.

Wait, no, the enthalpy per mole of H+ is the key here. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's about -57 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles reacting, so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. That's 11.4 kJ exothermic, so negative.

Looking at options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is limiting. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react, producing 0.2 moles of water.

So 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the enthalpy per mole is different. Wait, maybe it's -57 kcal/mol? Let me check. Oh wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal.

Wait, if the value is -13.6 kcal per mole, then 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

But wait, wait, I'm getting confused with the units. Let me double-check the standard values.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). Alternatively, sometimes it's given as -57 kJ per mole of acid, but that's only if the acid provides one H+ per mole. For H2SO4, which provides two H+ per mole, each H+ would contribute -57/2 = -28.5 kJ per mole of H2SO4. But wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the enthalpy is per mole of H+ neutralized. So each H+ that reacts releases about -57 kJ. So regardless of which acid or base is used, each mole of H+ reacting contributes -57 kJ.

So in my case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, none of them exactly match -11.4 kJ.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the moles. Let me recheck.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So yeah, 0.2 mol OH- available.

So the reaction is 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O. So 0.2 mol of H+ reacting.

So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have exactly that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 16 kJ. Hmm, maybe I should think about the volumes and concentrations again.

Wait, maybe the H2SO4 isn't fully dissociated? No, the question says H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it should dissociate completely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the heat based on the total moles of H+ and OH- available, but considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Wait, but in aqueous solution, H2SO4 does donate both protons, so I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the enthalpy per mole of reaction is given as -57 kJ per mole of H+ (for strong acid/base), so 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which would be around option B if it's in kcal.

Wait, let me convert 11.4 kJ to kcal. Since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, 11.4 kJ divided by 4.184 is approximately 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought my calculation gave -11.4 kJ. So which is it?

Ah, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal, in which case, -2.72 kcal (option A). But wait, the options have both. So which one is correct?

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. Typically, in such problems, the enthalpy per mole of H+ is considered, and the calculation is done in kJ. But the options have both units. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total amount of H+ and OH- and find the neutralization.

Wait, but the problem is, the neutralization is only possible up to the limiting reagent. So the OH- is 0.2 moles, which will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+. The remaining H+ would be 0.08 moles. But for the enthalpy, only the 0.2 moles reacting contribute.

So, 0.2 * (57 kJ) = 11.4 kJ, so -11.4 kJ. But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 16 kJ. Hmm, 16 is 0.28 * 57, which is 16. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the limiting reagent.

Wait, let's reevaluate: the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol. The OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the limiting reagent is OH-, which is 0.2 mol. So H+ used is 0.2 mol.

Ah, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole gives 2 OH-.

So the moles of OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2.

So the H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So the H+ that can react is 0.2 mol. So the reaction produces 0.2 mol of H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But in the options, there's no -11.4 kJ, but there's option B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, but if I convert 11.4 kJ to kcal, 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So, if the calculation is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So the answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why is there a -11.42 kcal option? Because maybe I'm supposed to calculate per mole of reaction, considering all the H+.

Wait, another approach: the total moles of H+ from both acids is 0.28, and moles of OH- is 0.2.

So, the reaction that occurs is 0.2 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O.

Assuming each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ, the total is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire reaction stoichiometry.

Wait, the reaction would involve all acids and the base.

HCl and H2SO4 are the acids, Ba(OH)2 is the base.

The neutralization reaction would be:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

But HCl is monoprotic, and Ba(OH)2 is diprotic. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two moles of HCl.

Wait, but also, H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole can neutralize two moles of OH-.

Wait, perhaps I need to write the net ionic equation.

The net ionic equation for neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So regardless of the source of H+ and OH-, each mole that reacts contributes to the enthalpy.

So, in this case, the OH- is 0.2 mol, so 0.2 mol of H+ (from the acids) will react.

So, 0.2 mol of H+ reacting → 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that exact number in kJ. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recalculate the moles carefully.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ is 0.1.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ total is 0.28 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol. So OH- is limiting, so 0.2 mol H+ reacts.

So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. So the answer should be -11.4 kJ, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again: option B is -11.42 kcal. Since 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72), but 11.42 kcal would correspond to about 47.5 kJ (11.42 *4.184≈47.5 kJ).

Hmm, so perhaps the problem is expecting the calculation in terms of the reaction using the Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let me think about the possible reaction.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When mixed with HCl and H2SO4, each mole of H+ will neutralize a mole of OH-.

But perhaps the problem is considering the stoichiometry of the reaction, including the moles of each acid and base.

Wait, let's think about the possible neutralization reactions.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two moles of H+.

So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

The total H+ available is 0.28, so 0.2 moles will be neutralized by Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.08 moles of H+.

So the H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, so the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Again, none of the options exactly match. But let's look at the options again.

Option A is -2.72 kcal. Which is about -11.4 kJ. So that's correct if the answer is in kcal. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.5 kJ. That's way higher than our calculation.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sum of all possible neutralizations, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe the enthalpy is calculated per mole of reaction, considering the specific amounts. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the heat released from each acid-base reaction separately.

But that would complicate things. Alternatively, considering that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can react with both HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps the reaction can be broken down into parts.

First, the Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from the acids.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 can take two H+ ions.

So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 will react with 0.2 moles of H+ from the acids.

So the H+ from HCl (0.1 mol) and H2SO4 (0.18 mol) sum to 0.28, so 0.2 is used, leaving 0.08.

The enthalpy for this reaction is the heat from neutralizing 0.2 moles of H+.

So the calculation is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that would be the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ from the acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \). Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \). Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \): \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).

2. **Determine the moles of OH⁻ from the base:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \). Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \). The limiting reagent is the species with the smaller moles, which is OH⁻ (\( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \)).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol H⁺} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol H⁺} \).
   - Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol H⁺} \) reacts, the enthalpy change is:
     \[
     0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}
     \]
     Converting to kcal:
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}
     \]

5. **Match the result to the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches option A.

**Critical analysis of the options:**
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value when converted to kcal.
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This value is inconsistent with the calculation, as it would correspond to approximately \( -47.5 \, \text{kJ} \), which is far too high.
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** This value does not match the calculation.
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** This value is close to \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \), but it is not exact.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
