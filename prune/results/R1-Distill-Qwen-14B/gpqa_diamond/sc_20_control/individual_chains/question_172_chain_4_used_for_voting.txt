Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens? Wait, no, that's plants. Oh right, the photosphere is the outer part of a star where we observe light. So, stars are emitting light from their photospheres.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, wait, excited in an energy level—so that's about the energy states of the iron atoms. I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.

Boltzmann distribution equation is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), right? So the fraction of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one depends on temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is the Boltzmann constant, isn't it? Let me check: the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, right! So the energy difference ΔE is k*T*(something), but wait, maybe the energy difference relates to the temperature somehow.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." So maybe the number of atoms in a certain energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Let me think. The ratio of the populations would be n1/n2 = 2. Since both are in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), we can apply the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann factor is n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

In this problem, I think they're looking at the same transition, so the energy difference is given. Let's assume E_j > E_i, so the higher level is j, and the lower is i.

So n_j/n_i = exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ) * (g_j/g_i)

But the problem might be assuming that the statistical weights (g_j and g_i) are the same for both stars, so they cancel out. If that's the case, then the ratio n1/n2 for each star would relate to their respective temperatures.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For star_1 and star_2, each has their own T. So for star_1, n1_j/n1_i = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T1) ), and similarly for star_2, n2_j/n2_i = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T2) ).

But the question states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the number of atoms in the higher state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's assume that in each star, the ratio of higher to lower energy level is being considered.

Wait, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." So maybe for each star, the population is in a certain level, and star_1's population is twice that of star_2.

But perhaps more accurately, the ratio between star_1 and star_2's populations in that specific level is 2:1. So let's say the number of atoms in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the number in higher level to lower level. So for each star, n_j/n_i = something. Then the ratio (n_j/n_i)_1 / (n_j/n_i)_2 = 2.

Hmm. Let me structure this.

Let me denote the ratio for star 1 as R1 = n1_j / n1_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g_j/g_i)
Similarly, R2 = n2_j / n2_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * (g_j/g_i)

If the problem says that star_1 has twice as many in the excited state (n_j) as star_2, then n1_j = 2 n2_j. But wait, no. The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the number in that level is twice. Alternatively, the excitation is the ratio n_j/(n_j + n_i) or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the population of the higher level relative to the lower level, and star_1's ratio is twice star_2's. So R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, the problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation level refers to the ratio of populations in the excited state to the ground state.

So for star_1, n1_j/n1_i = R1 = 2 * (n2_j/n2_i) = 2 R2.

Because star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g_j/g_i)
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * (g_j/g_i)

Assuming (g_j/g_i) is the same for both stars, since they're both iron atoms, so I can factor that out.

So R1/R2 = exp( [ (ΔE)/(k T2) - (ΔE)/(k T1) ] )

But since R1 = 2 R2, R1/R2 = 2.

So:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So substituting:

ln(2) = (k / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )
ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have here.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Assuming the stellar photospheres are in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution applies:

\[
\frac{n_j}{n_i} = \frac{g_j}{g_i} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( n_j \) and \( n_i \) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, respectively, and \( g_j/g_i \) is the ratio of their statistical weights. For simplicity, it is assumed that \( g_j/g_i \) is the same for both stars, so the ratio of populations depends only on temperature.

Let \( R_1 = \frac{n_{1j}}{n_{1i}} \) and \( R_2 = \frac{n_{2j}}{n_{2i}} \) represent the excitation ratios for star_1 and star_2, respectively. The problem states that \( R_1 = 2R_2 \). Substituting the Boltzmann distribution for each star:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \):

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( R_1/R_2 = 2 \), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = k \):

\[
\ln(2) = \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} \):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2}.
\]

This matches the equation in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:
