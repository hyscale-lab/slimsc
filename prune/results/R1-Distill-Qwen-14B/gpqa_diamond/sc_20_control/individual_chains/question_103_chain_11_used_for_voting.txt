Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I remember that ethan-1-one is acetophenone, so the structure would be a phenyl group attached to a ketone (CO) and a methyl group (CH3), but wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? Or is it acetyl something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO, so acetophenone would be benzene with a COCH3 group. So the target molecule has a COCH3 group attached to the benzene ring. Additionally, there are two substituents on the ring: a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5.

Wait, the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, then the bromine is at 3, and the nitro at 5. So the ring has three substituents: COCH3 at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. Let me draw that mentally. Benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3) at position 1, then Br at 3 (next position in the ring), and NO2 at 5, which is opposite the ketone. So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So the substituents are meta to each other. Hmm.

Wait, but how do the substituents get there? The synthesis steps would involve adding these groups in the right order, considering the directing effects of each group.

So, starting with benzene, what's the plan? We need to add the nitro group, the bromine, and the acetyl group (COCH3). 

I remember that nitro groups are strong meta directors. Bromine is an ortho/para director but deactivating. The acetyl group is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group attached via a carbonyl, which is actually deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, wait, the acetyl group is a ketone. Wait, the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating and meta-directing. So when attaching substituents after the ketone, they would go into the meta position relative to the ketone.

But wait, nitro groups are meta directors, but they're also strong deactivating. So, perhaps we need to add the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the ketone? Or maybe in a different order.

Wait, let's think about the possible steps. The product has three substituents: COCH3, Br, and NO2. So which group is added first, second, third?

One approach is to add the functional groups in the order that allows for the best directing. Since nitro is a strong meta director and deactivating, perhaps it's best to add it first. But if we add nitro first, then add another group, that group will be directed to the meta position relative to nitro. Then adding another group would be directed by both the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps we add the ketone first because it's an activating group? Wait, no, ketones are deactivating. Wait, wait, no, the acetyl group (COCH3) is attached as a substituent to benzene. So when it's attached, the ring is activated or deactivated? The acetyl group is an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl), so it's deactivating. So it's a meta director.

Wait, but when adding substituents, the order matters because each new group will be directed by the existing substituents.

Hmm, perhaps the steps involve Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the ketone. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Benzene is not very reactive, so perhaps we need to add an activating group first.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group. So if we add nitro first, the ring becomes less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. That might complicate adding the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts, which needs an activated ring. Alternatively, maybe we should add the acetyl group first, but wait, benzene isn't activated enough for Friedel-Crafts unless we have an activating group. Oh, wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation can be done on benzene with a catalyst like AlCl3, but not as readily as on toluene. Hmm, maybe we can manage it, but maybe it's better to add an activating group first, like a methyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para director. But wait, the target doesn't have a methyl; it has an acetyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group is added via another method, like using acetophenone synthesis from benzene via some other route. Wait, the Friedel-Crafts acylation uses an acyl chloride and AlCl3 as catalyst. So that's the step that would add the acetyl group.

Wait, but if the acetyl group is to be added first, then the next substituents (Br and NO2) would be directed by it. Let's see: Acetophenone has the ketone group (meta director). So adding a nitro group next would enter in the meta position relative to the ketone, correct. Then adding bromine would be directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but the target requires that the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. So the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5 positions. That would be a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. Each substituent being in the correct position.

So let me try to plan the steps:

1. Add the acetyl group (COCH3) to benzene. This is Friedel-Crafts acylation, using CH3COCl and AlCl3. Now, the ring is meta directed.

2. Next, add the nitro group. Since the ring has a meta-directing group, the nitro group would enter in the meta position relative to the ketone. Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so adding it after the ketone would be tricky because the ring is already deactivating. Or maybe not. Let's think: after adding the ketone, the ring is less reactive. So maybe adding nitro after that is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the nitro group first would be better. Let's consider that.

1. Nitration of benzene. So benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 gives nitrobenzene. Now, nitro is a meta director.

2. Next, perhaps add the acetyl group. But wait, nitro is deactivating; adding an acyl group via Friedel-Crafts might not be feasible because the ring is deactivated. Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So that's a problem. So if we do nitration first, we can't add the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts because the ring is deactivating. So that's a problem.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can introduce a group that can activate the ring after nitration. Like, maybe an amino group. Because amino groups are strong activating, ortho/para directors. Then, after adding the amino group, we can perform acylation. But wait, the target doesn't have an amino group, so that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think. The target has the ketone at position 1. So perhaps the ketone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation as the first step. But then, the ring is deactivating, so adding nitro next would require directed substitution. But nitrating a meta director ring might be challenging. Alternatively, maybe after acetylation, we can nitrate, but in the meta position relative to the ketone.

Wait, but nitration would require a strong activating group. Wait, maybe the ketone is a meta director, but it's deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. So nitrating acetophenone might be difficult. Let me think: can nitration occur on acetophenone? I remember that acetophenone is meta directed, and the ring is deactivating, but substitution can still happen under certain conditions.

So, after acetylation, nitration would occur in the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, bromination would occur in a position directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are at 1,3,5. So the ketone is at 1. The nitro is at 5, and the bromine at 3. So the ketone and nitro are separated by two positions, making them meta, and the bromine is adjacent to the ketone in the meta direction.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Acetylate benzene to form acetophenone (COCH3 group). This is Friedel-Crafts acylation.

2. Nitrate acetophenone. The nitro group will add in the meta position relative to the ketone. So after this, we have nitro group at position 3 (if ketone is at 1) or wait, acetophenone's structure is benzene with COCH3 at position 1. Then, the nitro would be added at position 3 or 5? Wait, nitration is a meta director, so the nitro would go to position 3 or 5 relative to the ketone. Wait, but in acetophenone, the ketone is at position 1. So possible positions for nitro would be 3 and 5. Let's say it goes to position 5. Then, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 5.

3. Then, brominate. But wait, after nitration, the ring has two meta directors: COCH3 and NO2. Both are deactivating, meta directors. So bromine would go into a position that's meta to both. Wait, but the positions are getting a bit complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the COCH3 group, then nitrate, then brominate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but considering the substituents' positions, perhaps the nitro group is added before the ketone. But as I thought earlier, that would complicate the acylation step because the ring would be deactivating. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ketone and bromine. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, introducing a directing group that can be removed later is helpful. For example, adding a nitro group, which is a meta director, then introducing substituents, and then reducing the nitro group to an amine (which is activating) to direct another substitution. But I don't think that's applicable here because the target has a nitro group, not an amine.

Hmm. Let's think about the options given.

Looking at the options, each option lists a series of steps. Let's go through each option and see which makes sense.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; Friedel-Crafts acylation. ii) Br2/FeBr3; bromination. iii) HNO3/H2SO4; nitration. iv) Fe/HCl; probably reduction. v) HNO3/H2SO4; another nitration. vi) NaNO2/HCl; diazotization. vii) H3PO2; maybe hydrolysis or some reaction.

Wait, but that seems like a lot of steps, possibly more than needed. Let's see. Starting with benzene, acylation gives acetophenone. Then bromination: where would Br add? Acetophenone is meta director, so Br would likely add at the meta position relative to COCH3. Then nitration: where? Now, the ring has COCH3 and Br. Both are meta directors. So the nitro group could go into a position that's meta to both. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, let's think about each step in the options.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; brominate benzene to get bromobenzene. ii) nitrate; so nitro group is added. Since bromine is an ortho/para director, the nitro would go into ortho or para relative to Br. But that may not lead to the correct positions. Then iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; acylation. Now, the ring has Br (ortho/para), nitro (meta), and COCH3. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4; nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene. Then ii) Fe/HCl; perhaps reduce nitro group to amine? Wait, Fe/HCl is not a standard reduction. Nitrobenzene to aniline is usually done with H2/Pd or using Fe/HCl in a different context, like in a Sandmeyer reaction. Wait, no, Sandmeyer uses CuCl and HCl. Maybe Fe/HCl is for something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a different step. Then iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; acylation. Then iv) Br2/FeBr3; bromination. Hmm, but after adding the acetyl group, the ring is deactivating, so Br would have difficulty adding. Also, the directing would be tricky.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; nitrate benzene. ii) Fe/HCl; maybe reduce nitro to amine. iii) NaNO2/HCl; diazotization. iv) H3PO2; perhaps to form a hydroxylamine or something else. Then v) Br2/FeBr3; brominate. vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; acylation. vii) HNO3/H2SO4; nitrate again. Not sure if this makes sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider each option's sequence and see which would lead to the correct substituents.

The target molecule has:

- COCH3 at position 1.

- Br at position 3.

- NO2 at position 5.

So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5.

So, to achieve this, the substituents must be added in such a way that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

Let me imagine the order of substitution. Suppose we add nitro first, then bromine, then ketone.

But adding nitro first would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps add the ketone, then nitro, then bromine.

Wait, but after adding ketone (COCH3), which is a meta director, then nitration would add nitro in the meta position relative to ketone. So that would put nitro at position 3 or 5. Then bromination would be directed by the ketone and nitro groups.

Wait, let me outline this:

Step 1: Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (COCH3 at position 1).

Step 2: Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group at position 3 (assuming meta addition). Now, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 3.

Step 3: Brominate. The ring now has two meta directors: COCH3 (at 1) and NO2 (at 3). So where would the Br add?

Wait, if COCH3 is at 1 and NO2 at 3, the meta positions relative to COCH3 are 3 and 5. But position 3 is already occupied by NO2. So the next substituent (Br) would have to go to position 5, which is meta to COCH3, but let me check.

Wait, acetophenone (COCH3 at 1). Nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5. Let's say it adds at 3. Now, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 3.

For bromination, the existing substituents are COCH3 (meta) and NO2 (meta). So the Br would have to go into a position that's activated.

Wait, but both COCH3 and NO2 are deactivating groups. So the ring is deactivating, making bromination difficult. But perhaps it's possible under certain conditions.

But where would Br add? The existing substituents are at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2). The possible positions for Br would be positions that are ortho or para to either substituent.

Wait, Br is an ortho/para director, but it's a deactivating group. But wait, that's when Br is the substituent on the benzene. Now, in this case, we have two meta directors.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring after nitration (COCH3 at 1, NO2 at 3) would have the Br added in a position that's activated by any groups. But wait, all three positions adjacent to COCH3 (positions 2, 6) are meta to NO2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br would add para to the nitro group, which is at 3. So para would be position 7, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so position 7 is same as 1. But position 1 is already occupied by COCH3. So perhaps the Br would go into position 5, which is meta to COCH3 and para to NO2.

Wait, position 5 is meta to COCH3 (position 1) because moving two positions in either direction from 1 would be 3 and 5. So if nitro is at 3, then position 5 is meta to COCH3. So perhaps Br would go into position 5.

Thus, the final product would have COCH3 at 1, NO2 at 3, and Br at 5. But wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl, so the positions would be COCH3 at 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. Hmm, that's a problem because in this scenario, NO2 is at 3 and Br at 5.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let's try adding nitro after bromine.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is: first acylation (COCH3), then bromination, then nitration.

So step 1: benzene → acylation → COCH3 at 1.

Step 2: bromination. Since COCH3 is a meta director, Br would add at position 3.

Now, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and Br at 3.

Step 3: nitration. Now, Br is an ortho/para director, but it's deactivating. COCH3 is a meta director, also deactivating. So where would the nitro group add?

Looking at the ring: positions 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br). The possible positions for nitration would be where both directors agree. Nitration is directed by the existing groups.

COCH3 directs meta, so positions 3 and 5. But 3 is already occupied by Br. So next possible is position 5.

Br is at 3, which is an ortho/para director. The para position to Br is position 7 (which is 1), which is already occupied. Ortho to Br would be positions 2 and 4.

But nitration is a meta director for COCH3. So the nitro group would have to go into position 5, which is meta to COCH3 and not directly directed by Br.

Wait, but position 5 is meta to COCH3 and also para to Br.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me visualize:

Positions on the benzene ring are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

COCH3 at 1, Br at 3.

Now, for nitration:

- COCH3 directs to 3 and 5. 3 is taken, so 5 is possible.

- Br directs ortho (2 and 4) and para (1, already taken). So the only position that is meta to COCH3 and not taken is 5.

So nitration would occur at position 5, giving the substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which is the target molecule.

So the sequence would be:

1. Acylation (COCH3 added at 1).

2. Bromination (Br added at 3, meta to COCH3).

3. Nitration (NO2 added at 5, meta to COCH3 and para to Br).

So the steps are:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

But wait, looking at the options, any option that follows this sequence?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps are acylation, bromination, nitration, then some other steps. But the target is achieved after step iii, but the option has more steps. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option B: The steps are bromination, nitration, acylation, then more steps. So it doesn't fit our sequence.

Option C: Steps are nitration, Fe/HCl, acylation, bromination, nitration, etc. Doesn't fit.

Option D: Starts with nitration, then Fe/HCl, then diazotization, then H3PO2, then bromination, acylation, nitration.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match the sequence I thought, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the option, after acylation and bromination, perhaps another step is needed. Wait, let me look again.

Wait, the target has three substituents. So the steps should add each substituent in the correct order.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option A: steps i, ii, iii, then others. Let me see:

Option A steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation → COCH3 at 1.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → NO2 at 5.

Then the product is as desired. But what about steps iv to vii? The product is achieved at step iii, but the option has more steps. So perhaps the options include more steps, but the correct sequence is the first three steps.

Wait, but the options list all steps, including those after. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Looking again, each option lists seven steps. So perhaps the correct option is the one that includes the correct sequence, even if there are extra steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine and nitro groups are added in a different order.

Wait, another possibility is that the nitro group is added before the bromine. So:

1. Acylation → COCH3 at 1.

2. Nitration → NO2 at 3.

3. Bromination → Br at 5.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents would be COCH3 at 1, NO2 at 3, Br at 5. Which doesn't match the target, which requires COCH3 at 1, Br at 3, NO2 at 5.

So how can that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Acylation → COCH3 at 1.

2. Nitration → NO2 at 5.

3. Bromination → Br at 3.

Because, after acylation, nitration would add meta to COCH3, which could be position 3 or 5. If it adds at 5, then bromination (directed by COCH3 and NO2) would add at position 3.

Wait, let me think:

After step 1: COCH3 at 1.

Step 2: nitration → adds to position 5 (meta to COCH3).

Now, substituents are at 1 and 5.

Step 3: bromination. Where would Br add? The existing groups are COCH3 (meta) and NO2 (meta). The possible positions are meta to both.

Looking at position 3: it's meta to COCH3 (since 1 and 3 are two positions apart) and ortho to NO2 at 5.

But wait, NO2 at 5 is a meta director. So the Br would be directed to position 3 (meta to COCH3, and ortho to NO2).

But NO2 is a strong deactivator; maybe the Br would prefer to be ortho or para to it. But NO2 is meta director, so ortho and para are not preferred. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is: acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

So:

1. Acylation → COCH3 at 1.

2. Bromination → Br at 3.

3. Nitration → NO2 at 5.

Which is the target.

So which option includes this sequence?

Looking at the options:

Option B: i) bromine, ii) nitrate, iii) acylation. No, that's not our order.

Option C: i) nitrate, then acylation. No.

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromine, iii) nitration. So that's steps 1,2,3 in the correct order.

But the option A has more steps beyond that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but the first three steps are correct, and the rest are extra steps which might be needed for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the target is after step iii. So why would the other steps be present?

Looking at the steps in option A:

i) acylation.

ii) bromination.

iii) nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl.

v) nitration.

vi) NaNO2/HCl.

vii) H3PO2.

Hmm, that seems like a lot. Maybe the initial steps produce the correct product, and the later steps are unnecessary. Or perhaps I'm mistaken and the correct sequence is longer.

Wait, another thought: the nitration in step iii may not be possible because the ring is deactivating. So maybe nitration needs to be done in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitration first. But that's difficult because the ring is deactivated after that. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me think about option D:

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → what's that? Maybe hydrolysis? I'm not sure.

Then v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

Hmm, but this seems to involve adding and removing groups, which is not ideal for the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B: bromination first, then nitrate, then acylation.

So:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added, but where? Bromobenzene is an ortho/para director.

So nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5 (if Br is at 1). Then acylation would add COCH3, which would be directed by Br and nitro.

Wait, let me imagine:

Step 1: benzene → bromobenzene (Br at 1).

Step 2: nitration → nitro can be at 3 or 5 (ortho/para to Br). Let’s say nitro at 3.

Step 3: acylation. Now, the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 3. Both are meta directors. So where would the acetyl group add?

The meta positions relative to Br would be 4 and 6. But nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to 4. Hmm, this might complicate the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps after bromination and nitration, the acetylation occurs.

Wait, but this seems to complicate the directing, and I'm not sure if it leads to the correct substituent positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, which has the correct initial steps.

But I'm getting stuck. Another approach: perhaps think about each reaction step in each option and see which leads to the target.

Looking at option A:

Step i: Acylation → acetophenone.

Step ii: bromination → Br at meta (position 3) relative to COCH3.

Step iii: nitration → NO2 at meta to COCH3, which is position 5.

So the product after step iii is the target. But the option has more steps, which I don't understand. Why would they do more steps?

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii is in a different position because of the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding Br and NO2 in certain positions, another step is needed.

Wait, perhaps when you add the groups in a certain order, some substituents are added in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to aniline (NH2).

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation → acetophenone, but wait, if the ring has NH2, Friedel-Crafts acylation would be possible because NH2 is a strong activating group. So acylation would occur at the meta position relative to NH2.

Wait, but after step ii, if we have aniline (NH2 at position 1), then acylation would add COCH3 at position 3 (meta to NH2). Then step iv: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Where would Br go? Now, the ring has NH2 (strong activating, ortho/para) and COCH3 (deactivating, meta). So Br would be directed by the most activating group, which is NH2.

So, after acylation, the substituents are NH2 at 1 and COCH3 at 3. Then bromination would add Br at position 5 (meta to COCH3) or ortho to NH2 (positions 2 or 6). But which is more likely?

Alternatively, maybe the Br adds ortho to NH2, which is position 2 or 6, but since COCH3 is at 3, which is meta to it, perhaps the directing is more complex.

Wait, if the ring has NH2 at 1 and COCH3 at 3, then Br would likely add ortho to NH2 (position 2 or 6), because NH2 is a strong activating group, directing ortho/para.

But if Br is added at position 2, then:

Substituents: NH2 at 1, COCH3 at 3, Br at 2. Then, any further steps, like nitration, would add where?

Hmm, but in option C, after step iv (bromination), there's another nitration. So step v: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Wait, this seems to be adding more substituents, but the target only has three. So perhaps option C isn't the right path.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the position of the substituents after each step in the options.

Looking back, the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration.

Which corresponds to option A steps i, ii, iii. So perhaps the answer is option A.

But why does option A have more steps? Perhaps because those steps are not needed, but maybe the initial three steps are sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another thought: the target has Br at 3 and NO2 at 5, both meta to COCH3 at 1. So perhaps the nitration occurs after bromination.

So the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration.

Which is option A's first three steps.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (COCH3, Br, and NO2) are added in the correct positions (1, 3, and 5, respectively) on the benzene ring. The substituents must be introduced in an order that allows proper directing effects, considering their electronic and steric influences.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3 adds the COCH3 group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with Br2/FeBr3 adds Br at position 3, which is meta to the COCH3 group.  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds NO2 at position 5, which is meta to the COCH3 group and para to the Br.  
   - This sequence achieves the target molecule after the first three steps. The additional steps (iv–vii) are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target compound but are included in the option.

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination with Br2/FeBr3 adds Br at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds NO2 at position 3 (ortho/para to Br).  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3 adds COCH3.  
   - This sequence does not lead to the correct positions for the substituents, as the directing effects of Br and NO2 would result in incorrect placement of the COCH3 group.

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds NO2 at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts NO2 to NH2.  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3 adds COCH3.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination with Br2/FeBr3 adds Br.  
   - This sequence is overly complicated and does not ensure the correct positions for the substituents.

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds NO2 at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts NO2 to NH2.  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO2/HCl and subsequent reaction with H3PO2 are unnecessary for this synthesis.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination with Br2/FeBr3 adds Br.  
   - **Step v**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3 adds COCH3.  
   - **Step vi**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 re-adds NO2.  
   - This sequence is inefficient and does not lead to the correct positions for the substituents.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is provided in **Option A**, where the COCH3 group is added first via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration in the correct positions. The additional steps in Option A are not necessary for the synthesis of the target compound but are included in the option.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I remember that ethan-1-one is acetophenone, so the structure would be a phenyl group attached to a ketone (CO) and a methyl group (CH3), but wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? Or is it acetyl something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO, so acetophenone would be benzene with a COCH3 group. So the target molecule has a COCH3 group attached to the benzene ring. Additionally, there are two substituents on the ring: a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5.

Wait, the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, then the bromine is at 3, and the nitro at 5. So the ring has three substituents: COCH3 at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. Let me draw that mentally. Benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3) at position 1, then Br at 3 (next position in the ring), and NO2 at 5, which is opposite the ketone. So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So the substituents are meta to each other. Hmm.

Wait, but how do the substituents get there? The synthesis steps would involve adding these groups in the right order, considering the directing effects of each group.

So, starting with benzene, what's the plan? We need to add the nitro group, the bromine, and the acetyl group (COCH3). 

I remember that nitro groups are strong meta directors. Bromine is an ortho/para director but deactivating. The acetyl group is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group attached via a carbonyl, which is actually deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, wait, the acetyl group is a ketone. Wait, the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating and meta-directing. So when attaching substituents after the ketone, they would go into the meta position relative to the ketone.

But wait, nitro groups are meta directors, but they're also strong deactivating. So, perhaps we need to add the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the ketone? Or maybe in a different order.

Wait, let's think about the possible steps. The product has three substituents: COCH3, Br, and NO2. So which group is added first, second, third?

One approach is to add the functional groups in the order that allows for the best directing. Since nitro is a strong meta director and deactivating, perhaps it's best to add it first. But if we add nitro first, then add another group, that group will be directed to the meta position relative to nitro. Then adding another group would be directed by both the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps we add the ketone first because it's an activating group? Wait, no, ketones are deactivating. Wait, wait, no, the acetyl group (COCH3) is attached as a substituent to benzene. So when it's attached, the ring is activated or deactivated? The acetyl group is an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl), so it's deactivating. So it's a meta director.

Wait, but when adding substituents, the order matters because each new group will be directed by the existing substituents.

Hmm, perhaps the steps involve Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the ketone. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Benzene is not very reactive, so perhaps we need to add an activating group first.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group. So if we add nitro first, the ring becomes less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. That might complicate adding the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts, which needs an activated ring. Alternatively, maybe we should add the acetyl group first, but wait, benzene isn't activated enough for Friedel-Crafts unless we have an activating group. Oh, wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation can be done on benzene with a catalyst like AlCl3, but not as readily as on toluene. Hmm, maybe we can manage it, but maybe it's better to add an activating group first, like a methyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para director. But wait, the target doesn't have a methyl; it has an acetyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group is added via another method, like using acetophenone synthesis from benzene via some other route. Wait, the Friedel-Crafts acylation uses an acyl chloride and AlCl3 as catalyst. So that's the step that would add the acetyl group.

Wait, but if the acetyl group is to be added first, then the next substituents (Br and NO2) would be directed by it. Let's see: Acetophenone has the ketone group (meta director). So adding a nitro group next would enter in the meta position relative to the ketone, correct. Then adding bromine would be directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but the target requires that the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. So the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5 positions. That would be a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. Each substituent being in the correct position.

So let me try to plan the steps:

1. Add the acetyl group (COCH3) to benzene. This is Friedel-Crafts acylation, using CH3COCl and AlCl3. Now, the ring is meta directed.

2. Next, add the nitro group. Since the ring has a meta-directing group, the nitro group would enter in the meta position relative to the ketone. Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so adding it after the ketone would be tricky because the ring is already deactivating. Or maybe not. Let's think: after adding the ketone, the ring is less reactive. So maybe adding nitro after that is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the nitro group first would be better. Let's consider that.

1. Nitration of benzene. So benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 gives nitrobenzene. Now, nitro is a meta director.

2. Next, perhaps add the acetyl group. But wait, nitro is deactivating; adding an acyl group via Friedel-Crafts might not be feasible because the ring is deactivated. Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So that's a problem. So if we do nitration first, we can't add the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts because the ring is deactivating. So that's a problem.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can introduce a group that can activate the ring after nitration. Like, maybe an amino group. Because amino groups are strong activating, ortho/para directors. Then, after adding the amino group, we can perform acylation. But wait, the target doesn't have an amino group, so that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think. The target has the ketone at position 1. So perhaps the ketone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation as the first step. But then, the ring is deactivating, so adding nitro next would require directed substitution. But nitrating a meta director ring might be challenging. Alternatively, maybe after acetylation, we can nitrate, but in the meta position relative to the ketone.

Wait, but nitration would require a strong activating group. Wait, maybe the ketone is a meta director, but it's deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. So nitrating acetophenone might be difficult. Let me think: can nitration occur on acetophenone? I remember that acetophenone is meta directed, and the ring is deactivating, but substitution can still happen under certain conditions.

So, after acetylation, nitration would occur in the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, bromination would occur in a position directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are at 1,3,5. So the ketone is at 1. The nitro is at 5, and the bromine at 3. So the ketone and nitro are separated by two positions, making them meta, and the bromine is adjacent to the ketone in the meta direction.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Acetylate benzene to form acetophenone (COCH3 group). This is Friedel-Crafts acylation.

2. Nitrate acetophenone. The nitro group will add in the meta position relative to the ketone. So after this, we have nitro group at position 3 (if ketone is at 1) or wait, acetophenone's structure is benzene with COCH3 at position 1. Then, the nitro would be added at position 3 or 5? Wait, nitration is a meta director, so the nitro would go to position 3 or 5 relative to the ketone. Wait, but in acetophenone, the ketone is at position 1. So possible positions for nitro would be 3 and 5. Let's say it goes to position 5. Then, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 5.

3. Then, brominate. But wait, after nitration, the ring has two meta directors: COCH3 and NO2. Both are deactivating, meta directors. So bromine would go into a position that's meta to both. Wait, but the positions are getting a bit complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the COCH3 group, then nitrate, then brominate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but considering the substituents' positions, perhaps the nitro group is added before the ketone. But as I thought earlier, that would complicate the acylation step because the ring would be deactivating. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ketone and bromine. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, introducing a directing group that can be removed later is helpful. For example, adding a nitro group, which is a meta director, then introducing substituents, and then reducing the nitro group to an amine (which is activating) to direct another substitution. But I don't think that's applicable here because the target has a nitro group, not an amine.

Hmm. Let's think about the options given.

Looking at the options, each option lists a series of steps. Let's go through each option and see which makes sense.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; Friedel-Crafts acylation. ii) Br2/FeBr3; bromination. iii) HNO3/H2SO4; nitration. iv) Fe/HCl; probably reduction. v) HNO3/H2SO4; another nitration. vi) NaNO2/HCl; diazotization. vii) H3PO2; maybe hydrolysis or some reaction.

Wait, but that seems like a lot of steps, possibly more than needed. Let's see. Starting with benzene, acylation gives acetophenone. Then bromination: where would Br add? Acetophenone is meta director, so Br would likely add at the meta position relative to COCH3. Then nitration: where? Now, the ring has COCH3 and Br. Both are meta directors. So the nitro group could go into a position that's meta to both. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, let's think about each step in the options.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; brominate benzene to get bromobenzene. ii) nitrate; so nitro group is added. Since bromine is an ortho/para director, the nitro would go into ortho or para relative to Br. But that may not lead to the correct positions. Then iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; acylation. Now, the ring has Br (ortho/para), nitro (meta), and COCH3. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4; nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene. Then ii) Fe/HCl; perhaps reduce nitro group to amine? Wait, Fe/HCl is not a standard reduction. Nitrobenzene to aniline is usually done with H2/Pd or using Fe/HCl in a different context, like in a Sandmeyer reaction. Wait, no, Sandmeyer uses CuCl and HCl. Maybe Fe/HCl is for something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a different step. Then iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; acylation. Then iv) Br2/FeBr3; bromination. Hmm, but after adding the acetyl group, the ring is deactivating, so Br would have difficulty adding. Also, the directing would be tricky.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; nitrate benzene. ii) Fe/HCl; maybe reduce nitro to amine. iii) NaNO2/HCl; diazotization. iv) H3PO2; perhaps to form a hydroxylamine or something else. Then v) Br2/FeBr3; brominate. vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; acylation. vii) HNO3/H2SO4; nitrate again. Not sure if this makes sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider each option's sequence and see which would lead to the correct substituents.

The target molecule has:

- COCH3 at position 1.

- Br at position 3.

- NO2 at position 5.

So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5.

So, to achieve this, the substituents must be added in such a way that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

Let me imagine the order of substitution. Suppose we add nitro first, then bromine, then ketone.

But adding nitro first would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps add the ketone, then nitro, then bromine.

Wait, but after adding ketone (COCH3), which is a meta director, then nitration would add nitro in the meta position relative to ketone. So that would put nitro at position 3 or 5. Then bromination would be directed by the ketone and nitro groups.

Wait, let me outline this:

Step 1: Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (COCH3 at position 1).

Step 2: Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group at position 3 (assuming meta addition). Now, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 3.

Step 3: Brominate. The ring now has two meta directors: COCH3 (at 1) and NO2 (at 3). So where would the Br add?

Wait, if COCH3 is at 1 and NO2 at 3, the meta positions relative to COCH3 are 3 and 5. But position 3 is already occupied by NO2. So the next substituent (Br) would have to go to position 5, which is meta to COCH3, but let me check.

Wait, acetophenone (COCH3 at 1). Nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5. Let's say it adds at 3. Now, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NO2 at 3.

For bromination, the existing substituents are COCH3 (meta) and NO2 (meta). So the Br would have to go into a position that's activated.

Wait, but both COCH3 and NO2 are deactivating groups. So the ring is deactivating, making bromination difficult. But perhaps it's possible under certain conditions.

But where would Br add? The existing substituents are at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2). The possible positions for Br would be positions that are ortho or para to either substituent.

Wait, Br is an ortho/para director, but it's a deactivating group. But wait, that's when Br is the substituent on the benzene. Now, in this case, we have two meta directors.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring after nitration (COCH3 at 1, NO2 at 3) would have the Br added in a position that's activated by any groups. But wait, all three positions adjacent to COCH3 (positions 2, 6) are meta to NO2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br would add para to the nitro group, which is at 3. So para would be position 7, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so position 7 is same as 1. But position 1 is already occupied by COCH3. So perhaps the Br would go into position 5, which is meta to COCH3 and para to NO2.

Wait, position 5 is meta to COCH3 (position 1) because moving two positions in either direction from 1 would be 3 and 5. So if nitro is at 3, then position 5 is meta to COCH3. So perhaps Br would go into position 5.

Thus, the final product would have COCH3 at 1, NO2 at 3, and Br at 5. But wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl, so the positions would be COCH3 at 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. Hmm, that's a problem because in this scenario, NO2 is at 3 and Br at 5.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let's try adding nitro after bromine.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is: first acylation (COCH3), then bromination, then nitration.

So step 1: benzene → acylation → COCH3 at 1.

Step 2: bromination. Since COCH3 is a meta director, Br would add at position 3.

Now, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and Br at 3.

Step 3: nitration. Now, Br is an ortho/para director, but it's deactivating. COCH3 is a meta director, also deactivating. So where would the nitro group add?

Looking at the ring: positions 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br). The possible positions for nitration would be where both directors agree. Nitration is directed by the existing groups.

COCH3 directs meta, so positions 3 and 5. But 3 is already occupied by Br. So next possible is position 5.

Br is at 3, which is an ortho/para director. The para position to Br is position 7 (which is 1), which is already occupied. Ortho to Br would be positions 2 and 4.

But nitration is a meta director for COCH3. So the nitro group would have to go into position 5, which is meta to COCH3 and not directly directed by Br.

Wait, but position 5 is meta to COCH3 and also para to Br.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me visualize:

Positions on the benzene ring are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

COCH3 at 1, Br at 3.

Now, for nitration:

- COCH3 directs to 3 and 5. 3 is taken, so 5 is possible.

- Br directs ortho (2 and 4) and para (1, already taken). So the only position that is meta to COCH3 and not taken is 5.

So nitration would occur at position 5, giving the substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which is the target molecule.

So the sequence would be:

1. Acylation (COCH3 added at 1).

2. Bromination (Br added at 3, meta to COCH3).

3. Nitration (NO2 added at 5, meta to COCH3 and para to Br).

So the steps are:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

But wait, looking at the options, any option that follows this sequence?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps are acylation, bromination, nitration, then some other steps. But the target is achieved after step iii, but the option has more steps. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option B: The steps are bromination, nitration, acylation, then more steps. So it doesn't fit our sequence.

Option C: Steps are nitration, Fe/HCl, acylation, bromination, nitration, etc. Doesn't fit.

Option D: Starts with nitration, then Fe/HCl, then diazotization, then H3PO2, then bromination, acylation, nitration.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match the sequence I thought, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the option, after acylation and bromination, perhaps another step is needed. Wait, let me look again.

Wait, the target has three substituents. So the steps should add each substituent in the correct order.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option A: steps i, ii, iii, then others. Let me see:

Option A steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation → COCH3 at 1.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → NO2 at 5.

Then the product is as desired. But what about steps iv to vii? The product is achieved at step iii, but the option has more steps. So perhaps the options include more steps, but the correct sequence is the first three steps.

Wait, but the options list all steps, including those after. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Looking again, each option lists seven steps. So perhaps the correct option is the one that includes the correct sequence, even if there are extra steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine and nitro groups are added in a different order.

Wait, another possibility is that the nitro group is added before the bromine. So:

1. Acylation → COCH3 at 1.

2. Nitration → NO2 at 3.

3. Bromination → Br at 5.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents would be COCH3 at 1, NO2 at 3, Br at 5. Which doesn't match the target, which requires COCH3 at 1, Br at 3, NO2 at 5.

So how can that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Acylation → COCH3 at 1.

2. Nitration → NO2 at 5.

3. Bromination → Br at 3.

Because, after acylation, nitration would add meta to COCH3, which could be position 3 or 5. If it adds at 5, then bromination (directed by COCH3 and NO2) would add at position 3.

Wait, let me think:

After step 1: COCH3 at 1.

Step 2: nitration → adds to position 5 (meta to COCH3).

Now, substituents are at 1 and 5.

Step 3: bromination. Where would Br add? The existing groups are COCH3 (meta) and NO2 (meta). The possible positions are meta to both.

Looking at position 3: it's meta to COCH3 (since 1 and 3 are two positions apart) and ortho to NO2 at 5.

But wait, NO2 at 5 is a meta director. So the Br would be directed to position 3 (meta to COCH3, and ortho to NO2).

But NO2 is a strong deactivator; maybe the Br would prefer to be ortho or para to it. But NO2 is meta director, so ortho and para are not preferred. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is: acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

So:

1. Acylation → COCH3 at 1.

2. Bromination → Br at 3.

3. Nitration → NO2 at 5.

Which is the target.

So which option includes this sequence?

Looking at the options:

Option B: i) bromine, ii) nitrate, iii) acylation. No, that's not our order.

Option C: i) nitrate, then acylation. No.

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromine, iii) nitration. So that's steps 1,2,3 in the correct order.

But the option A has more steps beyond that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but the first three steps are correct, and the rest are extra steps which might be needed for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the target is after step iii. So why would the other steps be present?

Looking at the steps in option A:

i) acylation.

ii) bromination.

iii) nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl.

v) nitration.

vi) NaNO2/HCl.

vii) H3PO2.

Hmm, that seems like a lot. Maybe the initial steps produce the correct product, and the later steps are unnecessary. Or perhaps I'm mistaken and the correct sequence is longer.

Wait, another thought: the nitration in step iii may not be possible because the ring is deactivating. So maybe nitration needs to be done in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitration first. But that's difficult because the ring is deactivated after that. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me think about option D:

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → what's that? Maybe hydrolysis? I'm not sure.

Then v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

Hmm, but this seems to involve adding and removing groups, which is not ideal for the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B: bromination first, then nitrate, then acylation.

So:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added, but where? Bromobenzene is an ortho/para director.

So nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5 (if Br is at 1). Then acylation would add COCH3, which would be directed by Br and nitro.

Wait, let me imagine:

Step 1: benzene → bromobenzene (Br at 1).

Step 2: nitration → nitro can be at 3 or 5 (ortho/para to Br). Let’s say nitro at 3.

Step 3: acylation. Now, the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 3. Both are meta directors. So where would the acetyl group add?

The meta positions relative to Br would be 4 and 6. But nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to 4. Hmm, this might complicate the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps after bromination and nitration, the acetylation occurs.

Wait, but this seems to complicate the directing, and I'm not sure if it leads to the correct substituent positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, which has the correct initial steps.

But I'm getting stuck. Another approach: perhaps think about each reaction step in each option and see which leads to the target.

Looking at option A:

Step i: Acylation → acetophenone.

Step ii: bromination → Br at meta (position 3) relative to COCH3.

Step iii: nitration → NO2 at meta to COCH3, which is position 5.

So the product after step iii is the target. But the option has more steps, which I don't understand. Why would they do more steps?

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii is in a different position because of the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding Br and NO2 in certain positions, another step is needed.

Wait, perhaps when you add the groups in a certain order, some substituents are added in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to aniline (NH2).

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation → acetophenone, but wait, if the ring has NH2, Friedel-Crafts acylation would be possible because NH2 is a strong activating group. So acylation would occur at the meta position relative to NH2.

Wait, but after step ii, if we have aniline (NH2 at position 1), then acylation would add COCH3 at position 3 (meta to NH2). Then step iv: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Where would Br go? Now, the ring has NH2 (strong activating, ortho/para) and COCH3 (deactivating, meta). So Br would be directed by the most activating group, which is NH2.

So, after acylation, the substituents are NH2 at 1 and COCH3 at 3. Then bromination would add Br at position 5 (meta to COCH3) or ortho to NH2 (positions 2 or 6). But which is more likely?

Alternatively, maybe the Br adds ortho to NH2, which is position 2 or 6, but since COCH3 is at 3, which is meta to it, perhaps the directing is more complex.

Wait, if the ring has NH2 at 1 and COCH3 at 3, then Br would likely add ortho to NH2 (position 2 or 6), because NH2 is a strong activating group, directing ortho/para.

But if Br is added at position 2, then:

Substituents: NH2 at 1, COCH3 at 3, Br at 2. Then, any further steps, like nitration, would add where?

Hmm, but in option C, after step iv (bromination), there's another nitration. So step v: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Wait, this seems to be adding more substituents, but the target only has three. So perhaps option C isn't the right path.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the position of the substituents after each step in the options.

Looking back, the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration.

Which corresponds to option A steps i, ii, iii. So perhaps the answer is option A.

But why does option A have more steps? Perhaps because those steps are not needed, but maybe the initial three steps are sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another thought: the target has Br at 3 and NO2 at 5, both meta to COCH3 at 1. So perhaps the nitration occurs after bromination.

So the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration.

Which is option A's first three steps.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (COCH3, Br, and NO2) are added in the correct positions (1, 3, and 5, respectively) on the benzene ring. The substituents must be introduced in an order that allows proper directing effects, considering their electronic and steric influences.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3 adds the COCH3 group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with Br2/FeBr3 adds Br at position 3, which is meta to the COCH3 group.  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds NO2 at position 5, which is meta to the COCH3 group and para to the Br.  
   - This sequence achieves the target molecule after the first three steps. The additional steps (iv–vii) are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target compound but are included in the option.

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination with Br2/FeBr3 adds Br at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds NO2 at position 3 (ortho/para to Br).  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3 adds COCH3.  
   - This sequence does not lead to the correct positions for the substituents, as the directing effects of Br and NO2 would result in incorrect placement of the COCH3 group.

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds NO2 at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts NO2 to NH2.  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3 adds COCH3.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination with Br2/FeBr3 adds Br.  
   - This sequence is overly complicated and does not ensure the correct positions for the substituents.

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds NO2 at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts NO2 to NH2.  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO2/HCl and subsequent reaction with H3PO2 are unnecessary for this synthesis.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination with Br2/FeBr3 adds Br.  
   - **Step v**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3 adds COCH3.  
   - **Step vi**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 re-adds NO2.  
   - This sequence is inefficient and does not lead to the correct positions for the substituents.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is provided in **Option A**, where the COCH3 group is added first via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration in the correct positions. The additional steps in Option A are not necessary for the synthesis of the target compound but are included in the option.
