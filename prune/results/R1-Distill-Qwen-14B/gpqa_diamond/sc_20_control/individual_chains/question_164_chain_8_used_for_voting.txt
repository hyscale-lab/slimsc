Okay, so I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about binary star systems and radial velocities.

So, both systems are binary, meaning they consist of two stars orbiting a common center of mass. The periods given are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses, which I think is the orbital period of the binary system. For system_1, it's 2 years, and for system_2, it's 1 year.

The radial velocity (RV) variations are sinusoidal because each star's velocity changes as they orbit. The amplitudes given are the maximum velocities each star reaches. In system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s.

Wait, I remember that in binary systems, the more massive star moves slower. So the star with the larger mass has a smaller velocity amplitude, and the smaller mass star has a higher velocity. Because the center of mass requires that m1*v1 = m2*v2, right? So the mass ratio is v2/v1.

So, for system_1: let's call the two masses M1 and m1. Their velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So M1/m1 = v1_secondary / v1_primary. Wait, no, because the more massive star has smaller velocity. So the larger velocity corresponds to the smaller mass. So if star A has velocity 10 and star B 5, then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A. So 5/10 is 1/2. So M_A is half of M_B. So the total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = (0.5 + 1) M_B = 1.5 M_B.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If M1 is the mass of the first star and m1 the second, then M1 * v1 = m1 * v2 (since they orbit the center of mass). So M1/m1 = v2/v1.

So in system_1: v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So M1/m1 = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1 = (1/2) m1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + m1 = (1/2 m1) + m1 = (3/2) m1.

Similarly, in system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So M2 (primary mass) and m2 (secondary) would have M2/m2 = v2/v1. Wait, no, the primary is the one with the smaller velocity. Wait, no: the RV amplitude is higher for the less massive star. So for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So which is which?

Wait, let's clarify. The primary eclipse is when the brighter star is eclipsed. But the RV measurements are for both stars. So when they say in system_1, the RVs are 10 and 5, which star is which? I think we don't need to know which is primary for this calculation. Because the mass ratio depends on the velocities.

So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So the ratio of their masses is (v2)/(v1) = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1 is twice as large as m1? Wait, no, because M1 * v1 = m1 * v2. So M1/m1 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is 0.5 times m1. Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Because if M1 is 0.5 m1, then the heavier star would be m1, which is moving at 5 km/s. Wait, maybe I got the velocity association wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the higher velocity is the less massive star. So the star with 10 km/s is the less massive one. So M1 is the more massive, moving slower. So M1 has velocity 5, M2 has velocity 10. Wait, no, that can't be right because the system_1 has two stars with a certain velocity. Oh wait, wait, perhaps M1 and m1 are the two components. So in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So the more massive star has the smaller velocity.

So let's let M1 and M2 be the two masses in system_1. Their velocities are v1 and v2. So M1 v1 = M2 v2. So M1/M2 = v2 / v1. So in system_1, v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is 0.5 times M2. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2. So the mass of system_1 is 1.5*M2.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm getting confused with which velocity corresponds to which mass. Let me make it clearer. Let's say in system_1, star A has velocity amplitude K1=10, and star B has K2=5.

So mass A * velocity A = mass B * velocity B.

So (MA)/(MB) = (velocity B)/(velocity A) = 5/10 = 0.5.

So MA is 0.5 MB. So MB is twice MA.

So the total mass of system_1 is MA + MB = 0.5 MB + MB = 1.5 MB.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. Let's say star C has velocity K1=15, and star D has K2=10.

So (MC)/(MD) = (velocity D)/(velocity C) = 10/15 = 2/3.

Wait, no. Wait, the more massive star has the smaller velocity. So higher velocity → lower mass.

So in system_2, which star is more massive? The one with velocity 10, because it's smaller than 15. So star D has velocity 10, so it's more massive. So MC is the velocity 15, so it's the less massive star. So in system_2:

MC * 15 = MD * 10.

So MC / MD = 10/15 = 2/3.

So MD = (3/2) MC.

So the total mass of system_2 is MC + MD = MC + (3/2) MC = (5/2) MC.

Now, to find the mass of each system, system_1 is 1.5 MB, and system_2 is 2.5 MC.

But wait, we don't know the absolute masses. However, perhaps we can find the ratio of the total masses.

Wait, but how do we relate this to the orbital period? Because the period is given, and I think Kepler's third law is involved here.

Kepler's third law in binary systems relates the period to the total mass. The formula is P² (in years) is proportional to (a₁ + a₂)³ / (M1 + M2), where a is the semi-major axis. But another version is P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ (a₁ + a₂)^3 (M1 + M2)⁻¹. Wait, no, let me think in terms of the formula:

The formula for binary stars is:

P² = (4π² / G) * (a³) / (M1 + M2)

But wait, considering that a is the sum of the semi-major axes of the two stars' orbits around the center of mass. Alternatively, the formula is often written as:

P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ (a_total)^3 (M_total), where a_total is the separation between the two stars, and M_total is the sum of the masses.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the version that involves the total mass and the period. The formula is:

P² (in years²) is proportional to (a³) / (M_total), where a is in astronomical units (AU), and M_total is in solar masses.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

(P²) * (M_total) = (4π² a³)/(G)

But perhaps a better approach is to relate the masses using the velocity amplitudes and the periods.

Wait, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass function. The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by:

(K₁³ P) / (241 * (1 + q)²) ) = M_total,

where q is the mass ratio M2/M1.

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass function for each system and then find the ratio.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler approach. Let's think about the relation between the velocity amplitudes and the masses.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit the center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit (smaller velocity). The masses are inversely proportional to their velocities.

So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So the mass ratio is 10:5, which is 2:1. So the less massive star is the one moving faster (10 km/s), and the more massive star is moving slower (5 km/s). Wait, no: mass ratio is (v2)/(v1) = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 M2. So M1 is half of M2. So the total mass is 1.5 M2.

Similarly, in system_2, velocities are 15 and 10. So the mass ratio is (v2)/(v1) = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2' (the more massive star) is (2/3) M1'? Wait, no. Let me clarify: M1' is the more massive star, so it has smaller velocity. So in system_2, the star with 10 km/s is more massive, and the 15 km/s is less massive.

So the mass ratio M1'/M2' = (v2')/(v1') = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1' = (2/3) M2'. Wait, wait, no: M1' is the more massive, so M1' = (v2'/v1') * M2'? Hmm, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, M1 * v1 = M2 * v2.

So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

In system_1: M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5.

So M1 = 0.5 M2. So M2 = 2 M1.

In system_1, the total mass is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but that's in terms of M2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

For each system, I can compute the mass function, which relates the observed velocities, the period, and the mass ratio.

The mass function is given by:

f(M) = (K³ P) / (241 * (1 + q)² )

Where K is the velocity semi-amplitude, P is the period in years, and q is the mass ratio (q = M2/M1).

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the mass function.

The mass function for a binary system gives a value that depends on the masses and the inclination angle. However, without knowing the inclination, we can't get the absolute masses, but since both systems are eclipsing, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so we can assume that the mass function f(M) equals (M2³ sin³ i)/( (M1 + M2)² (1 + q)² ) ), but given that i is 90 degrees, sin i = 1, so it simplifies.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total mass of the binary system can be found using the formula:

M_total = (4π²/G) * (a³/(P²)) )

But since we don't have the separation a, perhaps it's better to relate the masses to each other using the velocities and the periods.

Wait, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass and the period. The formula for K is:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_s) ) )

Wait, this might not be the right way. Maybe I should think in terms of the mass ratio and the velocities.

Wait, I think the key is to compute the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Let me denote for system_1:

K1 = 10 km/s, K2 = 5 km/s.

The mass ratio q1 = M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2.

So M2 = 2 M1.

Total mass: M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

For system_2:

K1 = 15, K2 =10.

Mass ratio q2 = K1/K2 =15/10 = 1.5.

So M2' = 1.5 M1'.

Total mass: M1' + M2' = M1' + 1.5 M1' = 2.5 M1'.

Now, I need to relate the total masses of the two systems.

But to find the ratio of the masses (M1_total / M2_total), we need to find (3 M1)/(2.5 M1').

Wait, but how do I relate M1 and M1' to each other?

Ah, perhaps through Kepler's third law. Because the period is given, and the period relates to the total mass and the size of the orbit.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the context of binary systems is:

P² = (4π² / G) * (a_total)^3 / (M1 + M2)

But since a_total is the separation between the two stars, which we don't know, perhaps we can relate the two systems using their periods and the velocity amplitudes.

Alternatively, considering that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( ( (M_p + M_s) )^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that relates K, the period P, and the mass function.

The mass function is given by:

f(M) = (K³ P) / (241.3) )

But f(M) is (M_s³ sin³ i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^2 )

Since both systems are eclipsing, i is 90 degrees, so sin i =1.

But without knowing M_p and M_s, perhaps I can relate the mass functions of the two systems.

Wait, but let's think about the mass function for each system.

For system_1:

The mass function f1 = (K1^3 P1) / 241.3

Similarly for system_2:

f2 = (K2^3 P2) /241.3

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio of the total masses for the two systems using their periods and velocity amplitudes.

Wait, let's consider each system's total mass.

The total mass is M = M1 + M2.

We can relate M to the velocity amplitudes and the period.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G (M) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (1 + q)^(-2/3) ) )

Where q is the mass ratio (M2/M1).

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compute the ratio of the total masses using the given information.

Wait, the formula for K can be written as:

K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * ( (M) )^(1/3) / ( (P)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1 + q) )^(-2/3) )

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the total mass M is proportional to (a³)/(P²), where a is the separation.

But since we don't have a, perhaps we can relate the two systems using their periods and velocity amplitudes.

Wait, another approach: the orbital velocity of each star is proportional to (G M_total / a )^(1/2) * (m_i / M_total ), where m_i is the mass of star i.

Wait, perhaps I should express the velocity amplitudes in terms of the total mass and period.

Let me think about the velocity of each star. The velocity of a star in a binary system is given by:

v = (2π a_i ) / P

Where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass.

But a_i is related to the mass of the other star. Since M1 a1 = M2 a2, because they orbit the same center of mass.

So a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a_total,

a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a_total.

So the velocities are:

v1 = 2π a1 / P = 2π (M2 a_total)/( (M1+M2) P )

Similarly, v2 = 2π a2 / P = 2π (M1 a_total)/( (M1+M2) P )

But a_total is the separation between the two stars.

Now, Kepler's third law says:

P² = (4π² a_total³ )/( G (M1 + M2) )

So a_total³ = ( G (M1 + M2) P² )/(4π² )

Substitute a_total into the velocity expressions.

So,

v1 = 2π ( M2/(M1 + M2) ) * [ ( G (M1 + M2) P² ) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3) / P

Simplify:

v1 = 2π ( M2/(M1 + M2) ) * [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π²) ]^(1/3) * (1/P )

= 2π * (M2/(M_total)) ) * [ G M_total P² / (4 π²) ]^(1/3) * (1/P )

Similarly, let's compute this.

Let me compute the term inside the cube root:

[ G M_total P² / (4 π²) ]^(1/3) 

= [ (G M_total) / (4 π²) ) * P² ]^(1/3 )

= [ (G M_total) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * (P²)^(1/3 )

= [ (G M_total) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * P^(2/3 )

So,

v1 = 2π * (M2 / M_total) * [ (G M_total)/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * P^(2/3 -1 )

Wait, because P^ (2/3) * (1/P ) = P^(2/3 - 3/3 ) = P^(-1/3 )

Hmm, perhaps there's a better way to proceed.

Alternatively, considering that for each system, the velocities are known, and the period is known, perhaps I can find a ratio of the total masses.

Let me consider that for system_1, the velocities are K1 and K2, and for system_2, K1' and K2'.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find the ratio of the total masses using the given periods and velocity amplitudes.

Let me think about the fact that the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the cube of the period and the square root of the mass ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula that connects K, P, and M.

Wait, from the binary star velocity formula, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G M_total )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 π / P ) )^(1/3) * ( (1 + q )^(-2/3) ) ) / ( (1 + q ) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look for the relation between K and M.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

K = ( (G M_total )^(1/3) * (2 π )^(1/3) ) / ( (P )^(1/3) (1 + q )^(2/3) ) )

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

K = [ ( (G (M1 + M2) ) / (4 π²) )^(1/3) * (2 π / P ) ) ] * ( M2 / (M1 + M2) ) )

Wait, that might be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each system, the product of velocity amplitude and period is related to the mass.

Wait, let's try to find the ratio of the total masses.

Let me denote:

For system_1:

v1 = 10 km/s,

v2 =5 km/s,

P1 = 2 years.

For system_2:

v1' =15,

v2'=10,

P2=1 year.

The total mass of system_1 is M1 = M1 + m1 = 3 M1 (since M1 is 0.5 m1, as earlier determined).

Wait, no, earlier I found for system_1, M1 = 0.5 m1.

So M1 + m1 = 0.5 m1 + m1 = 1.5 m1. So system_1's total mass is 1.5 m1.

Similarly, for system_2, M2' and m2' have velocities 15 and 10.

So M2' = (10/15) m2' = (2/3) m2'.

So total mass is (2/3 m2') + m2' = (5/3 m2').

Now, I need to find the ratio of the total masses: system_1's mass / system_2's mass = (1.5 m1) / (5/3 m2').

But how do I relate m1 and m2'?

Hmm, perhaps I should relate using Kepler's third law.

The formula for the period is:

P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G (M1 + M2) )

But without knowing a, perhaps I can find a relation between the two systems.

Let me write the formula for each system.

For system_1:

P1² = (4 π² a1³ )/( G (M1_total) )

For system_2:

P2² = (4 π² a2³ )/( G (M2_total) )

So the ratio of (a1³)/(a2³) = ( P1² G M2_total )/( P2² G M1_total ) )

But a1 and a2 are the separations for each system, which I don't know. But maybe I can relate them through the velocities.

The velocity of each star is v = 2 π a_i / P.

So for system_1, the two stars have velocities v1 and v2.

v1 = 2 π a1_1 / P1,

v2 = 2 π a1_2 / P1.

But a1_1 + a1_2 = a1.

And from the mass ratio, a1_1 / a1_2 = M2 / M1 = (v1)/(v2) = 10/5 = 2.

So a1_1 = 2 a1_2.

Therefore, a1 = a1_1 + a1_2 = 3 a1_2.

So a1_1 = (2/3) a1,

a1_2 = (1/3) a1.

Similarly, for system_2:

a2_1 = (15/10) a2_2 = 1.5 a2_2,

so a2 = a2_1 + a2_2 = 2.5 a2_2.

So a2_1 = (3/2) a2_2,

a2_2 = (2/3) a2_1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the velocities in terms of a and P.

So for system_1,

v1 = 2 π a1_1 / P1,

v2 = 2 π a1_2 / P1.

But a1_1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a1,

a1_2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a1.

So,

v1 = 2 π ( M2/(M1 + M2) a1 ) / P1,

v2 = 2 π ( M1/(M1 + M2) a1 ) / P1.

Dividing v1 by v2 gives (M2/M1) = (v1)/(v2).

Which matches what we found earlier (M2 = 2 M1 for system_1).

But perhaps I can find a relation between a1 and a2 using the periods and the velocities.

Another approach: express a in terms of v and P.

a = (v * P )/(2 π )

Wait, no, because a is the orbital separation, and velocity is v = 2 π a_i / P,

so a_i = (v P )/(2 π )

But a1 = a1_1 + a1_2 = (v1 P1 + v2 P1 )/(2 π )

= ( (v1 + v2) P1 )/(2 π )

Similarly, for system_2,

a2 = (v1' + v2') P2/(2 π )

So a1 = (10 +5)*2 / (2 π ) = 15*2/(2 π ) = 30/(2 π ) ≈ 15/ π

a2 = (15+10)*1 / (2 π ) = 25/(2 π )

So a1 = 15/π,

a2 =25/(2 π )

Now, using Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G (M_total) )

So solving for M_total:

M_total = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

So for system_1:

M1_total = (4 π² (15/π )^3 )/( G (2)^2 )

= (4 π² * (3375)/( π^3 )) ) / (G *4 )

= (4 π² * 3375 ) / ( π^3 * 4 G )

= (3375 * π² ) / ( π^3 * G )

= (3375 )/( π G )

Similarly, for system_2:

M2_total = (4 π² (25/(2 π ))^3 )/( G (1)^2 )

= (4 π² * (15625)/(8 π^3 )) ) / ( G )

= (4 π² * 15625 )/(8 π^3 G )

= (4 * 15625 )/(8 π G )

= (62500 )/(8 π G )

= 7812.5/( π G )

So now, the ratio M1_total / M2_total is:

(3375/( π G )) / (7812.5/( π G )) )

= 3375 / 7812.5

Hmm, let's compute that.

3375 ÷ 7812.5 = ?

Well, 7812.5 * 0.432 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 3375 / 7812.5.

Let me compute 3375 ÷ 7812.5.

Divide numerator and denominator by 31.25:

3375 ÷31.25= 108,

7812.5 ÷31.25= 250.

So 108/250 = 0.432.

So the ratio M1_total / M2_total is 0.432.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculations.

Wait, wait, 3375 /7812.5.

Let me compute it as:

3375 ÷7812.5 = ?

Well, 7812.5 × 0.432 = ?

Wait, 7812.5 × 0.4 = 3125,

7812.5 × 0.032 = 250,

So 3125 +250= 3375.

Yes, so 0.432 is correct.

So system_1 has a total mass that's approximately 0.432 times that of system_2.

But wait, the question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, M1_total is 0.432 times M2_total.

But wait, no: M1_total is the total of system_1, and M2_total is the total of system_2.

So system_1's mass is 0.432 times that of system_2.

But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, no, because 0.432 < 1, that would mean system_1 is less massive than system_2.

But the options given are factors where A is ~0.4, B ~0.6, etc.

Wait, but the options are about how much more massive system_1 is than system_2. But according to this, system_1 is less massive. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, perhaps I messed up the ratio.

Wait, when I computed M1_total, it was 3375/(pi G), and M2_total was 7812.5/(pi G).

So M1_total / M2_total = 3375 /7812.5 = 0.432.

So system_1's mass is about 0.43 times that of system_2.

So system_2 is more massive. But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? If system_1 is less massive, then the factor would be less than 1. But the options include 0.4 and 0.6, etc. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, ~0.4.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a1 and a2.

Wait, when I computed a1 for system_1, I took a1 = (v1 +v2)*P/(2 pi).

Is that correct?

Wait, because the stars are orbiting each other, the total separation a is a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of their orbits around the center of mass.

But each star's velocity is v = 2 pi a_i / P.

So a_i = v_i * P/(2 pi )

So a1 = a1_1 + a1_2 = (v1 P)/(2 pi) + (v2 P)/(2 pi ) = (v1 + v2 ) P/(2 pi )

Ah, that's correct.

So for system_1, a1 = (10 +5 ) * 2/(2 pi ) = 15 *2/(2 pi )= 30/(2 pi )= 15/pi.

And for system_2, a2 = (15 +10)*1/(2 pi )= 25/(2 pi )

So that part is correct.

Then, plugging into Kepler's law:

M_total = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G P^2 )

So for system_1, M1_total = (4 pi^2 (15/pi )^3 ) / ( G (2)^2 )

Compute numerator:

4 pi^2 * (3375)/(pi^3 ) = (4 pi^2 * 3375 )/(pi^3 ) = (4 *3375 )/(pi ) = 13500/pi.

Denominator: G *4.

So M1_total = (13500/pi )/(4 G )= 3375/(pi G )

Similarly for system_2:

a2 =25/(2 pi )

a^3 = (25/(2 pi ))^3 = 15625/(8 pi^3 )

So numerator: 4 pi^2 * 15625/(8 pi^3 ) = (4 pi^2 * 15625 )/(8 pi^3 )= (4 *15625)/(8 pi ) = (62500)/(8 pi )= 7812.5/pi.

Denominator: G *1^2 = G.

So M2_total = (7812.5/pi ) / G = 7812.5/(pi G )

Thus, the ratio M1_total / M2_total = (3375/(pi G )) / (7812.5/(pi G )) )= 3375 /7812.5 = 0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times the mass of system_2. So system_2 is about twice as massive as system_1.

But the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So system_1 is 0.43 times the mass of system_2, meaning it's about 0.43 times as massive, so system_1 is less massive. So the factor is approximately 0.43, which is option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but the options are given as the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. If system_1 is 0.43 times the mass of system_2, that would mean system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive, so it's less massive. So the factor is 0.43. So the answer would be approximately 0.4, which is option A.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, the formula M_total = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G P^2 )

Yes.

So let me compute M1_total and M2_total again.

For system_1:

a =15/pi,

a^3 = (15^3)/(pi^3 ) = 3375/(pi^3 )

So numerator:4 pi^2 * 3375/(pi^3 )=4 *3375/(pi )

= 13500/pi.

Denominator: G * (2)^2 =4 G.

So M1_total = (13500/pi )/(4 G )= 3375/(pi G )

For system_2:

a=25/(2pi )

a^3 = (25^3)/( (2pi )^3 )= 15625/(8 pi^3 )

Numerator:4 pi^2 *15625/(8 pi^3 )= (4 *15625 )/(8 pi )= (62500)/(8 pi )=7812.5/pi.

Denominator: G *1^2= G.

So M2_total=7812.5/(pi G )

Thus, the ratio is 3375/(pi G ) divided by 7812.5/(pi G ) = 3375/7812.5= 0.432.

So yes, it's correct.

Therefore, system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So the factor is 0.43, which is approximately 0.4. So the correct answer is option A) ~ 0.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the properties of binary star systems and Kepler's third law. The key steps are as follows:

1. **System Properties**:
   - System_1 has a period \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \) and radial velocity amplitudes \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - System_2 has a period \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \) and radial velocity amplitudes \( K_1' = 15 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_2' = 10 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Mass Ratio from Velocities**:
   - The mass ratio \( q \) is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitudes: \( q = \frac{K_{\text{secondary}}}{K_{\text{primary}}} \).
   - For system_1: \( q_1 = \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \). Thus, the total mass of system_1 is \( M_{\text{total,1}} = M_1 + M_2 = 1.5 M_2 \).
   - For system_2: \( q_2 = \frac{K_2'}{K_1'} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \). Thus, the total mass of system_2 is \( M_{\text{total,2}} = M_1' + M_2' = 2.5 M_1' \).

3. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   - Kepler's third law relates the orbital period \( P \), the total mass \( M_{\text{total}} \), and the orbital separation \( a \):  
     \[
     P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G M_{\text{total}}}.
     \]
   - Rearranging, the total mass is given by:
     \[
     M_{\text{total}} = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G P^2}.
     \]

4. **Orbital Separation**:
   - The orbital separation \( a \) can be expressed in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period:
     \[
     a = \frac{(K_{\text{primary}} + K_{\text{secondary}}) P}{2\pi}.
     \]
   - For system_1:  
     \[
     a_1 = \frac{(10 + 5) \cdot 2}{2\pi} = \frac{30}{2\pi} = \frac{15}{\pi}.
     \]
   - For system_2:  
     \[
     a_2 = \frac{(15 + 10) \cdot 1}{2\pi} = \frac{25}{2\pi}.
     \]

5. **Total Mass Ratio**:
   - Substituting \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) into the formula for \( M_{\text{total}} \), the ratio of the total masses is:
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{\frac{4\pi^2 a_1^3}{G P_1^2}}{\frac{4\pi^2 a_2^3}{G P_2^2}} = \frac{a_1^3 / P_1^2}{a_2^3 / P_2^2}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( a_1 = \frac{15}{\pi} \), \( a_2 = \frac{25}{2\pi} \), \( P_1 = 2 \), and \( P_2 = 1 \):
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{15}{\pi}\right)^3 / 2^2}{\left(\frac{25}{2\pi}\right)^3 / 1^2}.
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{\frac{3375}{\pi^3} / 4}{\frac{15625}{8\pi^3}} = \frac{3375 \cdot 8}{4 \cdot 15625} = \frac{27000}{62500} = 0.432.
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - System_1 is approximately \( 0.43 \) times as massive as system_2. This corresponds to a factor of \( \sim 0.4 \).
