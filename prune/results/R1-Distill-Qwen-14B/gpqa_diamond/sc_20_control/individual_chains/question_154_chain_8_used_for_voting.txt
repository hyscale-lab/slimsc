Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist found an unnamed white solid in a bottle and is using spectral data to identify it. The data given includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR. I need to look at each of these and match them to the possible options.

First, the mass spec data: the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. I remember that molecular ions can sometimes lose a fragment, and the difference between the m/z values can give clues. Let's calculate the difference between 158 and 156, which is 2. So, maybe it's a chlorine isotope? Because chlorine has two common isotopes: Cl-35 (75%) and Cl-37 (~25%). So, if the molecule has a Cl atom, the molecular ion would appear as a doublet. The molecular ion at 156 would correspond to the Cl-35 isotope, and at 158, Cl-37. The relative intensity is 32%, which is about a quarter of the molecular ion. That fits because Cl-37 is about 25% abundant, so maybe that's right. So the molecule likely has a Cl atom.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That looks like a carbonyl group. The sharpness suggests maybe an ester or a ketone, but considering the O-H from the IR, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is broad (due to hydrogen bonding), and the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is a bit higher, maybe around 1740, but 1720 could fit either. Wait, let me think. Carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1, but esters are a bit higher, like 1720-1750. Oh, but wait, the exact position can vary based on conjugation and other factors. So a strong peak at 1720 could be an ester or maybe a ketone. But considering the O-H in the IR, carboxylic acid is a possibility. Another possibility is an aldehyde, but aldehyde O-H is not present. Wait, no. Aldehydes don't have O-H. So if the IR shows O-H, it's probably a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But in the options, I need to see which ones have O-H and a carbonyl.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
Structure: Cl attached to benzene ring, with a hydroxyl (OH) group on position 2 and an aldehyde (CHO) on position 3. So this compound has both an aldehyde and an alcohol group.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
Structure: Cl on the benzene ring at position 4, and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on position 1.

C) Phenyl chloroformate
Structure: O=C(OCl) attached to a benzene ring. So this would be something like Cl-O-CO-Ph. Wait, no. Wait, phenyl chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. Or maybe O=C(Cl)-O-Ph? Hmm, not entirely sure, but the structure would have a carbonyl group and a Cl.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid
Same as B but Cl at position 2. So structure: Cl on position 2, COOH on position 1.

Now, back to the IR. Broad peak 3500-2700 suggests O-H (maybe in a carboxylic acid, which has a broad O-H stretch). The peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So if it's a benzoic acid, the COOH would show a strong peak around 1700. But 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or maybe a ketone.

But wait, benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1700 cm^-1. So 1720 is a bit higher. So maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid derivative, like an ester. Or perhaps it's a ketone. Let's think about the options.

Option B and D are benzoic acids, so their carbonyl would be around 1680. So the IR peak at 1720 might suggest something else. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a chloroformate, as in option C. Let me think about phenyl chloroformate. I think chloroformate esters have a carbonyl around 1720-1750 cm^-1, which matches the IR data. So the IR data would fit a chloroformate.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 11.0 ppm, singlet, 1H. That's a strong indication of an exchangeable proton, possibly an -OH group, maybe in a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids usually have broad peaks, but this is a singlet, which could be an O-H in an acidic environment. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they are also deshielded, but they are split if coupled. Wait, the 11 ppm is very downfield for an aldehyde.

Wait, in the options, option A has an aldehyde group. So its proton would be around 9-10 ppm, perhaps. But the NMR shows 11.0 ppm as a singlet. Hmm. Also, the NMR shows a proton at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That sounds like a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are two doublets each integrating to 2H. So each pair is two H, each coupled to each other.

So the benzene ring is para-substituted. Let's think: in benzoic acid, the COOH would be at position 1, and if Cl is in position 4 (option B), the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the substituent is at position 1 (carboxylic acid), so if Cl is at 4, that would be para to the COOH. So the ring would have substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the H would be at the 2,3,5,6 positions. Wait, but in the NMR, the two doublets (each 2H) would imply that the ring is para-substituted, meaning two substituents in the para positions. Or perhaps one substituent in the para position, making the ring have two sets of H, each as doublets. Wait, let me think.

Wait, if the substituent is in position 4 (Cl) and the COOH is in position 1 (B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid), then the ring would have the Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. The remaining positions (2,3,5,6) would have H. So positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl, and positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to COOH. But in the NMR, the two doublets are each 2H, which suggests that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. So maybe two substituents that are para to each other. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent and an electron-withdrawing group that deshields the protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like a chloroformate. Let me think about option C: phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, that's not right. Wait, chloroformate is O=C(OCl)-R. Or maybe it's Cl-C(O)-O-Ph. Either way, the structure would have a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an OCl group.

In that case, the benzene ring would be meta or para substituted. Wait, the NMR shows two sets of doublets, each 2H, which would fit a para-substituted ring. So if the substituent is at position 1 (the chloroformate group), then the ring would have two sets of H: positions 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent) and positions 3 and 5 (meta). But wait, in that case, the coupling would be between ortho and para positions? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, if the substituent is at position 1, then the H in positions 2 and 6 would be ortho, and positions 3 and 5 would be meta. Each of these pairs would be equivalent, leading to two doublets. So for example, the H in positions 2 and 6 would couple with each other (if they are adjacent), but wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the ortho positions are adjacent. So their coupling would lead to a doublet for each. Hmm.

Wait, for a para-substituted benzene, the two H's ortho to the substituent would be equivalent and split into a doublet due to coupling with each other. Similarly, the two H's meta would also be equivalent and split into another doublet. So yes, the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

So the benzene ring is para-substituted. So the substituent is at position 1, and the other substituent is at position 4? Or perhaps the substituent is in position 1, and the ring is para-substituted with that group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So the benzene ring has Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. Then, the protons in positions 2,3,5,6 would be on the ring. Positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In such a case, the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those in 3 and 5 would be another set. So each would form a doublet. Because each set of H's is coupled with their adjacent H's. So that would fit the NMR data of two doublets, each 2H. So that's plausible.

Now, looking at the NMR shifts: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d,2H). The higher shift (8.02) is more deshielded. In benzoic acid derivatives, substituents can cause the ring protons to shift. The COOH group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the protons ortho and para to it would be deshielded and appear downfield. Similarly, the Cl is also an electron-withdrawing group, so the protons ortho to Cl would be deshielded. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H in positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The H in positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH.

So the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more downfield because of the electron-withdrawing effect of COOH. So they would appear at a higher ppm, around 8.02. The H's ortho to Cl (3 and 5) would be deshielded as well but perhaps not as much as those near COOH. So they might be at 7.72 ppm. That fits the NMR data.

So, the NMR data supports option B or D.

Wait, in option D, it's 2-chlorobenzoic acid, so Cl is at position 2 and COOH at position 1. Then, the ring would have H's at positions 3,4,5,6. Let me see: positions 3 and 5 would be para to each other, but wait, in benzoic acid with substituents at 1 and 2, the ring would have ortho and meta positions differently. Hmm, maybe the NMR would not show the same pattern. Because if Cl is at position 2, the ring would have substituents at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl), making the structure more ortho substituted.

In that case, the ring H's would be at positions 3,4,5,6. How would that split the NMR peaks? Let's think. The H at position 3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2) and adjacent to position 4. The H at position 4 is between position 3 and 5. H at position 5 is adjacent to position 6 and position 4. H at position 6 is adjacent to position 5 and position 1.

Wait, this might complicate the splitting. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about whether the NMR would show two doublets. If the substituents are at 1 and 2, the ring would have more complex splitting, perhaps leading to more than two signals. Because the substituents are ortho to each other, the coupling patterns might not be as simple as two doublets.

Alternatively, in option B, substituents are at 1 and 4 (para), leading to two doublets in the NMR, each for two H's. That seems to fit the data.

So the NMR data seems to support option B or D. But D has Cl at position 2, which might complicate the ring's substitution pattern.

Another point: the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. For benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, which suggests no coupling. So that fits a COOH group, as the O-H is usually broad but sometimes can appear as a singlet depending on exchange. Alternatively, the singlet could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm. So the 11.0 ppm is more indicative of a carboxylic acid O-H.

Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Let me calculate the molecular weight. Let me see:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me compute the molecular weight. C:7*(12) =84, H:5*(1)=5, Cl:35.5, O:16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. Wait, the molecular ion is at 156 (m/z=156). So if the formula is C7H5ClO2, the molecular weight is approximately 156.5, which is close to 156. So the molecular ion would be at 156, and the Cl isotope would cause a peak at 158. So that matches the mass spec data.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula is the same as B, because it's just the position of Cl that changes. So same molecular weight, same mass spec pattern.

Looking back at the options, options B and D have the same molecular formula, so their mass spec would be the same.

So now, their NMR and IR need to be considered.

In IR, a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a bit higher than the typical 1700 of a carboxylic acid. So is this a problem?

Wait, sometimes in carboxylic acids, the carbonyl can be a bit higher if there's conjugation or other effects. But 1720 is more typical for an ester. So does this suggest something else?

Alternatively, could it be a chloroformate? Let's think about option C: phenyl chloroformate. The structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, no, chloroformate is O=C(OCl)-R. So the structure would be O=C(OCl)-Ph. The carbonyl in chloroformates is usually around 1720-1750 cm^-1, which matches the IR data. So the IR here would fit option C as well.

But then the NMR data would come into play. Let me think about option C: phenyl chloroformate. The structure would be O=C(OCl)-Ph. So the benzene ring would have the O=C(OCl) group attached. How would the NMR look?

In the NMR, we'd expect a singlet for the equivalent H's on the benzene ring. Wait, no. If the substituent is in position 1, then the ring would have H's in positions 2,3,4,5,6. Wait, but in chloroformate, the substituent is a strong EWG, so the ring would have deshielded H's. But the substituent is a single group (O=C(OCl)Ph), so the ring would be monosubstituted, leading to a single set of H's. But in the data, the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, suggesting a para-substituted ring. So that's not matching for option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there are two substituents on the ring, but I don't think option C suggests that. So maybe option C is less likely.

Another point: looking at option A, which is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That structure would have an OH group (as in option A), which would show a broad peak in IR, and an aldehyde group, which would have a peak around 2800-2700 (stretching) and a proton around 9-10 ppm in NMR. But in the NMR data, the singlet is at 11 ppm, which is more like a COOH group. Also, the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which doesn't fit an aldehyde's carbonyl (which is around 1700 cm^-1 but higher if aromatic). But the aldehyde would also have a peak around 2820 and 2720 cm^-1 for the C-H stretch. The IR data doesn't mention any peaks in that region, so maybe option A is less likely.

Moreover, the NMR of option A would have an aldehyde proton around 9.5-10 ppm, but the data shows a singlet at 11.0, which is more for a COOH. So option A is probably not the right choice.

So, back to options B and D. Both have the same molecular formula, so their mass spec is the same. Their NMR would differ based on substitution pattern.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So the ring has Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. The H's at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would couple with each other and appear as a doublet, perhaps around 8.02 ppm. The H's at positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH) would couple with each other and appear as another doublet, perhaps around 7.72 ppm. The -COOH proton would be a broad peak in the NMR, but in the data, it's a singlet at 11.0 ppm. Wait, but in the given data, the singlet is 1H. In benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak, not a singlet, but in the data, it's a singlet. Hmm, that's a point of confusion.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is not a benzoic acid but something where the -OH is not a broad peak. Wait, but benzoic acid's O-H is usually broad. Alternatively, maybe the sample is deprotonated, but that's more in solution, and NMR is done in solution. Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. Could that be an exchange process? Sometimes, in DMSO or under certain conditions, the O-H peak might appear as a sharp singlet. But usually, it's broad.

Wait, another possibility: if the structure is a chloroformate, the O-H (if any) would be different. But option C is phenyl chloroformate, which I think doesn't have an O-H. Wait, no. Chloroformate is O=C(OCl)-R, which is an acid chloride. It doesn't have an O-H. So then why is there a broad peak in the IR from 3500-2700? If the compound doesn't have O-H, this would be a problem.

Wait, but option C doesn't have an O-H group. Because the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph? No, wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-O-CO-Ph. So the structure is O=C(OCl)-Ph. There's no O-H in this structure. So the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 wouldn't make sense. Because without O-H, that peak wouldn't be present. Therefore, option C is probably not correct.

So, back to options B and D. The singlet at 11.0 ppm in NMR. If it's a carboxylic acid, that's the COOH proton. Why is it a singlet? Maybe because it's exchanging and the peak is sharp. But I thought it would be broad. Alternatively, maybe the sample is a salt, like the sodium salt, but that would have a different molecular weight. So perhaps the data suggests an exchange process where the proton is not split, hence a singlet.

Another point: in the mass spec, the molecular ion is at 156, and there's a peak at 158 (32%). For option B, the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, which has a molecular weight of 156.5. So the M+ peak is at 156 (due to Cl-35), and the M+2 peak is at 158 (Cl-37), which is about 32% because Cl-37 is about 25% of natural chlorine. So the mass data fits.

Now, the IR: if the compound is a benzoic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1. But the IR shows 1720, which is higher. So why is that? Could there be conjugation or another group affecting the carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let me think. If the structure was an ester, like phenyl chloroformate, the carbonyl would be higher. But we already considered that, and the NMR didn't fit.

Wait, maybe the IR peak at 1720 is actually from a carbonyl in a different environment. Could it be a ketone? But the options don't have any ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid anhydride, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR is slightly off, and the 1720 is due to a conjugated carbonyl. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1700, but if there's electron-withdrawing groups, like Cl, the carbonyl could be higher. So 1720 could be possible.

So, perhaps the IR peak is acceptable.

Putting it all together: the mass spec fits options B and D, the NMR fits B, and the IR is a bit ambiguous but could fit B.

Another point: the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is a strong, sharp peak. For a carboxylic acid, this is a bit unusual as the O-H is usually broad. Could this indicate something else? Maybe it's not a carboxylic acid but an aldehyde. Wait, but the 11 ppm is too high for an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm.

Wait, another possibility: the peak at 11 could be an acidic H, like in a phenol. But the options don't have a phenol except option A, which is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. But that would have both an aldehyde and a phenol group. The IR would show O-H (phenol) and maybe the aldehyde's carbonyl. But the NMR would have an aldehyde proton as a singlet, perhaps around 9.5-10 ppm, but the data has a peak at 11, which is higher. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, option A's structure would have an aldehyde and a phenol group. The aldehyde would have a peak around 9-10 ppm, and the phenol's O-H might be a broad peak in IR. But the NMR shows a singlet at 11, which doesn't fit aldehyde. So perhaps option A is less likely.

So, circling back, the best fit seems to be option B or D.

Wait, another thought: the molecular ion's molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the exact molecular weight. C:7*12=84, H:5*1=5, Cl:35.5, O:16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156, which is the M+ peak for Cl-35. The M+2 is at 158, which would be Cl-37, as expected.

So, the structure has one Cl atom, which is correct for options B and D.

Now, the NMR for benzoic acid derivatives: the COOH proton is typically a broad peak, but maybe under certain conditions, like in the presence of a strong acid or base, it could appear as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is integrated and appears as a singlet because it's exchanging rapidly and doesn't split.

In any case, the NMR data has a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which I think is more consistent with a carboxylic acid's O-H proton, despite it being a singlet. So option B or D.

The IR's 1720 cm^-1 is a bit higher than the typical benzoic acid, but perhaps because of the Cl's electron-withdrawing effect, the carbonyl is deshielded and appears higher. I've heard that substituents can shift the carbonyl peak. For example, in chlorobenzoic acids, the carbonyl peak can be around 1700-1720 cm^-1. So that could fit.

So, putting all this together, the correct answer is either B or D. But the NMR data shows two doublets, each 2H, which would fit a para-substituted ring. So option B, which has Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1, would have the ring substituents in para positions, leading to two sets of two H's, each a doublet, as observed.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data: mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Mass Spectrometry
- Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)** and **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggest the presence of a chlorine atom, as the isotopic pattern corresponds to chlorine's natural abundance (Cl-35: 75%, Cl-37: 25%). This matches the molecular formula **C7H5ClO2**, with a molecular weight of approximately 156.5.

### IR Spectroscopy
- A **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** suggests a carbonyl group. This is slightly higher than the typical 1700 cm⁻¹ for carboxylic acids, possibly due to conjugation or electron-withdrawing effects from the chlorine atom.

### 1H NMR
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A sharp singlet in this region is consistent with the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid.
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The higher chemical shift (8.02 ppm) indicates deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the lower shift (7.72 ppm) corresponds to protons meta to the chlorine atom.

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
   - Contains both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. The aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm in the NMR, not 11.0 ppm. Additionally, the IR would show aldehyde C-H stretching around 2800 cm⁻¹, which is not observed. This option is inconsistent with the data.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - The structure has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 4. The para-substitution pattern explains the two doublets in the NMR (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm). The singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid O-H proton. The IR and mass data are also consistent with this structure.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**
   - This compound lacks an O-H group, making the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ impossible to explain. Additionally, the NMR data does not match the expected pattern for a monosubstituted benzene ring. This option is inconsistent with the data.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - The structure has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 2. This ortho-substitution would result in a more complex NMR pattern, not the two simple doublets observed. Thus, this option is less likely than B.

### Conclusion
The spectral data (mass, IR, and NMR) are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern, the singlet at 11.0 ppm for the carboxylic acid O-H proton, and the molecular formula all support this structure.

**Answer: B**
