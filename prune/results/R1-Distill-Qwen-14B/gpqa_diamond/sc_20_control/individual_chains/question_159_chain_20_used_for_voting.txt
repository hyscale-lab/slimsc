Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this cosmology question. Hmm, the question is about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I'm supposed to find the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth based on the given cosmological parameters.

Wait, I remember that in cosmology, the peak emission of an object can be related to its redshift. Like how the Lyman-alpha forest is from distant galaxies where their emission lines are redshifted into the visible spectrum. So, in this case, the peak at 790 nm might be the rest frame emission line that's been redshifted.

Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. But wait, that's for hydrogen. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer. Let me calculate the redshift z. Redshift z is (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So z = 790 / 121 - 1. Let me compute that: 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So subtracting 1 gives z ≈5.528.

Wait, wait. Is 790 nm in the near infrared? Yeah, near IR is about 700-2500 nm, so 790 is in the near IR. The optical part is up to about 700 nm, so maybe the peak is just at the optical-infrared boundary.

So if the rest wavelength is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), observed is 790 nm, so z≈(790/121)-1 ≈6.5206-1 = 5.5206. So redshift z ≈5.5. But wait, I might be confusing with other emission lines. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer break or something else, but I think Lyman-alpha is a common one.

But wait another thought: the Balmer series starts at 365 nm (H-alpha maybe?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the peak is due to a different transition, but the calculation seems similar. Let's proceed with z≈5.5.

Now, the next part: using the Lambda-CDM model parameters to find the comoving distance. The given parameters are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_k=0).

The comoving distance for a given redshift is calculated using the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z)) dz, where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). Wait, is that right? Because for a flat universe, that's correct. So E(z) = (Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda)^(1/2). Wait, and sometimes dark energy is modeled as a cosmological constant, which is the case here, so the expression is correct.

So the comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) * integral from 0 to z of 1/sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda) dz'.

Hmm, but calculating this integral for z=5.5 is going to be a bit tricky. I don't remember the exact formula off the top of my head, but perhaps I can approximate it or use a known result.

Wait, for high redshifts, when z is large, the dark energy starts to dominate. The matter density decreases as (1+z)^3, so at high z, Omega_m*(1+z)^3 becomes much larger than Omega_lambda, but wait no, because Omega_lambda is about 0.7, and Omega_m is 0.3. Wait, at z=5.5, (1+z) is 6.5. So (1+z)^3 is 276.125. So Omega_m*(1+z)^3 = 0.3 * 276.125 ≈82.8375. Omega_lambda is 0.7, so E(z) would be sqrt(82.8375 + 0.7) ≈sqrt(83.5375)≈9.14. So 1/E(z) is about 0.109.

Wait, but if I'm integrating 1/E(z) from 0 to z, and at z=5.5, E(z) is about 9.14. So for all z up to 5.5, the integrand is 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

But integrating this analytically is complicated because it's a non-linear function. Maybe we can approximate the integral numerically or use a look-up table.

Alternatively, I remember that for a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3, the comoving distance for z=5.5 is approximately 10-11 billion parsecs. But wait, the options given are up to 9 Gpc. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, wait. Maybe I'm mixing up different redshifts. Let me think again. Wait, for the same parameters, the comoving distance at higher redshifts is larger than lower ones. For example, a redshift of 1 gives about 2 Gpc (for H0=70), but I'm not sure. Let me try to find an approximate formula.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for the age of the universe, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the luminosity distance, but that's similar to the comoving distance in a matter-dominated universe, but not here.

Wait, perhaps I can use the approximation for the comoving distance in a Lambda-CDM universe. There's a standard expression, but I don't remember it exactly. Alternatively, I can think about using the look-up table or an approximate integral.

Another approach: use the approximation for the integral. Let me try to approximate it numerically.

The integral is from z=0 to z=5.5 of dz/[sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7)].

Let me break this integral into several parts. Let's pick some z values and compute 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7) at each point, then approximate the area.

For z =0: 1/sqrt(0.3*1 +0.7) =1/sqrt(1) =1.

z=1: 1/sqrt(0.3*8 +0.7)=1/sqrt(2.4+0.7)=1/sqrt(3.1)=0.557.

z=2: 1/sqrt(0.3*27 +0.7)=1/sqrt(8.1+0.7)=1/sqrt(8.8)=0.333.

z=3: 1/sqrt(0.3*64 +0.7)=1/sqrt(19.2 +0.7)=1/sqrt(19.9)=0.220.

z=4: 1/sqrt(0.3*125 +0.7)=1/sqrt(37.5+0.7)=1/sqrt(38.2)=0.164.

z=5: 1/sqrt(0.3*216 +0.7)=1/sqrt(64.8 +0.7)=1/sqrt(65.5)=0.124.

z=5.5: 1/sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 +0.7)= 6.5^3 is 274.625. 0.3*274.625=82.3875. 82.3875+0.7=83.0875. sqrt(83.0875)=9.115. So 1/9.115≈0.1097.

So let's approximate the integral by using the midpoint for each interval.

Wait, perhaps using the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule. Alternatively, since the function is decreasing, I can approximate each interval's value.

Let me make a table of z and the integrand f(z):

z | f(z) = 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7)
0 | 1.000
1 | 0.557
2 | 0.333
3 | 0.220
4 | 0.164
5 | 0.124
5.5|0.1097

Now, let's approximate the integral from 0 to5.5 by breaking it into intervals:

From z=0 to 5.5, let me divide into intervals where the function changes significantly.

Let me do this step by step.

Maybe it's easier to use the midpoint values or average over intervals.

Alternatively, let's use the fact that the function f(z) decreases as z increases.

But perhaps a better way is to use the approximation formula. Alternatively, I can use an online calculator or remember that for z=5.5, the comoving distance for these parameters is about 11 Gpc, but the options don't go that high.

Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7. So perhaps my initial assumption about the redshift is wrong.

Wait, maybe the peak isn't Lyman alpha. Let me think again. Wait, 790 nm is near infrared, which is longer than 700 nm. So maybe the rest wavelength is 790*(1+z) = rest wavelength. Hmm, wait no, the observed wavelength is longer, so (1+z) = observed / rest.

Wait, maybe the peak is from the Lyman series but a higher transition. Or perhaps it's from the Balmer series. Another possibility is the Balmer break, but I think that's in the optical.

Wait, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman limit transition, which is at 91.2 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then (1+z)=790/91.2 ≈8.66. So z≈7.66. That's a higher redshift.

Hmm, that's a big difference. So which one is it?

Wait, the problem says that the flux drops significantly below 790 nm. So maybe the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux is high there. If in the rest frame, the emission line is at a shorter wavelength, then when we observe it at 790, it's redshifted.

But let's think about the Lyman-alpha line at 121 nm. If that's the peak, then z= (790/121)-1 ≈6.52. So that would be a redshift of about 6.5.

Alternatively, if it's the Lyman limit at 91 nm, then z= (790/91)-1= 8.68-1=7.68.

Wait, but the peak is in the near infrared and optical. 790 nm is near the boundary between optical and infrared. So if the rest wavelength is in the UV, then it's redshifted into the optical/near IR.

But let's proceed with both possibilities. Let's first compute for z=6.5 and z=7.68.

But perhaps the peak is due to another line. For example, the Lyman series includes higher transitions. The first few lines are Lyman alpha (n=2→1, 121 nm), Lyman beta (n=3→1, 102.6 nm), etc. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, the rest would be 790/(1+z) = rest. Let me try z=5.5: 790/(1+5.5)=790/6.5≈121.5 nm. Oh! That's exactly the Lyman-alpha line at about 121 nm. So that must be it. So z≈5.5.

So the redshift z is approximately 5.5.

Now, compute the comoving distance D_C for z=5.5.

The formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z [1 / E(z')] dz'

Where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^0) because dark energy is modeled as a cosmological constant.

So E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

H0 is given as 70 km/s/Mpc. c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e5 km/s.

So c/H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) = (3e5 /70 ) Mpc ≈4285.7 Mpc ≈4.2857 Gpc.

Now, the integral part: ∫₀^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)] dz'

This integral is a bit tricky. I might need to approximate it numerically. Let me try to compute it step by step.

Let me break the integral into intervals and approximate using the midpoint rule or trapezoidal rule.

Another approach is to use an online cosmology calculator or remember that for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5.5 is approximately 10,000 Mpc (10 Gpc), but that's higher than the options given. Hmm, but maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe I can use the approximation formula or a table. I remember that for high redshifts, the comoving distance increases but perhaps not as fast as a matter-dominated universe.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for z >>1, E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3) = sqrt(0.3) * (1+z)^(3/2). So 1/E(z) ≈ 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^1.5 )

But integrating 1/(1+z)^1.5 from 0 to z would give something like 2/(sqrt(z+1)).

Wait, let's compute that. If we approximate the integral as ∫ dz/(sqrt(0.3)(1+z)^1.5) ) from 0 to z.

The integral becomes 1/sqrt(0.3) * ∫ dz/(1+z)^1.5 from 0 to z.

Which is 1/sqrt(0.3) * [ -2/(1+z) ] from 0 to z.

So evaluating that: 1/sqrt(0.3) * [ -2/(1+z) + 2/(1+0) ].

So 1/sqrt(0.3) * [ 2 - 2/(1+z) ].

At z=5.5: 1/sqrt(0.3)≈1.826.

So 1.826 * [2 - 2/(6.5) ] → 1.826 * [2 - 0.3077] → 1.826 * 1.6923 ≈3.083.

So the integral is approximately 3.083.

But wait, this is an approximation valid only when z is large enough that the matter density dominates. But for z=5.5, the dark energy term is about 0.7, and the matter term is about 0.3*(6.5)^3=0.3*274.625≈82.388, so E(z)=sqrt(82.388+0.7)=sqrt(83.088)=≈9.115.

But in the approximation, I ignored the dark energy term. So this approximation might not be accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a more precise method.

Let me try to compute the integral numerically, breaking it into intervals.

Let me choose several points between 0 and 5.5 and compute f(z) at each.

Let me create a table:

z | f(z) = 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7)
0 | 1.000
1 | 0.557
2 | 0.333
3 | 0.220
4 | 0.164
5 | 0.124
5.5|0.1097

Now, let's apply the trapezoidal rule for integration. The trapezoidal rule approximates the integral as the sum of the average of f at each point multiplied by the interval.

But the interval sizes are 1 each, except the last which is 0.5.

So from 0 to1: interval=1.

The trapezoid area for each interval is (f(z_i) + f(z_{i+1}))/2 * delta_z.

Compute each part:

Interval 0-1: (1.000 + 0.557)/2 *1 = (1.557)/2 =0.7785

Interval 1-2: (0.557 +0.333)/2 *1 =0.89/2=0.445

Interval 2-3: (0.333 +0.220)/2 *1=0.553/2=0.2765

Interval3-4: (0.220 +0.164)/2 *1=0.384/2=0.192

Interval4-5: (0.164 +0.124)/2 *1=0.288/2=0.144

Interval5-5.5: (0.124 +0.1097)/2 *0.5= (0.2337)/2 *0.5=0.11685 *0.5=0.058425

Now sum all these:

0.7785 +0.445=1.2235

+0.2765 →1.5

+0.192 →1.692

+0.144 →1.836

+0.058425 →1.894425.

So the integral is approximately 1.8944.

But wait, the trapezoidal rule approximates the integral as the sum of these areas. So the integral is about 1.8944.

So D_C = (c/H0) * integral ≈4.2857 Gpc * 1.8944 → Let me compute that.

4.2857 * 1.8944 ≈ 8.17 Gpc.

Hmm, that would be approximately 8 Gpc. Looking at the options, B is 8 Gpc, D is7, C is9.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the trapezoidal rule is not precise enough because the function is changing more rapidly at higher z. Another approach is to use Simpson's rule for better accuracy.

Simpson's rule for intervals with even spacing. Let's try applying Simpson's rule for the intervals where possible.

But the intervals are 1, except the last which is 0.5. So it's a bit messy. Alternatively, let's split into more points.

Alternatively, perhaps using a better approximation or a calculator.

Wait, I think I recall that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, the comoving distance for z=5.5 is approximately 9 Gpc. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation formula for comoving distance at high redshifts.

Wait, another approach: using the approximation for the integrand.

The integral is ∫₀^z [1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7)] dz'.

We can factor out 0.3(1+z)^3 from the square root:

sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 [1 + (0.7)/(0.3(1+z)^3)]) ) = sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2) sqrt(1 + (0.7)/(0.3(1+z)^3)) )

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, for high z, 0.3(1+z)^3 >>0.7, so the integrand becomes approximately 1/(sqrt(0.3)(1+z)^1.5 ), as I thought earlier.

But earlier calculation using this approximation gave integral=3.083, leading to D_C=4.2857 *3.083≈13.27 Gpc, which is higher than any option. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach using the trapezoidal rule was too crude. Let me try using more intervals for better accuracy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a better estimation. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 8 Gpc, which is option B.

Wait, another thought: if the redshift is about 5.5, and the parameters are H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, then the comoving distance is roughly 8 Gpc.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting results. So perhaps I should look for an online calculator or use a known formula.

Wait, I found that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, the comoving distance at z=5 is about 7.4 Gpc. At z=6, perhaps around 8.5 Gpc, and at z=5.5, maybe around 8 Gpc.

So given that, option B (8 Gpc) seems plausible.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: the comoving distance can be found using this formula, but perhaps the integral is 1.89 as I estimated, leading to D_C=4.2857 *1.8944≈8.17 Gpc. So approximately 8 Gpc.

So the correct answer would be option B)8 Gpc.

To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we analyze the given observational data and cosmological parameters. The peak in the spectrum at 790 nm suggests a redshifted emission line. Assuming this corresponds to the Lyman-alpha line (rest wavelength 121 nm), the redshift \( z \) is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.52.
\]

With the cosmological parameters \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), and a flat universe (\( \Omega_k = 0 \)), the comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz',
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light. The term \( \frac{c}{H_0} \) is approximately:

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}}{70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}} \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc}.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz' \) is challenging to compute analytically but can be approximated numerically. Breaking the integral into intervals and using methods like the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, the integral evaluates to approximately 1.894 for \( z = 5.5 \). Thus, the comoving distance is:

\[
D_C \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc} \times 1.894 \approx 8.17 \, \text{Gpc}.
\]

This value aligns closely with the option \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \). Considering the approximations and the given cosmological parameters, the most reasonable estimate for the comoving distance is:
