Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with molecules that can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chiral centers—those are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. Or sometimes it's due to other factors like axial chirality, like in biphenyl compounds.

Let's look at the options given. There are four moieties, and I need to determine which exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have axial chirality. So if the substituents on each phenyl ring are arranged in such a way that they can't be superimposed on each other by rotation, there could be enantiomers. Wait, but does this compound have such substituents?

Let me think. The structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the positions are 2 and 6 on each phenyl ring. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1'. So if the substituents are in positions 2 and 6, which are para to the connecting point, that might create a situation where the two sides are mirror images. Because the substituents are in positions that are symmetric? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to a chiral axis. For a biphenyl compound to have axial chirality, the substituents on each ring should be in positions that are not mirror images. So if the two substituents (like nitro groups and carboxylate esters) are on each ring, but arranged in such a way that the structure isn't symmetric, then it can have optical isomerism.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Let's imagine the biphenyl: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Since the rings are connected at 1 and 1', the 2 and 6 positions would be on the same ring. Wait, no, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6? Or each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6 on their own? Hmm, the name is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring has two substituents, but on the same carbon? No, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. Wait, in that case, each ring is symmetric. So the overall molecule—do the substituents on each ring create a chiral axis?

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of groups around the central bond could lead to axial chirality. For example, if the groups on each ring are arranged so that when you look along the axis of the biphenyl, you can't superimpose the two sides, leading to left and right-handed forms. But I'm a bit confused here. Wait, I remember that biphenyls with substituents in the 2 and 6 positions (like in dinitro compounds) can have optical isomerism. Because the substituents are arranged in such a way that the two sides are mirror images. So in this case, maybe this molecule can have enantiomers, so it shows optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Let's see, the hydroxy is on the second carbon. So the carbon chain is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2- C( OH) -CH3

Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, wait no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, actually, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. Let's see: the carbon with the OH is CH2(OH)CH2... Wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure: the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, then carbon 2 has the OH and two CH2 groups. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- OH
- CH3 (from the CH2 on the other side)
Wait, no, wait the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the carbon with the OH is CH2(OH). So that's two CH2 groups attached. Wait, wait, no. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon with the OH is the middle carbon. So the groups attached are:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (one leading to the COOCH3 and the other to the other CH2 group? Or wait, the central carbon is attached to:

- OH,
- a CH2COOCH3 group,
- and two CH2's? No, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the second carbon. Let's write the structure as:

CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: propanoate is three carbons. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is: O=C(O-) - CH(OH) - CH2-?

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine as:

The carboxylate group is on carbon 1: COOCH3 is attached to carbon 1. Carbon 2 is attached to OH, and two CH2 groups? Or wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: OH and two CH2 groups?
No, wait, maybe it's:

Carbon chain: COOCH3 is on carbon 3, but wait no. Let me number the propanoic acid: carboxylic acid is carbon 1. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The carbon in the middle (carbon 2) has:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups? No, wait, the groups on that carbon are:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (no, wait, that would imply four bonds. Oh wait, no. The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- OH,
- a CH2COOCH3 group (which is a substituent from one side),
- a CH3 group (from the other CH2 group? No, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about the structure:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the carbon with the OH is the first CH2. So the carbon chain is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be three carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's as follows: the ester is OMe attached to the carbonyl, and the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (one leading to the COOCH3 and another to a CH3? No, wait, no, because it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the central carbon is the one with the OH. Let's see the groups attached to that carbon. The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (one to the left, which is CH2OH, and one to the right, which is CH2COOCH3),
Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- A CH2(OH) group,
- A CH2 (which is connected to COOCH3),
- and two H's? No, each carbon has four bonds. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to write it out: 

The molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the middle CH2 has:

- two CH2 groups (no, wait, the middle CH2 is connected to two more CH2 groups? No. Let me think again. Wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3

So the middle carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH2(OH)), 
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- and two H's (since CH2 has two H's).

Wait, no, that can't be right because each CH2 has two H's. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),
- COOCH3,
- and two H's.

Wait, but that would give it four bonds: the two CH2 groups (left and right), and two H's. So the central carbon is CH2, so it's a methylene group. So each CH2 has two H's, so the central carbon is not a chiral center because it doesn't have four different groups. Because it's connected to two H's, which are the same, and two CH2 groups leading to different parts. Wait, but wait, those CH2 groups are on either side—so each CH2 is attached to different groups. Because on one side, it's attached to CH2(OH), and on the other, to COOCH3.

Wait, but for a chiral center, the carbon must have four distinct substituents. So the central carbon (carbon 2) has:

- a CH2(OH) group,
- a CH2COOCH3 group,
- and two H's.

Wait, but the two H's are the same, so the substituents are not all different. So this carbon doesn't have four different groups. Hence, no chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, that would be if it's CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Oh wait, no, wait. Propanoate is three carbons. So the structure would be:

COOCH3 is on carbon 3, then carbon 2 has the OH, and carbon 1 is a CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So carbon 2 is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon? No, wait, each carbon in a chain is connected to two others, except the ends. Wait, no, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- OH,
- and another H.

Wait, but if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) has:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and a H.

So four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. That makes it a chiral center. Oh, wait, that's right! So that carbon is a chiral center because it's connected to four different groups. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center, hence exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 would show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the ester is from propanoic acid with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Yes, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) has four different groups: methyl, carbonyl (as part of the ester), hydroxyl, and hydrogen. So yes, a chiral center. So this molecule can have enantiomers. So it does exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 is correct.

Option 3: benzophenone. Its structure is (Ph)2CO. So two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups and another group (maybe a CH3? No, no, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, so it's a ketone where the carbonyl is connected to two phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

Wait, that's benzophenone. So the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. It's double-bonded to O, and connected to two phenyl groups. So that carbon has two phenyl groups, an O double bond, and a single bond to another group? No, wait, no, the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. So it's structure is:

O
||
C - connected to two phenyl groups.

Wait, wait no. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. It has a double bond to O, and two single bonds to phenyl groups. So the groups attached to the carbonyl carbon are two phenyl groups and an O double bond. But wait, a carbonyl carbon (C=O) is sp² hybridized, so it's trigonal planar. It doesn't have four substituents, only three. Hence, it's not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So the structure of fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2CH2-C-O-O-C-O
Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. It has a double bond between the two middle carbons, with the substituents on either side.

So the diesters, dimethyl fumarate, would be:

CH2(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, no, no. Wait, fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid (HO2CCH=CHCO2H). So dimethyl fumarate would be:

(CH3OOC)CH=CH(COOCH3).

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. No, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is:

(CH3OOC)-CH2-CH2-(COOCH3) ?

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? No, wait. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. No, wait. HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH would be succinic acid. Fumaric acid has a double bond. So it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, wait, no. It's a diester. So each -COOH becomes a -COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's not exactly right. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the ester would have each COOH replaced by COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So the molecule has two ester groups on either end of a double bond. The central part is CH=CH. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3)? No, no, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, the double bond is between the two middle carbons. So it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3. No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, no, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So the molecule has a trans double bond. Wait, no—fumarate is the ester, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH2-CH2, but no, wait, no. Let me think differently. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is connected via a double bond to another CH2 group, which is attached to another O-C-OCH3.

Wait, no. It's more accurate to say that the molecule is:

(CH3OOC)C=CH-C(OCOCH3)O.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on either end. So the molecule has a double bond, and substituents on either side. Does this create any stereoisomerism?

Wait, in this case, fumarate is the (E) isomer. Because fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So when esterified, dimethyl fumarate has the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule has a double bond and the substituents on either end are the same (two COOCH3 groups). Wait, but wait, for geometric isomerism, you need two different substituents on each end. But in this case, both ends have COOCH3 groups. So perhaps geometric isomerism isn't possible. Or wait, no, because each end has the same substituents. So the molecule can't have E/Z isomerism because both substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical.

Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3   COOCH3
    \   /
      C=C
    /   \
COOCH3   COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. The structure is:

On each end of the double bond, each carbon is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=CH2-C(=O)OCH3
   /
O

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3? No, that's succinate. Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the possibility of optical isomerism. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some other form of chirality, like axial chirality or geometric isomerism that leads to optical activity.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

(CH3OOC)CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, but the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same (each is an ester group and a CH2 group). Wait, no, the substituents are on each double bond carbon, perhaps. Let me get this straight. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two ester groups and two other groups. Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. No, perhaps each is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, regardless, let's think about the possibility of optical activity. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So if dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, it won't exhibit optical isomerism. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the double bond, like in the case of fumarate (the trans isomer), then the molecule might be achiral. 

Wait, actually, wait. Fumarate is itself a diastereomer of maleate. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. So their esters would retain that stereochemistry. So dimethyl fumarate is the trans diastereomer. But does it have a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the structure: each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So if the molecule is symmetric, then it might not be chiral.

Wait, if the double bond is between two identical groups, then the molecule could be symmetrical. For example, if the groups on either end are the same, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each end has a COOCH3 and another group. Let's think: each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. No, wait, perhaps each double bond carbon is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH3 group? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. For example, if the two substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So dimethyl fumarate would be achiral, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, wait—no, because the double bond is in the center, and the substituents on either end are identical. So the molecule would be symmetrical, so it won't be chiral. Hence, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Another possibility is that the molecule has a center of inversion, making it achiral. So in that case, it wouldn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again: the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH3OOC)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, no. The correct structure is that each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, which is succinate, not fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach this differently. Which of these four compounds have chiral centers or some form of chirality leading to optical isomerism?

- Option 1: The biphenyl compound. If the substituents are arranged such that the biphenyl has axial chirality (like in dinitro compounds), then it would exhibit optical isomerism. So if the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions, leading to non-superimposable mirror images, then yes.

- Option 2: 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so yes.

- Option 3: Benzophenone has no chiral centers, so no.

- Option 4: Dimethyl fumarate. Hmm. The structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the correct structure is:

COOCH3
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O=C-OCH3
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be right. I think I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH3OOC)CH=CH(COOCH3).

So each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group.

In this case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So it's symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Let me imagine the molecule: each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the molecule's structure is symmetric, making it achiral. So option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think about the possibility of E/Z isomerism. For that, you need two different substituents on each carbon of the double bond. In this case, each carbon of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. No, wait, perhaps each is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2. Wait, perhaps no, so the substituents on each carbon are same on both ends, making E/Z isomerism impossible. So for a double bond to exhibit E/Z isomerism, each carbon must be connected to two different groups. For example, if the substituents are R1, R2 on each carbon, and R1 ≠ R2.

In dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Are these two different? Yes. So each carbon has two different substituents. So, in theory, it can have E and Z isomerism. But wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same. So the molecule may be symmetrical, leading to only one possible isomer. So perhaps, the molecule is not chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think: if the substituents on either end of the double bond are identical, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So for example, if each end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, then the molecule would be symmetrical, and thus not chiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So to recap:

1. The biphenyl compound—probably exhibits optical isomerism because of axial chirality.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate—has a chiral center, so yes.

3. Benzophenone—no chiral centers, so no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate—no, because it's symmetrical.

So the options that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

Looking back at the options given:

Options:

A) 1,2,4 → No, because 4 doesn't.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No, because 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → Yes.

Wait, but the options say:

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Earlier, I thought this might have axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism. So that's correct.

So the correct answer would be option A) 1,2,4? No, because 4 doesn't. So the correct options are 1 and 2, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which can arise from chiral centers or axial chirality.

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound is a biphenyl derivative with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each phenyl ring. Biphenyl compounds can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. In this case, the nitro and carboxylate groups on each ring create non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical isomerism.  
**Conclusion:** Exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl (OH), a methyl (CH₃), an ester group (COOCH₃), and a hydrogen (H). This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exist as enantiomers.  
**Conclusion:** Exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and has two identical phenyl groups as substituents. Since there are no chiral centers or other sources of chirality, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
**Conclusion:** Does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (CH₃OOC)CH=CH(COOCH₃). The molecule has a double bond with identical substituents (COOCH₃ groups) on both ends. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, as it has a plane of symmetry along the double bond. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
**Conclusion:** Does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer  
The compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **Option 1** (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and **Option 2** (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate).  

**Answer: D**
