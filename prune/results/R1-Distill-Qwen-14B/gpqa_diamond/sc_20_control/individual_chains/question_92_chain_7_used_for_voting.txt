Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Enthalpy of formation usually involves looking at the bonds broken and formed. Oh right, the standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change when the molecule is formed from its elements in their standard states.

But wait, since the problem provides bond energies, I should use the bond energy method. The formula I remember is that the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds minus the sum of the product bonds. But wait, actually no, I think it's the other way around. Because when bonds are broken, you're putting energy in (endothermic), and when bonds are formed, you release energy (exothermic). So the overall enthalpy change would be (sum of bond energies broken) minus (sum of bond energies formed).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements. So, for the reaction:

Elements (in their standard states) → Compound.

So for each molecule, I have to consider all the bonds that are broken in the reactants and formed in the products.

Wait, but sometimes people use the bond energies approach where you calculate the total energy of the bonds in the reactants and subtract the total in the products, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energy required to break all bonds in the elements and then the energy released when the bonds in the compound are formed.

Oh wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies (atomization) of all the constituent atoms minus the sum of the bond energies in the molecule.

Wait, no. Let me think. The general formula is:

ΔHf = [ (sum of atomization energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule) ] / (moles of compound)

But wait, no, the atomization energy is the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule into individual atoms. So for the compound, the process is:

Elements (in standard states) → Atoms → Compound.

The enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the atomization energies of the elements minus the sum of the bond energies in the compound, divided by the number of moles of the compound.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me look for a clear formula. I think the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (Σ bond energies of reactants) - (Σ bond energies of products) ]

But wait, in the context of formation, the reactants are the elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon, the reactants would be H2 and O2 (if it's a hydrocarbon). Wait, but in this question, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, that's a key point.

Wait, the question says the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. So, for each carbon atom, you need to put in 1000 kJ to break it into individual atoms. For hydrogen, since it's diatomic, the bond energy is 100 kJ/mol. So each H atom would require 100/2 = 50 kJ? Or wait, the bond energy for H-H is 100 kJ/mol, so to get H atoms, you need to break H-H bonds, which is 100 kJ per mole of H-H. So for each H atom, it's 50 kJ? Wait, no, because bond energy is per mole of bonds. So for one mole of H2, breaking it into 2 moles of H atoms requires 100 kJ.

But the compound in question is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of C and H atoms.

Wait, the formula is a bit complicated. Let me write it out. It's (CH3)2C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. No, wait, I think I misread the formula. Let me parse it correctly.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So that's a molecule with two double bonds, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's best to count the number of each type of bond.

Wait, but perhaps I should first figure out how many C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds are in the molecule.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the molecule in terms of the number of each type of bond. Let me count the bonds:

Each (CH3)2C= group: that's a central C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond. So each (CH3)2C=CH- would have certain bonds. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to structure the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So the structure is something like:

( (CH3)2C=CH ) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the entire molecule and count bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that the molecule consists of two isopropenyl groups and some single bonds in between.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just count the number of each type of bond.

Each molecule has:

- C-C single bonds: how many?

Each CH2 group has a C-C single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Let me try to count each type:

Number of C-C single bonds: Let's see. The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: this is an isopropenyl group. It has a central C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to another CH group.

So, the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-.

Then after that, a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to another CH2, which connects to a CH group with a double bond to C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is structured as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the backbone has six carbons, maybe? Let's count:

1: (CH3)2C= (position 1)
2: CH- (position 2)
3: CH2- (position 3)
4: CH(CH3)- (position4)
5: CH2- (position5)
6: CH= (position6)
7: C(CH3)2 (position7?)

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the molecule as:

Positions 1 to 7: 1 is (CH3)2C=, 2 is CH-, 3 is CH2-, 4 is CH(CH3)-, 5 is CH2-, 6 is CH-, and 7 is C(CH3)2.

But perhaps a more accurate approach is to count each type of bond:

- C=C bonds: Let's see, the molecule has two double bonds. The first part is (CH3)2C=CH- and the last part is CH=C(CH3)2. So two C=C double bonds.

So two C=C bonds.

Now, the single bonds: C-C, C-H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: each CH3 has three C-H bonds. So two CH3 groups: 2 *3 =6 C-H bonds.

Then the =CH- has a single bond to the next CH2 group, which is a single C-C bond.

Similarly, each CH2 group has two C-H bonds. Let me try to count all the C-H bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the total number of C-H bonds in the entire molecule.

Each CH3 group has three C-H bonds. The molecule has multiple CH3 groups.

Let's count the number of CH3 groups.

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C= : two CH3 groups here.

Then, in the chain, we have:

After the double bond, a CH- (that's one CH), then CH2 (one CH2), then CH(CH3) (one CH(CH3)), then CH2 (another CH2), then CH= (another CH), and finally C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the CH(CH3) has one CH3 group. The C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups.

So total CH3 groups:

- (CH3)2C: two CH3.

- CH(CH3): one CH3.

- C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups.

So total CH3 groups: 2 +1 +2 =5? Wait, no. Wait, each CH3 is a group attached to a C. So each CH3 is a methyl group.

Wait, (CH3)2C= : two CH3 groups attached to the central C.

Then, CH(CH3): another CH3 attached to another C.

C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups attached.

So total (2 +1 +2)=5 CH3 groups. Each CH3 has three C-H bonds. So 5 *3 =15 C-H bonds.

Wait, but wait. The (CH3)2C= group: each CH3 has three C-H. So two CH3 groups contribute 2*3=6 C-H.

The CH(CH3) has one CH3 group, contributing 3 C-H.

C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups, contributing 2*3=6 C-H.

So total C-H bonds: 6 +3 +6 =15.

Wait, but let me check. The molecule has:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: this has two CH3 groups (6 C-H), then the CH- has one C-H.

Then CH2 has two C-H, then CH(CH3) has one C-H plus three from the CH3, then CH2 has two C-H, then CH= has one C-H, and the C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups (6 C-H). Hmm, perhaps my initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH3 contributes three C-H bonds. So the total number of C-H bonds is:

Each CH3 group: 3 × number of CH3 groups.

Number of CH3 groups: 2 (from (CH3)2C) +1 (from CH(CH3)) +2 (from C(CH3)2) =5. So 5 ×3=15 C-H bonds.

Now, the C=C bonds: two in total.

C-C single bonds: let's count.

Each CH2 has a C-C single bond. Let me think about the structure again.

The backbone is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the backbone has six carbons (positions 1 to 6), but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each C-C single bond.

Wait, each -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH- would contribute several C-C single bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps each single bond in the chain contributes to C-C bonds.

But maybe I can count the number of C-C single bonds.

Each CH2 group has one C-C bond. Let me see:

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C=C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the correct formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the backbone is connected as:

C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7.

Wait, perhaps not, but perhaps each '-' indicates a single bond.

So, the structure is:

C1 (with two CH3 groups) double bonded to C2 (CH group), which is connected to C3 (CH2), which is connected to C4 (CH(CH3)), which is connected to C5 (CH2), which is connected to C6 (CH-), which is double bonded to C7 (C(CH3)2).

So the single bonds are:

C2-C3 (single),

C3-C4 (single),

C4-C5 (single),

C5-C6 (single),

C6-C7 (double).

Wait, so how many C-C single bonds are there?

C2-C3: 1,

C3-C4: 1,

C4-C5:1,

C5-C6:1.

That's four single C-C bonds.

Additionally, each CH2 group is connected to another C via single bonds. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, each CH2 is a CH2 group, which is itself a C connected to two Hs and two other C's (the previous and next C in the chain).

Wait, perhaps each CH2 has two C-C bonds, but that's not right. Wait, no, each CH2 is part of a C-C single bond. For example, the CH2 between C3 and C4 is connected via a C-C single bond. So each CH2 group contributes one C-C single bond.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C single bonds is the number of single bonds along the chain.

Looking at the structure, the chain is:

C1=C2 - C3 - C4 - C5 - C6=C7.

So between C2 and C3: single bond (1),

C3 and C4: single bond (2),

C4 and C5: single bond (3),

C5 and C6: single bond (4).

So four C-C single bonds.

Additionally, each CH3 group is attached via C-C single bonds. For example, the (CH3)2C= part has two C-C single bonds (each CH3 attached to C1). Similarly, the CH(CH3) has one C-C single bond (CH3 attached to C4), and the C(CH3)2 has two C-C single bonds (each CH3 attached to C7).

So how many C-C bonds from the CH3 and other substituents?

Each CH3 group contributes a C-C bond.

- For (CH3)2C= : two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to C1).

- For CH(CH3): one C-C bond (CH3 attached to C4).

- For C(CH3)2: two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to C7).

So that's 2 +1 +2 =5 C-C bonds from substituents.

So total C-C single bonds:

4 (from the chain) +5 (from substituents) =9 C-C bonds.

Wait, but each C-C bond is a single bond, so each contributes 200 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the bond energy given is:

C-C: 200 kJ/mol,

C=C:300 kJ/mol,

C-H:400 kJ/mol,

H-H:100 kJ/mol (but not relevant here).

So, the total bond energies in the molecule would be:

Number of C-C bonds × 200 + number of C=C bonds × 300 + number of C-H bonds ×400.

So let's plug the numbers.

Number of C-C bonds: 9.

Number of C=C: 2.

Number of C-H: 15.

So:

C-C: 9 ×200 = 1800 kJ,

C=C: 2 ×300 =600 kJ,

C-H:15 ×400=6000 kJ.

Total bond energies in the molecule: 1800 +600 +6000 =8400 kJ.

But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of formation. So the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of elements in standard state) - (sum of bond energies in the compound).

Wait, but the elements are in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite and hydrogen is H2. So I need to calculate the energy required to break down the compound into its constituent atoms, which is the sum of the bond energies in the compound. Then, the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the energies needed to form the atoms (atomization) minus the bond energies in the compound.

Wait, but wait. The standard enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So using bond energies, the approach is to calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (H2 and O2, but in this case, since the molecule is hydrocarbon, the elements are C and H2) into their atoms, then the energy released when the bonds in the molecule are formed.

Wait, but the question gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, that's the energy required to break C into individual atoms. For hydrogen, since H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, breaking one mole of H2 into H atoms requires 100 kJ.

So for each mole of the compound, I need to calculate:

Total atomization energy = (moles of C × 1000) + (moles of H × (100/2)).

Wait, because each H2 molecule has two H atoms, so per mole of H2, you get 2 moles of H. But the bond energy is per mole of H-H. So to get H atoms, you have to break H-H bonds.

So for the molecule, the number of C atoms and H atoms is needed.

The formula of the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: Each CH3 has 3 H. Two CH3 groups: 6 H.

The =CH- has one H.

Then CH2 has 2 H.

CH(CH3): the CH has one H, and the CH3 has 3 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH= has one H.

C(CH3)2: each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3 groups: 6 H.

So total H atoms:

= (6 +1) + (2) + (1 +3) + (2) + (1) + (6) = Let me calculate step by step.

First group (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 H (from two CH3) +1 H (from CH) =7 H.

Then CH2:2 H.

Then CH(CH3):1 H (from CH) +3 H (from CH3) =4 H.

Then CH2:2 H.

Then CH=:1 H.

Then C(CH3)2:6 H (from two CH3).

Adding up:7 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 = 22 H atoms.

So each molecule has 22 H atoms. So per mole of the compound, 22 moles of H atoms.

So the total atomization energy for H is 22 × (100 kJ/mol / 2) = 22 ×50 = 1100 kJ? Because each H atom comes from breaking H2, which requires 100 kJ per mole of H2. Since each H2 gives two H atoms, so per H atom, it's 50 kJ.

Wait no, wait. The bond energy given is H-H = 100 kJ/mol. So for each mole of H2 that is broken, you get 2 moles of H atoms. So the energy per mole of H2 is 100 kJ. Therefore, for 22 moles of H atoms, since each H atom comes from 0.5 mole of H2, the total H2 broken is 22/2 =11 moles. So the energy for H is 11 ×100 =1100 kJ.

Similarly, for C atoms: The molecule has how many C atoms? Let's count.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: 3 C (the central C, and two from CH3, plus the CH which is another C. Wait, no, each (CH3)2C=CH- has 3 C atoms: the central C, and two CH3 groups attached to it. Or wait, each CH3 is a group, so the central C is connected to two CH3 (each CH3 is a C), plus the CH from the double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the C atoms.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group is a C atom. Let me count each C:

- The central C in (CH3)2C= : 1 C.

Then, each CH3 has a C: 2 ×1 =2 Cs.

Then, the =CH- part is another C: 1.

Then, the CH2 groups: each has a C. Let's see, in the chain, CH2 comes after CH=, so each CH2 is a C. So how many CH2 groups are there?

The structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-... Wait, perhaps the chain is:

C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C=C.

So the chain has four CH2 groups, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count each C.

Alternatively, perhaps think of each group:

1. (CH3)2C= : 3 C atoms (central C and two CH3 Cs).

Wait, no. The (CH3)2C= is a propene-like structure. So the central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to another C.

So that's 3 C's: the central C, and the two CH3 Cs. Wait, no, each CH3 is a group. So (CH3)2C= would be a C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to another C.

So, the central C is one, each CH3 is another C. So (CH3)2C= would have 3 C's: central C, plus two from the CH3 groups.

Then, the =CH- group: that's another C. So that's 4.

Then the CH2: another C (5).

Then CH(CH3): another C (6).

Another CH2: another C (7).

Then CH=: another C (8).

And the C(CH3)2: another C (9).

So total 9 C atoms per molecule.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2C= is three C atoms: the central C, and two from the CH3 groups.

Then the =CH- is one more C (so 4).

Then each -CH2- is another C (so 5).

Then CH(CH3) is another C (6).

Another -CH2- (7).

Then CH= (8).

And the C(CH3)2 is another C (9).

So 9 C atoms in total.

So per mole of the compound, 9 moles of C atoms.

Each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol of atomization energy. So total for C: 9 ×1000 =9000 kJ.

Total atomization energy for the compound: 9000 (C) + 1100 (H) =10100 kJ per mole.

Now, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is 8400 kJ (as calculated earlier).

So the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf = (sum of atomization energies) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule)

ΔHf = 10100 - 8400 =1700 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A) 11200, B) 67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, 1700 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Let me double-check the bond count.

C-C bonds:

Earlier I thought there are 9 C-C bonds, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me recount.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each C-C bond is a single bond between two C atoms.

So let's list each single bond:

1. Between the central C of (CH3)2C and each CH3: 2 C-C bonds.

2. The =CH- group: the C in =CH is connected to the next CH2. So that's one C-C bond.

3. The CH2 is connected to CH(CH3): another C-C bond.

4. The CH(CH3) is connected to the next CH2: another C-C bond.

5. The CH2 is connected to the next CH=: another C-C bond.

6. Now, the substituents:

Each CH3 group in (CH3)2C contributes a C-C bond: 2.

The CH(CH3) contributes one C-C bond (the CH3 attached).

The C(CH3)2 contributes two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached).

So that's 2+1+2=5.

So the C-C bonds are:

From the chain: 5 (positions 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7?), no wait, wait.

Wait, the backbone:

C1 (from (CH3)2C) double bonded to C2 (from =CH-).

C2 is connected to C3 (CH2).

C3 connected to C4 (CH(CH3)).

C4 connected to C5 (CH2).

C5 connected to C6 (CH-).

C6 double bonded to C7 (C(CH3)2).

So single bonds are:

C2-C3: 1,

C3-C4: 2,

C4-C5:3,

C5-C6:4,

That's four single bonds along the chain.

Then substituent bonds:

C1 connected to two CH3 groups: 2 bonds,

C4 connected to one CH3:1,

C7 connected to two CH3:2.

Total substituent bonds:5.

So total C-C bonds:4 (chain) +5 (substituents) =9, as before.

C=C bonds: two.

C-H bonds: 15.

So bond energies: 9*200=1800, 2*300=600,15*400=6000.

Sum=1800+600+6000=8400.

So the sum is 8400.

Atomization energy: 9*1000 (C) + 22*(100/2) (H) =9000 +22*50=9000+1100=10100.

ΔHf =10100-8400=1700 kJ/mol.

But none of the options are 1700. The options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the H count.

Wait, the molecule has 22 H atoms. So when considering the H2 bonds, each H atom comes from 0.5 mole of H2.

So for 22 H atoms, you need 11 moles of H2, which requires 11 ×100 kJ =1100 kJ.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C atoms. If the molecule has 8 C atoms instead of 9, let me recount.

Wait, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3) group is a C.

Breaking it down:

1. (CH3)2C= : 3 C atoms (central, and two from CH3).

2. =CH- :1 C.

3. CH2:1 C.

4. CH(CH3):1 C.

5. CH2:1 C.

6. CH=:1 C.

7. C(CH3)2:1 C.

So 7 C atoms. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.

Wait, the (CH3)2C= is three C atoms: the central, and two CH3.

=CH- :1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=:1 C.

C(CH3)2:1 C.

So total 7 C atoms? But that doesn't seem right. Because each CH3 is a group attached to a C, but the CH3 itself is a C connected to H's.

Wait, perhaps the correct count is:

Each CH3 is a group. So the (CH3)2C= has one central C and two CH3 C's.

=CH- is another C.

Each CH2 is another C.

CH(CH3) is another C.

CH2 is another C.

CH= is another C.

C(CH3)2 is another C.

So that's 2 (from (CH3)2) +1 (from C=) +1 (CH) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH=) +1 (C(CH3)2) = 9 C atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. If the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, then the formula can be written as C9H14.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me check the formula for C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group is C4H6.

Then, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2: let's see.

CH2 is C1H2,

CH(CH3) is C2H5,

CH2 is C3H2,

CH= is C4H,

C(CH3)2 is C5H6.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each group.

But perhaps a quicker way is to note that the formula is C9H14.

Because (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 contributes one C and three H.

But perhaps a better way is to figure out the molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula to count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: (CH3)2C=CH- is C4H6.

Then the rest is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

CH2 is CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 C, 4 H.

CH2:1 C, 2 H.

CH=:1 C, 1 H.

C(CH3)2:1 C, 6 H.

Wait, but then adding:

C4H6 + (CH2 + CH(CH3) + CH2 + CH + C(CH3)2).

CH2: 1 C,2 H.

CH(CH3):1 C,1 H +3 H=4 H.

CH2:1 C,2 H.

CH=:1 C,1 H.

C(CH3)2:1 C,6 H.

So:

C:4 (from first part) +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =9 C.

H:6 (first part) +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 =21 H.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 22 H. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

So the molecular formula is C9H20? Or C9H14?

Wait, let me recount all H atoms.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

(CH3)2C=: each CH3 has 3 H. Two CH3 → 6 H.

=CH-:1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H (from CH) +3 H (from CH3) =4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=:1 H.

C(CH3)2: each CH3 has 3 H. Two CH3 →6 H.

So adding:

6 (from (CH3)2C) +1 (from =CH) +2 (from CH2) +4 (from CH(CH3)) +2 (from CH2) +1 (from CH=) +6 (from C(CH3)2).

Total H:6+1=7; 7+2=9; 9+4=13;13+2=15;15+1=16;16+6=22.

So H=22.

C: Let's recount.

Each CH3 is a C.

The (CH3)2C=: 3 C (central, two CH3).

=CH-:1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=:1 C.

C(CH3)2:1 C.

So 3+1+1+1+1+1+1=9 C.

So molecular formula is C9H22?

Wait, no, 22 H.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount each group.

(CH3)2C=: central C has two CH3. So 3 C atoms.

=CH-:1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=:1 C.

C(CH3)2:1 C.

So that's 3+1+1+1+1+1+1 =9 C.

Now each CH3 contributes 3 H.

So:

(CH3)2C=:2×3=6 H.

=CH-:1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H (CH) +3 H (CH3) =4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=:1 H.

C(CH3)2:2 ×3 =6 H.

So total H=6 +1 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 =22 H.

So molecular formula is C9H22.

Wait, but wait, that's 9 C and 22 H.

So the molecule is C9H22.

So per mole of the compound, 9 C and 22 H.

Thus, the atomization energy is:

C:9 ×1000 =9000 kJ.

H:22 × (100/2) =22 ×50 =1100 kJ.

Total atomization energy:9000+1100=10100 kJ.

Sum of bond energies in the molecule: 8400 kJ.

So ΔHf =10100 -8400 =1700 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 1700. The closest is option D) 1900.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, let me recheck the bond count.

Wait, the molecule has 9 C atoms. So how many C-C bonds? Let me think of the structure again.

Each C connected to others via single bonds.

In the molecule, the backbone is:

C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7.

Wait, perhaps it's:

C1: (CH3)2C=.

C2: connected to C1 via double bond, and connected to C3 via single bond.

C3: connected to C2, and connected to C4 via single bond.

C4: connected to C3 and to C5 via single bond, and also to CH3 (so another C-C bond).

C5: connected to C4 and C6 via single bond.

C6: connected to C5 and C7 via double bond.

C7: connected to C6, and has two CH3 groups (so two C-C bonds).

So the single bonds in the backbone are C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6: four.

And substituent C-C bonds: C1 has two (for the two CH3), C4 has one (for CH3), C7 has two (for the two CH3). So 2+1+2=5.

Total single C-C bonds:4 +5 =9.

C=C bonds: two.

C-H bonds:15 (as before).

So bond energies:9×200=1800, 2×300=600,15×400=6000. So 1800+600=2400, +6000=8400.

So sum is 8400.

So ΔHf=10100−8400=1700.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1700. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization given is per mole of C, but in the molecule, perhaps it's per mole of C atoms. So if the molecule has 9 C atoms, it's 9 moles of C.

Wait, that's correct. So 9×1000=9000.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the number of moles of the compound. Oh, wait, the question is about the enthalpy of formation per mole of the compound. So if the calculation gives 1700 kJ per mole, but the options don't have it, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1900 kJ/g. Wait, but the units are per gram? Hmm, the question says 'given' values are per mole.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of formation of the compound, so the answer should be in kJ per mole. The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B)67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

Wait, options C and D are per gram. But the given data is per mole. So it's more likely that the correct answer is in kJ/mol. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the bond counts.

Another approach: perhaps the molecule is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene or something else, but no, the formula given is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 2,2,4,4,6,6,8-octamethyl something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as having more C-C bonds.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each CH2 is a single bond between C's.

But perhaps I should count all the C-C single bonds.

Wait, in the molecule, each CH2 is a single bond.

So the backbone is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the backbone has:

- (CH3)2C=CH: part.

- CH2.

- CH(CH3).

- CH2.

- CH=C(CH3)2.

So the single bonds are:

Between the =CH and CH2: 1.

Between CH2 and CH(CH3): 2.

Between CH(CH3) and CH2:3.

Between CH2 and CH=:4.

So four single bonds.

Substituent bonds:

In (CH3)2C=: two bonds.

In CH(CH3): one bond.

In C(CH3)2: two bonds.

So total substituent bonds:5.

So total C-C bonds:4+5=9.

Hmm, same as before.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole.

Wait, the options C and D are per gram. So perhaps I should calculate per gram.

The molecular weight of the compound is (9×12) + (22×1) =108 +22=130 g/mol.

So 1700 kJ per mole is 1700 /130 ≈13.08 kJ/g.

But that's not an option. The options are C)11.44 kJ/g, D)1900 kJ/g.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of H atoms. Let me recount.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

- (CH3)2C=: 2×3=6 H.

- =CH-:1 H.

- CH2:2 H.

- CH(CH3):1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3)=4 H.

- CH2:2 H.

- CH=:1 H.

- C(CH3)2:2×3=6 H.

Adding:6 +1=7; +2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +6=22.

So 22 H, correct.

Molecular weight is 9×12 +22×1= 108+22=130 g/mol.

So 1700 kJ per mole is 1700/130 ≈13.08 kJ/g.

Hmm, but that's not an option. The closest is option C:11.44 kJ/g.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which is 9 C and 18 H. Did I make a mistake in counting H?

Wait, let me recount H.

Each (CH3)2C=: two CH3 groups →6 H.

=CH-:1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H (from CH) +3 H (from CH3)=4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=:1 H.

C(CH3)2: two CH3 →6 H.

So total H:6+1=7; +2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +6=22.

No, 22 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the molecular weight is 12×9 +1×22=130, correct.

Hmm, maybe the question intended to ask for enthalpy of formation per gram, but I'm getting 13.08, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Another approach: maybe the problem is using the formula where the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the products (the molecule) minus the bond energies of the reactants (the elements).

Wait, perhaps I should have done ΔHf = sum of bond energies in elements - sum of bond energies in compound.

Wait, no, no. The bond energy approach for enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies in elements (H2 and C)] - [sum of bond energies in the molecule].

Wait, because the elements are H2 and C (in some form, like graphite). So the bond energies for H2 is 100 kJ/mol, and for C it's 1000 kJ/mol per mole of C.

Wait, but for C, the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol, which is the energy to break C into atoms. So for each mole of C, you have to add 1000 kJ.

But perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [ (C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (H atoms × enthalpy of H atomization) ] - (sum of bond energies in the molecule).

Wait, but H comes from H2, so each H atom requires 50 kJ (since H2 is 100 kJ/mol).

So, for the molecule, ΔHf = [9 ×1000 +22 ×50 ] - 8400 = [9000 +1100 ] -8400=10100-8400=1700 kJ/mol.

So, same result as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question expects an answer per gram. So 1700 kJ/mol ÷130 g/mol =13.08 kJ/g. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energies. Let me check the given bond energies.

Given:

C-C:200,

C=C:300,

C-H:400,

H-H:100.

So, everything seems correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the double bonds are counted as two C-C bonds, but no, C=C is a double bond, so it's treated as a single bond with higher energy.

Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, the only one in the same ballpark is option B:67.4 kJ/mol, but that's much lower than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is much bigger, but I think I counted correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of formation of the molecule from its elements, but perhaps I should have considered the number of moles of C and H in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different approach, where the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the products.

Wait, no, I think I got it right.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula where the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies in the reactants minus the bond energies in the products. So:

ΔHf = [sum of bonds in reactants] - [sum of bonds in products].

But the reactants are C and H2.

Wait, but in that case:

The reactants are 9 C atoms and 22 H atoms.

The bonds in the reactants would be:

Each C atom is in its elemental form, which is graphite. But the given data is the enthalpy of atomization, which is the energy to break C into atoms. So perhaps the correct formula is as I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf = sum (bonds broken in reactants) - sum (bonds formed in products).

In this case, the reactants are C (atomized) and H (atomized). The bonds broken would be the atomization energy: 9×1000 (C) +22×50 (H) =10100.

The bonds formed are the bonds in the molecule:8400.

So ΔHf =10100−8400=1700 kJ/mol.

So I think I'm correct, but the options don't have this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that there are more C-C bonds than I thought. Let me try to count again.

Wait, perhaps I missed some C-C bonds in the substituents.

Wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH: two CH3 groups attached to one C. So two C-C bonds.

- =CH-: connected to next CH2. So one C-C bond.

- CH2: connected to next CH(CH3). One C-C bond.

- CH(CH3): connected to next CH2. One C-C bond.

- CH2: connected to next CH=.

One C-C bond.

- CH=: connected to C(CH3)2. One C-C bond.

Substituent C-C bonds:

Each CH3 in (CH3)2C= contributes one C-C bond: two.

CH3 in CH(CH3): one.

Each CH3 in C(CH3)2: two.

Total substituent C-C bonds:2+1+2=5.

So total C-C bonds: 2 (from (CH3)2C=) +1 (from =CH- to CH2) +1 (from CH2 to CH(CH3)) +1 (from CH(CH3) to CH2) +1 (from CH2 to CH=) +1 (from CH= to C(CH3)2) + substituent bonds 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another approach: each CH2 is a single C-C bond.

Let me list all the single bonds:

1. Between (CH3)2C= and =CH-: no, that's a double bond.

2. Between =CH- and CH2: single bond:1.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3): single bond:2.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2: single bond:3.

5. Between CH2 and CH=: single bond:4.

6. Between CH= and C(CH3)2: double bond, so no single bond here.

So four single bonds in the chain.

Substituent bonds:

Each (CH3)2C= has two C-C bonds: 2.

CH(CH3) has one C-C bond:1.

C(CH3)2 has two C-C bonds:2.

Total substituent bonds:5.

So total C-C bonds:4 (chain) +5 (substituents) =9.

So same as before.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Since my calculation gives 1700 kJ/mol, which isn't an option, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is not provided, but looking at the options, perhaps option B is the intended one, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is considered as a different structure, leading to a different bond count.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which has two double bonds and multiple single bonds. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each double bond contributes one bond, not two. But that's already accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-H bonds is less than I thought. Let me recount.

Each (CH3)2C= has 6 H.

=CH- has 1 H.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH(CH3) has 4 H.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH= has 1 H.

C(CH3)2 has 6 H.

Total:6+1+2+4+2+1+6=22 H.

So 22 H.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question's given data is per mole of the element, so perhaps the bond energies are per mole of bonds, not per mole of molecule.

Wait, but the way I did it, I multiplied by the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using the molar approach.

Wait, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is 8400 kJ per mole of the molecule.

The sum of atomization energies is 10100 kJ per mole of molecule.

So ΔHf =10100−8400=1700 kJ/mol.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, where the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule minus the sum of the bonds in the elements.

But that would be:

ΔHf = (sum of molecule bonds) - (sum of elements bonds).

But the elements are C (atomized) and H (atomized).

Sum of molecule bonds:8400.

Sum of elements bonds: atomization energies are the energies to break into atoms, so it's the same as the sum of bonds in elements, which is 10100.

So ΔHf =8400−10100=−1700 kJ/mol. But that would imply the formation is exothermic, but I'm not sure.

But that's not matching any options either.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, but that's not what's asked.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's formula is C8H14, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I missed a C in the count. Let me recount the C's.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

(CH3)2C=:3 C.

=CH-:1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=:1 C.

C(CH3)2:1 C.

Total: 3+1+1+1+1+1+1=9 C.

Yes.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the bond energies in the molecule and the bond energies in the reactants (elements) but in a different way.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated as:

ΔHf = (Σ bond energies of reactants) − (Σ bond energies of products).

But the reactants are the elements: C (graphite) and H2.

So, for each mole of the compound, the number of moles of C and H.

But perhaps I should think of it as:

ΔHf = [ (moles of C × enthalpy of atomization) + (moles of H × bond energy of H2/2) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ].

Which is what I did.

So, I think my calculation is correct, but since the options don't match, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ/g, which would be 1700/130≈13.08, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I added the sum of the bond energies in the molecule, but perhaps I should subtract them. For example, maybe the correct formula is:

ΔHf = sum of bonds in elements - sum of bonds in molecule.

Which would be 10100−8400=1700 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's the same as before. So I think the correct answer is 1700, but it's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not seeing the link.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Wait, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2 group is a single bond between C's.

Let me count all single C-C bonds:

1. Between the =CH and CH2:1.

2. Between CH2 and CH(CH3):1.

3. Between CH(CH3) and CH2:1.

4. Between CH2 and CH=:1.

Substituent bonds:

Each (CH3)2C= has two C-C:2.

CH(CH3) has one:1.

C(CH3)2 has two:2.

Total substituent bonds:5.

So total single C-C bonds:4+5=9.

Same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and perhaps the correct answer is 1700, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I've checked multiple times and can't find it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the sum of the bond energies to be subtracted from the sum of the elements' bond energies. So, 10100 -8400=1700. But again, that's not an option.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol. But I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2** using the provided bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Understanding the Formula**:  
   The compound is a hydrocarbon with the molecular formula **C9H22**. It contains 9 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms. The structure includes two double bonds (C=C) and several single bonds (C-C and C-H).

2. **Enthalpy of Atomization**:  
   - Carbon requires **1000 kJ/mol** to break into atoms.  
   - Hydrogen, from H2, requires **50 kJ per H atom** (since bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol).  
   - Total atomization energy for the compound:  
     \[
     \text{Atomization energy} = (9 \times 1000) + (22 \times 50) = 9000 + 1100 = 10100 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
     \]

3. **Bond Energies in the Molecule**:  
   - **C-C single bonds**: 9 bonds × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol.  
   - **C=C double bonds**: 2 bonds × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.  
   - **C-H bonds**: 15 bonds × 400 kJ/mol = 6000 kJ/mol.  
   - Total bond energy in the molecule:  
     \[
     \text{Total bond energy} = 1800 + 600 + 6000 = 8400 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
     \]

4. **Enthalpy of Formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \text{Atomization energy} - \text{Total bond energy}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 10100 - 8400 = 1700 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated enthalpy of formation (**1700 kJ/mol**) does not match any of the provided options. The options are:  
   - A) 11200 kJ/mol  
   - B) 67.4 kJ/mol  
   - C) 11.44 kJ/g  
   - D) 1900 kJ/g  

   The calculation appears correct, but none of the options align with the result. A possible explanation is that the question may have intended the answer in **kJ/g**. The molecular weight of the compound is:  
   \[
   \text{Molecular weight} = (9 \times 12) + (22 \times 1) = 130 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   Converting **1700 kJ/mol** to **kJ/g**:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \frac{1700}{130} \approx 13.08 \, \text{kJ/g}.
   \]  
   This value also does not match any of the options.

6. **Final Consideration**:  
   Given the mismatch, the most plausible conclusion is that the intended answer is **B) 67.4 kJ/mol**, though the reasoning behind this discrepancy is unclear. No errors were identified in the calculations.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Enthalpy of formation usually involves looking at the bonds broken and formed. Oh right, the standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change when the molecule is formed from its elements in their standard states.

But wait, since the problem provides bond energies, I should use the bond energy method. The formula I remember is that the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds minus the sum of the product bonds. But wait, actually no, I think it's the other way around. Because when bonds are broken, you're putting energy in (endothermic), and when bonds are formed, you release energy (exothermic). So the overall enthalpy change would be (sum of bond energies broken) minus (sum of bond energies formed).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements. So, for the reaction:

Elements (in their standard states) → Compound.

So for each molecule, I have to consider all the bonds that are broken in the reactants and formed in the products.

Wait, but sometimes people use the bond energies approach where you calculate the total energy of the bonds in the reactants and subtract the total in the products, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energy required to break all bonds in the elements and then the energy released when the bonds in the compound are formed.

Oh wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies (atomization) of all the constituent atoms minus the sum of the bond energies in the molecule.

Wait, no. Let me think. The general formula is:

ΔHf = [ (sum of atomization energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule) ] / (moles of compound)

But wait, no, the atomization energy is the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule into individual atoms. So for the compound, the process is:

Elements (in standard states) → Atoms → Compound.

The enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the atomization energies of the elements minus the sum of the bond energies in the compound, divided by the number of moles of the compound.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me look for a clear formula. I think the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (Σ bond energies of reactants) - (Σ bond energies of products) ]

But wait, in the context of formation, the reactants are the elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon, the reactants would be H2 and O2 (if it's a hydrocarbon). Wait, but in this question, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, that's a key point.

Wait, the question says the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. So, for each carbon atom, you need to put in 1000 kJ to break it into individual atoms. For hydrogen, since it's diatomic, the bond energy is 100 kJ/mol. So each H atom would require 100/2 = 50 kJ? Or wait, the bond energy for H-H is 100 kJ/mol, so to get H atoms, you need to break H-H bonds, which is 100 kJ per mole of H-H. So for each H atom, it's 50 kJ? Wait, no, because bond energy is per mole of bonds. So for one mole of H2, breaking it into 2 moles of H atoms requires 100 kJ.

But the compound in question is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of C and H atoms.

Wait, the formula is a bit complicated. Let me write it out. It's (CH3)2C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. No, wait, I think I misread the formula. Let me parse it correctly.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So that's a molecule with two double bonds, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's best to count the number of each type of bond.

Wait, but perhaps I should first figure out how many C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds are in the molecule.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the molecule in terms of the number of each type of bond. Let me count the bonds:

Each (CH3)2C= group: that's a central C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond. So each (CH3)2C=CH- would have certain bonds. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to structure the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So the structure is something like:

( (CH3)2C=CH ) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the entire molecule and count bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that the molecule consists of two isopropenyl groups and some single bonds in between.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just count the number of each type of bond.

Each molecule has:

- C-C single bonds: how many?

Each CH2 group has a C-C single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Let me try to count each type:

Number of C-C single bonds: Let's see. The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: this is an isopropenyl group. It has a central C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to another CH group.

So, the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-.

Then after that, a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to another CH2, which connects to a CH group with a double bond to C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is structured as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the backbone has six carbons, maybe? Let's count:

1: (CH3)2C= (position 1)
2: CH- (position 2)
3: CH2- (position 3)
4: CH(CH3)- (position4)
5: CH2- (position5)
6: CH= (position6)
7: C(CH3)2 (position7?)

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the molecule as:

Positions 1 to 7: 1 is (CH3)2C=, 2 is CH-, 3 is CH2-, 4 is CH(CH3)-, 5 is CH2-, 6 is CH-, and 7 is C(CH3)2.

But perhaps a more accurate approach is to count each type of bond:

- C=C bonds: Let's see, the molecule has two double bonds. The first part is (CH3)2C=CH- and the last part is CH=C(CH3)2. So two C=C double bonds.

So two C=C bonds.

Now, the single bonds: C-C, C-H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: each CH3 has three C-H bonds. So two CH3 groups: 2 *3 =6 C-H bonds.

Then the =CH- has a single bond to the next CH2 group, which is a single C-C bond.

Similarly, each CH2 group has two C-H bonds. Let me try to count all the C-H bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the total number of C-H bonds in the entire molecule.

Each CH3 group has three C-H bonds. The molecule has multiple CH3 groups.

Let's count the number of CH3 groups.

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C= : two CH3 groups here.

Then, in the chain, we have:

After the double bond, a CH- (that's one CH), then CH2 (one CH2), then CH(CH3) (one CH(CH3)), then CH2 (another CH2), then CH= (another CH), and finally C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the CH(CH3) has one CH3 group. The C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups.

So total CH3 groups:

- (CH3)2C: two CH3.

- CH(CH3): one CH3.

- C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups.

So total CH3 groups: 2 +1 +2 =5? Wait, no. Wait, each CH3 is a group attached to a C. So each CH3 is a methyl group.

Wait, (CH3)2C= : two CH3 groups attached to the central C.

Then, CH(CH3): another CH3 attached to another C.

C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups attached.

So total (2 +1 +2)=5 CH3 groups. Each CH3 has three C-H bonds. So 5 *3 =15 C-H bonds.

Wait, but wait. The (CH3)2C= group: each CH3 has three C-H. So two CH3 groups contribute 2*3=6 C-H.

The CH(CH3) has one CH3 group, contributing 3 C-H.

C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups, contributing 2*3=6 C-H.

So total C-H bonds: 6 +3 +6 =15.

Wait, but let me check. The molecule has:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: this has two CH3 groups (6 C-H), then the CH- has one C-H.

Then CH2 has two C-H, then CH(CH3) has one C-H plus three from the CH3, then CH2 has two C-H, then CH= has one C-H, and the C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups (6 C-H). Hmm, perhaps my initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH3 contributes three C-H bonds. So the total number of C-H bonds is:

Each CH3 group: 3 × number of CH3 groups.

Number of CH3 groups: 2 (from (CH3)2C) +1 (from CH(CH3)) +2 (from C(CH3)2) =5. So 5 ×3=15 C-H bonds.

Now, the C=C bonds: two in total.

C-C single bonds: let's count.

Each CH2 has a C-C single bond. Let me think about the structure again.

The backbone is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the backbone has six carbons (positions 1 to 6), but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each C-C single bond.

Wait, each -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH- would contribute several C-C single bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps each single bond in the chain contributes to C-C bonds.

But maybe I can count the number of C-C single bonds.

Each CH2 group has one C-C bond. Let me see:

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C=C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the correct formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the backbone is connected as:

C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7.

Wait, perhaps not, but perhaps each '-' indicates a single bond.

So, the structure is:

C1 (with two CH3 groups) double bonded to C2 (CH group), which is connected to C3 (CH2), which is connected to C4 (CH(CH3)), which is connected to C5 (CH2), which is connected to C6 (CH-), which is double bonded to C7 (C(CH3)2).

So the single bonds are:

C2-C3 (single),

C3-C4 (single),

C4-C5 (single),

C5-C6 (single),

C6-C7 (double).

Wait, so how many C-C single bonds are there?

C2-C3: 1,

C3-C4: 1,

C4-C5:1,

C5-C6:1.

That's four single C-C bonds.

Additionally, each CH2 group is connected to another C via single bonds. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, each CH2 is a CH2 group, which is itself a C connected to two Hs and two other C's (the previous and next C in the chain).

Wait, perhaps each CH2 has two C-C bonds, but that's not right. Wait, no, each CH2 is part of a C-C single bond. For example, the CH2 between C3 and C4 is connected via a C-C single bond. So each CH2 group contributes one C-C single bond.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C single bonds is the number of single bonds along the chain.

Looking at the structure, the chain is:

C1=C2 - C3 - C4 - C5 - C6=C7.

So between C2 and C3: single bond (1),

C3 and C4: single bond (2),

C4 and C5: single bond (3),

C5 and C6: single bond (4).

So four C-C single bonds.

Additionally, each CH3 group is attached via C-C single bonds. For example, the (CH3)2C= part has two C-C single bonds (each CH3 attached to C1). Similarly, the CH(CH3) has one C-C single bond (CH3 attached to C4), and the C(CH3)2 has two C-C single bonds (each CH3 attached to C7).

So how many C-C bonds from the CH3 and other substituents?

Each CH3 group contributes a C-C bond.

- For (CH3)2C= : two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to C1).

- For CH(CH3): one C-C bond (CH3 attached to C4).

- For C(CH3)2: two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to C7).

So that's 2 +1 +2 =5 C-C bonds from substituents.

So total C-C single bonds:

4 (from the chain) +5 (from substituents) =9 C-C bonds.

Wait, but each C-C bond is a single bond, so each contributes 200 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the bond energy given is:

C-C: 200 kJ/mol,

C=C:300 kJ/mol,

C-H:400 kJ/mol,

H-H:100 kJ/mol (but not relevant here).

So, the total bond energies in the molecule would be:

Number of C-C bonds × 200 + number of C=C bonds × 300 + number of C-H bonds ×400.

So let's plug the numbers.

Number of C-C bonds: 9.

Number of C=C: 2.

Number of C-H: 15.

So:

C-C: 9 ×200 = 1800 kJ,

C=C: 2 ×300 =600 kJ,

C-H:15 ×400=6000 kJ.

Total bond energies in the molecule: 1800 +600 +6000 =8400 kJ.

But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of formation. So the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of elements in standard state) - (sum of bond energies in the compound).

Wait, but the elements are in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite and hydrogen is H2. So I need to calculate the energy required to break down the compound into its constituent atoms, which is the sum of the bond energies in the compound. Then, the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the energies needed to form the atoms (atomization) minus the bond energies in the compound.

Wait, but wait. The standard enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So using bond energies, the approach is to calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (H2 and O2, but in this case, since the molecule is hydrocarbon, the elements are C and H2) into their atoms, then the energy released when the bonds in the molecule are formed.

Wait, but the question gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, that's the energy required to break C into individual atoms. For hydrogen, since H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, breaking one mole of H2 into H atoms requires 100 kJ.

So for each mole of the compound, I need to calculate:

Total atomization energy = (moles of C × 1000) + (moles of H × (100/2)).

Wait, because each H2 molecule has two H atoms, so per mole of H2, you get 2 moles of H. But the bond energy is per mole of H-H. So to get H atoms, you have to break H-H bonds.

So for the molecule, the number of C atoms and H atoms is needed.

The formula of the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: Each CH3 has 3 H. Two CH3 groups: 6 H.

The =CH- has one H.

Then CH2 has 2 H.

CH(CH3): the CH has one H, and the CH3 has 3 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH= has one H.

C(CH3)2: each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3 groups: 6 H.

So total H atoms:

= (6 +1) + (2) + (1 +3) + (2) + (1) + (6) = Let me calculate step by step.

First group (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 H (from two CH3) +1 H (from CH) =7 H.

Then CH2:2 H.

Then CH(CH3):1 H (from CH) +3 H (from CH3) =4 H.

Then CH2:2 H.

Then CH=:1 H.

Then C(CH3)2:6 H (from two CH3).

Adding up:7 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 = 22 H atoms.

So each molecule has 22 H atoms. So per mole of the compound, 22 moles of H atoms.

So the total atomization energy for H is 22 × (100 kJ/mol / 2) = 22 ×50 = 1100 kJ? Because each H atom comes from breaking H2, which requires 100 kJ per mole of H2. Since each H2 gives two H atoms, so per H atom, it's 50 kJ.

Wait no, wait. The bond energy given is H-H = 100 kJ/mol. So for each mole of H2 that is broken, you get 2 moles of H atoms. So the energy per mole of H2 is 100 kJ. Therefore, for 22 moles of H atoms, since each H atom comes from 0.5 mole of H2, the total H2 broken is 22/2 =11 moles. So the energy for H is 11 ×100 =1100 kJ.

Similarly, for C atoms: The molecule has how many C atoms? Let's count.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: 3 C (the central C, and two from CH3, plus the CH which is another C. Wait, no, each (CH3)2C=CH- has 3 C atoms: the central C, and two CH3 groups attached to it. Or wait, each CH3 is a group, so the central C is connected to two CH3 (each CH3 is a C), plus the CH from the double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the C atoms.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group is a C atom. Let me count each C:

- The central C in (CH3)2C= : 1 C.

Then, each CH3 has a C: 2 ×1 =2 Cs.

Then, the =CH- part is another C: 1.

Then, the CH2 groups: each has a C. Let's see, in the chain, CH2 comes after CH=, so each CH2 is a C. So how many CH2 groups are there?

The structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-... Wait, perhaps the chain is:

C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C=C.

So the chain has four CH2 groups, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count each C.

Alternatively, perhaps think of each group:

1. (CH3)2C= : 3 C atoms (central C and two CH3 Cs).

Wait, no. The (CH3)2C= is a propene-like structure. So the central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to another C.

So that's 3 C's: the central C, and the two CH3 Cs. Wait, no, each CH3 is a group. So (CH3)2C= would be a C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to another C.

So, the central C is one, each CH3 is another C. So (CH3)2C= would have 3 C's: central C, plus two from the CH3 groups.

Then, the =CH- group: that's another C. So that's 4.

Then the CH2: another C (5).

Then CH(CH3): another C (6).

Another CH2: another C (7).

Then CH=: another C (8).

And the C(CH3)2: another C (9).

So total 9 C atoms per molecule.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2C= is three C atoms: the central C, and two from the CH3 groups.

Then the =CH- is one more C (so 4).

Then each -CH2- is another C (so 5).

Then CH(CH3) is another C (6).

Another -CH2- (7).

Then CH= (8).

And the C(CH3)2 is another C (9).

So 9 C atoms in total.

So per mole of the compound, 9 moles of C atoms.

Each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol of atomization energy. So total for C: 9 ×1000 =9000 kJ.

Total atomization energy for the compound: 9000 (C) + 1100 (H) =10100 kJ per mole.

Now, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is 8400 kJ (as calculated earlier).

So the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf = (sum of atomization energies) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule)

ΔHf = 10100 - 8400 =1700 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A) 11200, B) 67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, 1700 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Let me double-check the bond count.

C-C bonds:

Earlier I thought there are 9 C-C bonds, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me recount.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each C-C bond is a single bond between two C atoms.

So let's list each single bond:

1. Between the central C of (CH3)2C and each CH3: 2 C-C bonds.

2. The =CH- group: the C in =CH is connected to the next CH2. So that's one C-C bond.

3. The CH2 is connected to CH(CH3): another C-C bond.

4. The CH(CH3) is connected to the next CH2: another C-C bond.

5. The CH2 is connected to the next CH=: another C-C bond.

6. Now, the substituents:

Each CH3 group in (CH3)2C contributes a C-C bond: 2.

The CH(CH3) contributes one C-C bond (the CH3 attached).

The C(CH3)2 contributes two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached).

So that's 2+1+2=5.

So the C-C bonds are:

From the chain: 5 (positions 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7?), no wait, wait.

Wait, the backbone:

C1 (from (CH3)2C) double bonded to C2 (from =CH-).

C2 is connected to C3 (CH2).

C3 connected to C4 (CH(CH3)).

C4 connected to C5 (CH2).

C5 connected to C6 (CH-).

C6 double bonded to C7 (C(CH3)2).

So single bonds are:

C2-C3: 1,

C3-C4: 2,

C4-C5:3,

C5-C6:4,

That's four single bonds along the chain.

Then substituent bonds:

C1 connected to two CH3 groups: 2 bonds,

C4 connected to one CH3:1,

C7 connected to two CH3:2.

Total substituent bonds:5.

So total C-C bonds:4 (chain) +5 (substituents) =9, as before.

C=C bonds: two.

C-H bonds: 15.

So bond energies: 9*200=1800, 2*300=600,15*400=6000.

Sum=1800+600+6000=8400.

So the sum is 8400.

Atomization energy: 9*1000 (C) + 22*(100/2) (H) =9000 +22*50=9000+1100=10100.

ΔHf =10100-8400=1700 kJ/mol.

But none of the options are 1700. The options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the H count.

Wait, the molecule has 22 H atoms. So when considering the H2 bonds, each H atom comes from 0.5 mole of H2.

So for 22 H atoms, you need 11 moles of H2, which requires 11 ×100 kJ =1100 kJ.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C atoms. If the molecule has 8 C atoms instead of 9, let me recount.

Wait, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3) group is a C.

Breaking it down:

1. (CH3)2C= : 3 C atoms (central, and two from CH3).

2. =CH- :1 C.

3. CH2:1 C.

4. CH(CH3):1 C.

5. CH2:1 C.

6. CH=:1 C.

7. C(CH3)2:1 C.

So 7 C atoms. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.

Wait, the (CH3)2C= is three C atoms: the central, and two CH3.

=CH- :1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=:1 C.

C(CH3)2:1 C.

So total 7 C atoms? But that doesn't seem right. Because each CH3 is a group attached to a C, but the CH3 itself is a C connected to H's.

Wait, perhaps the correct count is:

Each CH3 is a group. So the (CH3)2C= has one central C and two CH3 C's.

=CH- is another C.

Each CH2 is another C.

CH(CH3) is another C.

CH2 is another C.

CH= is another C.

C(CH3)2 is another C.

So that's 2 (from (CH3)2) +1 (from C=) +1 (CH) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH=) +1 (C(CH3)2) = 9 C atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. If the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, then the formula can be written as C9H14.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me check the formula for C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group is C4H6.

Then, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2: let's see.

CH2 is C1H2,

CH(CH3) is C2H5,

CH2 is C3H2,

CH= is C4H,

C(CH3)2 is C5H6.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each group.

But perhaps a quicker way is to note that the formula is C9H14.

Because (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 contributes one C and three H.

But perhaps a better way is to figure out the molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula to count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: (CH3)2C=CH- is C4H6.

Then the rest is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

CH2 is CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 C, 4 H.

CH2:1 C, 2 H.

CH=:1 C, 1 H.

C(CH3)2:1 C, 6 H.

Wait, but then adding:

C4H6 + (CH2 + CH(CH3) + CH2 + CH + C(CH3)2).

CH2: 1 C,2 H.

CH(CH3):1 C,1 H +3 H=4 H.

CH2:1 C,2 H.

CH=:1 C,1 H.

C(CH3)2:1 C,6 H.

So:

C:4 (from first part) +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =9 C.

H:6 (first part) +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 =21 H.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 22 H. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

So the molecular formula is C9H20? Or C9H14?

Wait, let me recount all H atoms.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

(CH3)2C=: each CH3 has 3 H. Two CH3 → 6 H.

=CH-:1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H (from CH) +3 H (from CH3) =4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=:1 H.

C(CH3)2: each CH3 has 3 H. Two CH3 →6 H.

So adding:

6 (from (CH3)2C) +1 (from =CH) +2 (from CH2) +4 (from CH(CH3)) +2 (from CH2) +1 (from CH=) +6 (from C(CH3)2).

Total H:6+1=7; 7+2=9; 9+4=13;13+2=15;15+1=16;16+6=22.

So H=22.

C: Let's recount.

Each CH3 is a C.

The (CH3)2C=: 3 C (central, two CH3).

=CH-:1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=:1 C.

C(CH3)2:1 C.

So 3+1+1+1+1+1+1=9 C.

So molecular formula is C9H22?

Wait, no, 22 H.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount each group.

(CH3)2C=: central C has two CH3. So 3 C atoms.

=CH-:1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=:1 C.

C(CH3)2:1 C.

So that's 3+1+1+1+1+1+1 =9 C.

Now each CH3 contributes 3 H.

So:

(CH3)2C=:2×3=6 H.

=CH-:1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H (CH) +3 H (CH3) =4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=:1 H.

C(CH3)2:2 ×3 =6 H.

So total H=6 +1 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 =22 H.

So molecular formula is C9H22.

Wait, but wait, that's 9 C and 22 H.

So the molecule is C9H22.

So per mole of the compound, 9 C and 22 H.

Thus, the atomization energy is:

C:9 ×1000 =9000 kJ.

H:22 × (100/2) =22 ×50 =1100 kJ.

Total atomization energy:9000+1100=10100 kJ.

Sum of bond energies in the molecule: 8400 kJ.

So ΔHf =10100 -8400 =1700 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 1700. The closest is option D) 1900.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, let me recheck the bond count.

Wait, the molecule has 9 C atoms. So how many C-C bonds? Let me think of the structure again.

Each C connected to others via single bonds.

In the molecule, the backbone is:

C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7.

Wait, perhaps it's:

C1: (CH3)2C=.

C2: connected to C1 via double bond, and connected to C3 via single bond.

C3: connected to C2, and connected to C4 via single bond.

C4: connected to C3 and to C5 via single bond, and also to CH3 (so another C-C bond).

C5: connected to C4 and C6 via single bond.

C6: connected to C5 and C7 via double bond.

C7: connected to C6, and has two CH3 groups (so two C-C bonds).

So the single bonds in the backbone are C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6: four.

And substituent C-C bonds: C1 has two (for the two CH3), C4 has one (for CH3), C7 has two (for the two CH3). So 2+1+2=5.

Total single C-C bonds:4 +5 =9.

C=C bonds: two.

C-H bonds:15 (as before).

So bond energies:9×200=1800, 2×300=600,15×400=6000. So 1800+600=2400, +6000=8400.

So sum is 8400.

So ΔHf=10100−8400=1700.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1700. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization given is per mole of C, but in the molecule, perhaps it's per mole of C atoms. So if the molecule has 9 C atoms, it's 9 moles of C.

Wait, that's correct. So 9×1000=9000.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the number of moles of the compound. Oh, wait, the question is about the enthalpy of formation per mole of the compound. So if the calculation gives 1700 kJ per mole, but the options don't have it, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1900 kJ/g. Wait, but the units are per gram? Hmm, the question says 'given' values are per mole.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of formation of the compound, so the answer should be in kJ per mole. The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B)67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

Wait, options C and D are per gram. But the given data is per mole. So it's more likely that the correct answer is in kJ/mol. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the bond counts.

Another approach: perhaps the molecule is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene or something else, but no, the formula given is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 2,2,4,4,6,6,8-octamethyl something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as having more C-C bonds.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each CH2 is a single bond between C's.

But perhaps I should count all the C-C single bonds.

Wait, in the molecule, each CH2 is a single bond.

So the backbone is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the backbone has:

- (CH3)2C=CH: part.

- CH2.

- CH(CH3).

- CH2.

- CH=C(CH3)2.

So the single bonds are:

Between the =CH and CH2: 1.

Between CH2 and CH(CH3): 2.

Between CH(CH3) and CH2:3.

Between CH2 and CH=:4.

So four single bonds.

Substituent bonds:

In (CH3)2C=: two bonds.

In CH(CH3): one bond.

In C(CH3)2: two bonds.

So total substituent bonds:5.

So total C-C bonds:4+5=9.

Hmm, same as before.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole.

Wait, the options C and D are per gram. So perhaps I should calculate per gram.

The molecular weight of the compound is (9×12) + (22×1) =108 +22=130 g/mol.

So 1700 kJ per mole is 1700 /130 ≈13.08 kJ/g.

But that's not an option. The options are C)11.44 kJ/g, D)1900 kJ/g.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of H atoms. Let me recount.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

- (CH3)2C=: 2×3=6 H.

- =CH-:1 H.

- CH2:2 H.

- CH(CH3):1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3)=4 H.

- CH2:2 H.

- CH=:1 H.

- C(CH3)2:2×3=6 H.

Adding:6 +1=7; +2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +6=22.

So 22 H, correct.

Molecular weight is 9×12 +22×1= 108+22=130 g/mol.

So 1700 kJ per mole is 1700/130 ≈13.08 kJ/g.

Hmm, but that's not an option. The closest is option C:11.44 kJ/g.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which is 9 C and 18 H. Did I make a mistake in counting H?

Wait, let me recount H.

Each (CH3)2C=: two CH3 groups →6 H.

=CH-:1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H (from CH) +3 H (from CH3)=4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=:1 H.

C(CH3)2: two CH3 →6 H.

So total H:6+1=7; +2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +6=22.

No, 22 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the molecular weight is 12×9 +1×22=130, correct.

Hmm, maybe the question intended to ask for enthalpy of formation per gram, but I'm getting 13.08, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Another approach: maybe the problem is using the formula where the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the products (the molecule) minus the bond energies of the reactants (the elements).

Wait, perhaps I should have done ΔHf = sum of bond energies in elements - sum of bond energies in compound.

Wait, no, no. The bond energy approach for enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies in elements (H2 and C)] - [sum of bond energies in the molecule].

Wait, because the elements are H2 and C (in some form, like graphite). So the bond energies for H2 is 100 kJ/mol, and for C it's 1000 kJ/mol per mole of C.

Wait, but for C, the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol, which is the energy to break C into atoms. So for each mole of C, you have to add 1000 kJ.

But perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [ (C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (H atoms × enthalpy of H atomization) ] - (sum of bond energies in the molecule).

Wait, but H comes from H2, so each H atom requires 50 kJ (since H2 is 100 kJ/mol).

So, for the molecule, ΔHf = [9 ×1000 +22 ×50 ] - 8400 = [9000 +1100 ] -8400=10100-8400=1700 kJ/mol.

So, same result as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question expects an answer per gram. So 1700 kJ/mol ÷130 g/mol =13.08 kJ/g. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energies. Let me check the given bond energies.

Given:

C-C:200,

C=C:300,

C-H:400,

H-H:100.

So, everything seems correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the double bonds are counted as two C-C bonds, but no, C=C is a double bond, so it's treated as a single bond with higher energy.

Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, the only one in the same ballpark is option B:67.4 kJ/mol, but that's much lower than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is much bigger, but I think I counted correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of formation of the molecule from its elements, but perhaps I should have considered the number of moles of C and H in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different approach, where the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the products.

Wait, no, I think I got it right.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula where the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies in the reactants minus the bond energies in the products. So:

ΔHf = [sum of bonds in reactants] - [sum of bonds in products].

But the reactants are C and H2.

Wait, but in that case:

The reactants are 9 C atoms and 22 H atoms.

The bonds in the reactants would be:

Each C atom is in its elemental form, which is graphite. But the given data is the enthalpy of atomization, which is the energy to break C into atoms. So perhaps the correct formula is as I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf = sum (bonds broken in reactants) - sum (bonds formed in products).

In this case, the reactants are C (atomized) and H (atomized). The bonds broken would be the atomization energy: 9×1000 (C) +22×50 (H) =10100.

The bonds formed are the bonds in the molecule:8400.

So ΔHf =10100−8400=1700 kJ/mol.

So I think I'm correct, but the options don't have this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that there are more C-C bonds than I thought. Let me try to count again.

Wait, perhaps I missed some C-C bonds in the substituents.

Wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH: two CH3 groups attached to one C. So two C-C bonds.

- =CH-: connected to next CH2. So one C-C bond.

- CH2: connected to next CH(CH3). One C-C bond.

- CH(CH3): connected to next CH2. One C-C bond.

- CH2: connected to next CH=.

One C-C bond.

- CH=: connected to C(CH3)2. One C-C bond.

Substituent C-C bonds:

Each CH3 in (CH3)2C= contributes one C-C bond: two.

CH3 in CH(CH3): one.

Each CH3 in C(CH3)2: two.

Total substituent C-C bonds:2+1+2=5.

So total C-C bonds: 2 (from (CH3)2C=) +1 (from =CH- to CH2) +1 (from CH2 to CH(CH3)) +1 (from CH(CH3) to CH2) +1 (from CH2 to CH=) +1 (from CH= to C(CH3)2) + substituent bonds 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another approach: each CH2 is a single C-C bond.

Let me list all the single bonds:

1. Between (CH3)2C= and =CH-: no, that's a double bond.

2. Between =CH- and CH2: single bond:1.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3): single bond:2.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2: single bond:3.

5. Between CH2 and CH=: single bond:4.

6. Between CH= and C(CH3)2: double bond, so no single bond here.

So four single bonds in the chain.

Substituent bonds:

Each (CH3)2C= has two C-C bonds: 2.

CH(CH3) has one C-C bond:1.

C(CH3)2 has two C-C bonds:2.

Total substituent bonds:5.

So total C-C bonds:4 (chain) +5 (substituents) =9.

So same as before.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Since my calculation gives 1700 kJ/mol, which isn't an option, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is not provided, but looking at the options, perhaps option B is the intended one, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is considered as a different structure, leading to a different bond count.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which has two double bonds and multiple single bonds. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each double bond contributes one bond, not two. But that's already accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-H bonds is less than I thought. Let me recount.

Each (CH3)2C= has 6 H.

=CH- has 1 H.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH(CH3) has 4 H.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH= has 1 H.

C(CH3)2 has 6 H.

Total:6+1+2+4+2+1+6=22 H.

So 22 H.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question's given data is per mole of the element, so perhaps the bond energies are per mole of bonds, not per mole of molecule.

Wait, but the way I did it, I multiplied by the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using the molar approach.

Wait, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is 8400 kJ per mole of the molecule.

The sum of atomization energies is 10100 kJ per mole of molecule.

So ΔHf =10100−8400=1700 kJ/mol.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, where the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule minus the sum of the bonds in the elements.

But that would be:

ΔHf = (sum of molecule bonds) - (sum of elements bonds).

But the elements are C (atomized) and H (atomized).

Sum of molecule bonds:8400.

Sum of elements bonds: atomization energies are the energies to break into atoms, so it's the same as the sum of bonds in elements, which is 10100.

So ΔHf =8400−10100=−1700 kJ/mol. But that would imply the formation is exothermic, but I'm not sure.

But that's not matching any options either.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, but that's not what's asked.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's formula is C8H14, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I missed a C in the count. Let me recount the C's.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

(CH3)2C=:3 C.

=CH-:1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=:1 C.

C(CH3)2:1 C.

Total: 3+1+1+1+1+1+1=9 C.

Yes.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the bond energies in the molecule and the bond energies in the reactants (elements) but in a different way.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated as:

ΔHf = (Σ bond energies of reactants) − (Σ bond energies of products).

But the reactants are the elements: C (graphite) and H2.

So, for each mole of the compound, the number of moles of C and H.

But perhaps I should think of it as:

ΔHf = [ (moles of C × enthalpy of atomization) + (moles of H × bond energy of H2/2) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ].

Which is what I did.

So, I think my calculation is correct, but since the options don't match, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ/g, which would be 1700/130≈13.08, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I added the sum of the bond energies in the molecule, but perhaps I should subtract them. For example, maybe the correct formula is:

ΔHf = sum of bonds in elements - sum of bonds in molecule.

Which would be 10100−8400=1700 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's the same as before. So I think the correct answer is 1700, but it's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not seeing the link.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Wait, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2 group is a single bond between C's.

Let me count all single C-C bonds:

1. Between the =CH and CH2:1.

2. Between CH2 and CH(CH3):1.

3. Between CH(CH3) and CH2:1.

4. Between CH2 and CH=:1.

Substituent bonds:

Each (CH3)2C= has two C-C:2.

CH(CH3) has one:1.

C(CH3)2 has two:2.

Total substituent bonds:5.

So total single C-C bonds:4+5=9.

Same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and perhaps the correct answer is 1700, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I've checked multiple times and can't find it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the sum of the bond energies to be subtracted from the sum of the elements' bond energies. So, 10100 -8400=1700. But again, that's not an option.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol. But I'm not certain.


The problem involves calculating the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2** using the provided bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Understanding the Formula**:  
   The compound is a hydrocarbon with the molecular formula **C9H22**. It contains 9 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms. The structure includes two double bonds (C=C) and several single bonds (C-C and C-H).

2. **Enthalpy of Atomization**:  
   - Carbon requires **1000 kJ/mol** to break into atoms.  
   - Hydrogen, from H2, requires **50 kJ per H atom** (since bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol).  
   - Total atomization energy for the compound:  
     \[
     \text{Atomization energy} = (9 \times 1000) + (22 \times 50) = 9000 + 1100 = 10100 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
     \]

3. **Bond Energies in the Molecule**:  
   - **C-C single bonds**: 9 bonds × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol.  
   - **C=C double bonds**: 2 bonds × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.  
   - **C-H bonds**: 15 bonds × 400 kJ/mol = 6000 kJ/mol.  
   - Total bond energy in the molecule:  
     \[
     \text{Total bond energy} = 1800 + 600 + 6000 = 8400 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
     \]

4. **Enthalpy of Formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \text{Atomization energy} - \text{Total bond energy}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 10100 - 8400 = 1700 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated enthalpy of formation (**1700 kJ/mol**) does not match any of the provided options. The options are:  
   - A) 11200 kJ/mol  
   - B) 67.4 kJ/mol  
   - C) 11.44 kJ/g  
   - D) 1900 kJ/g  

   The calculation appears correct, but none of the options align with the result. A possible explanation is that the question may have intended the answer in **kJ/g**. The molecular weight of the compound is:  
   \[
   \text{Molecular weight} = (9 \times 12) + (22 \times 1) = 130 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   Converting **1700 kJ/mol** to **kJ/g**:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \frac{1700}{130} \approx 13.08 \, \text{kJ/g}.
   \]  
   This value also does not match any of the options.

6. **Final Consideration**:  
   Given the mismatch, the most plausible conclusion is that the intended answer is **B) 67.4 kJ/mol**, though the reasoning behind this discrepancy is unclear. No errors were identified in the calculations.

ANSWER: B
