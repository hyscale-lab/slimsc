Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, enamine reactions... I remember they involve amines and ketones or aldehydes. The process usually forms an imine or an enamine, which can then undergo various reactions.

The question is about a specific reaction. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. I need to figure out the product B and the correct sequence of reagents A.

Wait, let me think about what the starting material looks like. The name is a bit complicated. Breaking it down: it's an ethanaminium ion. The substituents are N-methyl and N-pentan-2-ylidene. The (E) configuration means the groups are on opposite sides.

Ethanaminium is CH2NH3+ maybe? But with substituents. So pentan-2-ylidene implies a double bond at position 2. So the structure would be something like CH2=C(pentyl group)-N(CH3)... but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's more like (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3) attached as a substituent on a double bond connected to the amine?

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the structure is CH2=C-(CH2)3CH3 as a substituent, connected to N-methyl. So the molecule looks like CH2=CH-(CH2)3CH3 attached to N(CH3) and a CH2+ group? Wait, no, ethanaminium would be CH3CH2NH3+ but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-enyl)ethanaminium? No, wait, it's pentan-2-ylidene, which is a substituent with a double bond. So the molecule is an enamine since it's an amine with a conjugated double bond.

Enamine reactions often involve the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. The reaction steps may include deprotonation, alkylation, and then hydrolysis.

Looking at the reagents: in the options, some involve LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane), and CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide), followed by H3O+ (acid workup).

So the process would be: first, deprotonation to form a strong base. LDA is a strong base, so it would abstract a proton from the starting material. Since the starting material is an enamine, where is the acidic proton? The alpha protons (next to the nitrogen) would be acidic because of the adjacent amine.

Once deprotonated, the enamine anion would attack an alkylating agent, like ethyl iodide. The ethyl group would attach to the alpha position.

After alkylation, there's an acid workup (H3O+), which would hydrolyze the enamine back to a ketone and amine.

Wait, but how does the product look? Let me think. The starting enamine is (E)-configured. So, when LDA deprotonates the alpha hydrogen, the enamine becomes a strong base. Then, ethyl iodide would supply an ethyl group. The alkylation would add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.

After alkylation, upon acid workup, the enamine would undergo hydrolysis. Enamine hydrolysis typically gives a ketone and an amine. The ketone's position depends on where the ethyl group was added.

Let me detail the steps:

1. Deprotonation with LDA: The enamine has an alpha hydrogen (the one adjacent to the N) which is deprotonated. So the enamine becomes enolate-like.

2. Alkylation: The enolate attacks ethyl iodide. So the ethyl group adds to the alpha carbon, increasing the chain length.

3. Workup with H3O+: This would protonate and hydrolyze the enamine. The enamine has a conjugated double bond, so hydrolysis would break it into a carbonyl group. Let's see: the original enamine is from a ketone and amine. Hydrolysis would give back the ketone and the amine.

Wait, the starting material is an enamine. Let's think about its structure. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the structure is (CH2)3CH2 attached to the double bond. The enamine is formed from a ketone and secondary amine.

So, when we deprotonate and alkylation occurs, we add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon. After alkylation, during hydrolysis, the enamine breaks into a ketone.

Wait, but the initial enamine is derived from a ketone. Let me imagine the structure. Let's say the enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Wait, no, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the structure would be:

The ethanaminium part is CH2NH3+CH2-. Wait, no, ethanaminium is CH3CH2NH3+? But attached to a pentan-2-ylidene group. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2)3CH3 attached to N-methyl.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let's approach it differently. Let's think about the reaction steps.

The starting material is an enamine, and the reaction involves adding an ethyl group.

So, when the enamine is treated with a strong base like LDA, it deprotonates at the alpha position (the one adjacent to the N). Then, the enolate attacks an ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.

After alkylation, acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine. Enamine hydrolysis typically gives a ketone and an amine. The ketone's position would be where the ethyl group was added.

Wait, let's think about the structure before and after alkylation. The starting enamine has a certain chain length. Adding an ethyl group would increase the chain length.

Suppose the starting material is derived from pentan-2-one. Then, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position would form a longer chain. Wait, but hydrolysis would give the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is formed from a ketone and a secondary amine. Let's say the amine is N,N-dimethylethanamine, which is (CH3)2NCH2CH3. When this amine reacts with pentan-2-one, it forms an imine, then an enamine.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine. So, the enamine is formed from the amine and the ketone. When you treat an enamine with a base, deprotonate, alkylate, then hydrolyze.

So, the process is:

Enamine → Deprotonate → Alkylation → Hydrolyze.

After alkylation, when the enamine is hydrolyzed, you get a ketone and an amine.

So, the product B would be a ketone and an amine. Let's see what the options say.

Looking at the options:

Option C says B is heptan-4-one. Option D says B is heptan-4-one.

Option A says B is pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the chain lengths.

The starting enamine is formed from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is (CH2)3CH2 attached to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the enamine comes from the reaction of N,N-dimethylethanamine (which is (CH3)2NHCH2CH3?), but wait, no. N,N-dimethylethanamine is CH3CH2N(CH3)2. So when it reacts with pentan-2-one (which is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH2CH3), the enamine would form.

Wait, the enamine formation typically involves the ketone reacting with the amine, then losing water to form the imine, then perhaps another reaction with a base to form the enamine. Or maybe it's the other way around.

But in any case, the product after alkylation and hydrolysis would be a ketone. Let's figure out its structure.

The starting enamine is (E)-configured. After deprotonation at the alpha position (the carbon next to N), the enolate would attack ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group.

So, the structure after alkylation would have an additional ethyl group on the alpha carbon. Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine breaks, and a ketone is formed. Where?

Let's imagine that the enamine has a structure like:

CH2=CH-(CH2)3CH3 attached to N(CH3)CH2+.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out. Alternatively, perhaps the initial enamine is derived from a cyclohexenone or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and N-methyl ethyl amine. Let's not get stuck on the exact structure but focus on the reaction.

So, when the enamine is treated with LDA, it deprotonates an alpha hydrogen. Then, the enolate attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group. Then, acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine to a ketone and an amine.

The starting enamine's structure determines the position of the ketone after hydrolysis. If the starting enamine is derived from a five-carbon ketone, adding an ethyl group would change the chain length and the position of the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is the enamine from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. So, the enamine would have the structure where the ketone's carbonyl is now part of the enamine system.

When we add an ethyl group via alkylation, the enamine becomes longer. Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be in a new position.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the possible products.

Option C and D say B is heptan-4-one. So that's a seven-carbon ketone with the carbonyl at position 4.

So, heptan-4-one would be CH2CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3. So, five carbons on both sides of the carbonyl.

How would that form from the starting enamine?

Perhaps the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and an amine. So the enamine has a certain structure which, after alkylation and hydrolysis, gives a seven-carbon ketone.

Wait, if the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one, which is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. Then, the enamine would have the structure where the carbonyl is now part of an imine. Then, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would add two carbons (since ethyl is CH2CH3).

But wait, the chain length increases. Let's think: perhaps the enamine from pentan-2-one is a five-carbon compound. After adding ethyl (two carbons), the total becomes seven. So, hydrolysis would give a seven-carbon ketone.

But wait, how would the positions line up? Let me imagine that the starting enamine's structure is:

CH2=CH-(CH2)3CH3 connected to an N(CH3) group.

Upon alkylation, we add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon. Then, when hydrolyzed, the ketone would be at a position that's four away from the end. Or maybe the chain is seven carbons in total.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is more like (CH2)4CH2 attached via a double bond. Adding an ethyl group would make it (CH2)5CH2. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the problem is that I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the possible reagent sequences.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Reagents are (i) LDA followed by DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the options for A are the sequences of reagents. The question says that the reaction is (starting material) + A → B.

So, the correct order is (i) LDA, then (ii) ethyl iodide, then (iii) H3O+? Or is there DME involved?

Wait, LDA is typically used in THF or DME as a solvent. So in the reagent steps, LDA would be in DME. So step (i) is LDA in DME. Step (ii) is adding ethyl iodide, and step (iii) is acid workup.

Looking at option C: Reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) ethyl iodide; (iii) H3O+. So the steps are LDA, then ethyl iodide, then acid.

Option D says (i) LDA, followed by DME, ethyl iodide, H3O+. But that would imply that after LDA, you add DME and the other reagents, which is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is: first, LDA is added in DME as the solvent, then ethyl iodide is added, then acid workup. So the steps would be in the order: LDA (with DME), then ethyl iodide, then acid.

In that case, the reagent sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Looking back at the options, option C says A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. So product B is heptan-4-one.

Other options: Option A says B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which suggests no chain elongation. But if we're adding an ethyl group, the chain should elongate, so product B would be a longer ketone.

Option C and D have product B as heptan-4-one. So the correct product is heptan-4-one.

So which option leads to that? The reagents should be LDA (deprotonation), ethyl iodide (alkylation), then acid (hydrolysis).

Looking at option C, the reagents are correct, and the product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, but option D has the reagents in a different order. Let me check.

Option D: (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. So, after LDA, DME is added? That doesn't make sense. LDA is typically pre-mixed with a solvent like DME. So the correct sequence is to first add LDA in DME, then add ethyl iodide, then acid.

So the correct reagent sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) ethyl iodide; (iii) H3O+.

Which matches option C's description of reagents A.

Wait, but looking back, the question says: the product B is after reaction with A. So, product B is the result after all steps in A are done.

So, the product is heptan-4-one, which is option C and D. But option C says product is heptan-4-one, and reagents are (i) LDA DME, (ii) ethyl iodide, (iii) H3O+.

Option D's reagent sequence is (i) LDA, then (ii) DME, ethyl iodide, H3O+. That would imply that LDA is used without DME first, which doesn't seem right because LDA is usually in DME as a solvent.

Thus, the correct reagent sequence is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

Which sequence is correct? Because in option D, the steps are not in the right order. Using LDA without the solvent first doesn't make sense. So the correct reagents are the ones in option C.

Wait, but looking at the product, adding an ethyl group to an enamine should increase the chain length. So, if the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one, which is 5 carbons, adding ethyl would make it 7, leading to heptan-4-one.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves an enamine derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. The enamine undergoes three steps: deprotonation with LDA, alkylation with ethyl iodide, and hydrolysis with acid (H₃O⁺). 

1. **Deprotonation**: LDA, a strong base, deprotonates the alpha hydrogen of the enamine, forming an enolate-like species.
2. **Alkylation**: The enolate attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon, increasing the chain length.
3. **Hydrolysis**: Acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine, yielding a ketone and an amine. The ketone's position depends on the chain length after alkylation.

The starting material is derived from pentan-2-one, which has five carbons. Adding an ethyl group (two carbons) results in a seven-carbon chain. Hydrolysis produces heptan-4-one, a seven-carbon ketone with the carbonyl group at position 4.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** suggests no chain elongation, which is incorrect because the reaction involves alkylation.
- **Option B** is inconsistent with the reaction steps and product.
- **Option C** correctly identifies the reagent sequence as (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺ and the product as heptan-4-one.
- **Option D** incorrectly lists the reagent sequence, implying LDA is used without DME first, which is not standard.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the reagent sequence and product.

Answer: C

Wait, perhaps the enamine comes from the reaction of N,N-dimethylethanamine (which is (CH3)2NHCH2CH3?), but wait, no. N,N-dimethylethanamine is CH3CH2N(CH3)2. So when it reacts with pentan-2-one (which is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH2CH3), the enamine would form.

In that case, the reagent sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Looking back at the options, option C says A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. So product B is heptan-4-one.

So the correct reagent sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) ethyl iodide; (iii) H3O+.

Which matches option C's description of reagents A.

Wait, but looking back, the question says: the product B is after reaction with A. So, product B is the result after all steps in A are done.

So, the product is heptan-4-one, which is option C and D. But option C says product is heptan-4-one, and reagents are (i) LDA DME, (ii) ethyl iodide, (iii) H3O+.

Option D's reagent sequence is (i) LDA, then (ii) DME, ethyl iodide, H3O+. That would imply that LDA is used without DME first, which doesn't seem right because LDA is usually in DME as a solvent.

Option D: A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

Which sequence is correct? Because in option D, the steps are not in the right order. Using LDA without the solvent first doesn't make sense. So the correct reagents are the ones in option C.

Wait, but looking at the product, adding an ethyl group to an enamine should increase the chain length. So, if the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one, which is 5 carbons, adding ethyl would make it 7, leading to heptan-4-one.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.


The reaction involves an enamine derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. The enamine undergoes three steps: deprotonation with LDA, alkylation with ethyl iodide, and hydrolysis with acid (H₃O⁺). 

1. **Deprotonation**: LDA, a strong base, deprotonates the alpha hydrogen of the enamine, forming an enolate-like species.
2. **Alkylation**: The enolate attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon, increasing the chain length.
3. **Hydrolysis**: Acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine, yielding a ketone and an amine. The ketone's position depends on the chain length after alkylation.

The starting material is derived from pentan-2-one, which has five carbons. Adding an ethyl group (two carbons) results in a seven-carbon chain. Hydrolysis produces heptan-4-one, a seven-carbon ketone with the carbonyl group at position 4.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** suggests no chain elongation, which is incorrect because the reaction involves alkylation.
- **Option B** is inconsistent with the reaction steps and product.
- **Option C** correctly identifies the reagent sequence as (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺ and the product as heptan-4-one.
- **Option D** incorrectly lists the reagent sequence, implying LDA is used without DME first, which is not standard.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the reagent sequence and product.

Answer: C
