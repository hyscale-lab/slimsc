Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They mention small m, which is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So I'm thinking about the Zeeman effect here, right? Because the Zeeman effect deals with the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term—oh, right, that's the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the atom and the external magnetic field. The paramagnetic term is usually given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. But in the case of the Zeeman effect, especially the normal Zeeman effect, the Hamiltonian is H_Zeeman = -μ·B. 

So for hydrogen, the magnetic moment μ is related to the orbital angular momentum L and the magnetic quantum number m. I think the formula is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (m/L), wait no, maybe it's μ = (μ_B) * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh right, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), where e is the electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and m_e is the electron mass.

The energy due to the Zeeman effect would then be ⟨H⟩ = -μ·B. But since the magnetic field is along Oz, and the magnetic moment for the electron's orbital motion is μ = μ_B * m, so the energy is ⟨H⟩ = -μ_B * m * B. Wait, but the sign might depend on the direction, but for magnitude comparison, the sign isn't important. So the magnitude is μ_B * m * B.

On the other hand, the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom with wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. That's the Balmer series, I remember. The wavelength corresponds to the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no. Wait, wait, the Balmer series has λ around 0.486 μm, which is the H-alpha line, corresponding to the transition n=3 to n=2. Let me check: the Balmer formula is 1/λ = R*(1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)), where n2 > n1. For the first line, n2=3, n1=2: 1/λ = R*(1/4 - 1/9) = R*(5/36), so λ = 36/(5R). R is the Rydberg constant, approximately 1.097e4 m^-1.

Wait, but I think I should calculate the energy difference ΔE for that transition. The Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV for the ground state (n=1), but the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So the energy difference between n=2 and n=3 would be E_2 - E_3 = [ -13.6 /4 ] - [ -13.6 /9 ] = 13.6 (1/9 - 1/4) = 13.6 ( (4 -9)/(36) ) = 13.6 * (-5/36) = - (68/36) eV ≈ -1.9 eV. But since we're looking at the magnitude, ΔE is about 1.9 eV.

Wait, wait, no. Actually, the transition energy when going from higher energy (n=3) to lower (n=2) is E_2 - E_3. So E_2 is -3.4 eV (since 13.6/4 is 3.4), and E_3 is -1.511 eV (13.6/9 ≈ 1.511). So ΔE is E_3 - E_2 = (-1.511) - (-3.4) = 1.889 eV. So approximately 1.89 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩ is μ_B * m * B. Let's compute that. First, what's the value of μ_B? μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. Wait, let me check: μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e). Let's compute it numerically.

e is approximately 1.602e-19 C. ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. m_e is 9.109e-31 kg.

So μ_B = (1.602e-19 C * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.109e-31 kg) 

Let me compute numerator: 1.602e-19 * 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 1.693e-53 C·J·s.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 ≈ 1.8218e-30 kg.

So μ_B ≈ 1.693e-53 / 1.8218e-30 = approx 9.29e-24 J/T. Yep, that's around 9.27e-24 J/T.

Now, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Since the problem says "small values of m", but without specifying, perhaps it's considering m=1? Or maybe m=0? Wait, m can be from -L to +L in integer steps. For hydrogen, the ground state has L=0, so m=0, but excited states have L>0. So considering small m, perhaps m=1?

Wait, wait, the question says for a magnetic field with small m. So maybe m is on the order of 1? Let's proceed with m=1.

So ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * m * B. μ_B is 9.27e-24 J/T. m=1, B=1 T. So ⟨H⟩ = 9.27e-24 * 1 * 1 = 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but that's in Joules. Let's convert that to eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 9.27e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.78e-5 eV. So about 5.78e-5 eV.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is about 1.89 eV. So the paramagnetic term is about 5.78e-5 eV, and the transition energy is about 1.89 eV. So the ratio is 5.78e-5 / 1.89 ≈ 3e-5. So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait—am I comparing the right things? Because the paramagnetic term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field, and ΔE is the energy difference between two states. If the paramagnetic coupling is much smaller, then the magnetic field effect is negligible compared to the transition energy.

So in this case, ⟨H⟩ = 5.78e-5 eV is much less than ΔE=1.89 eV. So ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Looking at the options: Option C says ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE. So the answer should be C.

Wait a second, but I'm a bit confused—could the orbital magnetic quantum number m be higher? Because the question says "small values of m". If m is 1, then that's the calculation. But what if m is 0? Then ⟨H⟩ would be zero. But the question says "small", so m could be 1, 0, or perhaps even m=2?

Wait, the orbital angular momentum quantum number L determines the possible m values. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n, and L can vary from 0 to n-1. So for n=2, L can be 0 or 1. So m can be 0, ±1 for L=1.

But the problem states "small values of m", which probably implies m=0 or m=1. If m=0, then the paramagnetic term is zero. So if m is 0, then ⟨H⟩=0, which is much less than ΔE. But if m is 1, then it's 5.78e-5 eV. Either way, it's much less than 1.89 eV.

So the correct comparison is ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (⟨H⟩):**  
   The energy due to the interaction of the magnetic moment with the external magnetic field is given by:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = \mu_B \cdot m \cdot B
   \]  
   where:  
   - \(\mu_B = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\) is the Bohr magneton.  
   - \(m\) is the orbital magnetic quantum number.  
   - \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\) is the magnetic field strength.  

   For small values of \(m\), we assume \(m = 1\) (the smallest non-zero value for \(m\)). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = (9.27 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx 5.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Transition Energy (\(\Delta E\)):**  
   The transition energy corresponds to the wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m}\), which belongs to the Balmer series of the hydrogen atom. Using the Rydberg formula:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right),
   \]  
   where \(R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1}\) is the Rydberg constant, \(n_1 = 2\), and \(n_2 = 3\). Substituting:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \cdot \frac{5}{36} \approx 1.545 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
   \]  
   Solving for \(\lambda\):  
   \[
   \lambda \approx 6.46 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
   \]  
   The energy difference between the \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\) levels is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \left| E_2 - E_3 \right| = \left| -\frac{13.6}{4} + \frac{13.6}{9} \right| \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \Delta E = 13.6 \left( \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 13.6 \cdot \frac{-5}{36} \approx 1.89 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term is \(\langle H \rangle \approx 5.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}\), while the transition energy is \(\Delta E \approx 1.89 \, \text{eV}\). The ratio of the two is:  
   \[
   \frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{5.78 \times 10^{-5}}{1.89} \approx 3 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This shows that \(\langle H \rangle\) is much smaller than \(\Delta E\).

Thus, the correct comparison is \(\langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E\).

Answer: C
