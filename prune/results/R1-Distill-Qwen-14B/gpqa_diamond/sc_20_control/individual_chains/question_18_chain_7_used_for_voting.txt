Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. Astronomers have determined their elemental abundances using the Equivalent Width (EW) method, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The given values are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

We also have the solar photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → which I think means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5, so nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → so log10(nMg/nH) = 7 - 12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we need to find (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the notation. The square brackets usually denote logarithmic abundances relative to a reference, which is typically the Sun. For example, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

But wait, the way the question presents it is [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That would mean that in Star 1, the abundance of Si relative to Fe is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun. So, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. Hmmm, wait, [Fe/H] is the abundance of Fe relative to hydrogen. So, [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe_1 / nH_1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) = 0. That implies that the Fe abundance in Star_1 relative to the Sun is the same as the Sun's. So, nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but the Sun's nFe/nH is given as log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → wait, no. The given solar value is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) (in the Sun's photosphere).

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, so for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, the hydrogen is the same as in the Sun's case? Well, maybe in terms of their ratios, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can treat the hydrogen as a normalizing factor.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down.

Let me first handle Star_1.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

We know from the Sun that nFe_sun /nH_sun =1e-4.5 (because log(nFe/nH) =-4.5). So, nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 * nH_sun.

Similarly, the Sun's nSi can be found, but wait, I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Hmm, wait, perhaps I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] would be log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun). Let's calculate that.

But wait, from solar photosphere data, we can get the abundance of Si. Oh wait, but the problem only provides nFe and nMg relative to H. It doesn't give [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe], I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to make some assumptions or find a way around it.

Wait, maybe I can find the [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Wait, I know the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps the problem gives me [Fe/H]_1 =0, which means that Star 1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's. But how does that help?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this another way.

Let me think about the [X/Y] notation. [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So, for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3.

So, log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But I don't have nSi_sun. Wait, perhaps I can find it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But how does that relate to Si? Maybe through [Mg/Si]_2, which is given for Star 2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, which would be for Star 2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to proceed by first computing the ratios relative to the Sun for each element in each star.

Let me try to model each star's elements.

Starting with Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)}.

But without knowing nSi_sun, perhaps I can express it relative to the Sun's nFe.

Hmm, wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not given, but perhaps it's not needed. Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that [Fe/H] for the Sun is zero, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, but [Si/Fe] is not necessarily zero. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Let me try to model the Sun's data first.

In the Sun:

nFe_sun /nH_sun = 1e-4.5 → nFe_sun = 3.16e-5 * nH_sun.

Similarly, nMg_sun /nH_sun = 1e-5 → nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

But what about nSi_sun? I don't have that data. I think I need to find a way to express [Si/Fe]_sun, which I don't have.

Wait, perhaps that's the key. Let me think. The problem gives for Star 2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0. So, for Star 2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 implies that the Mg abundance relative to H in Star 2 is the same as in the Sun.

So, [Mg/H]_2 = log(nMg_2/nH_2) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) =0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star 1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

But I'm not sure how that helps me find the ratio of Si in the two stars.

Wait, perhaps I can write expressions for nSi in each star in terms of nFe and then relate them.

Let me try for Star 1.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun) → because [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) *nH_1.

So, substituting:

nSi_1 = [ (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 ] * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) )

Simplifying, the nFe_sun cancels:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

Hmm, but I don't know nSi_sun. So I'm stuck here. Without knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe], I can't find this.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data.

Wait, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → which implies that Star_2's Mg relative to H is the same as the Sun's. So, for Star_2:

nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun).

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So, substituting nMg_2 from above:

log( [nMg_sun (nH_2 /nH_sun) ] /nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Simplify the left side: log( (nMg_sun *nH_2) / (nH_sun *nSi_2) ) = log( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * (nH_2 /nH_sun) ) ).

Which equals log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + log(nH_2/nH_sun).

So,

log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + log(nH_2/nH_sun) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Subtract log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) from both sides:

log(nH_2/nH_sun) =0.3 → nH_2 = nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the hydrogen abundance in Star_2 is 10^{0.3} times that of the Sun. So, nH_2 = nH_sun * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, but how does that help me with Si in Star_1?

Hmm, perhaps I can relate the two stars' hydrogen content, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find nSi_2 in terms of nMg_2 and then find it.

Wait, let's proceed for Star_2.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But from [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) = nMg_sun * 10^{0.3}.

So, substituting into the previous equation:

( nMg_sun * 10^{0.3} ) / nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) → 

Cancel 10^{0.3} and nMg_sun from both sides:

1/nSi_2 = (1/nSi_sun) → nSi_2 = nSi_sun.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the abundance of silicon in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. Because nSi_2 = nSi_sun.

Wait, how? Because the way the equations worked out, that's what I get. So, Star_2 has the same silicon abundance as the Sun.

Wait, but let me confirm that.

Starting from [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

Expressing nMg_2 as nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) because [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

Then, [Mg/Si]_2 is log( (nMg_2)/(nSi_2) ) - log( (nMg_sun)/(nSi_sun) ) )=0.3.

Which is log( (nMg_sun * nH_2 /nH_sun ) / (nSi_2) ) ) - log( nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

Which can be written as log( (nMg_sun * nH_2 / (nH_sun *nSi_2 )) ) - log( nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

Which is log( [nMg_sun /nSi_2 * nH_2/(nH_sun) ] ) - log( nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) ) =0.3.

Which is log( (nH_2/(nH_sun )) * (nMg_sun/nSi_2) ) ) - log( nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

That's equal to log( nH_2/(nH_sun) ) + log( nMg_sun/nSi_2 ) ) - log( nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

Which simplifies to log( nH_2/(nH_sun) ) + [ log(nMg_sun/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ] =0.3.

The term in the brackets is log( (nMg_sun/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )) → log( nSi_sun /nSi_2 ) = - log( nSi_2 /nSi_sun ).

So, putting it all together:

log( nH_2/(nH_sun) ) - log( nSi_2/(nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

We know from earlier that [Mg/H]_2=0 → nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

So, substituting this into the equation:

log(10^{0.3}) - log( nSi_2/(nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

Since log(10^{0.3}) =0.3 → 0.3 - log(nSi_2 /nSi_sun )=0.3 → 

Subtract 0.3 from both sides:

- log(nSi_2 /nSi_sun )=0 → log( nSi_2 /nSi_sun )=0 → nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

Ah, so that's correct. So, Star_2's silicon abundance is the same as the Sun's.

But wait, that's only in terms of number density relative to H, no? Because [Mg/H]_2 =0 means that nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun). So, nMg_2 =nMg_sun *10^{0.3}.

Hmm, but I thought we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun. So, in terms of number density, yes.

Now, moving on to Star_1.

Star_1's [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → which is log( nSi_1 /nFe_1 ) = log( nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) +0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{ log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) +0.3 }.

But nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

So substituting:

nSi_1 = [nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) ] * 10^{ log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) +0.3 }.

Hmm, let's simplify this. Let me think about 10^{log(a) +b} → that's equal to a *10^b.

So, 10^{log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) +0.3} = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

So,

nSi_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/(nFe_sun)) *10^{0.3}.

Simplify:

nFe_sun cancels out. So,

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Wait, so nSi_1 = nSi_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Wait, that's interesting because for Star_2, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun. So, to find the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 , it would be:

(nSi_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}) ) / (nSi_sun) ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio is (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But wait, how do I find nH_1/nH_sun? Because Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, which tells us about Fe relative to H, but doesn't directly give the H abundance. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the H abundances of Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, for Star_2, from [Mg/H]_2=0 and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

But I don't have a direct way to find nH_1. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the stars' H abundances.

Wait, but without more data, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of nH_1 to nH_sun can be found from the fact that Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0.

Wait, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nH_1 =nFe_1 * (nH_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 is in Star_1's photosphere, but I'm not sure how that relates to H.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in each star is normalized, so nH_1 and nH_2 are just scaling factors. But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

We're to find the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2).

From earlier, nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

nSi_1 = nSi_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Now, I need to find (nH_1/nH_sun).

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can relate [Fe/H]_1 and [Fe/H]_2? No, because only Star_1's [Fe/H] is given.

Wait, maybe I can find nH_1 from the fact that [Fe/H]_1=0. So, nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun).

But I don't have any other constraints on nH_1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio (nH_1/nH_sun) is 1, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the hydrogen abundance in both stars is the same as the Sun, which would make nH_1 =nH_sun, and thus the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2 ) =10^{0.3} ≈2.

But that doesn't match any of the options given. The options are 3.9, 12.6, 0.8, 1.2.

Wait, 10^0.3 is approximately 2, but none of the options are 2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should revisit the earlier steps. Let me go through Star_1 again.

Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So,

nSi_1 =nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) → 

The nFe_sun cancels out:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So, (nSi_1 /nSi_sun) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Then, since nSi_2 =nSi_sun, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, I need to find (nH_1/nH_sun).

Wait, I'm stuck because I don't have any data that directly relates the hydrogen in Star_1 to the Sun. Unless I can find it through another way.

Wait, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) using the fact that Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0. But [Fe/H]_1 is about Fe relative to H, which is already given. So, nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

But without another relation, I can't find nH_1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the mass of the stars to their photospheric composition, but I'm not sure. The masses are given, but I don't see a direct link to the abundances.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach. Maybe the problem expects me to use the fact that [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun), and [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3}*(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But since nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun), substituting:

nSi_1 = [nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun)] *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → 

Simplify: nFe_sun cancels, so:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) = [ (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun ] / nSi_sun = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, if I can find (nH_1/nH_sun), I can find the ratio.

Wait, but how?

Hold on, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) from the fact that [Fe/H]_1 =0. But [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe/nH = same as in Sun → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

But without more data, I can't find the value of (nH_1/nH_sun).

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen is the same in both stars as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. But earlier, for Star_2, from [Mg/H]_2=0, we had nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun), and from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}, so nH_2 isn't the same as the Sun's. So that assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key piece of data. Let me think again about the problem.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not given. But perhaps I can compute it using the given data. Because the Sun's nFe and nMg are known relative to H.

Wait, but I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] and relate that to [Mg/Si]_2.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun → but that's not helpful. Wait, no, the [X/Y] notation is always log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun = [X/Y], which is the logarithm of the ratio of the star's X/Y to the Sun's X/Y.

Wait, so the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0. So, the Sun's own [Mg/Si] is zero.

But in Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → which means that in Star_2, Mg/Si is 10^{0.3} times higher than in the Sun.

Wait, that would be:

log( (nMg_2/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ) =0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But from [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

And from earlier, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, substituting into [Mg/Si]_2's equation:

(nMg_sun * nH_2/(nH_sun) ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But since nSi_2 =nSi_sun, this becomes:

nMg_sun *nH_2/(nH_sun *nSi_sun) ) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Cancel nMg_sun and nSi_sun from both sides:

nH_2/(nH_sun) ) =10^{0.3}.

Which is consistent with what we found earlier: nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

So, perhaps for Star_1, if I can find nH_1/nH_sun, I can proceed.

Wait, but how?

Maybe I can think about the mass of the stars. The masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. But I'm not sure how that relates to the photospheric composition. Unless it's a red giant or main sequence star, but the problem doesn't specify. So I think that's a dead end.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that the hydrogen abundance in both stars is the same as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. But earlier, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 led us to nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}, which contradicts this assumption. So that's not valid.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach the problem differently. Let's consider that the [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2 are both 0, so in Star 1, Fe is solar, and in Star 2, Mg is solar.

But how does that help me find the ratio of Si in the two stars?

Let me think about the problem again. The question is to find (nSi_1 /nSi_2).

From Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

In Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) ) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) → 

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So, (nSi_1 /nSi_sun) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Hmm, so I need to find (nH_1/nH_sun).

Wait, perhaps I can relate nH_1 to nH_2 through some other means. For example, perhaps the problem implies that both stars have the same hydrogen abundance, but I don't think that's stated.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't give enough data. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem gives the solar photospheric composition as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So,

log(nFe/nH)_sun =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

log(nMg/nH)_sun =7 -12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So, in the Sun, nFe =3.16e-5 *nH, and nMg=1e-5 *nH.

But I don't think that helps me find nSi_sun. Unless I can find [Mg/Si]_sun, but I don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I can compute [Mg/Si]_sun from the Sun's data. But without knowing nSi_sun, I can't directly compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps if I can find nSi_sun from the [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should make an assumption that the number density of hydrogen is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So, nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun.

If that's the case, then:

For Star_1:

(nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} → (1) *10^{0.3} ≈2.

But the options don't have 2. So, that can't be right.

Wait, but from Star_2's data, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

So, if Star_2's nH is higher than the Sun's, perhaps Star_1's nH is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the hydrogen abundance and just focus on the ratios. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio (nH_1/nH_sun) is 1, but that leads to a ratio of ~2, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

Wait, 10^{0.3} is approximately 2. So, if (nH_1/nH_sun) is 1, the ratio is 2, which isn't an option. But option D is 1.2. Hmm.

Wait, could there be a different approach?

Let me think about the problem from another angle.

In Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Substituting nMg_2:

log( (nMg_sun *nH_2 /nH_sun) /nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Which can be rewritten as log( (nH_2/nH_sun) ) + log( nMg_sun/nSi_2 ) ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) +0.3.

Subtracting log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) from both sides:

log(nH_2/nH_sun) + log( nMg_sun/nSi_2 ) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) ) =0.3.

Which is log(nH_2/nH_sun) + log( nSi_sun /nSi_2 ) =0.3.

So,

log(nH_2/nH_sun) + log( nSi_sun /nSi_2 ) =0.3.

Since log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), this becomes:

log( (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nSi_2) ) ) =0.3.

Taking 10^ on both sides:

(nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/nSi_2) )=10^{0.3} → 

So,

nSi_2 = nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) /10^{0.3}.

But earlier, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun. So,

nSi_sun =nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)/10^{0.3} → 

Divide both sides by nSi_sun (assuming it's non-zero):

1= (nH_2/nH_sun)/10^{0.3} → nH_2/nH_sun =10^{0.3} → 

Which is consistent with what we found earlier. So, that's correct.

But this doesn't help us find nH_1/nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can use Star_1's data to find the ratio. Let me try again.

In Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1)=log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So,

nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )

Which simplifies to:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So, (nSi_1/nSi_sun) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, (nSi_1/nSi_2 ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nSi_sun) ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that both stars have the same hydrogen abundance as the Sun. So, nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun.

In that case, (nH_1/nH_sun) =1. So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 =1 *10^{0.3} ≈ 2.

But this isn't one of the options. So, that must be incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the stars have the same H abundance as each other. So, nH_1 =nH_2.

From Star_2, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

So, if nH_1 =nH_2 → nH_1 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

Thus, (nH_1/nH_sun) =10^{0.3} → (nSi_1/nSi_2) =10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Which is option A (~3.9).

But wait, why would nH_1 =nH_2 unless stated? The problem doesn't say anything about the hydrogen abundance being the same in both stars. So, this is an assumption that may not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H abundance and only compute the ratio using the given abundances.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ratio [Si/Fe]_1 is relative to the Sun, and in Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1=0, the [Fe/H] is solar, so [Fe/H]=0. So, the metallicity for Fe is solar. But what about Si?

Wait, perhaps the way to proceed is to take the Sun's [Si/Fe], but I don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_1 in terms of other known ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi_1 in terms of nFe_sun and nH_1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, here's another approach. Let me express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Let me denote the Sun's abundances as S.

So, for any element X,

nX_sun = S_X * nH_sun.

In the Sun:

nFe_sun = S_Fe * nH_sun.

nMg_sun = S_Mg *nH_sun.

nSi_sun = S_Si *nH_sun.

But we don't know S_Si or S_Fe, but wait, the problem gives us the Sun's [Fe/H] as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12=-4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5 → so S_Fe =nFe_sun/nH_sun =1e-4.5.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun is 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=-5 → S_Mg=1e-5.

But we don't have S_Si. So, I can't compute nSi_2 in terms of S_Si because nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

Wait, but in Star_2:

nSi_2 =nSi_sun = S_Si *nH_sun.

In Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * S_Si *nH_sun.

So, (nSi_1/nSi_2) = [ (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * S_Si *nH_sun ] / [ S_Si *nH_sun ] → 

Simplifies to (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, same result as before.

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't find the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) using the [Fe/H]_1=0.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe_1 /nH_1 ) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

But again, this doesn't give me (nH_1/nH_sun) unless I can relate it to another abundance.

Wait, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) using the fact that Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0 and its [Si/Fe] is 0.3.

So,

nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (S_Si/S_Fe).

But S_Si/S_Fe is the Sun's [Si/Fe], which I don't know.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the Sun's [Si/Fe] from the given data. Since I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe], perhaps it's a known value, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero, but that's not correct. The solar [Si/Fe] is a positive value, I think.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the H ratios and only consider the [X/Fe] and [X/Y] ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number densities.

Let me try to model the problem using the given data.

In Star_1:

nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

nSi_1 =nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Which becomes:

nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}*(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → 

The nFe_sun cancels:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

In Star_2:

nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, the ratio is (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But without (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio is 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3}=10^{0.6}≈3.98, which is option A. But how did I get that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think again.

Wait, in Star_2, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

If I assume that nH_1 =nH_2, then:

nH_1/nH_sun =10^{0.3}.

Thus, (nSi_1/nSi_2 )=10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Which is option A (~3.9).

But why would nH_1 =nH_2? The problem doesn't state that. It's an assumption, but perhaps that's what is intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find that the ratio is 10^{0.3} =2, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the intended approach is to find that the ratio is 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6}.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to find the ratio as 10^{0.3} =2, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem's setup. Let me think about the given data again.

Given:

Star_1: [Si/Fe]=0.3, [Fe/H]=0.

Star_2: [Mg/Si]=0.3, [Mg/H]=0.

Solar data: [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe =1e-4.5 *nH.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun= -5 → nMg=1e-5 *nH.

But we don't have [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_1 in terms of [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3.

But nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

So,

log(nSi_1/(nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun))) ) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3.

Which can be written as:

log( (nSi_1 /nFe_sun) * (nH_sun/nH_1) ) ) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3.

This becomes:

log( (nSi_1/nFe_sun) ) - log(nH_1/nH_sun) ) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3.

Which is:

log(nSi_1/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) - log(nH_1/nH_sun) =0.3.

Which is:

[Si/Fe]_sun + [Fe/H]_1 - log(nH_1/nH_sun) =0.3.

But I'm not sure if this helps, as I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H]=0 implies that Fe is at solar abundance, but without knowing Si's abundance relative to Fe in the Sun, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe]_1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward, and I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is simply 10^{0.3} =2, but that's not an option. Or perhaps 10^{0.3} /10^{0.3} =1, but that's not correct either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try to compute the ratio again.

We have for Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

For Star_2:

nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the mass of the stars are given, but I don't see how that ties into the photospheric composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H abundance and just compute the ratio using the given [X/Fe] and [X/Y] values.

Wait, another approach: Let me model the abundances in terms of the Sun's.

In Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So,

nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Which simplifies to:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So,

nSi_1/nSi_sun = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 →nMg_2 =nMg_sun *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nMg_sun) )? Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

So,

nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So,

(nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Cancel nMg_sun:

(nH_2/nH_sun) /nSi_2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Multiply both sides by nSi_2:

nH_2/nH_sun = (nSi_2/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But earlier, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun → nSi_2/nSi_sun=1.

So,

nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

Thus, (nH_2/nH_sun)=10^{0.3}.

Now, going back to Star_1:

nSi_1/nSi_sun = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't compute this ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the ratio (nH_1/nH_sun) is 1. So, (nH_1/nH_sun)=1 → nSi_1/nSi_sun =10^{0.3} → nSi_1/nSi_2 =10^{0.3} ≈2.

But the options don't have 2. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to find the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) as (10^{0.3})^2 =10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not sure why that would be the case. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) from another relation.

Wait, in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

But I don't have any other data about Star_1's other elements, except [Si/Fe]_1=0.3.

So, I can't find (nH_1/nH_sun) from Star_1's data.

But perhaps if I can relate it to Star_2's data.

Wait, but I don't see a direct way to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio is 10^{0.3} =2, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of number densities relative to hydrogen.

In the Sun:

nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun is unknown.

In Star_1:

nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So,

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun)) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → 

Simplifies to:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

In Star_2:

nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3} → 

Which we have already established.

But without knowing nH_1, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio without considering the hydrogen ratios, assuming that both stars have the same hydrogen abundance as the Sun. So, nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun.

In that case:

For Star_1:

nSi_1 =1 *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun → nSi_1 =nSi_sun *2.

For Star_2:

nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, the ratio is 2, but that's not an option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H normalization and compute the ratio using only the given [X/Fe] and [X/Y] values.

Let me try that.

In Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

In Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^{0.3}*(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But Star_1 and Star_2 don't have overlapping elements, so perhaps it's impossible to find the ratio without more data.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate the two through the Sun's [Mg/Fe], but I don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the ratio as 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6}≈3.98, which is option A.

I think I'll go with that, even though I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships provided in the problem.

### Key Data and Relationships:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si, sun}} / n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) + 0.3 \).
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{Si, sun}}) + 0.3 \).
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \).

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) = -4.5 \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) = -5 \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_2:
From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \).  
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{Si, sun}}) \).  
Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} \), we find \( n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} = 10^{0.3} \).  
Thus, \( n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{H, sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \).

#### For Star_1:
From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \).  
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,1}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si, sun}} / n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) \).  
Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} \), we get \( n_{\text{Si,1}} = (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si, sun}} \).

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio \( n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} \) is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{Si, sun}}} = (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit data about \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \). To proceed, we assume \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} = n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} = 10^{0.3} \). Substituting this:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot 10^{0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Calculation:
\( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), which corresponds to option **A (~3.9)**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. Astronomers have determined their elemental abundances using the Equivalent Width (EW) method, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The given values are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

We also have the solar photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → which I think means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5, so nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → so log10(nMg/nH) = 7 - 12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we need to find (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the notation. The square brackets usually denote logarithmic abundances relative to a reference, which is typically the Sun. For example, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

But wait, the way the question presents it is [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That would mean that in Star 1, the abundance of Si relative to Fe is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun. So, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. Hmmm, wait, [Fe/H] is the abundance of Fe relative to hydrogen. So, [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe_1 / nH_1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) = 0. That implies that the Fe abundance in Star_1 relative to the Sun is the same as the Sun's. So, nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but the Sun's nFe/nH is given as log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → wait, no. The given solar value is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) (in the Sun's photosphere).

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, so for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, the hydrogen is the same as in the Sun's case? Well, maybe in terms of their ratios, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can treat the hydrogen as a normalizing factor.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down.

Let me first handle Star_1.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

We know from the Sun that nFe_sun /nH_sun =1e-4.5 (because log(nFe/nH) =-4.5). So, nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 * nH_sun.

Similarly, the Sun's nSi can be found, but wait, I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Hmm, wait, perhaps I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] would be log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun). Let's calculate that.

But wait, from solar photosphere data, we can get the abundance of Si. Oh wait, but the problem only provides nFe and nMg relative to H. It doesn't give [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe], I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to make some assumptions or find a way around it.

Wait, maybe I can find the [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Wait, I know the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps the problem gives me [Fe/H]_1 =0, which means that Star 1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's. But how does that help?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this another way.

Let me think about the [X/Y] notation. [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So, for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3.

So, log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But I don't have nSi_sun. Wait, perhaps I can find it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But how does that relate to Si? Maybe through [Mg/Si]_2, which is given for Star 2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, which would be for Star 2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to proceed by first computing the ratios relative to the Sun for each element in each star.

Let me try to model each star's elements.

Starting with Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)}.

But without knowing nSi_sun, perhaps I can express it relative to the Sun's nFe.

Hmm, wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not given, but perhaps it's not needed. Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that [Fe/H] for the Sun is zero, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, but [Si/Fe] is not necessarily zero. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Let me try to model the Sun's data first.

In the Sun:

nFe_sun /nH_sun = 1e-4.5 → nFe_sun = 3.16e-5 * nH_sun.

Similarly, nMg_sun /nH_sun = 1e-5 → nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

But what about nSi_sun? I don't have that data. I think I need to find a way to express [Si/Fe]_sun, which I don't have.

Wait, perhaps that's the key. Let me think. The problem gives for Star 2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0. So, for Star 2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 implies that the Mg abundance relative to H in Star 2 is the same as in the Sun.

So, [Mg/H]_2 = log(nMg_2/nH_2) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) =0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star 1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

But I'm not sure how that helps me find the ratio of Si in the two stars.

Wait, perhaps I can write expressions for nSi in each star in terms of nFe and then relate them.

Let me try for Star 1.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun) → because [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) *nH_1.

So, substituting:

nSi_1 = [ (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 ] * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) )

Simplifying, the nFe_sun cancels:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

Hmm, but I don't know nSi_sun. So I'm stuck here. Without knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe], I can't find this.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data.

Wait, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → which implies that Star_2's Mg relative to H is the same as the Sun's. So, for Star_2:

nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun).

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So, substituting nMg_2 from above:

log( [nMg_sun (nH_2 /nH_sun) ] /nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Simplify the left side: log( (nMg_sun *nH_2) / (nH_sun *nSi_2) ) = log( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * (nH_2 /nH_sun) ) ).

Which equals log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + log(nH_2/nH_sun).

So,

log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + log(nH_2/nH_sun) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Subtract log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) from both sides:

log(nH_2/nH_sun) =0.3 → nH_2 = nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the hydrogen abundance in Star_2 is 10^{0.3} times that of the Sun. So, nH_2 = nH_sun * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, but how does that help me with Si in Star_1?

Hmm, perhaps I can relate the two stars' hydrogen content, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find nSi_2 in terms of nMg_2 and then find it.

Wait, let's proceed for Star_2.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But from [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) = nMg_sun * 10^{0.3}.

So, substituting into the previous equation:

( nMg_sun * 10^{0.3} ) / nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) → 

Cancel 10^{0.3} and nMg_sun from both sides:

1/nSi_2 = (1/nSi_sun) → nSi_2 = nSi_sun.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the abundance of silicon in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. Because nSi_2 = nSi_sun.

Wait, how? Because the way the equations worked out, that's what I get. So, Star_2 has the same silicon abundance as the Sun.

Wait, but let me confirm that.

Starting from [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

Expressing nMg_2 as nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) because [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

Then, [Mg/Si]_2 is log( (nMg_2)/(nSi_2) ) - log( (nMg_sun)/(nSi_sun) ) )=0.3.

Which is log( (nMg_sun * nH_2 /nH_sun ) / (nSi_2) ) ) - log( nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

Which can be written as log( (nMg_sun * nH_2 / (nH_sun *nSi_2 )) ) - log( nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

Which is log( [nMg_sun /nSi_2 * nH_2/(nH_sun) ] ) - log( nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) ) =0.3.

Which is log( (nH_2/(nH_sun )) * (nMg_sun/nSi_2) ) ) - log( nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

That's equal to log( nH_2/(nH_sun) ) + log( nMg_sun/nSi_2 ) ) - log( nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

Which simplifies to log( nH_2/(nH_sun) ) + [ log(nMg_sun/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ] =0.3.

The term in the brackets is log( (nMg_sun/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )) → log( nSi_sun /nSi_2 ) = - log( nSi_2 /nSi_sun ).

So, putting it all together:

log( nH_2/(nH_sun) ) - log( nSi_2/(nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

We know from earlier that [Mg/H]_2=0 → nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

So, substituting this into the equation:

log(10^{0.3}) - log( nSi_2/(nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

Since log(10^{0.3}) =0.3 → 0.3 - log(nSi_2 /nSi_sun )=0.3 → 

Subtract 0.3 from both sides:

- log(nSi_2 /nSi_sun )=0 → log( nSi_2 /nSi_sun )=0 → nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

Ah, so that's correct. So, Star_2's silicon abundance is the same as the Sun's.

But wait, that's only in terms of number density relative to H, no? Because [Mg/H]_2 =0 means that nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun). So, nMg_2 =nMg_sun *10^{0.3}.

Hmm, but I thought we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun. So, in terms of number density, yes.

Now, moving on to Star_1.

Star_1's [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → which is log( nSi_1 /nFe_1 ) = log( nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) +0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{ log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) +0.3 }.

But nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

So substituting:

nSi_1 = [nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) ] * 10^{ log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) +0.3 }.

Hmm, let's simplify this. Let me think about 10^{log(a) +b} → that's equal to a *10^b.

So, 10^{log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) +0.3} = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

So,

nSi_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/(nFe_sun)) *10^{0.3}.

Simplify:

nFe_sun cancels out. So,

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Wait, so nSi_1 = nSi_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Wait, that's interesting because for Star_2, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun. So, to find the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 , it would be:

(nSi_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}) ) / (nSi_sun) ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio is (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But wait, how do I find nH_1/nH_sun? Because Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, which tells us about Fe relative to H, but doesn't directly give the H abundance. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the H abundances of Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, for Star_2, from [Mg/H]_2=0 and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

But I don't have a direct way to find nH_1. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the stars' H abundances.

Wait, but without more data, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of nH_1 to nH_sun can be found from the fact that Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0.

Wait, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nH_1 =nFe_1 * (nH_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 is in Star_1's photosphere, but I'm not sure how that relates to H.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in each star is normalized, so nH_1 and nH_2 are just scaling factors. But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

We're to find the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2).

From earlier, nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

nSi_1 = nSi_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Now, I need to find (nH_1/nH_sun).

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can relate [Fe/H]_1 and [Fe/H]_2? No, because only Star_1's [Fe/H] is given.

Wait, maybe I can find nH_1 from the fact that [Fe/H]_1=0. So, nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun).

But I don't have any other constraints on nH_1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio (nH_1/nH_sun) is 1, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the hydrogen abundance in both stars is the same as the Sun, which would make nH_1 =nH_sun, and thus the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2 ) =10^{0.3} ≈2.

But that doesn't match any of the options given. The options are 3.9, 12.6, 0.8, 1.2.

Wait, 10^0.3 is approximately 2, but none of the options are 2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should revisit the earlier steps. Let me go through Star_1 again.

Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So,

nSi_1 =nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) → 

The nFe_sun cancels out:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So, (nSi_1 /nSi_sun) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Then, since nSi_2 =nSi_sun, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, I need to find (nH_1/nH_sun).

Wait, I'm stuck because I don't have any data that directly relates the hydrogen in Star_1 to the Sun. Unless I can find it through another way.

Wait, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) using the fact that Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0. But [Fe/H]_1 is about Fe relative to H, which is already given. So, nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

But without another relation, I can't find nH_1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the mass of the stars to their photospheric composition, but I'm not sure. The masses are given, but I don't see a direct link to the abundances.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach. Maybe the problem expects me to use the fact that [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun), and [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3}*(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But since nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun), substituting:

nSi_1 = [nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun)] *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → 

Simplify: nFe_sun cancels, so:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) = [ (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun ] / nSi_sun = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, if I can find (nH_1/nH_sun), I can find the ratio.

Wait, but how?

Hold on, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) from the fact that [Fe/H]_1 =0. But [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe/nH = same as in Sun → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

But without more data, I can't find the value of (nH_1/nH_sun).

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen is the same in both stars as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. But earlier, for Star_2, from [Mg/H]_2=0, we had nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun), and from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}, so nH_2 isn't the same as the Sun's. So that assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key piece of data. Let me think again about the problem.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not given. But perhaps I can compute it using the given data. Because the Sun's nFe and nMg are known relative to H.

Wait, but I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] and relate that to [Mg/Si]_2.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun → but that's not helpful. Wait, no, the [X/Y] notation is always log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun = [X/Y], which is the logarithm of the ratio of the star's X/Y to the Sun's X/Y.

Wait, so the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0. So, the Sun's own [Mg/Si] is zero.

But in Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → which means that in Star_2, Mg/Si is 10^{0.3} times higher than in the Sun.

Wait, that would be:

log( (nMg_2/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ) =0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But from [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

And from earlier, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, substituting into [Mg/Si]_2's equation:

(nMg_sun * nH_2/(nH_sun) ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But since nSi_2 =nSi_sun, this becomes:

nMg_sun *nH_2/(nH_sun *nSi_sun) ) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Cancel nMg_sun and nSi_sun from both sides:

nH_2/(nH_sun) ) =10^{0.3}.

Which is consistent with what we found earlier: nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

So, perhaps for Star_1, if I can find nH_1/nH_sun, I can proceed.

Wait, but how?

Maybe I can think about the mass of the stars. The masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. But I'm not sure how that relates to the photospheric composition. Unless it's a red giant or main sequence star, but the problem doesn't specify. So I think that's a dead end.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that the hydrogen abundance in both stars is the same as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. But earlier, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 led us to nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}, which contradicts this assumption. So that's not valid.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach the problem differently. Let's consider that the [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2 are both 0, so in Star 1, Fe is solar, and in Star 2, Mg is solar.

But how does that help me find the ratio of Si in the two stars?

Let me think about the problem again. The question is to find (nSi_1 /nSi_2).

From Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

In Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) ) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) → 

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So, (nSi_1 /nSi_sun) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Hmm, so I need to find (nH_1/nH_sun).

Wait, perhaps I can relate nH_1 to nH_2 through some other means. For example, perhaps the problem implies that both stars have the same hydrogen abundance, but I don't think that's stated.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't give enough data. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem gives the solar photospheric composition as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So,

log(nFe/nH)_sun =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

log(nMg/nH)_sun =7 -12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So, in the Sun, nFe =3.16e-5 *nH, and nMg=1e-5 *nH.

But I don't think that helps me find nSi_sun. Unless I can find [Mg/Si]_sun, but I don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I can compute [Mg/Si]_sun from the Sun's data. But without knowing nSi_sun, I can't directly compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps if I can find nSi_sun from the [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should make an assumption that the number density of hydrogen is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So, nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun.

If that's the case, then:

For Star_1:

(nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} → (1) *10^{0.3} ≈2.

But the options don't have 2. So, that can't be right.

Wait, but from Star_2's data, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

So, if Star_2's nH is higher than the Sun's, perhaps Star_1's nH is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the hydrogen abundance and just focus on the ratios. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio (nH_1/nH_sun) is 1, but that leads to a ratio of ~2, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

Wait, 10^{0.3} is approximately 2. So, if (nH_1/nH_sun) is 1, the ratio is 2, which isn't an option. But option D is 1.2. Hmm.

Wait, could there be a different approach?

Let me think about the problem from another angle.

In Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Substituting nMg_2:

log( (nMg_sun *nH_2 /nH_sun) /nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Which can be rewritten as log( (nH_2/nH_sun) ) + log( nMg_sun/nSi_2 ) ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) +0.3.

Subtracting log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) from both sides:

log(nH_2/nH_sun) + log( nMg_sun/nSi_2 ) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) ) =0.3.

Which is log(nH_2/nH_sun) + log( nSi_sun /nSi_2 ) =0.3.

So,

log(nH_2/nH_sun) + log( nSi_sun /nSi_2 ) =0.3.

Since log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), this becomes:

log( (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nSi_2) ) ) =0.3.

Taking 10^ on both sides:

(nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/nSi_2) )=10^{0.3} → 

So,

nSi_2 = nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) /10^{0.3}.

But earlier, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun. So,

nSi_sun =nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)/10^{0.3} → 

Divide both sides by nSi_sun (assuming it's non-zero):

1= (nH_2/nH_sun)/10^{0.3} → nH_2/nH_sun =10^{0.3} → 

Which is consistent with what we found earlier. So, that's correct.

But this doesn't help us find nH_1/nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can use Star_1's data to find the ratio. Let me try again.

In Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1)=log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So,

nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )

Which simplifies to:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So, (nSi_1/nSi_sun) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, (nSi_1/nSi_2 ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nSi_sun) ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that both stars have the same hydrogen abundance as the Sun. So, nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun.

In that case, (nH_1/nH_sun) =1. So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 =1 *10^{0.3} ≈ 2.

But this isn't one of the options. So, that must be incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the stars have the same H abundance as each other. So, nH_1 =nH_2.

From Star_2, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

So, if nH_1 =nH_2 → nH_1 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

Thus, (nH_1/nH_sun) =10^{0.3} → (nSi_1/nSi_2) =10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Which is option A (~3.9).

But wait, why would nH_1 =nH_2 unless stated? The problem doesn't say anything about the hydrogen abundance being the same in both stars. So, this is an assumption that may not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H abundance and only compute the ratio using the given abundances.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ratio [Si/Fe]_1 is relative to the Sun, and in Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1=0, the [Fe/H] is solar, so [Fe/H]=0. So, the metallicity for Fe is solar. But what about Si?

Wait, perhaps the way to proceed is to take the Sun's [Si/Fe], but I don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_1 in terms of other known ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi_1 in terms of nFe_sun and nH_1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, here's another approach. Let me express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Let me denote the Sun's abundances as S.

So, for any element X,

nX_sun = S_X * nH_sun.

In the Sun:

nFe_sun = S_Fe * nH_sun.

nMg_sun = S_Mg *nH_sun.

nSi_sun = S_Si *nH_sun.

But we don't know S_Si or S_Fe, but wait, the problem gives us the Sun's [Fe/H] as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12=-4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5 → so S_Fe =nFe_sun/nH_sun =1e-4.5.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun is 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=-5 → S_Mg=1e-5.

But we don't have S_Si. So, I can't compute nSi_2 in terms of S_Si because nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

Wait, but in Star_2:

nSi_2 =nSi_sun = S_Si *nH_sun.

In Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * S_Si *nH_sun.

So, (nSi_1/nSi_2) = [ (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * S_Si *nH_sun ] / [ S_Si *nH_sun ] → 

Simplifies to (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

So, same result as before.

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't find the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) using the [Fe/H]_1=0.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe_1 /nH_1 ) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

But again, this doesn't give me (nH_1/nH_sun) unless I can relate it to another abundance.

Wait, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) using the fact that Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0 and its [Si/Fe] is 0.3.

So,

nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (S_Si/S_Fe).

But S_Si/S_Fe is the Sun's [Si/Fe], which I don't know.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the Sun's [Si/Fe] from the given data. Since I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe], perhaps it's a known value, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero, but that's not correct. The solar [Si/Fe] is a positive value, I think.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the H ratios and only consider the [X/Fe] and [X/Y] ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number densities.

Let me try to model the problem using the given data.

In Star_1:

nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

nSi_1 =nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Which becomes:

nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}*(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → 

The nFe_sun cancels:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

In Star_2:

nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, the ratio is (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But without (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio is 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3}=10^{0.6}≈3.98, which is option A. But how did I get that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think again.

Wait, in Star_2, we found that nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

If I assume that nH_1 =nH_2, then:

nH_1/nH_sun =10^{0.3}.

Thus, (nSi_1/nSi_2 )=10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Which is option A (~3.9).

But why would nH_1 =nH_2? The problem doesn't state that. It's an assumption, but perhaps that's what is intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find that the ratio is 10^{0.3} =2, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the intended approach is to find that the ratio is 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6}.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to find the ratio as 10^{0.3} =2, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem's setup. Let me think about the given data again.

Given:

Star_1: [Si/Fe]=0.3, [Fe/H]=0.

Star_2: [Mg/Si]=0.3, [Mg/H]=0.

Solar data: [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe =1e-4.5 *nH.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun= -5 → nMg=1e-5 *nH.

But we don't have [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_1 in terms of [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3.

But nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

So,

log(nSi_1/(nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun))) ) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3.

Which can be written as:

log( (nSi_1 /nFe_sun) * (nH_sun/nH_1) ) ) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3.

This becomes:

log( (nSi_1/nFe_sun) ) - log(nH_1/nH_sun) ) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3.

Which is:

log(nSi_1/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) - log(nH_1/nH_sun) =0.3.

Which is:

[Si/Fe]_sun + [Fe/H]_1 - log(nH_1/nH_sun) =0.3.

But I'm not sure if this helps, as I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H]=0 implies that Fe is at solar abundance, but without knowing Si's abundance relative to Fe in the Sun, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe]_1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward, and I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is simply 10^{0.3} =2, but that's not an option. Or perhaps 10^{0.3} /10^{0.3} =1, but that's not correct either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try to compute the ratio again.

We have for Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

For Star_2:

nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the mass of the stars are given, but I don't see how that ties into the photospheric composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H abundance and just compute the ratio using the given [X/Fe] and [X/Y] values.

Wait, another approach: Let me model the abundances in terms of the Sun's.

In Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So,

nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Which simplifies to:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

So,

nSi_1/nSi_sun = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 →nMg_2 =nMg_sun *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nMg_sun) )? Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

So,

nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So,

(nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Cancel nMg_sun:

(nH_2/nH_sun) /nSi_2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Multiply both sides by nSi_2:

nH_2/nH_sun = (nSi_2/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But earlier, we found that nSi_2 =nSi_sun → nSi_2/nSi_sun=1.

So,

nH_2 =nH_sun *10^{0.3}.

Thus, (nH_2/nH_sun)=10^{0.3}.

Now, going back to Star_1:

nSi_1/nSi_sun = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_sun), I can't compute this ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the ratio (nH_1/nH_sun) is 1. So, (nH_1/nH_sun)=1 → nSi_1/nSi_sun =10^{0.3} → nSi_1/nSi_2 =10^{0.3} ≈2.

But the options don't have 2. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to find the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) as (10^{0.3})^2 =10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not sure why that would be the case. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_sun) from another relation.

Wait, in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

But I don't have any other data about Star_1's other elements, except [Si/Fe]_1=0.3.

So, I can't find (nH_1/nH_sun) from Star_1's data.

But perhaps if I can relate it to Star_2's data.

Wait, but I don't see a direct way to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio is 10^{0.3} =2, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of number densities relative to hydrogen.

In the Sun:

nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun is unknown.

In Star_1:

nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So,

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun)) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → 

Simplifies to:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

In Star_2:

nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3} → 

Which we have already established.

But without knowing nH_1, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio without considering the hydrogen ratios, assuming that both stars have the same hydrogen abundance as the Sun. So, nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun.

In that case:

For Star_1:

nSi_1 =1 *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun → nSi_1 =nSi_sun *2.

For Star_2:

nSi_2 =nSi_sun.

So, the ratio is 2, but that's not an option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H normalization and compute the ratio using only the given [X/Fe] and [X/Y] values.

Let me try that.

In Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

In Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^{0.3}*(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But Star_1 and Star_2 don't have overlapping elements, so perhaps it's impossible to find the ratio without more data.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate the two through the Sun's [Mg/Fe], but I don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the ratio as 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6}≈3.98, which is option A.

I think I'll go with that, even though I'm not entirely confident.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships provided in the problem.

### Key Data and Relationships:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si, sun}} / n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) + 0.3 \).
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{Si, sun}}) + 0.3 \).
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \).

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) = -4.5 \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) = -5 \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_2:
From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \).  
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{Si, sun}}) \).  
Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} \), we find \( n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} = 10^{0.3} \).  
Thus, \( n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{H, sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \).

#### For Star_1:
From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \).  
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,1}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si, sun}} / n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) \).  
Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} \), we get \( n_{\text{Si,1}} = (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si, sun}} \).

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio \( n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} \) is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{Si, sun}}} = (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit data about \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \). To proceed, we assume \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} = n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} = 10^{0.3} \). Substituting this:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot 10^{0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Calculation:
\( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), which corresponds to option **A (~3.9)**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A
