Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read through it again. 

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, both reactions give the same product but with different configurations, I think. Let me look again.

Wait no, the first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second is B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So each reaction is producing a different enantiomer of the same ketone.

Hmm, so the starting materials A and B must be related in a way that when they are reduced with different reagents, they produce the R and S configurations, respectively.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for carbonyl groups. BH3 is a milder one, perhaps used for ketones or aldehydes. Wait, but in this case, both reactions are reducing something to form a ketone, but the stereochemistry is different.

Wait, wait, maybe these reducing agents are being used in a specific type of reaction. Oh, perhaps these are reductions of epoxides or something else. Or maybe it's a reduction of a carbonyl group, but leading to a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is used in the reduction of esters, maybe. Oh, wait, another possibility: the starting material could be an ester, which upon reduction with BH3 or LiBH4 would form a diol or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, looking at the product, it's 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone. Pyranone structure. So 2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. So the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that maybe the starting material is a lactone or a different kind of carbonyl compound.

Wait, but how do the reducing agents come into play here? Let me think: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. For example, an ester R-O-CO-R' upon treatment with LiBH4 would become R-O-CH2-O-R', but wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone. No, the product is a cyclic ketone, so the starting material must have a different group.

Wait, another approach: The product is a pyranone. So it's a six-membered ring with one oxygen and a ketone. So the ring is similar to a tetrahydropyran, which is an oxygen-containing ring with five carbons and one oxygen. Wait, no, tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, making it a five-membered ring? No, wait, wait. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring with five carbons and one oxygen, and a ketone at position 2.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C - O - (CH2)3 - CH2 ?

No, perhaps more accurately, cyclohexenone analog. Hmm.

So after reduction, maybe the starting material is a ketone with some substituents that, when reduced, form the cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which upon reduction would form a diol. But that doesn't seem to fit with the product being a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Hmm, but then reduction of epoxides would lead to diols, not ketones.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, which when reduced would form a diol, but that doesn't seem right because the product is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, maybe this is about the reduction of an ester to a diol, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. BH3 is typically used for ketone reductions, but wait, no, BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, perhaps for alkene reductions. Wait, wait, no: BH3 is used in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but I might be mixing up different reactions.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's a cyclic hemiacetal that opens upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. Wait, no, when you reduce a ketal, you get a diol. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) and when reduced with LiBH4, it becomes a diol, but that doesn't directly give a ketone. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed by a ring-opening of an epoxide. But wait, if the product is a pyranone, then maybe the starting material is an epoxide that, when reduced, forms the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reduction leads to the formation of the ring by opening the epoxide.

Wait, another thought: The product is a tetrahydropyranone, so maybe the starting material is a dihydroxyketone that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, forms the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diketone, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the starting material has both a carbonyl group and an ether group, which upon reduction forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. So when an epoxide is treated with a reducing agent, it would open to form a diol. But how would that form the cyclic ketone? Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps it's about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but that doesn't form a ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic beta-keto ester. For example, something like a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction would form a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The numbering suggests that the ethyl group is at position 4, and the ketone is at position 2.

So perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group that, when reduced, forms the ring structure.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone, and the starting materials are esters or carbonyl compounds that, upon reduction, form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are acyclic carbonyl compounds (like ketones) that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, form the cyclic structure via some kind of cyclization.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enol ethers or something similar. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which upon reduction form the diol, but that doesn't directly form the product.

Wait, maybe the product is formed from a cyclic ether via ring-opening, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo various reactions, including the Robinson annulation, but I'm not sure how that would tie in here.

Wait, another angle: The problem is about the stereochemistry. The products are enantiomers—R and S. So the starting materials must have had stereogenic centers that, upon reduction, lead to these configurations.

Wait, but how do the reagents affect the stereochemistry? LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reaction mechanisms.

Wait, BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, where the boron adds to the less substituted end of an alkene, following anti-Markovnikov addition. But in this case, the product is a ketone, so maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Let's think: epoxides can be opened by nucleophilic attack. For example, BH3 could open an epoxide in a way that forms an alcohol, but I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol with specific stereochemistry, which then forms the ring.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look at the options and see what the starting materials are.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A and B are both (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Option B: Both are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Option C: A is (S), B is (R).

Option D: A is (R), B is (S).

Each starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different configurations at the chiral center.

So the starting materials are enantiomers of each other in options C and D, while options A and B have the same configuration.

Wait, wait, no: the options A and B have both A and B as same configuration. In C, A is S and B is R. In D, A is R and B is S.

So the starting materials are either same enantiomers (A and B same), or opposite (A and B opposite).

So the question is, when each is treated with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively, they form R and S products.

Wait, but how does the configuration of the starting material affect the product's configuration when reduced?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol or an alcohol that cyclizes into the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, let's think: a beta-keto ester has the structure RCO-COOR'. Upon reduction with a strong agent like LiBH4, it could reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, giving RCH(OH)-COOR'. But how would that form the cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo conjugate additions or reductions.

Wait, but perhaps the starting material is a cyclic beta-keto ester, like a five-membered ring, which upon reduction would form a diol that rings into a six-membered ring. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then forms the pyranone via cyclization.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce esters to alcohols. So if the starting material is an ester, maybe (COOR) group, then LiBH4 would reduce it to CH2OH.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe the starting material is an acyclic ketone with some substituents, and upon reduction, it forms the cyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reduction leads to the formation of the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an epoxide group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry and how the reduction leads to the R and S configurations.

The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one when reduced with LiBH4, and (S) when reduced with BH3.

Wait, but which reagent is which. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing esters, amides, ketones, etc., to their respective alcohols. BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, typically for adding across alkenes in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov orientation.

Wait a minute, perhaps the starting materials have an epoxide group. Because LiBH4 can open epoxides. Let me think: when an epoxide is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, the oxygen is reduced, and the ring opens. But I'm not sure if that would form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent epoxide. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, but how does that form the cyclic ketone?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a dihydroxy ketone, which upon treatment with acid forms the cyclic hemiacetal (the pyranone). But that doesn't involve the reducing agents.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Looking at the options, both A and B are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 has an isobutoxy (O-C(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone (oxo) group. Position 3 has an ethyl group.

So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-C(O)O-CH2-CH2-COOH?

Wait, no, wait: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So position 3 is the third carbon from the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH?

Hmm, not quite. Let me draw it:

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but substituents are at C3 and C5.

At C3: ethyl group.

At C5: isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone group (oxo).

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(ethyl)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2?

Wait, no, because pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So substituting at C3 (the third carbon from COOH) would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2?

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because position 5 would be the fifth carbon. Wait, wait, the compound is pentanoic acid, which is five carbons in total, with COOH at one end. So numbering from the COOH group as 1:

1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

So 3-ethyl would be an ethyl group on C3, and 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo would be on C5.

Wait, but C5 is the last carbon before the COOH? No, wait, in pentanoic acid, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So number 1 is the COOH, then CH2 (number 2), CH2 (3), CH2 (4), CH3 (5). So substituting on C3 would be the third carbon from the COOH.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2?

Wait, but that would mean that C5 is the last carbon, but in pentanoic acid, that's just a methyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2-CH(CH2CH3)

No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think in terms of the reaction.

When the starting material is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it forms (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Assuming that LiBH4 is a reducing agent, perhaps it's reducing an ester group to an alcohol. Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which cyclizes to form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Let's consider that.

A beta-keto ester has the structure R-CO-COOR'. Upon treatment with LiBH4, the ester group (COOR') is reduced to CH2OH, and the ketone (CO) is also reduced to CH2OH? Hmm, no, that might not lead to the product.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the starting material is an ester which, when reduced, forms a diol, and then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone. For example, a diol could form a hemiacetal, which upon dehydration becomes a ketone.

Wait, but in that case, the diol would need to have adjacent hydroxyl groups to form the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material, upon reduction, forms a diol which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the stereochemistry. The product has an R configuration, and the other has S. So the starting materials must have had a chiral center that, upon reduction, leads to the opposite configuration in the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So when one is reduced with LiBH4, it gives R, and when the other is reduced with BH3, it gives S.

Wait, that would suggest that the starting materials are enantiomers, which would correspond to options C and D.

Wait, looking at the options, C is A=S, B=R, and D is A=R, B=S.

Now, the reagents used are LiBH4 and BH3. How do these affect the stereochemistry?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and in some reductions, like of ketones, it can lead to racemization. But in this case, perhaps the reduction is stereoselective.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal, and the reduction leads to the formation of an alcohol with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material was a diketone or a beta-keto ester that upon reduction forms the ring.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the options again. The starting materials in all options are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So when A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it forms (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

When B is treated with BH3 and H+, it forms (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone. But the stereochemistry would depend on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

Wait, another thought: In the presence of a strong reducing agent like LiBH4, the reduction of a ketone would lead to an alcohol. But the product is a ketone, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an adjacent ketone. When reduced, it opens up to form a diol, which then rearranges into the cyclic ketone product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to form a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me try to imagine the structure.

Suppose the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the necessary functional groups for cyclization into the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that can cyclize to form the pyranone. The configuration of the starting material would dictate the configuration of the product.

Assuming that the starting material has a chiral center, the configuration of that center would influence the product's configuration upon reduction.

So, the starting material is (R) or (S) configuration. When reduced, the stereochemistry would be determined based on the reducing agent's mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents (LiBH4 vs BH3) have different selectivities for the stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanisms here. Another approach: think about the product's configuration and the starting material's configuration.

If the starting material A is R and produces R product, then perhaps the configuration is retained. Similarly, if starting material B is S and produces S product, perhaps it's the same.

Wait, but in the problem, the product from A is R, and from B is S.

Looking at the options, options D and C have A and B as R and S respectively.

So perhaps when starting material A (R configuration) is treated with LiBH4, it produces R product, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it produces S product.

Wait, but why would different reagents lead to different configurations from enantiomeric starting materials?

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents affect the stereochemistry. For example, LiBH4 may reduce a carbonyl group with a certain stereochemistry, leading to the R product, and BH3 leads to S.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Another angle: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal which upon treatment with the reducing agent forms the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms a chiral center with a specific configuration based on the reagent.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester with a chiral center, and the reduction leads to a secondary alcohol with the opposite configuration, which then forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I don't have enough information to make that determination.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the formation of the pyranone via a Claisen-like rearrangement or some similar reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's about the reduction of an ester to a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone with ethyl substituents. The starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with ethyl and isobutoxy groups.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is converted into a diol upon reduction, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. The configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the diol, which would then influence the configuration of the product.

So, perhaps the starting material's configuration (R or S) determines the diol's configuration, which in turn determines the product's configuration.

If the starting material is (R), then after reduction, the diol would have a certain configuration leading to the (R) product. Similarly, (S) starting material would lead to (S) product.

Now, considering the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it's used for a more extensive reduction, while BH3 is used for a different type, maybe leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact stereochemical outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether (epoxide) with a substituent, and the reduction leads to specific diastereomers.

Wait, but I'm still not getting it. Let me think about the options again.

Option D says A is R and B is S. So treating R with LiBH4 gives R product, and S with BH3 gives S product.

Option C is A is S, B is R.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D, where A is R and B is S.

But why? Because the reagent affects the stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the reductants determine the face of the carbonyl group that the hydride attacks. For example, in a ketone, the hydride could attack from either face, leading to R or S configuration.

If the starting material's configuration determines the approach of the hydride, then the reagent's strength might influence the outcome.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to cause complete reduction, perhaps leading to retention of configuration, whereas BH3 might lead to some inversion.

Alternatively, maybe the stereochemistry is determined by the configuration of the starting material. For example, if the starting material is R, the reduction leads to R product, and if it's S, the product is S.

So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, product is R. B is S, treated with BH3, product is S.

That would correspond to option D: A is R, B is S.

So the correct answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, differing in their stereochemistry at the chiral center.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Products**:
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce esters or carbonyl groups to alcohols.
   - BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions but can also reduce carbonyl groups.
   - The products are enantiomers, indicating that the stereochemistry of the starting materials determines the configuration of the products.

2. **Starting Materials**:
   - The starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The stereochemistry at the chiral center (R or S) in the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Reaction Outcomes**:
   - When the starting material with the (R) configuration is treated with LiBH4, it produces the (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one product.
   - When the starting material with the (S) configuration is treated with BH3, it produces the (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one product.

4. **Options**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is incorrect because the starting materials must be enantiomers to produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is incorrect because the stereochemistry of the starting materials does not align with the product configurations.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is correct because the (R) starting material with LiBH4 produces the (R) product, and the (S) starting material with BH3 produces the (S) product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for reaction A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for reaction B, corresponding to **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read through it again. 

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, both reactions give the same product but with different configurations, I think. Let me look again.

Wait no, the first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second is B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So each reaction is producing a different enantiomer of the same ketone.

Hmm, so the starting materials A and B must be related in a way that when they are reduced with different reagents, they produce the R and S configurations, respectively.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for carbonyl groups. BH3 is a milder one, perhaps used for ketones or aldehydes. Wait, but in this case, both reactions are reducing something to form a ketone, but the stereochemistry is different.

Wait, wait, maybe these reducing agents are being used in a specific type of reaction. Oh, perhaps these are reductions of epoxides or something else. Or maybe it's a reduction of a carbonyl group, but leading to a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is used in the reduction of esters, maybe. Oh, wait, another possibility: the starting material could be an ester, which upon reduction with BH3 or LiBH4 would form a diol or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, looking at the product, it's 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone. Pyranone structure. So 2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. So the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that maybe the starting material is a lactone or a different kind of carbonyl compound.

Wait, but how do the reducing agents come into play here? Let me think: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. For example, an ester R-O-CO-R' upon treatment with LiBH4 would become R-O-CH2-O-R', but wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone. No, the product is a cyclic ketone, so the starting material must have a different group.

Wait, another approach: The product is a pyranone. So it's a six-membered ring with one oxygen and a ketone. So the ring is similar to a tetrahydropyran, which is an oxygen-containing ring with five carbons and one oxygen. Wait, no, tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, making it a five-membered ring? No, wait, wait. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring with five carbons and one oxygen, and a ketone at position 2.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C - O - (CH2)3 - CH2 ?

No, perhaps more accurately, cyclohexenone analog. Hmm.

So after reduction, maybe the starting material is a ketone with some substituents that, when reduced, form the cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which upon reduction would form a diol. But that doesn't seem to fit with the product being a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Hmm, but then reduction of epoxides would lead to diols, not ketones.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, which when reduced would form a diol, but that doesn't seem right because the product is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, maybe this is about the reduction of an ester to a diol, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. BH3 is typically used for ketone reductions, but wait, no, BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, perhaps for alkene reductions. Wait, wait, no: BH3 is used in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but I might be mixing up different reactions.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's a cyclic hemiacetal that opens upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. Wait, no, when you reduce a ketal, you get a diol. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) and when reduced with LiBH4, it becomes a diol, but that doesn't directly give a ketone. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed by a ring-opening of an epoxide. But wait, if the product is a pyranone, then maybe the starting material is an epoxide that, when reduced, forms the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reduction leads to the formation of the ring by opening the epoxide.

Wait, another thought: The product is a tetrahydropyranone, so maybe the starting material is a dihydroxyketone that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, forms the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diketone, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the starting material has both a carbonyl group and an ether group, which upon reduction forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. So when an epoxide is treated with a reducing agent, it would open to form a diol. But how would that form the cyclic ketone? Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps it's about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but that doesn't form a ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic beta-keto ester. For example, something like a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction would form a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The numbering suggests that the ethyl group is at position 4, and the ketone is at position 2.

So perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group that, when reduced, forms the ring structure.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone, and the starting materials are esters or carbonyl compounds that, upon reduction, form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are acyclic carbonyl compounds (like ketones) that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, form the cyclic structure via some kind of cyclization.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enol ethers or something similar. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which upon reduction form the diol, but that doesn't directly form the product.

Wait, maybe the product is formed from a cyclic ether via ring-opening, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo various reactions, including the Robinson annulation, but I'm not sure how that would tie in here.

Wait, another angle: The problem is about the stereochemistry. The products are enantiomers—R and S. So the starting materials must have had stereogenic centers that, upon reduction, lead to these configurations.

Wait, but how do the reagents affect the stereochemistry? LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reaction mechanisms.

Wait, BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, where the boron adds to the less substituted end of an alkene, following anti-Markovnikov addition. But in this case, the product is a ketone, so maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Let's think: epoxides can be opened by nucleophilic attack. For example, BH3 could open an epoxide in a way that forms an alcohol, but I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol with specific stereochemistry, which then forms the ring.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look at the options and see what the starting materials are.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A and B are both (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Option B: Both are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Option C: A is (S), B is (R).

Option D: A is (R), B is (S).

Each starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different configurations at the chiral center.

So the starting materials are enantiomers of each other in options C and D, while options A and B have the same configuration.

Wait, wait, no: the options A and B have both A and B as same configuration. In C, A is S and B is R. In D, A is R and B is S.

So the starting materials are either same enantiomers (A and B same), or opposite (A and B opposite).

So the question is, when each is treated with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively, they form R and S products.

Wait, but how does the configuration of the starting material affect the product's configuration when reduced?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol or an alcohol that cyclizes into the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, let's think: a beta-keto ester has the structure RCO-COOR'. Upon reduction with a strong agent like LiBH4, it could reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, giving RCH(OH)-COOR'. But how would that form the cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo conjugate additions or reductions.

Wait, but perhaps the starting material is a cyclic beta-keto ester, like a five-membered ring, which upon reduction would form a diol that rings into a six-membered ring. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then forms the pyranone via cyclization.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce esters to alcohols. So if the starting material is an ester, maybe (COOR) group, then LiBH4 would reduce it to CH2OH.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe the starting material is an acyclic ketone with some substituents, and upon reduction, it forms the cyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reduction leads to the formation of the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an epoxide group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry and how the reduction leads to the R and S configurations.

The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one when reduced with LiBH4, and (S) when reduced with BH3.

Wait, but which reagent is which. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing esters, amides, ketones, etc., to their respective alcohols. BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, typically for adding across alkenes in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov orientation.

Wait a minute, perhaps the starting materials have an epoxide group. Because LiBH4 can open epoxides. Let me think: when an epoxide is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, the oxygen is reduced, and the ring opens. But I'm not sure if that would form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent epoxide. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, but how does that form the cyclic ketone?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a dihydroxy ketone, which upon treatment with acid forms the cyclic hemiacetal (the pyranone). But that doesn't involve the reducing agents.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Looking at the options, both A and B are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 has an isobutoxy (O-C(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone (oxo) group. Position 3 has an ethyl group.

So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-C(O)O-CH2-CH2-COOH?

Wait, no, wait: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So position 3 is the third carbon from the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH?

Hmm, not quite. Let me draw it:

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but substituents are at C3 and C5.

At C3: ethyl group.

At C5: isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone group (oxo).

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(ethyl)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2?

Wait, no, because pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So substituting at C3 (the third carbon from COOH) would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2?

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because position 5 would be the fifth carbon. Wait, wait, the compound is pentanoic acid, which is five carbons in total, with COOH at one end. So numbering from the COOH group as 1:

1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

So 3-ethyl would be an ethyl group on C3, and 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo would be on C5.

Wait, but C5 is the last carbon before the COOH? No, wait, in pentanoic acid, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So number 1 is the COOH, then CH2 (number 2), CH2 (3), CH2 (4), CH3 (5). So substituting on C3 would be the third carbon from the COOH.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2?

Wait, but that would mean that C5 is the last carbon, but in pentanoic acid, that's just a methyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2-CH(CH2CH3)

No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think in terms of the reaction.

When the starting material is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it forms (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Assuming that LiBH4 is a reducing agent, perhaps it's reducing an ester group to an alcohol. Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which cyclizes to form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Let's consider that.

A beta-keto ester has the structure R-CO-COOR'. Upon treatment with LiBH4, the ester group (COOR') is reduced to CH2OH, and the ketone (CO) is also reduced to CH2OH? Hmm, no, that might not lead to the product.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the starting material is an ester which, when reduced, forms a diol, and then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone. For example, a diol could form a hemiacetal, which upon dehydration becomes a ketone.

Wait, but in that case, the diol would need to have adjacent hydroxyl groups to form the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material, upon reduction, forms a diol which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the stereochemistry. The product has an R configuration, and the other has S. So the starting materials must have had a chiral center that, upon reduction, leads to the opposite configuration in the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So when one is reduced with LiBH4, it gives R, and when the other is reduced with BH3, it gives S.

Wait, that would suggest that the starting materials are enantiomers, which would correspond to options C and D.

Wait, looking at the options, C is A=S, B=R, and D is A=R, B=S.

Now, the reagents used are LiBH4 and BH3. How do these affect the stereochemistry?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and in some reductions, like of ketones, it can lead to racemization. But in this case, perhaps the reduction is stereoselective.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal, and the reduction leads to the formation of an alcohol with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material was a diketone or a beta-keto ester that upon reduction forms the ring.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the options again. The starting materials in all options are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So when A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it forms (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

When B is treated with BH3 and H+, it forms (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone. But the stereochemistry would depend on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

Wait, another thought: In the presence of a strong reducing agent like LiBH4, the reduction of a ketone would lead to an alcohol. But the product is a ketone, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an adjacent ketone. When reduced, it opens up to form a diol, which then rearranges into the cyclic ketone product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to form a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me try to imagine the structure.

Suppose the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the necessary functional groups for cyclization into the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that can cyclize to form the pyranone. The configuration of the starting material would dictate the configuration of the product.

Assuming that the starting material has a chiral center, the configuration of that center would influence the product's configuration upon reduction.

So, the starting material is (R) or (S) configuration. When reduced, the stereochemistry would be determined based on the reducing agent's mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents (LiBH4 vs BH3) have different selectivities for the stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanisms here. Another approach: think about the product's configuration and the starting material's configuration.

If the starting material A is R and produces R product, then perhaps the configuration is retained. Similarly, if starting material B is S and produces S product, perhaps it's the same.

Wait, but in the problem, the product from A is R, and from B is S.

Looking at the options, options D and C have A and B as R and S respectively.

So perhaps when starting material A (R configuration) is treated with LiBH4, it produces R product, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it produces S product.

Wait, but why would different reagents lead to different configurations from enantiomeric starting materials?

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents affect the stereochemistry. For example, LiBH4 may reduce a carbonyl group with a certain stereochemistry, leading to the R product, and BH3 leads to S.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Another angle: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal which upon treatment with the reducing agent forms the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms a chiral center with a specific configuration based on the reagent.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester with a chiral center, and the reduction leads to a secondary alcohol with the opposite configuration, which then forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I don't have enough information to make that determination.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the formation of the pyranone via a Claisen-like rearrangement or some similar reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's about the reduction of an ester to a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone with ethyl substituents. The starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with ethyl and isobutoxy groups.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is converted into a diol upon reduction, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. The configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the diol, which would then influence the configuration of the product.

So, perhaps the starting material's configuration (R or S) determines the diol's configuration, which in turn determines the product's configuration.

If the starting material is (R), then after reduction, the diol would have a certain configuration leading to the (R) product. Similarly, (S) starting material would lead to (S) product.

Now, considering the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it's used for a more extensive reduction, while BH3 is used for a different type, maybe leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact stereochemical outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether (epoxide) with a substituent, and the reduction leads to specific diastereomers.

Wait, but I'm still not getting it. Let me think about the options again.

Option D says A is R and B is S. So treating R with LiBH4 gives R product, and S with BH3 gives S product.

Option C is A is S, B is R.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D, where A is R and B is S.

But why? Because the reagent affects the stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the reductants determine the face of the carbonyl group that the hydride attacks. For example, in a ketone, the hydride could attack from either face, leading to R or S configuration.

If the starting material's configuration determines the approach of the hydride, then the reagent's strength might influence the outcome.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to cause complete reduction, perhaps leading to retention of configuration, whereas BH3 might lead to some inversion.

Alternatively, maybe the stereochemistry is determined by the configuration of the starting material. For example, if the starting material is R, the reduction leads to R product, and if it's S, the product is S.

So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, product is R. B is S, treated with BH3, product is S.

That would correspond to option D: A is R, B is S.

So the correct answer would be D.


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, differing in their stereochemistry at the chiral center.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Products**:
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce esters or carbonyl groups to alcohols.
   - BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions but can also reduce carbonyl groups.
   - The products are enantiomers, indicating that the stereochemistry of the starting materials determines the configuration of the products.

2. **Starting Materials**:
   - The starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The stereochemistry at the chiral center (R or S) in the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Reaction Outcomes**:
   - When the starting material with the (R) configuration is treated with LiBH4, it produces the (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one product.
   - When the starting material with the (S) configuration is treated with BH3, it produces the (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one product.

4. **Options**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is incorrect because the starting materials must be enantiomers to produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is incorrect because the stereochemistry of the starting materials does not align with the product configurations.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is correct because the (R) starting material with LiBH4 produces the (R) product, and the (S) starting material with BH3 produces the (S) product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for reaction A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for reaction B, corresponding to **Option D**.

Answer: D
