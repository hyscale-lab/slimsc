Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, right. So the question is asking two things: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with a value for v_rel and E.

First, I should think about the relative velocity. I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic addition formula. Oh yeah, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no wait. Wait, the formula for relative velocity depends on the frame you're looking from. Let me get this straight.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's velocity? Or vice versa? Wait, the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other. So relative velocity formula: (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u is the velocity of one object relative to the other. Hmm. Let me think. If object 1 is moving at u relative to a rest frame, and object 2 is moving at v relative to the same frame, then the velocity of object 2 as seen from object 1 is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/(c²))?

Wait, let me calculate that. 0.5c minus 0.6c is -0.1c. The denominator would be 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity would be (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. Since speed can't be negative, the magnitude is 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that would narrow it down to those.

Next, the total energy of the system. Total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Oh right, the relativistic energy is gamma * m c². So for each astronaut, I need to calculate their gamma factor.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):
Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². So that's approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. So that matches both the relative speed and the total energy. Option D has E=5 mc², which is less than our calculation. So option C is the correct choice.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me re-calculate the gammas.

First astronaut: v=0.6c. v² = 0.36 c². 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so gamma =1/0.8=1.25 correct. Energy: 1.25 *2m c²=2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. v²=0.25 c². 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=approx 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660≈1.1547. So 1.1547 *3m c²= approx 3.4641 mc².

Sum: 2.5 +3.4641=5.9641 mc² ≈5.96 mc². So yes, that matches option C.

Another thing to check: when adding velocities relativistically, did I do it correctly? Let me see. So the formula is (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/c² ). Wait, I think I might have mixed up the order. Because in the scenario, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 -0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So option C is the correct one.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m, v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m, v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m, v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m, v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:
