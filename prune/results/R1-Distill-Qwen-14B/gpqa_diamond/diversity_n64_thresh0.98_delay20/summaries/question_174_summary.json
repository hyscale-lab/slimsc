The more massive fragment has twice the rest mass of the less massive one, and the total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., 297 GeV. The mass defect of 3 GeV is converted into the total kinetic energy of the two fragments. The task is to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy \\( T_1 \\) of the more massive fragment and the kinetic energy calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Rest Masses of Fragments**:\n   - Let \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) be the rest masses of the two fragments, with \\( m_1 = 2m_2 \\).\n   - Since \\( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \\), substituting \\( m_1 = 2m_2 \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M, \\quad m_1 = 0.66M.\n     \\]\n   - In terms of energy, \\( m_1c^2 = 198 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( m_2c^2 = 99 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).\n\n2. **Total Kinetic Energy**:\n   - The total kinetic energy of the two fragments is equal to the mass defect:\n     \\[\n     K_1 + K_2 = 3 \\, \\text{GeV}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**:\n   - Using conservation of momentum and energy in the non-relativistic case:\n     \\[\n     m_1v_1 = m_2v_2 \\implies v_2 = 2v_1,\n     \\]\n     and\n     \\[\n     K_1 + K_2 = \\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2 = 3 \\, \\text{GeV}.\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( m_1 = 2m_2 \\) and \\( v_2 = 2v_1 \\), the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:\n     \\[\n     K_1 = \\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 = 1 \\, \\text{GeV}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Relativistic Calculation**:\n   - Using relativistic conservation of momentum and energy, the relativistic gamma factors for the two fragments are determined:\n     \\[\n     \\gamma_1 = 1.005, \\quad \\gamma_2 = 1.0203.\n     \\]\n   - The relativistic kinetic energies are:\n     \\[\n     K_1 = (\\gamma_1 - 1)m_1c^2 = 0.99 \\, \\text{GeV}, \\quad K_2 = (\\gamma_2 - 1)m_2c^2 \\approx 2.01 \\, \\text{GeV}.\n     \\]\n   - The sum \\( K_1 + K_2 \\approx 3 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) is consistent with the total energy conservation.\n\n5. **Difference Between Relativistic and Classical \\( T_1 \\)**:\n   - The classical value of \\( T_1 \\) is \\( 1 \\, \\text{GeV} \\), while the relativistic value is \\( 0.99 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).\n   - The difference is:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta T_1 = 1 \\, \\text{GeV} - 0.99 \\, \\text{GeV} = 0.01 \\, \\text{GeV} = 10 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe difference between the correct \\( T_1 \\) and the classical \\( T_1 \\) is **10 MeV**.\n\nANSWER: C"
