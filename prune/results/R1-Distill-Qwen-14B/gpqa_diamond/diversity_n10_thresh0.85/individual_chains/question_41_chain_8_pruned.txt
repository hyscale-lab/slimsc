Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic effects, but let me start by recalling what I know.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the beam. So the light is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.

Wait, noâ€” the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is going, say, to the right, and the glass is moving to the right (same direction as the beam), but it's also moving toward the observer. Hmm, that's a bit contradictory. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Oh, maybe the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam (so towards the observer), and with velocity v.

So the setup is: in the lab frame, a glass slab (or a medium) moving with velocity v towards the observer. The light beam is propagating through this glass, in
