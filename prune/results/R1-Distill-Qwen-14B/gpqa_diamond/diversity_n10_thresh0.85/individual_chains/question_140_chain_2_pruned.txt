Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and break it down.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. When I look at the properties, gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Oh, right! Because the number of neutrons plus protons equals the mass number, and if they're equal, the molecule is probably something like H2O or CO2? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think. The same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. So for each molecule, neutrons = protons. So, the atomic number (protons) equals the number of neutrons. So, for example, if a molecule is made of one atom with Z=15 and N=15, that would be phosphorus-30, but since it's a gas, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another approach. If the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons per molecule. Suppose it's a diatomic gas. Let's see: For example, O2. Oxygen has 8 protons. If the molecule has 8 protons and 8 neutrons each, that would make each O atom O-16. Because 8 protons and 8 neutrons sum to 16. So O2 would have 16 neutrons and 16 protons in total? Wait, no. Wait, each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 2*(8+8) = 32 neutrons and protons in total? No, wait, for each molecule, the total number of protons and neutrons would be 2*(8) protons and 2*(8) neutrons. So each molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So protons equal neutrons. So that fits. That's a possibility. So gas W could be O2.

Alternatively, what about something else. Let's think of H2O. Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons (if it's H-1). Each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So H2O has 2 protons (from H) + 8 (O) = 10 protons. And 0 (H) + 8 (O) = 8 neutrons. So protons (10) don't equal neutrons (8). So that's not it.

What about CO2? C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 8*2 = 22 as well. Oh! So each molecule would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons, so protons equal neutrons. That's another possibility. So CO2 could be gas W.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, but under standard conditions, it's a gas? Wait, CO2 is a gas at room temperature, but sometimes it's a liquid or solid depending on pressure and temperature. Hmm, but the question says
