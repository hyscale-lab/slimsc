Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is present. The given concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are from A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so the reaction tends to go to the product side.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, I think this is the concentration of the complex at equilibrium. I'm trying to recall the formula for the formation constant. I think it's K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh right, the formation constant is for the formation of the complex from the ions. So, K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this solution, the only source of calcium and EDTA is the complex itself. So, if the complex dissociates, it will produce Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. So, assuming that all the EDTA and calcium in solution comes from the dissociation of the complex.

Let me think, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's say the complex dissociates a little bit, so [CaEDTA^2-] decreases, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] increase by x each. Wait, but maybe I can make an assumption here. Since K is a large number (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the dissociation might be minimal. But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So, perhaps the concentration of the complex is much larger than the individual ions.

Wait, no. Wait, in this scenario, the complex is the major species. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are much lower. So, if we let the concentration of the complex be C, which is 0.02 M, then the dissociation would be:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

So, the formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) ) = 5e10.

But wait, when the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would both be x, assuming that each dissociation gives one ion each. So, [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x. And [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 - x
