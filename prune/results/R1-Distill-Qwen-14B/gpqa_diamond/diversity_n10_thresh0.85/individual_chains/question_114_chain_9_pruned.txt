Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses the product from the first reaction (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile) with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think about what each reaction involves.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So, probably, the CN- is adding to the carbonyl group.

But wait, in the product, we have 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure to visualize:

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When CN- adds, it would add to the carbonyl carbon. So the product after addition would have a cyanide group and an alcohol group. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that.

The structure would be NC-C(C)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, but butanenitrile would have four carbons. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)(OH)-CN? No, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, no, butanenitrile is NC-CH2CH2CH2CH3. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is: NC-CH(C)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps it's:

The molecule is (CH2CH2CH2CN) with a hydroxyl and methyl group on the second carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN-CH2CH3? No, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When CN- adds, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I should think about the mechanism.

Wait, the addition of CN- to a ketone. Normally, the mechanism is that the nucleophile (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, the oxygen picks up a proton. Wait, but in the presence of something else, like an acid or a base.

But the product here is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. So, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition followed by a protonation. Wait, but how does that lead to the product?

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is an example of the Stephen reduction, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, Stephen reduction uses different reagents like NaCN and HCl, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the ketone is treated with a cyanide ion, it'll add to the carbonyl, giving a cyanohydrin. Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation reaction. That's when a nucleophile (like CN-) adds to a carbonyl group to form a cyanohydrin. The product is a vicinal diol? Wait, no, the cyanohydrin would have an alcohol and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, no, but butanenitrile would have four carbons. Wait, (CH3)2C(OH)CN is actually 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, right? Because the chain is three carbons: the central C is connected to two CH3 groups, OH, and CN.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the nomenclature wrong. Let me think again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would imply a four-carbon chain with the nitrile at the end. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH(C)(OH)CN? Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH(C)(OH)CH2CN? No, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe the product is CH2-C(C)(OH)-CH2-CN, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. So, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile at the end. So, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CN. So, butanenitrile is NC-CH2CH2CH2CH3. The product in question is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitr
