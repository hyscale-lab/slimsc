Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let me think through this.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms in the photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait, no, actually, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the excitation is higher there. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Both photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here. Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. It says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states is proportional to the Boltzmann factor of the energy difference divided by the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i is the number in the higher energy state, and n_j in the lower. So if the energy levels are E_2 and E_1, with E_2 > E_1, the ratio would be n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, wait. But in this problem, in star_1, the excitation is higher. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower would be higher in star_1 than in star_2.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the ratio of excitation (n_upper) to the lower state (n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2)/(n_lower2).

But wait, the question says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me double-check. Oh, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given. So E is fixed for both stars, right? Because it's the same transition in iron.

So E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's call the energy difference E = E_upper - E_lower.

So for each star, the ratio is:

n_upper/n_lower = exp( -E/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait. The
