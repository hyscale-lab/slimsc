Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it says. The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps to form product 3. Then, we need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, let me break down each step to understand what's happening.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with excess KOH, giving product 1. The product is a light yellow solid. The NMR data includes signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Also, there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. 

Hmm, what's a common reaction when dibromide reacts with KOH? Oh right, dehydrohalogenation, which is an elimination reaction. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... so with two bromines in positions 1 and 3. Heating with a strong base like KOH would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Wait, but in adamantane, the structure is pretty rigid. So, if you eliminate two HBr molecules, you might get a diene? Or maybe a more substituted double bond.

But wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it could undergo a double elimination to form an allene. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a cyclopropane? Wait, no, cyclopropane usually comes from adjacent bromines. In 1,3 positions, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2, but not sure.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe product 1 isn't an alkene but something else. Hmm, so what else could happen? Oh, perhaps it's an epoxide? But wait, wait, KOH is a base but not typically used for epoxidation. Alternatively, maybe a ketone is formed. But wait, how?

Wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane might undergo a double elimination to form a ketone. Because when two adjacent bromides are present, but in 1,3 positions, elimination would form a double bond, but maybe the structure is such that it forms a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Wait, no. Let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on opposite ends of the structure.

Another thought: perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an enolate, but wait, that's more for ketones. Alternatively, maybe the dibromide undergoes a double E2 elimination, forming an alkene and releasing 2 HBr. But where would the double bond form?

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm peak is a doublet of 2H. That could be an -OCH2- group. But wait, in the reaction with KOH, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. If the bromides are in positions where they can be attacked by hydroxide, perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane in KOH... another possibility is that it's a double substitution. So each Br is replaced by OH, giving 1,3-diol. But then the NMR would show OH protons, which usually don't appear in the spectrum because they exchange with the solvent. However, the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, not an -OH. So maybe it's not a diol.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but forming a ketone. Oh! Wait, if the compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination to form a ketone. For example, in pinacol-like elimination, but that's typically for vicinal diols. Alternatively, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation leading to an enone.

Wait, but pinacol rearrangement requires diol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzil-type elimination. Wait, benzil is 1,2-diketone, but maybe that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, considering the NMR data: a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a deshielded proton. Maybe it's an ether, like OCH2. But then, another thought: maybe the product is an epoxide. But in that case, the protons adjacent to oxygen would be around 3.5-4.5 ppm, maybe as a triplet or quartet, depending on substitution.

Wait, but then the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is more indicative of a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a ketone. How could that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Maybe via elimination, but how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is adjacent to a CH2 group, and elimination leads to a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination usually forms double bonds, not carbonyls. Unless it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, another angle: the initial product (product 1) has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which indicates a carbonyl, so it's likely a ketone or an ester or an aldehyde. But the NMR
