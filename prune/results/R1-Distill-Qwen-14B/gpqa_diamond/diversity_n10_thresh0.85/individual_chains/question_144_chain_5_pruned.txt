Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

Right, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh wait, because particles moving faster will travel further before decaying. So first, I need to find the lifetime, then calculate how far it travels given its velocity.

Wait, but how do I find the lifetime? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The width is the total decay width, which gives the inverse of the mean lifetime. The formula I think is Γ = ħ / τ. Or wait, no, Γ is the energy width, and τ is the lifetime. So τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Wait, let me get that straight.

The total decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ/(Γ). Because Γ is the width, which is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the time uncertainty. From the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE is Γ (since it's the energy width), so Γ * τ ≈ ħ/2. So τ ≈ ħ/(2Γ). Hmm, but sometimes people approximate τ ≈ ħ/Γ. Wait, I might need to double-check that.

But maybe in particle physics, they often use τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Because Γ is the total decay rate, which is the width, and the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. So I think τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, let me make sure. The relation between decay width and lifetime is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yes, that makes sense because the units would work out. Γ is in energy units (MeV), ħ is in energy*time units (like GeV·s), so ħ/Γ has units of time.

So first, I need to compute the lifetime τ. Then, I need to find the speed of the
