Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given from A to D.

Hmm, okay, so first I think I need to figure out what's happening in each part of the process. Let me break it down.

First, diluting the acetic acid. I remember that diluting a solution changes its concentration. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) and the initial concentration is 0.05 M. When we add another 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). So I can calculate the new concentration after dilution using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me compute that: (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Oh wait, 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Adding 20 cm³ of water makes the volume 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So moles remain the same, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that seems correct.

So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction will be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So at any point during the titration, some of the acetic acid will be neutralized to form acetate ions.

The first part asks for the pH at 25% titration. I think that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to figure out how much NaOH is added, then find the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base at that point, and then use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, but perhaps I should first find the equivalence point to know how much NaOH is needed. Because the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Then, 25% of that volume would be the 25% titration point.

So, let's find the moles of acetic acid initially. The diluted solution is 0.025 M in 0.04 L. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed would equal moles of acetic acid, so 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, wait. Wait, the initial volume is 40 cm³. But when titrating, the volume of the solution plus the
