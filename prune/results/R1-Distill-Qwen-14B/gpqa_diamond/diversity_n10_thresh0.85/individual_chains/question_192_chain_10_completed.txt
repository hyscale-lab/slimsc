Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. There's a spherical conductor, right? And it's uncharged initially. Inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity isn't at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance 's' from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is 'r', and it's smaller than the conductor's radius R.

Now, they introduce a small positive charge '+q' somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and it's also at a distance 'l' from the center of the cavity. Oh wait, and the angle between 'l' and 's' is theta. So, I guess the position of point P relative to the cavity's center matters here.

I remember that conductors have some special properties regarding electric fields and charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges on a conductor reside on the surface. Also, the electric field inside the conductor material itself (so between the conductor's inner and outer surfaces) is zero. But wait, what about when there's a cavity inside?

Oh, right! The concept of electrostatic shielding. If the cavity is uncharged and there's no charge on the conductor, the charges inside the cavity can't affect the electric field outside the conductor. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity. So, how does that work?

Wait, I think the idea is that the conductor will redistribute any charges induced by the internal charge. Let me think. When a charge is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface would have an induced charge opposite to the cavity's charge. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, so the inner surface must have a charge of -q. Then, the outer surface must remain neutral because the total conductor's charge is zero. So, the outer surface would have +q, because the inner surface has -q, and the original conductor was neutral.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The conductor is initially uncharged. When we place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) would have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material would have free electrons that are attracted to the positive charge. Then, the total charge on the conductor itself (including outer surface) must be zero because the conductor is uncharged. So the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner's -q.

Wait, no. Wait. The conductor's total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q, which is inside the conductor but not part of it. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q because the conductor's material will create an opposite charge to the enclosed +q. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the inner surface has -q. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. The cavity has +q. The conductor's inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the conductor's inner surface is -q, conductor’s outer surface must be +q to make the total conductor's charge zero. So the conductor's net charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0.

Wait, but the conductor's material is neutral, but when a charge is placed in the cavity, the inner surface must have an opposite charge. So when +q is inside, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) must have -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the inner has -q. So the conductor's net charge is zero, but the outer surface has +q and the inner has -q.

So the electric field outside the conductor (since it's a spherical conductor) would be due to the outer surface's charge. Because of Gauss's Law, the field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface. In this case, the Gaussian surface would enclose the conductor. Since the conductor's outer surface has +q, the electric field outside would be as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity affects the conductor's inner surface, but not the outer, which is what contributes to the external field. So the field outside should be the same as if the +q was at the center of the conductor? Or is it based on the position of the charge inside the cavity?

Wait, no. Wait a second, the arrangement is that the charge is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So the inner surface has -q, but the outer surface has +q. But when considering a point outside the conductor, the field is determined by the total charge outside the Gaussian surface. So the Gaussian surface would be outside the conductor. The total charge inside that Gaussian surface would be the conductor's charge, which is zero, but wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the Gaussian surface would enclose the conductor, which includes the outer charge of +q. So the electric field outside would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so the field outside would be the same as if the charge +q was at the center. So the electric field at point P, which is outside, would be E = (1/(4πε0)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

But wait, the options don't all have L squared. Let me check the options.

Option B is E = (1/(4πε0)) * q / L².

Option A is (l - s cosθ)^2 in denominator.

Option C is (l + s cosθ)^2.

Option D is 1/l².

Wait, but why would the position of the charge inside the cavity affect the field outside? Because the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the shape of the inner surface.

Wait, but the inner surface has an induced charge due to the +q. But the inner surface is a sphere because the conductor is a sphere. Wait, no, wait. The cavity is a sphere, so the inner surface of the conductor (which is a sphere) would have a uniform charge distribution? Or does the position of the charge inside the cavity affect the inner surface's charge distribution?

Wait, the cavity is centered at a point s away from the conductor's center. So the charge +q is at a point s away from the center of the conductor, inside the cavity. So the inner surface of the conductor can't be a uniform sphere. It would have a dipole or something? Hmm, but wait, the conductor is a sphere. So the inner surface's charge distribution must be such that the electric field inside the conductor (the material) is zero.

Wait, perhaps I should think about image charges. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the charge inside the cavity induces a charge on the inner surface of the conductor, which then induces a charge on the outer surface.

But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution would be uniform, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed. Because the inner surface's charge would arrange such that the conductor's external field is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, is that right? Because when I have a charge inside a non-conducting shell, the induced charges are on the inner and outer surfaces. But for a conducting shell, the inner surface charge is opposite to the enclosed charge, and the outer surface would have the same as the net charge of the conductor. But in this case, the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge equal to the inner surface's opposite, so that the conductor's net charge remains zero.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The conductor is neutral. There's a charge +q inside the cavity. The inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the conductor as a whole has a charge of -q (inner) + outer charge. But the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's spread uniformly over the outer surface because the conductor is spherical.

So from the outside, the conductor behaves as if the charge +q is at its center. So, the electric field outside would be the same as that produced by a point charge +q at the center.

So point P is outside, so the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε0)) * q / (L)^2, where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that: (1/(4πε0)) * q / L².

But wait, another thought: point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity, and the center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the point P is not just a straight radial point from the conductor's center, but is offset by the position of the cavity.

But wait, because the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed. So the field outside depends only on the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is +q. So the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the external field. So point P's position relative to the cavity's center shouldn't matter; it's the distance from the conductor's center that matters.

So the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε0)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but why are other options present? Let me think again. The question says the point P is outside, at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta.

If the charge were not in the cavity, but say, on the conductor's surface, then the field at P would depend on the position. But in this case, the charge is inside the cavity, which is an inner point.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the method of images. Or maybe the field outside the conductor is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the field outside would be as if all the charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

So irrespective of where the point P is, as long as it's outside the conductor, the field is (1/(4πε0)) q / L².

Hence, the correct answer is B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **System Setup**:  
   - A neutral spherical conductor of radius $R$ has a small spherical cavity inside it. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$.  
   - A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.  
   - Point $P$ is located outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

2. **Induced Charges**:  
   - The charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor.  
   - Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.  

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor, as per Gauss's Law.  
   - The outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, and the field outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.  

4. **Field at Point $P$**:  
   - Point $P$ is outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is given by:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
     \]  
   - The position of the charge inside the cavity or the specific geometry involving $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ does not affect the external field, as the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

5. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The denominator $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ does not describe the field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. The field outside the conductor depends only on $L$, the distance from the center of the conductor to $P$.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The denominator $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is irrelevant for the external field.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The field does not depend on $l$, the distance from the center of the cavity to $P$.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
