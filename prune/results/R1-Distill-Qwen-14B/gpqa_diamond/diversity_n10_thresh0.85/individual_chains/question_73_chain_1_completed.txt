Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Alright, it's about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds mean I have to use special relativity formulas, right?

The astronauts have masses of 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so they're moving in the same direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy.

First, I think I should tackle the relative speed. Oh wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. I remember there's a formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), right? Or wait, is it (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²))? Hmm, I need to be careful here.

So astronaut A has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m moving at 0.5c. Wait, but wait, the problem says they're both moving in the positive x-direction. So from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So I guess I need to find the velocity of B as seen from A's frame.

Wait, no, relative speed is just the difference, but considering relativity. Let me think. So if the two are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u and v are their speeds. Wait, but which one is u and which is v? Let me get this straight. If A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.5c is slower than 0.6c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. But wait, the formula for relative velocity is (u' - v)/(1 - (u'v/c²)), where u' is the velocity of B in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of A. Or is it the other way around? Maybe I should double-check the formula.

Wait, the correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of B and v is the velocity of A, from the perspective of A. Because A is moving at v = 0.6c, and B is moving at u = 0.5c in the same direction. Wait, no, wait. From A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab, B's velocity would be u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So u is B's speed in lab frame (0.5c), v is A's speed in lab frame (0.6c). So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) 

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator. Numerator is (0.5 - 0.6)c = (-0.1)c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates that from A's perspective, B is moving at -0.1428c, which is 0.1428c in the opposite direction. But relative speed is the magnitude, so 0.1428c.

Wait, but the options have 0.14c as an option. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So that's one part done.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, and the total energy is the sum. So I'll calculate the energy for each and add them.

The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them up: E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

So approximately 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct energy is around 5.96.

Looking back at the options:

A) v_rel=1.1c, which is impossible because you can't go faster than c.

B) v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96. Hmm, 4.96 is lower than our calculation.

C) 0.14c, 5.96: matches our calculation.

D) 0.14c, 5. So no, C is correct.

So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A (mass \(2m\)) moves at \(0.6c\), and astronaut B (mass \(3m\)) moves at \(0.5c\), both in the same direction. Substituting \(u = 0.5c\) (B's speed) and \(v = 0.6c\) (A's speed):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

- Numerator: \(0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c\)
- Denominator: \(1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates that B is moving opposite to A's direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
For astronaut A (\(2m\), \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
For astronaut B (\(3m\), \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of \(E_A\) and \(E_B\):

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options:

- **A**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\) is incorrect (relativistic speeds cannot exceed \(c\)).
- **B**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\), \(E = 4.96m c^2\) is incorrect (energy is too low).
- **C**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\) is correct.
- **D**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5m c^2\) is incorrect (energy is too low).

**Answer: C**
