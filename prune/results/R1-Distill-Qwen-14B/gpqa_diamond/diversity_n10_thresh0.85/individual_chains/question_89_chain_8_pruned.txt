Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane derivatives can undergo specific reactions, especially with strong bases like KOH.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (1 and 3 positions), heating with a strong base like KOH would likely lead to an elimination, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bit tricky because the adamantane structure is quite rigid. So when KOH is added, each bromide could leave, but where would the double bond form?

Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so the positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons in a way that's conducive to forming a bridge. Eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps a dielimination occurs, but I'm more familiar with vicinal dihalides eliminating to form alkenes. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar? Wait, no. Wait, when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination leads to a double bond between those carbons. So if it's 1 and 3 adjacent, maybe it's 1,2-dibromo? No, the question says 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, so maybe the structure is such that the bromines are across a bridge, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a carbonyl group. Wait, that's unexpected because elimination would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So maybe I was wrong about the reaction.

Wait, maybe instead of elimination, it's a substitution. KOH is a strong base but also a nucleophile. However, adamantane is quite unreactive towards substitution because of its structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening? Wait, no, adamantane is a very stable structure. Hmm.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. That suggests either an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But considering the reaction conditions, it's more likely a ketone or an ester. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's an elimination followed by some kind of rearrangement? Or maybe a substitution forming a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Oh wait, no, elimination typically forms alkenes, not carbonyls. Unless it's a special case. Alternatively, perhaps the bromides are on adjacent carbons, and when both are eliminated, they form a double bond, but then undergo some kind of ring expansion or contraction to form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong reaction. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH. I remember that in some cases, when two vicinal bromides are present, especially in a rigid structure like adamantane, elimination can lead to a bridge structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-type elimination, but pinacol is more about diols losing water.

Wait another thought: maybe the KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but since adamantane is so rigid, perhaps it's a SN2 mechanism. But with two bromines on adjacent carbons, maybe a double substitution occurs, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs to form an allene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That's a high ppm, possibly for an oxygen-bearing proton. For example, an alcohol would have protons around 1-5 ppm, but 4.79 is more upfield for an alcohol. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton? No, but in that case, the coupling would be different.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, epoxides have lower carbonyl frequencies. Wait, maybe it's a ketone. So, if the product has a ketone group, then where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, let me think about the reaction conditions. KOH heated with dibromide. Could it be a Fiedler-Bailey type reaction? No, that's usually for forming epoxides from diols. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation? No, that's for cyclic esters. Wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes a carbene is formed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but how? Maybe a double dehydrohalogenation to create a carbonyl group. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, but then some rearrangement occurs.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is the formation of a diene, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. For example, maybe a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl, which is common in ketones or amides. Alternatively, it might be an epoxide's CH2, but that's usually around 3-4 ppm.

Wait, another angle: when two vicinal bromides are present and treated with a strong base, perhaps they undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, forming a conjugated dienol or something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone. Adamantane with two carbonyl groups? No, because if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, removing two HBr would form a double bond, but how does that lead to a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. Wait, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure that's very stable. Maybe it's not opening.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the IR and NMR. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, suggesting a carbonyl. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is a doublet. Wait, no, the description says 4.79 (2H), but it doesn't specify the splitting. Wait, product 1 is the result of reacting with KOH. Maybe it's forming a ketone and an epoxide? No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol. Wait, but the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3300 cm-1 which is typical for O-H. But the IR here has 1720, so that's probably a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester or ketone. Let's think about the NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester or a ketone's alpha position.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH... perhaps it's a ring-opening via substitution. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form a carbonyl. Wait, but dehydration usually needs a proton source, but KOH is a base. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product's NMR has 10H between 2.41 and 2.23 ppm, which is a region typical for CH2 groups in a rigid structure, like adamantane. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another CH2 group. So the product might still have a structure similar to adamantane but with some functional groups.

Wait, considering all this, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane might lose two HBr molecules, and the two carbons where bromides were attached form a carbonyl group. But how? That would require each carbon where Br was to lose Br and gain an O, but that doesn't seem straightforward.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of two eliminations, each forming a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl in the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an acylation? So, product 2 would be an acylated product.

Wait, but the next step after product 1 is heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, then adding a Lewis acid could lead to some kind of Friedel-Craft
