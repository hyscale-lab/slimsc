Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, let me think. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I remember that neutrinos are produced in different nuclear reactions in the Sun, and the pp chain is a major one.

Wait, the pp-III branch... I think the proton-proton chain has several branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Each produces neutrinos of different energies. Oh right, the main pp-I branch produces lower energy neutrinos because it involves the fusion of two protons into deuterium and emits a positron and a neutrino. Then there are higher branches like pp-II and pp-III that involve more steps and release higher-energy neutrinos.

So the pp-III branch stopping would mean that the production of certain high-energy neutrinos would cease. But how does this affect the flux in those two bands?

The flux ratio is flux band1 over flux band2. So I need to figure out what sources contribute to each band. I recall that the pp-I branch produces neutrinos around ~0.5 MeV, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

No, wait: the main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos produced in the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain has different branches. The pp-I branch is the most common, producing lower energy neutrinos, while the pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher-energy ones.

In particular, the pp-III branch contributes to the production of neutrinos in the ~1 MeV range. Oh wait, maybe in the range of 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV? Let me think. The 700-800 keV band is about 0.7-0.8 MeV, and 800-900 is 0.8-0.9 MeV. So pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos than pp-I.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those higher-energy neutrinos stops. But the other branches (like pp-I and maybe pp-II) continue. So which bands get affected more?

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between band1 (700-800 keV) and band2 (800-900 keV). If the pp-III branch is responsible for a significant portion of the 800-900 keV neutrinos, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band2.

But what about band1? Band1 is lower energy. Are the neutrinos in that band mainly produced by other branches?

I think the main contributor to the lower energy neutrinos (like ~1 MeV and below) is the pp-I branch. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (above perhaps 0.8 MeV) would be reduced. So band2 would have less flux because pp-III contributes to it, while band
