Okay, so I have this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when we talk about excitation in stars, it relates to the thermal energy of the photosphere, which is connected to the star's effective temperature. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of the star where most of the light is emitted, and if it's in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), then the distribution of the atoms' energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. I think the excitation is related to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. The ratio of excited to ground state, or something like that.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states (say, state 2 and state 1) is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So, n2/n1 for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Or wait, wait. No, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio of n2 to n1 is higher in star_1 than in star_2. So let me think: if star_1 has higher excitation, it means more atoms are in the higher energy state. So for star_1, (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around: maybe the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So maybe the ratio of excited atoms to unexcited is 2:1 for star_1, and 1:1 for star_2. Wait, but that's not necessarily precise. Let me clarify.

The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the population in a specific energy level is twice as much in star_1. Hmm, but which level? It specifies "a specific energy level," so perhaps comparing the same energy level? Or maybe different levels. Wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J between the considered energy levels. So I think the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars because it's a specific transition, like between two levels.

So the energy levels are the same for both stars. So the question is about the ratio of the populations in these two levels. Let's denote level 2 as the excited state and level 1 as the lower state.

So for star_1, the ratio (n2/n1)_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, (n2/n1)_2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, what does that exactly mean? Are we talking about n2 (number of excited) or the ratio n2/n1?

Hmm, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Let's think in terms of the number of excited atoms. Suppose n2 is the number in the higher energy state. So perhaps in star_1, n2 is twice that of star_2. Or is it the ratio n2/n1 that's twice?

Wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe for the same energy level, the number of excited atoms is twice. Hmm, but that might not make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is about the ratio of the populations in the
