Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But let's take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with iodine is involved in some kind of reaction, maybe a substitution or addition. Wait, no, wait—red phosphorus and HI are often used together in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no, that's for ketones or aldehydes, right? Or is it for something else?

Wait, no. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroiodic acid reaction, which is like a cleavage reaction. Oh, right! For allylic or benzylic positions. So, if the compound has a triple bond or something, maybe. Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

But wait, looking at the options, they are all either substituted benzene rings or benzoic acids. Hmm. So maybe the reaction is about replacing a group on the benzene ring.

Wait, but the starting material has IR and NMR data. Let's start by interpreting that.

The IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1 usually indicate O-H or N-H stretching. But the strong peak at 3400 could be an O-H. Also, a peak at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the region for aromatic C=C stretching. So this compound has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

The NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical of an O-H proton, maybe from a carbonyl group. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an alcohol, but more likely a carboxylic acid because of the 1720 cm-1 peak which is more like a carbonyl in an acid.

Wait, wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl of a ketone or ester. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1 and maybe a bit lower. Wait, but acids can have lower wavenumbers because of the O-H effect. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone. But the 10.5 ppm peak is a strong indicator of an O-H.

Let me check the NMR again. So, 10.5 is a broad singlet, so that's probably a -COOH group. So the 1720 cm-1 would fit a carboxylic acid's carbonyl.

Then, the aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So that's a para-substituted benzene ring, because in para substitution, you get two doublets each integrating to 2H, each with the same splitting. So the substituent is in the para position.

Wait, but the protons are each a doublet. So it's a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, making the ring para directing. If the substituent is a carbonyl group (like -COOH or -COOR), which is meta directing, but wait in that case, the substituents on the ring would be in the meta positions. Hmm, wait no. Wait, if the substituent is a carbonyl, like a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached, then the ring is meta directing. So if the substituent is at the para position, maybe it's an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets. So each pair of protons is in a doublet. That would mean the substituent is in the para position, with each pair of protons being adjacent to it. So for example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be one pair (as a doublet), and the protons at 3 and 5 would be another pair (another doublet). Wait, but that's not correct because in a para-substituted benzene with a substituent in position 4, the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent. So they would give two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that makes sense.

So the benzene ring is para-substituted with something that causes this splitting.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, probably from a CH that's connected to something else, maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl or an electronegative atom.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe from a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, probably a CH3 group attached to a CH, maybe a branched chain.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, which is likely a terminal CH3, probably part of an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position, which is a group like CH2COOH or something. Hmm, but the NMR indicates a 10.5 ppm peak, which is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps it's a phenyl group attached to a chain that has a carboxylic acid. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzyl group with a substituent. Let me try to sketch this out.

The aromatic ring is para-substituted. The substituent is perhaps a group like -CH2COOH. Let's see.

But let's look at the other peaks. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH? Wait, that might not fit. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituent like -CH2-COOH. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is a terminal CH3, so that would be part of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a chain like ethyl.

Wait, let me piece it together. The substituent on the benzene is a group that has a chain leading to a CH3 at the end. The 0.9 triplet is likely a CH2CH2CH3 group, but wait, the triplet is 3H at 0.9, which is a terminal CH3. So that would be part of a ethyl group, like CH2CH3.

Looking at the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), that's a CH3 attached to a CH, which is split into a doublet. So perhaps the structure is something like CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOH?

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH group. Wait, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the chain is something else. Let's think about the substituent on the benzene ring. Let's say it's a propyl group or something with a branching.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH connected to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) would be a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to the CH2. So maybe the structure is something like CH(CH3)-CH2- something.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests that it's a CH2CH3 group. So the substituent could be a chain like CH2CH2CH3 connected via a CH group.

Wait, putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene ring and then a COOH group. Hmm, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group. Let me draw this out.

The benzene ring has a substituent at the para position. That substituent is a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

But let's check the NMR shifts.

The 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. The aromatic protons are as expected for para-substituted. Then the CH near the COOH would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which would be the CH next to the carbonyl. The CH2 next to that would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). Then, the ethyl group would have the CH2 next to the CH, which would be at 1.7 ppm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring, and then a carbonyl group. But then where is the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-COOH group. So the benzene has a substituent at para position which is a -CH2-COOH. Then the NMR would have the COOH proton at 10.5, the CH2 adjacent to COOH would be split in some way.

Wait, but then where are the other peaks? Let me think. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be something else. Oh, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-O-R group, but I don't think that fits the IR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CO-O-R, but the IR shows a peak at 1720, which could be an ester. But the NMR has a broad peak, which is more typical for a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps it's a benzoic acid derivative. Let me think about that.

So, the para-substituted benzene has a -COOH group and another substituent. Wait, but the IR shows 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, probably the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. So the compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position.

Wait, that makes sense. So the benzene ring has a -COOH group and another substituent, and those substituents are in the para position relative to each other.

Wait, but the NMR shows 10.5 ppm (1H, broad), which is the COOH proton. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), which fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents? Or is the substituent a single group that's ortho, meta, or para directing?

Wait, no. Wait, the para-substituted benzene would have two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other. Or wait, perhaps the substituent is a single group in the para position relative to the -COOH group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the substituent in the para position is causing this splitting. So the substituent is in the para position relative to the -COOH group.

So the structure is a benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position, which is
