Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies among the options given. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations. These divergences can make the theory seem non-sensical, so regularization helps to make the calculations manageable by introducing a temporary cutoff, which is then removed after renormalization.

Wait, but which theories actually need regularization? Let me think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't really deal with quantum effects, right? So they don't have the same issues with divergences as quantum theories. In classical electromagnetism, you might have issues with self-energy of charges or things like the infinite charge density at a point charge, but those are more conceptual and handled differently, maybe by distribution theory or some other classical methods. But regularization as a technique is more of a quantum field theory thing.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is option C. I know QED is a quantum theory and it does require renormalization. So it must use regularization as part of the process. The same goes for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), option B. QCD deals with the strong force and involves things like asymptotic freedom. But wait, I thought QCD doesn't require as much fine-tuning as QED because of things like confinement, but I'm not sure. Anyway, it's a quantum theory, so regularization is part of the process.

Superstring Theory, option A, is a quantum theory as well, trying to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. I think string theories generally have better behavior at high energies because they're background-dependent and perhaps have a more consistent framework that doesn't require the same kind of divergent integrals as point particle theories. Wait, but do they need regularization? String theories deal with higher-dimensional objects, and maybe their perturbative expansions are better behaved. Or maybe they still require some form of regularization, but perhaps it's not necessary in the same way because the theory is more complete or doesn't have the same divergences.

Wait, another angle. Regularization is used when a theory has divergences, like loop divergences. In QED, Feynman diagrams at higher loops give rise to divergent integrals, which need
