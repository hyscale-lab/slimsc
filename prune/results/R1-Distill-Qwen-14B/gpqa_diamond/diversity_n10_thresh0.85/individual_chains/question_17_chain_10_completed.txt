Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant K tells us about the stability of that complex.

Wait, the formation constant K is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Or wait, maybe the exact stoichiometry isn't that, but the question mentions a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, I think it's a 1:1 complex.

So, the formation constant K is for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-; K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, we're given the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, it binds tightly to Ca²+. So, in solution, most of the EDTA would be bound to Ca²+ as the complex. But the question is about the free calcium ions.

So, let's model this. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. The formation constant K is 5e10, which is very large. So, K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, if the complex is present, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very low since K is large.

But wait, another thing to consider: the EDTA may not all be in the Y^4- form. Because EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, so maybe the Y^4- concentration is 100% of EDTA? Or perhaps I need to account for the alpha fraction. Oh wait, the problem says "we assume that the pH is ideal," which probably means that the fraction of EDTA in the Y^4- form (alpha_Y^4-) is 1. So, alpha_Y = 1, which simplifies the calculation.

So, if alpha is 1, then [EDTA^4-] is equal to the total EDTA concentration, which is the same as the concentration of free EDTA, I think. But wait, no, the total EDTA would be the sum of all protonated forms plus the complex. But since the pH is ideal, the problem likely assumes that EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form, so [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total free EDTA concentration.

Wait, but in this case, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the total EDTA would be the sum of [EDTA^4-] and [CaEDTA^2-]. But wait, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, so the total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = [EDTA_total] .

Wait no, the EDTA is consumed when it forms the complex. Let me think: the initial EDTA is in solution, some of it binds to Ca²+ to form the complex. So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that represents the amount of EDTA that's been used to form the complex. The free EDTA would be [EDTA^4-], but also considering that EDTA can exist in other forms, but since pH is ideal, we can assume that most is Y^4-.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of it as a reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant K is 5e10. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the problem gives us the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So, what's the initial setup?

Let me denote:

Let’s let the concentration of Ca²+ be x. And the concentration of EDTA^4- be y. Then, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

So, we have K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) = (0.02) / (x * y) ) = 5e10.

But what's the relation between x, y, and the total EDTA and Ca²+.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, perhaps the only source of Ca and EDTA is this complex, meaning that all the Ca and all the EDTA in solution are in the complex, except for the free ions.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but we have to think about the total concentration. Let me clarify:

Assume that the solution has only the Ca-EDTA complex, with a concentration of 0.02 M. So, the initial concentrations are:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The K for this dissociation is 1/K_form, which is 1/(5e10) ≈ 2e-11.

So, K_dissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but what's the initial state? The solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M minus the amount dissociated, but maybe for such a large K_form, the dissociation is negligible. Hmm, but let's model it.

Let me denote the degree of dissociation as α. So, each mole of complex dissociates into 1 mole of Ca²+ and 1 mole of EDTA^4-.

So, [Ca²+] = α * 0.02

[EDTA^4-] = α *0.02

And [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 - α *0.02 ≈ 0.02 (since α is small, because K is large).

So, K_dissociation = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ ( (α *0.02)^2 ) / 0.02 ) = ( α^2 * 0.02 ) / 0.02 ) = α^2.

So, K_dissociation ≈ α^2 = 2e-11 → α = sqrt(2e-11) ≈ about 4.47e-6.

Wait, but wait, K_dissociation is 2e-11, so K = alpha squared, so alpha is sqrt(2e-11) ≈ 4.47e-6.

So, [Ca²+] = alpha * 0.02 M = (4.47e-6) * 0.02 ≈ 8.94e-8 M.

Wait, but this isn't matching any of the options. Let's see the options: A is 2e-2, C is 6.3e-7, D is 1e-2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the approach isn't correct.

Another approach: since K is very large, the dissociation is minimal. So, [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both very small.

So, the formation constant expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = 5e10.

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-} )

So, [Ca²+][EDTA^4-} = 0.02 /5e10 = 4e-13.

But what is the relation between [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-}?

Wait, because the solution is a 0.02 M solution of the complex, the total concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA must come from the dissociation.

Wait, but maybe the solution is such that all the Ca comes from the dissociation, and same with EDTA. So, [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-} ] = x.

So, then:

x * x =4e-13 → x^2=4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 2e-6.5?

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13.

The square root is sqrt(4)=2 and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7.

So, 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this.

So, the concentration of Ca²+ ions is about 6.3e-7 M, so the answer is C.

Wait, but wait, why did I assume [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-}? Because each mole of complex dissociates into one mole of each. So, the amount of Ca²+ released equals the amount of EDTA^4- released. So, yes, [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-} ] = x.

So, substituting that into the equation leads us to x^2 = 4e-13 → x=2e-6.5 → which is approximately 6.3e-7.

So, the correct answer should be C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is approximately 0.02 M, as the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \). Let the concentrations of \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) be \( x \). Substituting into the formation constant equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
