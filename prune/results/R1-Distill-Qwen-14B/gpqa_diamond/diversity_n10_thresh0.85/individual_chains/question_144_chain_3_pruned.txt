Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The formula probably involves the lifetime, then using velocity and time to get distance. Oh right, the mean proper lifetime (tau) of a particle is h-bar divided by the total decay width (Gamma). So tau = ħ / Gamma.

But wait, wait. Gamma is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units involving GeV·s or something, so I'll need to handle the units carefully. Let me jot down the formula:

tau = ħ / Gamma

And then once I have tau, the mean lifetime, the mean decay distance (c tau) is the speed of light multiplied by tau. Because the particle is moving at some velocity, but wait, particles like mesons might be moving relativistically. Oh, but wait, maybe the formula already accounts for that in terms of the particle's lifetime. Hmm.

Wait no, the proper lifetime is tau, and if the particle is moving at speed v, then the observed lifetime is gamma * tau. But wait, the decay distance is the velocity times the lifetime. Since the particle is moving, the mean decay length would be L = v * gamma * tau. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the velocity of the meson.

Wait, but maybe the formula for the mean decay path is given by (v * gamma) * tau. Alternatively, sometimes people use the formula L = c * gamma * tau, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the mean path is simply c multiplied by the lifetime gamma tau. But if the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So I think the formula should be L = v * (gamma * tau), where tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach step by step.

First, let's compute the proper lifetime tau. Tau is h-bar divided by Gamma. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

But what's the value of ħ? I know that ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because h-bar is h/(2π), and Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. But when working in GeV units, it's easier to remember ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So Gamma is given as 320 MeV. Oh, but wait, that's 0.32 GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s.

Let me compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875e-25 s. So tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, wait. Wait no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Hmm, okay. Now, gamma is the Lorentz factor. The meson's gamma factor depends on its velocity. The velocity can be found from its energy and mass. Because the energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m is 1.2 GeV.

Wait, the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. The total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m * c^2. But since we're working in units where c=1 (GeV units?), maybe it's E = gamma * m. So gamma = E / m.

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667.

Wait, but wait, particles moving at high energies have gamma factors, which are significant. So the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame would be gamma * tau. So the total lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau.

Wait, but the proper lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, it's longer by gamma. So the lifetime is gamma * tau, and the velocity is v = beta c, where beta is v/c.

So the decay distance is L = v * (gamma * tau) = beta c gamma tau.

But wait, beta can be found from gamma. Because for a particle, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So let me compute beta. With gamma = 6.6667, so 1/gamma^2 is about (0.15) (since 6.6667^2 is about 44, 1/44 ≈ 0.0227). Wait, 6.6667 is 20/3, so 20/3 squared is (400/9) ≈44.444. So 1/gamma^2 is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

But wait, alternatively, beta can be calculated as (p c)/E, but perhaps it's easier to compute using gamma.

Wait, another approach: since E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m v, and v = beta c. Alternatively, p = gamma m beta c. So beta = (p c) / (gamma m c²) ), but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute beta from gamma.

So beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ), but since we're in units where c=1, it's sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

So m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So m/E = 1.2/8 = 0.15. So (m/E)^2 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So the velocity v is beta c ≈ 0.9887 c.

So now, putting it all together: decay distance L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, no, earlier I thought L = v * gamma tau. Wait
