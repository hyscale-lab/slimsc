Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a meson resonance, X. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. They can have different properties like mass, energy, and width, which probably relates to their stability or how quickly they decay.

The problem gives me three pieces of data: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The question is asking for the mean decay distance. Hmm, the mean decay distance... I think that relates to how far the meson travels before it decays. So, the longer the lifetime, the farther it can move, right?

Wait, I remember something about the mean proper lifetime. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I should make sure about the units here. Since Γ is the decay width, which is the energy width, and we're using natural units where ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So I can convert Γ from MeV to GeV to match the units.

Let me jot down the numbers:

E_X = 8 GeV (though I'm not sure if this is needed for the decay distance)
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

But wait, the decay width Γ is given, so I can proceed. So first, calculate the mean lifetime τ.

τ = ħ / Γ.

So let's compute Γ in GeV. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So:

τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.

Let me calculate that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, that's 2.056875e-24 seconds? Or wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.568 times. So 20.568e-25 s, which is 2.0568e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait, that seems extremely small, but I think that's correct because particles like mesons decay quickly.

Now, the mean decay distance is the product of the velocity (v) and the lifetime (τ). So distance = v * τ.

But wait,
