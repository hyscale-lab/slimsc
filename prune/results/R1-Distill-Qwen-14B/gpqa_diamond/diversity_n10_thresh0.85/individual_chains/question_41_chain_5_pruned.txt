Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and c is taken as 1 (so the speed of light in a vacuum is 1 unit).

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with relative velocities, especially involving light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, this is a question about light in a medium, not in a vacuum. Oh wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where n is the refractive index. But that's in the medium's rest frame. What happens when the medium itself is moving?

So, in the rest frame of the glass, light travels at speed v_light = c/n. But when the glass is moving relative to the lab frame, we have to consider how velocities transform between frames. I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. Oh wait, but wait a second—special relativity's velocity addition formula applies when you're transforming between inertial frames moving at a constant velocity relative to each other.

But wait, the glass is moving through the lab frame at velocity v. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light beam?

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. Since the glass is moving at v relative to the lab, we need to find the lab frame's measurement of the light's velocity.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the direction of the glass's motion is the same as the light's direction in the glass's frame. So when we perform the Lorentz transformation, the velocities add in a particular way.

The special relativity velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame (the glass's frame here), and u' is the velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, but in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab's frame, the glass's speed is v. So the light, in the glass's frame, is moving at u
