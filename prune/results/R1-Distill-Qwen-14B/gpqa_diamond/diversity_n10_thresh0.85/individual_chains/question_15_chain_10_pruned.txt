Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right?

The stars are interesting. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a bit bigger but they ended up with the same size. Not sure how that affects transit probability though.

The question is about transit probability. From what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Specifically, it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) to the star's radius. The closer the orbit, the higher the probability because a small change in alignment can cause a transit.

Wait, wait. More precisely, the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by [ (a_planet / R_star) ]^-1, but wait, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Oh right, I think the transit probability formula is P_transit ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2, but wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Another approach: the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. The formula is something like (R_star / a)^2 × something else. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I think the probability is roughly (R_star / a)^2. Because a larger a (distance) makes the chance of alignment less likely. So the probability is inversely proportional to a squared? Or is it the semi-major axis divided by the star's radius, squared.

Wait, no, the probability is actually higher when the orbital distance is smaller. So the probability of transit increases when a is smaller because the planet's path is more likely to cross our line of sight.

Let me get
