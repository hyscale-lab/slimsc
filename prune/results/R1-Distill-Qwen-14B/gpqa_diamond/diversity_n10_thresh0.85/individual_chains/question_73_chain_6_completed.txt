Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Alright, it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds... so I'm probably going to have to use some special relativity formulas.

Wait, the question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember from my studies that when dealing with relative velocities in special relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula.

So the first part is finding the relative speed. Let me think. The formula for adding velocities in relativity is v = (u + v')/(1 + (u v')/c²), but wait, is that correct? Or is it the other way around? Oh, right. So if I have object A moving at speed u and object B moving at speed v' relative to A, then the speed of B as seen from A is (v' + u)/(1 + (v' u)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, I think I got that backwards. Let me think again. If you're in frame S and you see object A moving at u, and object B moving at v in S, then in frame S', which is moving at u relative to S, the speed of B would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), right? Oh wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing up the formula. The correct formula is v = (v' + u) / (1 + (v' u)/c²). Wait, no, that's when you're adding velocities in the same direction. So in this case, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So if we have two objects moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference. Let me think.

Wait, the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the same direction. So, the relative speed of the slower one from the faster one's frame. So, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. From the first's perspective, what's the second's speed?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says, "relative speed and the total energy of the system." So it's the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since they're moving in the same direction, I think we need to subtract their speeds, but considering relativity. So, using the formula for relative velocity.

So the formula is v_rel = (u - v')/(1 - (u v')/c²), where u is the speed of the first object (0.6c), and v' is the speed of the second object in the same direction (0.5c). So substituting, v_rel is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, let's compute that denominator first.

The denominator is 1 - (0.6 * 0.5)c² / c². Because u times v' is (0.6c)(0.5c) = 0.3 c². Dividing by c squared gives 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So v_rel is (0.1c)/0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.142857c. Which is approximately 0.14c. So that's one of the options.

Now, looking at the options, option C has v_rel =0.14c. Option D also has v_rel=0.14c. So that's part one.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. The total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies, right? Because each astronaut's energy is their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma.

So for each astronaut, calculate gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy, then sum them.

The rest mass energy is E = mc², so for each, it's gamma * m_i c², where m_i is their mass.

So, for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So that's 1/sqrt(1 - (0.36)c²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So the energy is 2m * (gamma) c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, no. Wait, each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass. So the first astronaut's rest energy is 2m c². So with gamma 1.25, the total energy is 2m c² * 1.25 = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, the second astronaut has mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let's compute that. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) which is (√3)/2 ≈0.8660. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.1547.

So the second astronaut's energy is 3m c² * 1.1547 ≈ 3m c² * 1.1547 ≈ 3.4641 m c².

So the total energy is 2.5 m c² + 3.4641 m c² = approximately 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C: E =5.96 mc².

Option D: E=5mc².

So the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is option C, which has both the relative speed of 0.14c and energy 5.96 mc².

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the relative velocity calculation: v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.142857c, which rounds to 0.14c.

Energy:

First astronaut: 0.6c, mass 2m.

Gamma 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Energy: 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: 0.5c, mass 3m.

Gamma 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈1.1547.

Energy: 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈3.464 m c².

Total: 2.5 +3.464=5.964 m c².

Yes, that seems right. So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v'}{1 - \frac{u v'}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut),
- \( v' = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut).

Substituting the values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:
\[
1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Now, calculate the numerator:
\[
0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c
\]

Thus:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
- Mass: \( 2m \),
- Speed: \( 0.6c \).

Calculate \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Energy:
\[
E_1 = \gamma (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
- Mass: \( 3m \),
- Speed: \( 0.5c \).

Calculate \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy:
\[
E_2 = \gamma (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \)**
