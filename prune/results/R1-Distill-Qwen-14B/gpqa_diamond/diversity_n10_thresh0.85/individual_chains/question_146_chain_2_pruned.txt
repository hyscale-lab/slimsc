Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a Diels-Alder reaction, I think. The question is, when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride, what's the major product?

Hmm, right. Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. So, the diene here is cyclopenta-1,3-diene, and the dienophile is maleic anhydride. Wait, but wait, the diene is cyclopentadiene with a fluorine on the 5 position. Let me visualize that. Cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. The fluorine is at position 5, which would be next to the double bonds. So the structure is like a cyclopentadiene ring with F attached.

Wait, actually, cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene. So it's like:
CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with one double bond. Or wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene has two double bonds? No, wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think: cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with one double bond, right? But here, it's 1,3-diene, so maybe it's a conjugated diene. Wait, but in a five-membered ring, that would be a 1,3-diene, which would have two double bonds? That can't be possible because that would imply allenes, but in a five-membered ring, having 1,3-diene would have two double bonds, but that's not possible because you can't have two double bonds without a conjugated system unless it's cumulated. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw this.

Wait, 1,3-diene in a five-membered ring. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4, then it's 1,3-diene as
