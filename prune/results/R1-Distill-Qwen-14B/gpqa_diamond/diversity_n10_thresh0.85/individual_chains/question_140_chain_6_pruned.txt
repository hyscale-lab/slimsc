Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W, precipitate G, and eventually metal B. The problem also mentions a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms.

Hmm, let's start by parsing each part.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an isotope which is heavier than the usual. That might mean it's something like chlorine, which has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. Or maybe sodium, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, X reacts violently with liquid Y. Liquid Y... what common liquids react violently? Maybe something like water, but not sure. Or perhaps an acid, but Y is a liquid. Wait, another thought: maybe Y is an oil or something else.

The reaction releases gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, that's important. So for a molecule to have equal neutrons and protons, let's think about possible gases.

Wait, gas W: same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. So each molecule has as many neutrons as protons. Let's see. Let's think of possible gases. For example, H2O has 8 protons (since O is 8, H is 1 each) and 8 neutrons? Wait, O has 8 protons and usually 8 neutrons (so O-16). So H2O would have 2*(1p, 0n) + 1*(8p,8n) = total per molecule: 10 protons and 8 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

What about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (12C), O has 8 each. So CO2 would be 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. So that's equal. So each molecule of CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W could be CO2. But wait, when X reacts with Y, does that produce CO2? Alternatively, maybe another gas.

Wait, another possibility: NH3. NH3 has 14 protons (N has 7, H has 1 each x3) and 14 neutrons? N has 7 neutrons (if it's N-14), and H has 0. So for NH3, the molecule has 14 protons (7 from N, 3 from H) and 7 neutrons (from N). Not equal.

Wait, perhaps it's CH4? Let's see: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. H has 1 each. So CH4 has 6*1 (protons) + 4*1 = 10 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 0 = 6. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe it's H2. H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait another approach: the molecule should have the same number of neutrons and protons
