Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the problem is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find the normalized eigenvector for P along direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. Hmm, but wait, the operator is given in terms of its components. So first, I think I need to construct the operator P along the arbitrary direction n.

I remember that for a vector operator, the operator along a direction n is given by the dot product of the vector with the Pauli matrices. So if n is a unit vector, then P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But in this case, the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane. So its y-component, n_y, must be zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So substituting, the operator P becomes P = n_x P_x + 0*P_y + n_z P_z.

Given the components:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P is:

P = (ħ/2) [ n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's denote n_x = a and n_z = c for simplicity. Then,

P = (ħ/2) * [ a * [[0,1],[1,0]] + c * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So adding the matrices:

Top-left element: 0*a + 1*c = c
Top-right: a*1 + 0*c = a
Bottom-left: a*1 + 0*c = a
Bottom-right: 0*a + (-1)*c = -c

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ c , a ],
  [ a , -c ] ]

But multiplied by ħ/2.

So P is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of this operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

The general approach is to solve the eigenvalue equation P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue, here ħ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

( (ħ/2) * [ [c, a], [a, -c] ] ) * |ψ> = (λ) |ψ>

But since ħ/2 is a scalar factor, I can factor it out. So let's set ħ/2 = s for a moment. So the matrix is s * M, where M is [[c, a], [a, -c]].

So the equation becomes s * M |ψ> = λ |ψ>

But λ is given as s, since s is ħ/2, so λ = s.

So s * M |ψ> = s |ψ>

Divide both sides by s (assuming s ≠ 0, which it isn't), we get M |ψ> = |ψ>

So M is the matrix [[c, a], [a, -c]] and we need to find its eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1.

Wait, no, because M * |ψ> = (1) |ψ>, because s M |ψ> = s |ψ> implies M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the problem reduces to solving (M - I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So let's compute M - I:

[ [c-1, a],
  [a, -c -1] ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

The determinant is (c-1)(-c -1) - a² = 0.

Expanding that:

(c-1)(-c -1) = -(c-1)(c+1) = -(c² - 1) = -c² +1.

So determinant equation:

(-c² +1) - a² = 0 → 1 - c² - a² = 0 → but wait, from earlier, since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, a² + c² =1 (since n_x = a, n_z = c, and n_y =0). So yes, 1 - a² -c² = 0 → 0=0. So the equation is satisfied, which means the matrix M - I is singular, as expected for eigenvalues.

So the eigenvector equation is (M - I)|ψ> = 0.

Let me write the equations:

(c-1) ψ₁ + a ψ₂ = 0

a ψ₁ + (-c -1) ψ₂ = 0

Alternatively, from the first equation:

(c-1) ψ₁ = -a ψ₂ → ψ₁ = (-a/(c-1)) ψ₂.

But perhaps it's better to express ψ₂ in terms of ψ₁.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more carefully.

From the first equation:

(c-1) ψ₁ + a ψ₂ = 0 → ψ₂ = [ (1 - c) / a ] ψ₁

Assuming a ≠0. What if a is zero? Then n_x is zero, and n is in the z-direction (so a=0, c=±1). But let's proceed assuming a ≠0 for now.

So ψ₂ = (1 - c)/a * ψ₁.

The eigenvector is then a two-component vector [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T = ψ₁ [1, (1 - c)/a ]^T.

So the general eigenvector (up to a scalar multiple) is [1, (1 - c)/a]^T.

Now, we can write the eigenvector as proportional to [1, (1 - c)/a].

But wait, let's plug in a and c in terms of n_x and n_z. Since a =n_x and c =n_z.

So (1 - c) = 1 - n_z, and a =n_x.

So the ratio (1 - c)/a = (1 - n_z)/n_x.

So the eigenvector is [1, (1 - n_z)/(n_x)].

But wait, let's think about this. Since the direction is arbitrary in x-z, but the eigenvector depends on n_x and n_z.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parameterize the direction. Let me think, since the direction is in the x-z plane, we can write n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no. Because in the x-z plane, the angle θ is typically measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis, but perhaps I should think in terms of spherical coordinates. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle (from z-axis), and φ is the azimuthal angle around z. But since we're in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, but perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, the direction can be represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but wait, if θ is the angle from the x-axis, then x component is cosθ, z is sinθ. Alternatively, if θ is from the z-axis, then x would be sinθ, z cosθ. Hmm, perhaps that's a point of confusion.

Wait, perhaps using more standard conventions: the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since the direction lies in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n becomes (sinθ * 1, 0, cosθ) → (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

But wait, that depends on how θ is defined. Let me think: when θ is 0, we're along the x-axis, and when θ is 90 degrees (π/2), we're along the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting a = sinθ, c = cosθ.

So the ratio (1 - c)/a = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Hmm, which is a trigonometric identity. Because (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = tan(θ/2).

So the ratio becomes tan(θ/2).

So the eigenvector components are [1, tan(θ/2)].

Wait, but that would result in [1, tan(θ/2)] as the components. Let me see.

So the eigenvector is [1, tan(θ/2)]. But to write it more neatly, perhaps we can factor out something. Let me compute this for specific θ.

For example, when θ = 0, we're along x-axis. Then tan(θ/2) = 0, so the eigenvector is [1,0], which makes sense because in the x-direction, the spin-up state would be along x, which is [1,0].

Similarly, when θ= π/2, along z-axis: tan(θ/2) = tan(π/4) =1. So the eigenvector is [1,1], but wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, for spin in the z-direction, the eigenstates are [1,0] and [0,1], but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the direction of the operator. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is better approached using the standard eigenstates of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, another approach: since P is proportional to the Pauli matrix σ·n, the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along direction n.

The eigenstates for spin-1/2 along n are given by:

|↑⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{i φ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩,

|↓⟩ = -e^{i φ} sin(θ/2)|0⟩ + cos(θ/2)|1⟩,

where θ is the angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle. But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so e^{i φ}=1.

So the spin-up state is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Wait, but when θ is 0 (along x-axis), this becomes [1,0], which is correct for the x-up state.

So the normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which corresponds to the spin-up state along n.

Looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, the options are given as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but no hbar factors. But wait, the eigenvectors in quantum mechanics are often written without the ħ since they are normalized vectors.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which seems to match.

But wait, let me check the other options. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like it's using standard spherical coordinates but without the 1/2 angle.

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)), which includes hbar factors, which I don't think are part of the eigenvectors since in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are vectors in Hilbert space, so they don't carry units like ħ). So options with ħ would be incorrect, unless perhaps the problem is using a different convention, but I think that's unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. The operator P is given for each component, but perhaps I should construct the operator as spin components. Wait, P is the operator, which might correspond to spin angular momentum, so ħ/2 times a Pauli matrix.

Wait, but the given operator seems to be for spin-1/2, since the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So the eigenstates would indeed be the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the direction n.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which looks like it's normalized in a different way, perhaps involving some other coefficients.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the normalization of the eigenvector.

The vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] has a magnitude squared of cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1, so it's already normalized. So option C is normalized correctly.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but this looks like the parameterization for a 2D vector in polar coordinates without the 1/2 angle.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the original matrix.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvector we obtained earlier is [1, (1 - c)/a], where a= n_x = sinθ, c= n_z = cosθ.

So substituting, that ratio is (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = 2 sin²(theta/2) / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = tan(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [1, tan(theta/2)].

But to make it a unit vector, the components would be [1, tan(theta/2)] divided by the square root of 1 + tan²(theta/2)}.

Which is sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) = sec(theta/2).

So each component becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Which is the same as what we got earlier.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Construction**:  
   The operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ is constructed using the dot product of $\vec{n}$ with the components of $\vec{P}$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Thus,  
   $$\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.$$  
   Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator becomes:  
   $$\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.$$

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is $\vec{P}|\psi\rangle = \lambda|\psi\rangle$, where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$. Factoring out $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:  
   $$\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix}.$$

3. **Solving for Eigenvectors**:  
   Expanding the eigenvalue equation gives the system of equations:  
   $$(n_z - 1)\psi_1 + n_x \psi_2 = 0,$$  
   $$n_x \psi_1 + (-n_z - 1)\psi_2 = 0.$$  
   From the first equation, $\psi_2 = \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} \psi_1$. Substituting this into the second equation confirms consistency, and the eigenvector is proportional to:  
   $$|\psi\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} \end{bmatrix}.$$

4. **Normalization**:  
   To normalize the eigenvector, divide by the square root of the sum of the squared components:  
   $$\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{1 - n_z}{n_x}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \tan^2(\theta/2)} = \sec(\theta/2).$$  
   Thus, the normalized eigenvector becomes:  
   $$|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.$$

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.  
   - **Option B**: Uses $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$, which does not match the derived eigenvector.  
   - **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.  
   - **Option D**: Includes incorrect normalization factors and $\hbar$, which are not part of the eigenvector.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ is $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
