Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let's see. The setup is a bit tricky. So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. But when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in electrostatics, the charges redistribute themselves. Oh right, in a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. But when there's a cavity, things get interesting. So if the conductor is neutral, any charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

So when you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor is neutral overall. But wait, no, wait. The conductor is initially uncharged, so the charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

So the conductor as a whole has a charge of +q on its outer surface. But wait, the problem says the conductor is uncharged; so when we put +q in the cavity, the conductor's net charge remains zero? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). When we put +q inside the cavity, the cavity's inner surface induces a -q. Since the conductor must remain neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer charges. So inner is -q, outer is +q: total is zero. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

But wait, the
