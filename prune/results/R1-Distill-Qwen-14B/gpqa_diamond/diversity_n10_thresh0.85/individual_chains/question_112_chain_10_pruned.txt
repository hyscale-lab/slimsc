Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that there's an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, when a state is given as a linear combination of eigenstates, the coefficients squared give the probabilities. But wait, the question mentions that it's proportional to that combination, so I might have to normalize it first.

So the first step is probably to normalize the state. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me compute the norm squared. That would be the sum of the absolute squares of each coefficient. 

The coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The absolute square is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For |down>, the coefficient is (2-i). The absolute square is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1 =5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). That means |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the next part is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation is given as Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what does this matrix look like?

Wait, the operator is a 2x2 matrix because the spin state is in 2D space (|up> and |down> are the eigenstates). So for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are:
A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1, so it's 0)
A_12 = ħ/2 (i=1, j=2)
A_21 = ħ/2 (i=2, j=1)
A_22 = 0.

Wait, no, wait: the matrix is diagonal when i=j? No, because if i equals j, A_ij is 0, and for i≠j, it's ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:
[ 0 , ħ/2 ]
