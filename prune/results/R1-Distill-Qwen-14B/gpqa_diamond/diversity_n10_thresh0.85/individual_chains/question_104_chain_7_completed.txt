Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think about what I remember about the RV method.

Alright, the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves back and forth because of the planet's gravity, and that causes the spectral lines to shift. The shift's amplitude depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. Oh wait, right, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by some equation involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and other orbital parameters.

Wait, I think the formula is K = (V * (M_planet) * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) ), but wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I remember another formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude K with the orbital period P. Oh, right, the formula is K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars have masses similar to the Sun. So M_planet is much less than M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

But let me think again. Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital period and the mass. Since the same method is used, I think K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ), or something like that.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to write the correct formula for K. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to recall that K is given by:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / (2π c (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But that might not be exact. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ), assuming M_p << M_star so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have the same mass as Neptune, and the stars have the same mass as the Sun. So M_p is the same for both, and M_star is the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So, if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, because K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), so K1 = (something) * (1/P1^(1/3)), K2 = (same something) * (1/P2^(1/3)). So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3 )

Alternatively, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K implies shorter period. Because if period is longer, the same K would require a larger mass (but masses are same), so maybe the period is shorter for higher K.

Wait, no: So according to the formula, K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since the same M_p and M_star, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is larger than K2, P1 must be smaller than P2.

In the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, and K2 is 7 milliangstroms. So K2 is larger than K1. So according to the formula, since K2 > K1, P2 < P1. Wait, but wait, let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, K1 =5, K2=7. So K2 is larger. So from K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), the larger K means smaller P. So P2 is shorter than P1? But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then it's less than 1 times. So the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, but the options have A) ~0.36, D) ~0.85, etc. So the period of planet 2 is longer or shorter than planet 1?

Wait, let me re-express the relationship. Let me write:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

But K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, so K1/K2 =5/7.

Thus, (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364

So P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364

Wait, but wait, in the formula, if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, let me rederive it more carefully.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / (c (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

Assuming that M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p ) / (c M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

So K ∝ M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, M_p is same for both, M_star same for both. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Thus, K1 = k / P1^(1/3)

K2 = k / P2^(1/3)

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

So, (P2 / P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2= k / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, but wait. Let me substitute numbers.

K1 =5, K2=7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

(P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125 / 343 ≈ approximately 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

But the question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So it's 0.36 times, which is less than 1, meaning it's shorter. So the ratio is P2/P1 ≈ 0.36.

But wait, the question says, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So it's 0.36 times longer? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because P2 is shorter than P1, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, meaning planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1, so it's about 0.36 times as long. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Well, it's 0.36 times as long, which is less than one. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Are the periods P1 and P2 such that P2 is longer or shorter than P1? Because K is larger for planet #2, which would imply a shorter period.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. So P2 is shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, so it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer is 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let's double-check the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π c)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps a more standard form is K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(something)), but perhaps it's better to go back to the formula.

Alternatively, another source says K is given by:

K = ( (P * G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / (2 π c (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

Assuming M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (P G )^(1/3) M_p ) / (2 π c M_star^(2/3) ) )

So, K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So back to the problem. K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But since K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Because K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

So, (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2

Which gives P1/P2 = 343 / 125 ≈ 2.744

Thus, P2 = P1 * (125/343 ) ≈ P1 * 0.364

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Thus, the question is, "how many times longer is P2 than P1?" So it's 0.36 times as long, meaning it's about 0.36 times longer. So the answer is option A) ~0.36

Wait, but the question is phrased as, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is shorter, then it's less than 1 times longer. So the ratio is 0.36, so the answer is A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), assuming the planet's mass \( M_p \) is much smaller than the star's mass \( M_\text{star} \). Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that both planets have similar masses to Neptune and their host stars have masses similar to the Sun, the ratio of their orbital periods can be determined using the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes. For planet #1 and planet #2, the semi-amplitudes are \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), respectively. The relationship between the periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately \( 0.36 \).
