Okay, so I've got this question about a metric in general relativity, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like Euclidean or hyperbolic. But what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a saddle shape.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere when r=2. I'm a bit confused because the metric doesn't look like the standard pseudosphere metric. Let me recall: the standard metric for a pseudosphere in Poincaré coordinates might be something like ds² = (dr² + dz²)/z² or something similar? Or maybe in another coordinate system, like (dx² + dy² + dz²)/(z²). Hmm, not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, looking at the given metric, it's written in terms of x and y. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So if I set z = sqrt(4 - x² - y²), then the denominator becomes z², but I'm not sure. Let me think about the form of the metric. It's ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero,
