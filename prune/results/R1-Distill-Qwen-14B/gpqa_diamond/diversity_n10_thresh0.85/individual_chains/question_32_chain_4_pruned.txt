Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the mass of this nucleus is. Li with 3 neutrons means it's Li-6, right? Because lithium typically has 3 protons and adding 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So the atomic number Z is 3. The mass number A is 6. 

The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons. I remember that the mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Let me double-check that. Oh wait, I think the proton is 938.272 MeV/c² and neutron is 939.565 MeV/c². So I should use these more precise values.

So for Li-6: it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass would be (3 * 938.272) + (3 * 939.565) MeV/c².

Let me calculate that. 3*938.272 is 2814.816 MeV. 3*939.565 is 2818.695 MeV. Adding them together: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. That's the total rest energy. But wait, considering binding energy, the actual mass might be a bit less. But for heavy ions in colliders, sometimes they approximate using the sum of individual nucleons. So I'll proceed with this value unless I remember a different approach.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to find the mass of Li-6 using the standard atomic weight. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017586 u (atomic mass units). Oh right, because the exact mass can be found in tables. The atomic mass M = 6.017586 u.
