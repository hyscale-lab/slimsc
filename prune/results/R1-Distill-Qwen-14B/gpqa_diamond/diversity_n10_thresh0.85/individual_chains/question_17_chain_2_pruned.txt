Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. And they want the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with EDTA, the concentration of the free metal ion is super low because EDTA is a strong chelator. The formation constant (K) tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable, so free metal ions are low.

The formula I think is K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, I should make sure about the stoichiometry. The problem says it's a 1:1 complex, 1 Ca²+ and 1 EDTA^4-.

So, [Ca-EDTA] is given as 0.02 M. We can assume that all the Ca²+ is complexed because the K is so large, which makes sense because K=5e10 is pretty big. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

So, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. K is 5e10. We need to find [Ca²+].

But wait, what about the EDTA? If we start with the complex, but where does the EDTA come from? Or is the initial EDTA concentration provided? Hmm, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, I think the total concentration of EDTA would be from the complex, assuming that the EDTA is all in the complex form because K is so large.

Wait, but in reality, EDTA can exist in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal. So maybe we can ignore that and assume that EDTA is fully deprotonated, which is EDTA^4-. So, [EDTA^4-] is equal to the concentration of the complex, but wait, no, because each complex has one EDTA. So, [EDTA^4-] would be the same as the concentration of the complex? Or is
