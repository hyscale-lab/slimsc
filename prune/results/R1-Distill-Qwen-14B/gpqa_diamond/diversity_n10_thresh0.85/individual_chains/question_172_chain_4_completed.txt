Okay, so I've got this problem here about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as those in star 2. Oh wait, wait—wait, I think this refers to the excitation level, which is related to the Boltzmann distribution. Right, Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium, which is LTE here.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38 is the Boltzmann constant times something? Because Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait! So the energy difference ΔE is equal to k times the temperature? Or wait, no—the energy levels are quantized, and the probability is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The ratio of the populations of two energy levels (n_upper and n_lower) is given by (n_upper/n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ). Here, E_upper is higher than E_lower, so the exponent is negative.

In this problem, the excitation level in star 1 is twice that of star 2. But wait, what's the ratio exactly? Let me read again. "Iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star 2." So, for a specific energy level, the excitation is higher in star 1.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of the populations. Let me denote the ratio as (n1/n2), where n is the population of the excited state in each star.

The problem says n1 = 2 * n2. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2. But wait, is that correct? Or is it the other way around? Because if star_1 has atoms twice as excited, maybe the population is higher there.

Wait, for each star, the excited state population is n1 and n2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2. Or perhaps, I should think about the ratio of excited to lower state. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem says the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh, maybe the excitation refers to the number in the excited state relative to the ground state. So for star_1, the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is twice that of star_2's (n_upper' / n_lower').

So, for star 1: (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But considering the Boltzmann equation, (n_upper/n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming that for both stars, the ratio of statistical weights (g_upper/g_lower) is the same, because it's the same element and same transition. So we can ignore the g factors if they're equal, or else the ratio would be same for both stars. So let me denote that (g1/g2) = constant.

So, for star 1: (n1_upper/n1_lower) = A * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))

For star 2: (n2_upper/n2_lower) = A * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So the ratio of (n1_upper/n1_lower) to (n2_upper/n2_lower) is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Because when you take the ratio of the two expressions, the A's cancel, and you have exp[ (-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Given that (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower), so the ratio is 2. So:

2 = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, let me compute that. Let me write the equation again.

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, wait, because:

ΔE/(k T) in the exponent for each star, and when taking the ratio, T1 is in the denominator for star_1, T2 for star_2.

Wait, let me redo the ratio step:

(n1_upper / n1_lower) / (n2_upper / n2_lower) = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

Which is equal to exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

So that equals 2, so:

exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take ln:

(ΔE/k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2)

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

But wait, the problem states that ΔE is approximately 1.38e-23 J. Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * something?

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So k is same as 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is k * 1 K? Because 1.38e-23 J = k * 1 K. So,

(ΔE) = k * 1 K.

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln 2 * k ) / (k) ) = ln(2)

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2 )

Hmm, but which way? Let's see.

So 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2 )
=> 1/T2 = 1/T1 + 0.693 approx.

But the options are in terms of T1 and T2. Let me rearrange.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

So,

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Because,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So, this is the equation we're getting.

Looking at the options, option D has ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the equation is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So this would be option D.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2) ]

Yes, that's exactly what we have. So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the value of the Boltzmann constant \( k \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = g \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g \) is the ratio of statistical weights, and \( T \) is the temperature of the star. For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of excitation levels is:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}.
\]

Taking the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two stars:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}}}{\frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since the ratio of excitation levels is 2, we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Given that \( \Delta E = k \), this simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting in terms of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
