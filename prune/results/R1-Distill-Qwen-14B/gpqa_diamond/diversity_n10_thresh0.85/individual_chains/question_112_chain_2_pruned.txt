Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I know that these are the standard basis states for spin-½ particles. The coefficients here are (1+i) and (2-i), but since the state is proportional to that, I'll need to normalize it.

The question asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait. Let me think about that matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0  ]

Wait, no, wait. Because Aij = ħ/2 when i≠j. So for a 2x2 matrix, A_12 and A_21 are ħ/2, and A_11 and A_22 are zero. So this matrix is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. Wait, but that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So this operator A is (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, but the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So this operator A is proportional to σ_x, so its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. So any measurement of A will project the state into either |+x> or |-x> states.

So the first part of the question is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, when the state is |alpha>. Also, find the average value of the operator A.

So the plan is:

1. Normalize the state |alpha> because it's only given as proportional. Find the normalization constant.

2. Express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of operator A, which is the |+x> and |-x> basis.

3. Calculate the probabilities of each eigenstate by taking the square of the amplitude.

4. Compute the expectation value of A, which is the average.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in the |alpha> state.

But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to diagonalize the operator A and express |alpha> in that basis. Let me think.

First, let's tackle step 1: normalizing |alpha>.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. But it's proportional to that, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> multiplied by some normalization factor.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So compute the inner product.

Compute (1+i)*(1-i) + (2 -i)*(2 +i) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) for the first term, since it's the conjugate times the original. Similarly, for the second term, it's (2 -i)*(2 + i). So:

| (1+i) |^2 + | (2 -i) |^2.

Compute each modulus squared.

For (1+i): |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

For (2 -i): |2 -i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So total modulus squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So now, |alpha> is normalized.

Next, find the eigenstates of operator A. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, because when we measure A, the outcome is the eigenvalue corresponding to whichever eigenstate |alpha> is projected into. The probabilities will be the square of the coefficients in this expansion.

So, let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

We can find c_+ and c_- by taking inner products.

Compute c_+ = < +x | alpha >,
c_- = < -x | alpha >.

Let's compute these.

First, express |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So,

c_+ = < +x | alpha > = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Compute this inner product:

[ (1+i) * <up|up> + (2 -i) * <down|up> ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Similarly, <up|up> is 1, and <down|up> is 0.

So,

c_+ = (1+i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Similarly, compute c_-:

c_- = < -x | alpha > = [ <up| - <down| ] / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Inner product:

(1+i) * <up|up> + (2 -i) * <down|up> ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Again, <down|up> is zero. So,

c_- = (1+i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, that can't be right. Because |+x> and |-x> are orthogonal, and |alpha> is a combination of them, their coefficients sum of squares should be 1.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for c_+.

Wait, let me write it again.

c_+ is the inner product of |+x> and |alpha>.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

c_+ = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * [1/sqrt(2)] * <up|up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [1/sqrt(2)] * <down|up>.

Wait, no, inner product is sum over i,j (something).

Wait, more accurately:

c_+ = [ (1+i) <up| + (2 -i) <down| ] / sqrt(7) ) multiplied by [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) ).

Wait, no, the inner product is:

< +x | alpha > = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, expanding this, we get:

(1+i) <up|up> / sqrt(2*7) + (2 -i) <down|up> / sqrt(2*7) + (1+i) <up|down> / sqrt(2*7) + (2 -i) <down|down> / sqrt(2*7).

But <up|down> is zero, and <down|up> is zero.

So, only the first and last terms remain.

So,

c_+ = (1+i) * 1 / sqrt(14) + (2 -i) * 1 / sqrt(14) ?

Wait no: because the terms are:

(1+i) * <up|up> / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) + (2 -i) * <down|down> / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express:

Each term in the expansion is:
