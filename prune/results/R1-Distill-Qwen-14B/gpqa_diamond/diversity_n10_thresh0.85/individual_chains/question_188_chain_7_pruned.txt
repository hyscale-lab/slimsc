Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

Wait, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal. Oh right, so in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Hmm, I think interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell, the 'a' parameter. So a = 10 Angstrom here.

Now, the interplanar distance for a crystal plane (hkl) is calculated using the formula from the Bragg's law context. I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - sqrt(2)(hk + hl + kl) ) ) or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but this isn't a cubic system. Oh right, because in rhombohedral, the angles aren't 90 degrees.

So the formula must be more complicated. Let me recall. I think the general formula for the interplanar distance d in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c (and angles between them) is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/(a²) ) + (k²/(b²) ) + (l²/(c²)) - 2(hk cosβγ)/(a b) - 2(hl cosαγ)/(a c) - 2(kl cosαβ)/(b c) ) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, a = b = c, right? Because all sides are equal. And the angles between them are the same too. So alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So the formula should simplify. 

Wait, but for rhombohedral, the angles are all equal, but not necessarily 90 degrees. So all a, b, c are the same, let's say a. So a = b = c = 10 Angstrom.

So substituting into the formula, since a = b = c, the expression becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +
