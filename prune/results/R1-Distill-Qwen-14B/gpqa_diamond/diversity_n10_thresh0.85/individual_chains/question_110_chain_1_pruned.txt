Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my star observations, but I'll try to think this through.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various parameters and asks which ones can be seen by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key is understanding the brightness limits of each spectrograph.

First, I should recall the brightness limits. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, wait—brighter than 17? Oh, right, because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So anything with V mag less than or equal to 17 is observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V mag ≤16 for detection.

So each star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. But wait, some stars have apparent magnitudes given, others have absolute magnitudes. Oh right, absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs, while apparent is how it appears from Earth. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for the stars that have absolute given.

Let me list each star and calculate their apparent V magnitude where necessary.

Starting with Star1: It's given an absolute V mag of 15.5 and is at 10 pc. So apparent mag is same as absolute, right? Because 10 pc is the standard distance. So V=15.5. That's way below 17 for ESPRESSO and 16 for HIRES. So Star1 can be detected by both. But wait, let me check the options. Option D says Star1 and Star4. Hmm, I'll keep that in mind.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So for ESPRESSO, 16.5 is less than 17, so yes. For HIRES, needs to be ≤16. 16.5 is higher, so no. So Star2 is only detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So Star2 can't be in the correct answer.

Star3: Absolute mag 15.5, located at
