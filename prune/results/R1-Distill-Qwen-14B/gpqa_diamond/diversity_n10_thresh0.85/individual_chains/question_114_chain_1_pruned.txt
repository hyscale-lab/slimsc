Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to work through it.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait a second. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when you add a nitrile group like NaCN, I think that's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, butan-2-one has a ketone group. Oh wait, wait, maybe this is a nucleophilic addition reaction. Because ketones can undergo addition, especially if the nucleophile is strong enough.

In the product, the ketone is replaced by a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add to the carbonyl group. So normally, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. Wait, but NaCN is providing the CN- nucleophile. So the reaction would be the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the product would have an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon that was the carbonyl.

So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. The original butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN- and maybe some acid, like H+ as a catalyst, you protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So the reagent A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or maybe something else.

Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or maybe NaHSO3. So for the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+ or NaHSO3. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-; but in this case, we're just using acid, so H3O+ makes sense as the catalyst for the addition of CN- to the ketone.

So for reaction A, the reagent is H3O+. So in the options, which have A as H3O+? Looking at the options: A) A = H3O+, B=HCl; B) same A, B=CH3COOH; C) A=NaHSO3, B=HCl; D) A= same as C, B=CH3COOH. So for the first reaction, the correct reagent for A should be H3O+, so options A or B for the first part.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (which is in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So how does that happen?

The typical way to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is through hydrolysis.
