Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is described as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Li is lithium. The isotope must be something like Li-6 or Li-7. Wait, because lithium has 3 protons normally. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons)=6. So it's Li-6. That means the nucleus is a lithium-6 ion. But wait, in a collider, they usually use ions with a charge. So maybe it's like a Li^+ ion, meaning it has lost one electron, so the charge is +1. But I'm not sure if that affects the calculation here. I think for energy calculations, the mass is what matters, whether it's Li-6 or something else.

So the problem is about relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma.

Let me compute gamma first. v = 0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that square root. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy E is gamma multiplied by m c squared. So I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a lithium-6 atom is roughly known. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number to get per nucleus. Let me think. Wait, more accurately, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But I should get the exact value.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0141 u. So each nucleus has a mass of about 6.0141 u. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.94, but that's the average of different isotopes. But in this case, it's specifically Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. So the exact mass is 6.0141 u. So each Li-6 nucleus is 6.0141 u.

But wait, how do I convert that to kilograms? Because E=gamma*m*c² requires mass in kg.

1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.6605
