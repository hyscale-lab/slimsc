Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the situation is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Astronomers found exoplanets around each using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The orbits are circular, so that's good—no eccentricity complications there.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When the star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift to a shorter wavelength (blue shift), and when it moves away, the lines shift to a longer wavelength (red shift). The periodic shift in the spectral lines tells us about the planet's presence and some of its orbital parameters.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, whereas Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass and orbit of the planet. The formula I recall is something like the velocity semi-amplitude (K) being proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, and the denominator becomes 1. So that part drops out. Also, since both planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than their Sun-like stars, M_p << M_star. So the denominator (1 + M_p/M_star) can be approximated as 1, so that term is negligible.

Wait, but in this problem, the RV shift is given as the maximum shift, which would be the maximum velocity. The RV velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is K = (v) which is related to (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(1/3)) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3), but I may be mixing up some terms.

Wait, no, let me get the right formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (P) / (2π) ) )^(-1/3) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2)

But since e is zero and M_p is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies. So, let's see:

K ≈ ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (2π)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star
