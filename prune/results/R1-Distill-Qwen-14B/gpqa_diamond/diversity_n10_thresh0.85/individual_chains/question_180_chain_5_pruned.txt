Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of particles with charges. I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge. Right, e is about 1.6e-19 coulombs, so each charge would be 3.2e-19 C. But wait, 13 particles, so 12 are constrained at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the setup must be something like point P has one charge, and around it, 12 charges are each placed 2 meters away.

Wait, but are those 12 charges arranged in a particular way? Like, maybe on a sphere around P? Or maybe in some other configuration? Oh, right, when multiple charges are placed around a central charge, the potential energy can be calculated based on their positions. But since they're all at the same distance from P, perhaps it's a symmetrical arrangement, like on a sphere.

But wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Energy in electrostatic systems is usually potential energy because kinetic energy depends on motion, and if the system is isolated, maybe it's in a static state. So I think this is about calculating the electrostatic potential energy of the configuration.

So the system consists of two parts: the potential energy between the 13th charge (fixed at P) and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves. Because all the 12 are at the same distance from P, but what about their distances from each other?

Wait, if the 12 charges are each 2 meters from P, they form a regular dodecahedron? Or perhaps a sphere with radius 2 meters. But if they're all on a sphere, the distance between any two charges would be the chord length of the sphere. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained at 2 m from P, but nothing about their arrangement relative to each other. So maybe we're supposed to assume that they're all very far apart compared to 2 meters, so their mutual interactions can be neglected? Or perhaps not.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy
