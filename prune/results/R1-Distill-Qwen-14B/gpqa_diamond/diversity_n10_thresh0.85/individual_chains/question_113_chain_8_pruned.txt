Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different formulas, each with varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens. Let me go through each piece of data one by one and see what I can figure out.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H groups. A broad peak at around 3000 suggests either an alcohol (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak around 2500-3300, sometimes even a bit lower. Hmm, but 3000 is on the higher side for that. Could it be an alcohol?

Looking at the other strong peaks: 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is a strong one. I think that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 peak might be related to conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, 1650 is in the range of conjugated carbonyls, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system. Alternatively, it could be from an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Oh, but the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so there's probably a double bond (like in an alkene) in the structure.

So putting that together: IR shows an O-H group and a carbonyl. Then, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, meaning there's a double bond somewhere. So maybe the compound is something like a ketone with an alcohol group, or perhaps an ester with an alcohol? Or maybe a conjugated system.

Next, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what's m/z 45? I should think about common fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of something like a methyl group attached to something else, or perhaps a ketene ion, but more likely, it's the loss of a fragment. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) has a mass of 91, so that's not it. Maybe a CH3CO+ fragment? Wait, CH3CO is 59. Hmm, wait another approach.

If the molecular ion is, say, for C6H10O, the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(16)=72+10+16=98. So if the fragment is 45, maybe it's a smaller piece. 45 is also the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone (58? No, wait: C3H6O is 58. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think. 45 would be the molecular weight of CH3CHO (acetaldehyde), but that's 44. Wait, no: carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So CH3CHO is C2H4O: 2*12 +4*1 +16 =24+4+16=44. Close to 45, but not exactly.

Alternatively, maybe m/z 45 is from a CH2CH2O group? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, another approach: what if it's an acetylation or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the break off of a fragment that's (CH3)2CO+ (acetone), but that's 58. Hmm. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2=CH-O group? Not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could be a (CH2)2O group, but that's 48 (CH2)2O would be 48, since 2*14 (CH2 is 14) plus 16 (O) would be 44? Wait, 2 CH2 groups: 2*(12+2) =28, plus O is 16, so 44, which is close to 45. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2=CH-O- group, but I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO+ group, which is 43, but 45 is 2 more. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula can be deduced more directly. Let's look at the options again:

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, all are C6 with varying O and H.

The IR's 1700 and 1650 cm^-1
