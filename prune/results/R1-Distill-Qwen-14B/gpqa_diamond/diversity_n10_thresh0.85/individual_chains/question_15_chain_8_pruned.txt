Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

So, the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose which one to observe for transits because they have limited time. They already detected these using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Both planets have the same mass. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3. But wait, orbital period relates to how often they transit. A shorter period means they orbit closer in, right? So they might transit more often. But transit probability is another thing.

The host stars have the same radius, but the star with Planet_1 is more massive. Host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. Hmm, so the stars' masses are different, but radii are the same. Wait, same radii, but different masses? That's interesting. So probably, the more massive star is younger, maybe, or just denser. But for transit probability, I think the main factors are the size of the planet, the size of the star, and the orbital distance.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher if the planet's orbit is edge-on. But how does the orbital period and star's mass relate to that? Oh, wait, the probability is also related to the planet's semi-major axis and the star's radius.

Wait, let me recall the transit probability formula. The geometric probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is given by P = (R_star / a) Ã— ( (R_planet + R_star) / R_star )^2. Wait, no, maybe it's P = (R_star / a) * (something with angles). Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the area where the planet's position relative to the star must be for a transit to occur is a function of that ratio.

Wait, I think the probability is approximately (R_* / a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait
