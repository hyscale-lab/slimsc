Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and pH changes along the way.

Alright, let me read the details again. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

First, I think I should find the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half of the original, right? Because concentration is moles over volume. So original moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles, so moles stay the same, but volume is 40 cm³. So new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³ water, which is 0.02 L, so total is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that makes sense.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. So I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let's tackle the 25% titration first. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Wait, how do I find how much NaOH is added at 25%?

I think the moles of acetic acid initially (after dilution) is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 0.025 M is 0.025 moles per liter, and 0.04 L is 40 mL. So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol? Wait wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 mol. Then when diluted to 40 cm³, the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, so the moles are still 0.001 mol.

So for the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH needed would be equal to the moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ NaOH added.

At 25% titration, 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Now, to find the pH at 25% titration.

Wait, when you add a strong base like NaOH to a weak acid like acetic acid, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So, the NaOH will neutralize some of the acetic acid. Let's find how much is left.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-)
