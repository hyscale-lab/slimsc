Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics—1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor this ratio changes—no spots versus with spots.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature and the energy difference between the states.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the ratio of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. Wait, because when the ratio decreases, that means n1/n2 is getting smaller. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, let me make sure. The ratio is (n1/n2) when the star has spots. When the star doesn't have spots, the Teff is higher. So I think the ratio without spots is higher than the ratio with spots, which aligns with the problem statement that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes. So I think they're asking for the ratio of the ratio when no spots (R0) to when spots are present (R1), so R0/R1.

Wait, the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) multiplied by the inverse of the statistical weights (g1/g2). But wait, wait, the Boltzmann factor is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So, if E2 > E1, then (n1/n2) would be proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )^{-1} ? No, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So (n2/n1) would be less than 1, which makes sense as higher energy states have fewer particles.

But in our case, the ratio (n1/n2) is (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So, as temperature increases, the exponential term increases, leading to higher (n1/n2). So when the star's effective temperature is higher (no spots), the ratio (n1/n2) is higher. When the star is cooler (spots), the ratio is lower.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K, lower than 6000 K when no spots. So the ratio (n1/n2) is lower when there are spots, which aligns with the question.

We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me denote this as Factor = [(n1/n2)_0 ] / [(n1/n2)_1 ] 

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T0) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ]

The g factors (statistical weights) cancel out. So Factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/(T0) - 1/(T1)] )

Wait, wait, let me make sure. No spots: T0 = 6000 K. Spots: T1=5500 K.

So the exponent becomes [ (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T0 - 1/T1) ) ]

Wait that's not right. Wait, the exponent for no spots is (E2-E1)/(k T0), and for spots it's (E2-E1)/(k T1).
