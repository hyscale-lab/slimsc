Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a given Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and in this case, it's calcium. 

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, and the pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or anything. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is room temperature. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

Wait, formation constant... I think that's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2−, and K would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Right, because K is the product of the concentrations of the products over the reactants, each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

But wait, the complex is given in 0.02 M solution. Since it's a 1:1 complex, the initial concentrations would be: [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] would be zero? No, wait, that's not right. Because in solution, some of the complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. 

But wait, the problem is asking about the concentration of calcium ions. So I need to find [Ca²+]. Let's think about the dissociation. The complex dissociates as follows:

CaEDTA^2− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

The formation constant K is given, which is 5e10. So the dissociation constant would be 1/K, right? Because K for formation is [complex]/([metal][ligand]), so the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have K_dissociation = 1/K_formation. So K_d = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, let's model the situation. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's say that 'x' is the amount that dissociates. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

Wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and in solution, it exists in various protonated forms. Oh wait, but the problem says pH is ideal. I think that means the pH is such that EDTA is in its most suitable form, Y^4- (the deprotonated form), so I don't have to account for the different species. So I can treat EDTA as Y^4-.

So the dissociation equation is as I wrote before. The K_d is 2e-11, so:

K_d = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA^2−] = x * x / (0.02 -
