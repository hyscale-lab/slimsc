Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the information given. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, waitâ€”wait, no, actually, wait. V magnitude brighter than 17 means the star is fainter than 17? Or is it that they can observe up to 17? No, wait, the way it's worded: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, no, because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if I'm understanding correctly, ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 17. Because brighter stars have smaller magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, which is like, a brighter object, so they can see it. But wait, wait, no, the wording is: "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. So I think that means the apparent magnitude (V) is less than 17? Let me clarify. Oh, wait, no. If a star's apparent magnitude is 17, it's quite faint. So if a telescope can observe stars
