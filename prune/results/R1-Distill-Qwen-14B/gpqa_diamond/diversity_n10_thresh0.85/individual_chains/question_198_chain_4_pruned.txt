Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the different complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. So, I remember that stability constants are related to the formation of complexes. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. Each beta corresponds to a different complex. The first complex, Co(SCN)1^+, has beta1=9. The second, maybe Co(SCN)2^+ with beta2=40, and so on up to beta4=16 for the fourth complex. Wait, no, beta4 is 16, which is actually lower than beta3 (63). That's interesting. So the third complex is the most stable.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands, so that would be the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex. Because I remember that Co with two SCN- is blue, while more ligands might change the color. So, the species we're interested in is the one where each Co^2+ is surrounded by two SCN^- ions. That's the one with beta2=40, right?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Stability constants are for each step of complex formation. So, β1 would be the formation of [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 would be adding another SCN^- to form [Co(SCN)_2]^+ (since each step is adding one more ligand). So, the overall stability constant for the second complex would be β1 multiplied by β2. Because each beta is the stepwise formation. So the overall beta for [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is β1 * β2 = 9*40=360? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up
