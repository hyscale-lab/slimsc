Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

Next, the problem is about relativistic energy. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty fast, so relativistic effects are definitely in play here. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy; you have to consider the kinetic energy as well.

Wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. So that's the total energy each nucleus has when it's moving at 0.96c. So I need to calculate the relativistic energy of the Li-6 nucleus moving at this speed.

I think the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to compute gamma first.

Let me plug in v = 0.96c into the equation. So v squared is (0.96c)^2. Then v²/c² is 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.571428... So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, let me compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely. Hmm, 0.28 squared is exactly 0.0784, right? So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Okay, so moving on. Now, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, the mass of a nucleus is a bit tricky because it's the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But wait, maybe for this problem, it's acceptable to approximate the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact mass of Li-6. But since I don't have that data here, maybe the problem expects me to use the atomic mass as the rest mass. Let me think.

Wait, the problem might be using the concept of the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the protons and neutrons' rest masses. Because the binding energy is considered negligible in the rest mass calculation unless specified. Or wait, no, the rest mass includes the binding energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula treats the nucleus as a single particle with mass m = mass number * mass of a nucleon. Since Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), maybe we approximate its mass as 6 times the mass of a proton or a neutron.

But wait, wait. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So perhaps I should take an average or use one of them. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the atomic mass, which would include electrons for neutral atoms.

Wait, but the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So for an isotope, the atomic mass is approximately the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons and binding energy. But for the nucleus itself, the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding, which is negligible at this level? Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the mass of the nucleus is m = 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. Wait, but that might not be accurate because neutrons have slightly different masses. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is taken as the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. But without exact data, perhaps I should proceed with an approximate calculation.

Wait, let me think. The mass of a Li-6 atom is 6.017569 × 10^-27 kg, I think. But perhaps I can get the atomic mass from a periodic table. Let me try to remember. Oh, but without exact data, maybe I can find the mass in terms of u (atomic mass units).

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as 6 times the mass of a proton, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus in terms of the mass of a nucleon. Let's think about this more carefully.

Wait, another approach: The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons minus the binding energy. But the binding energy for Li-6 is about 6 MeV, I think. So, maybe the mass is approximately 3*(m_p) + 3*(m_n) - (binding energy in mass units).

But without exact values, perhaps I should proceed with the rest mass as m = 6 * m_n, since neutron is about 1.0089 amu, but wait, the exact values are tricky. Alternatively, maybe the problem just uses the rest mass as 6 times the proton mass, which is roughly 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV/c².

Wait, but wait a second. The rest mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So, for Li-6 nucleus, the sum would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

But that's without considering the binding energy. The binding energy for Li-6 is about 6.992 MeV, but wait, the mass defect. Wait, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum because of binding energy. So, the actual nucleus mass would be sum - (binding energy / c²). But wait, the binding energy is given in MeV, so to convert it to mass units, since 1 MeV ≈ 1.78266 ×10^-27 kg, but perhaps I can compute the mass defect as binding energy in MeV divided by c², but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and just take the nucleus mass as 6 * m_nucleon (assuming same mass for protons and neutrons). But that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass, but then I'd have to account for electrons as well.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the problem again. The question is about the energy of the collider, which would be the total energy (kinetic + rest) of each nucleus. So E = γ * m * c².

But I'm not sure about m. Maybe the problem assumes that the mass is approximately 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. So let's proceed with that approximation.

So m = 6 * m_p = 6 * 938.272 MeV/c² = 5629.632 MeV/c².

But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass. Let me try to remember the exact mass of Li-6. I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017569 u. Hmm, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.017569 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u ≈ 6.017569 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.017569 * 931.5 ≈ 16.38 MeV.

So total is approximately 5605.38 MeV/c².

Wait, but that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Li has 3 electrons. So if we're considering the nucleus, we should subtract the mass of the electrons. Each electron is about 0.511 MeV/c², so 3 * 0.511 = 1.533 MeV.

So the nucleus mass would be 5605.38 - 1.533 ≈ 5603.85 MeV/c².

But wait, that's the atomic mass minus electrons. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass of the nucleus is approximately this value. So m ≈ 5603.85 MeV/c².

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach, such as using the rest mass as m = 6 * m_p, which would be 5629.632 MeV/c².

But without exact data, perhaps I should proceed with the approximation that m is about 6 times the proton mass. Let's proceed.

So m ≈ 6 * 938.272 MeV/c² = 5629.632 MeV/c².

So now, E = gamma * m c².

We have gamma ≈ 3.5714.

So E = 3.5714 * 5629.632 MeV.

Let me compute that:

3.5714 * 5629.632 ≈ ?

Let me approximate. 3.5 * 5629.632 = 5629.632 * 3 = 16888.896, plus 5629.632 * 0.5 = 2814.816. So 16888.896 + 2814.816 = 19703.712 MeV.

But wait, 0.0714 of 5629.632 is approximately 5629.632 * 0.07 = 394.074, and 0.0014 would be about 7.88 MeV. So total extra is about 394 + 7.88 = 401.88 MeV.

So total E ≈ 19703.712 + 401.88 ≈ 20105.59 MeV, which is about 20.105 GeV.

Wait, but that's if gamma is exactly 3.5714 and m is 5629.632 MeV. But let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely. Let's recompute gamma.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

So gamma is approximately 3.5714285714.

Now, m = 6 * 938.272 MeV/c² = 5629.632 MeV/c².

So E = 3.5714285714 * 5629.632 MeV.

Let me compute this multiplication step by step.

3.5714285714 * 5629.632.

Hmm, let's break it down:

3 * 5629.632 = 16888.896.

0.5714285714 is approximately 4/7.

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.57142857.

So 4/7 of 5629.632.

4/7 * 5629.632 = let's compute that.

5629.632 / 7 = 804.233142857.

Multiply by 4: 804.233142857 * 4 = 3216.93257143.

So 3 * 5629.632 = 16888.896.

Plus 4/7 * 5629.632 ≈ 3216.93257143.

Total E ≈ 16888.896 + 3216.93257143 = 20105.8285714 MeV ≈ 20.1058 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's 20.1058 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is pretty close. But why the slight discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass m. Maybe the mass of the nucleus is not exactly 6 * m_p. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each about 938 MeV.

Wait, let me compute the exact sum. 3 * 938.272 (protons) + 3 * 939.565 (neutrons) = 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

E = 3.57142857 * 5633.511 MeV.

Let me compute that.

3 * 5633.511 = 16900.533 MeV.

0.57142857 * 5633.511 = ?

Compute 0.5 * 5633.511 = 2816.7555 MeV.

0.07142857 * 5633.511 ≈ Let's compute 5633.511 * 0.07 = 394.34577 MeV.

And 5633.511 * 0.00142857 ≈ approx 8.05 MeV.

So total for 0.07142857 is about 394.34577 + 8.05 ≈ 402.4 MeV.

So 0.5 part is 2816.7555 + 402.4 ≈ 3219.1555 MeV.

So total E = 16900.533 + 3219.1555 ≈ 20119.6885 MeV ≈ 20.1197 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.12 GeV. So when I use the sum of protons and neutrons, I get around 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but what about the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus? Let me think again. The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is a little tricky. Let me try to find the atomic mass.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017569 u. As I computed earlier, that's about 6.017569 * 931.5 MeV/c² ≈ 5605.38 MeV/c². But that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. So the nucleus mass would be 5605.38 MeV/c² minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Each electron is about 0.5109989461 MeV/c². So 3 electrons are 3 * 0.5109989461 ≈ 1.5329968 MeV/c².

So the nucleus mass is 5605.38 - 1.533 ≈ 5603.847 MeV/c².

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the atomic mass is for the neutral atom, which includes 3 electrons. So the mass of the nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

So m_nucleus = 5603.847 MeV/c².

Using this m, E = gamma * m.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5603.847 MeV.

Let me compute this.

3 * 5603.847 = 16811.541 MeV.

0.57142857 * 5603.847 = ?

Compute 0.5 * 5603.847 = 2801.9235 MeV.

0.07142857 * 5603.847 ≈ Let's compute 5603.847 * 0.07 = 392.26929 MeV.

And 5603.847 * 0.00142857 ≈ approx 8.00 MeV (since 5603.847 * 0.001 is 5.6038, so 0.00142857 is about 8.00 MeV).

So 0.07142857 part is about 392.26929 + 8.00 ≈ 400.26929 MeV.

So the 0.5 part is 2801.9235 + 400.26929 ≈ 3202.1928 MeV.

Total E ≈ 16811.541 + 3202.1928 ≈ 20013.733 MeV ≈ 20.0137 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.014 GeV, which is lower than the earlier 20.1197 GeV. But wait, that's when using the exact atomic mass.

Hmm, but that's about 20.014 GeV, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 20.014 is closer to option C (20.132) than to option D, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation or perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the mass is just 6 times the mass of a proton, which would give 6 * 938.272 MeV/c² = 5629.632 MeV/c².

So E = 3.57142857 * 5629.632 MeV.

Let me compute that:

3.57142857 * 5629.632.

Compute 3 * 5629.632 = 16888.896.

0.57142857 * 5629.632 = ?

0.5 * 5629.632 = 2814.816.

0.07142857 * 5629.632 ≈ Let's compute 5629.632 * 0.07 = 394.07424.

5629.632 * 0.00142857 ≈ approx 8.04 MeV.

So 0.07142857 part ≈ 394.07424 + 8.04 ≈ 402.11424 MeV.

So 0.5 part is 2814.816 + 402.11424 ≈ 3216.93024 MeV.

Total E = 16888.896 + 3216.93024 ≈ 20105.82624 MeV ≈ 20.1058 GeV.

So about 20.106 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Hmm, but why the discrepancy when using the exact atomic mass minus electrons? Because in that case, I got around 20.0137 GeV, which is lower than expected. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of protons and neutrons, which gives about 20.12 GeV, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Let me proceed with that.

So with m = 6 * 938.272 MeV/c² = 5629.632 MeV/c².

E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5629.632 MeV.

Which is approximately 20.1058 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5629.632.

Let me compute it step by step:

First, 3 * 5629.632 = 16888.896.

0.57142857 * 5629.632 = ?

Let me compute 5629.632 * 0.5 = 2814.816.

Then 5629.632 * 0.07142857.

Compute 5629.632 * 0.07 = 394.07424.

5629.632 * 0.00142857:

0.001 * 5629.632 = 5.629632.

0.00042857 * 5629.632 ≈ 5629.632 * (3/7)*0.0001? Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 5629.632 * 0.00142857.

Alternatively, 5629.632 * 0.00142857 ≈ 5629.632 * (1/700) ≈ approximately 8.04233 MeV.

So total 0.07142857 part is 394.07424 + 8.04233 ≈ 402.11657 MeV.

So the 0.5 part is 2814.816 + 402.11657 ≈ 3216.93257 MeV.

So total E = 16888.896 + 3216.93257 = 20105.82857 MeV, which is 20.1058 GeV.

So approximately 20.106 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close but a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of the proton and neutron.

Wait, the proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3 protons + 3 neutrons.

Total mass = 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV/c².

So E = gamma * m = 3.57142857 * 5633.511.

Let me compute that exactly:

3.57142857 * 5633.511.

Let me compute this as:

3 * 5633.511 = 16900.533.

0.57142857 * 5633.511.

Compute 0.5 * 5633.511 = 2816.7555.

0.07142857 * 5633.511.

Compute 5633.511 * 0.07 = 394.34577.

5633.511 * 0.00142857 ≈ 5633.511 * (1/700) ≈ 8.047873 MeV.

So 0.07142857 part: 394.34577 + 8.047873 ≈ 402.39364 MeV.

So the 0.5 part is 2816.7555 + 402.39364 ≈ 3219.14914 MeV.

Total: 16900.533 + 3219.14914 = 20119.68214 MeV ≈ 20.1197 GeV.

So that's about 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Maybe I should use a calculator approach.

gamma = 3.5714285714.

m = 5633.511 MeV/c².

E = 3.5714285714 * 5633.511.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 * 5633.511.

3.5714285714 is equal to 25/7, because 3.5714285714 is 25/7 (since 25 ÷ 7 ≈ 3.57142857).

So 25/7 * 5633.511 = (25 * 5633.511) /7.

25 * 5633.511 = 5633.511 * 25.

Let me compute that:

5633.511 * 25 = 5633.511 * (20 +5) = 112670.22 + 28167.555 = 140837.775.

Now, divide by 7: 140837.775 /7 ≈ 20119.68214 MeV ≈ 20.1197 GeV.

So the energy is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So with all that calculation, I think the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the particle, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus
Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using approximate proton and neutron masses (\( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), \( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Substitute \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m \approx 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) into the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3 \times 5633.511 = 16900.533 \, \text{MeV}
\]

\[
0.5714 \times 5633.511 \approx 3219.149 \, \text{MeV}
\]

\[
E = 16900.533 + 3219.149 = 20119.682 \, \text{MeV} \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]

Answer: C
