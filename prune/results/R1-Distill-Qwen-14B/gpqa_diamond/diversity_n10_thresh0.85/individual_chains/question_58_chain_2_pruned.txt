Okay, so I've got this physics question here. Hmm, the question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics. 

Wait, I remember from my studies that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. These infinities can cause problems, so regularization helps make the math manageable by introducing a cutoff or something.

So each of these theories: which ones have issues with high energies that require regularization? Let's think through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, classical theories don't really have the same issues as quantum theories when it comes to renormalization or regularization. Because in classical electromagnetism, the equations are smooth and don't predict things like particles with infinite charge or other infinities. I think in classical E&M, you don't get the same divergences because it's not a quantum theory. So maybe D doesn't require regularization.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is option C. I remember that QED does require renormalization because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. Those infinities pop up, so you need to regularize them. Like, maybe you use a cutoff, or dimensional regularization, to handle those infinities. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Then there's Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), option B. QCD deals with the strong force. At high energies, QCD becomes asymptotically free, so the coupling constant decreases, and perturbative methods work better. But wait, doesn't QCD still require regularization? I think so. Because when you calculate loop integrals in QCD, you can get divergences too. So you need to regularize those, perhaps using methods like lattice regularization or others. So B does require regularization.

Superstring Theory, option A. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. String theory is a quantum theory of gravity, right? And it's supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. Because in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings with different vibrational modes, which might lead to different behavior. I think that in string theory, the perturbation series is better behaved. Also, string theories don't require the same type of renormalization because the divergences are tamed by the higher-dimensional
