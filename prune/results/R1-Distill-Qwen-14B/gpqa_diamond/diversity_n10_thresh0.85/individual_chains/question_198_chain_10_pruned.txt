Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually tell us about the formation of complexes. Right, higher β means more stable complex.

I remember that the stability constant (β) for a complex tells us how much the complex will form. The general formula is β = [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand]^n), where n is the number of ligands. So for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable it is.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN^- ligands attached to Co. So I'm looking for the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? Because the blue color is associated with the tetrahedral complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or wait, I think the blue is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is the dithiocyanato. Let me make sure. Oh, wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), where n is the number of ligands. So for n=2, it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Wait, no: Co is +2, each SCN- is -1. So for n ligands, charge is 2 - n. So n=0: Co^2+; n=1: Co(SCN)^+ ; n=2: Co(SCN)_2^0; n=3: Co(SCN)_3^-; n=4: Co(SCN)_4^2-.

Wait, the problem mentions the blue dithiocyanato. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex? Or maybe it's another one. Wait, no. I think the dithiocyanate complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) (since 2 SCN- would be -2, Co^2+ → 0 overall). So that's the neutral complex. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the colors. Oh, wait, I remember that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is a different color, maybe pink or something else. So the blue is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) complex, which is the dithiocyanato.

So the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) in the solution. To find that, I need to calculate the fraction of all cobalt species that is this particular complex.

The approach is to calculate the distribution of each complex (from n=0 to n=4) and find the fraction that corresponds to n=2.

The general formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the formation constants. I recall that the fraction f_n is given by (β_n [L]^n) / (Σ (β_m [L]^m)) ), where m ranges from 0 to the maximum possible ligands, which here is 4.

Wait, the formula for the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (β_0 [L]^0 + β_1 [L]^1 + β_2 [L]^2 + β_3 [L]^3 + β_4 [L]^4 )

But wait, the stability constants given here are β1, β2, β3, β4. What's β0? Oh, wait, β0 is 1 because it's the constant for the complex with zero ligands (just the free ion). So β0 = 1.

Wait, actually, sometimes the stability constants are given starting from n=1. Let me double-check. The problem says 'the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.' So β1 is probably for the monosubstituted complex, [Co(SCN)], β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc. So for each n, β_n is the constant for the n ligand complex.

So, to compute the fraction f_n for each n from 0 to 4:

Wait, wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The general approach is to consider each possible complex, from n=0 (Co^2+) up to n=4 (Co(SCN)_4^2-). The fraction of each can be found using the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

But wait, the way to compute the fractions is:

For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), the fraction f_n is given by (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum over m=0 to 4 of β_m [SCN^-]^m )

But wait, β0 is not given. Oh, because β0 is just 1, as the formation constant for the zero complex is 1. So β0 =1.

But wait, the given β's are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for n=1, β1=9, n=2, β2=40, etc.

So the denominator is sum from m=0 to 4 of β_m [SCN]^m, where β0=
