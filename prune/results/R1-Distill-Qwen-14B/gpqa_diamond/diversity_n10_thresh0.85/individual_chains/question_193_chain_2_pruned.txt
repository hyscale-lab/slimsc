Okay, I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. So the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, right? So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, the formula given is number of stars N = 1/(plx^5). Parallax (plx) is 1/distance in parsecs, I think. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. Oh wait, but wait, in the question, parallax is varying with that fifth power. So let's see.

Let me write down what I know. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance r, plx = k/r, where k is some constant. Maybe I can express plx in terms of r. So plx = 1/r (since parallax in arcseconds is 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So for example, r in parsecs, plx in arcseconds is 1/r).

So substituting plx into the equation for N, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Because plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5.

So 1/(plx^5) would be 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which
