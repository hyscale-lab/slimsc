Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see... The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars, right?

Wait, the formula I remember is that distance d is approximately 1 over parallax (in parsecs), like d = 1 / plx. So parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx increases, distance decreases, and vice versa.

The question states that the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to d^5, because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. Wait, let me double-check that substitution. If plx = 1/d, then 1/plx^5 becomes d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, wait, maybe they mean the density or the number per unit volume? Or perhaps the rate of change of the number with distance.

Wait, the wording says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)" — so maybe they're asking about the rate of change, like dN/dr. Or perhaps the number per unit distance.

Wait, let's think. If N ∝ d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Because as you look further away, there are more stars? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, in reality, if you look at a certain region of the sky, the number of stars you can see decreases with distance because stars are more spread out. Wait, but the question says that the number varies as 1/plx^5, so that would mean that N is proportional to d^5. So if distance increases, N increases as d^5. So that would imply that as we go to larger distances, the number of stars increases a lot, which seems counter to my initial thought.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the number of stars in a specific region (like a given solid angle) varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for
