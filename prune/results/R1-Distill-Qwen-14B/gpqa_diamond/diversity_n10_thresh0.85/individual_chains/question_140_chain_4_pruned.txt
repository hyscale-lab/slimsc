Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W and precipitate G. Then, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Also, X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, especially its analog. Hmm.

First, I'll try to identify what each part refers to. Let's start with the reactions. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's a strong acid-base reaction or something that produces gas quickly. The gas W has molecules with the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons—so that would mean the molecule is made of elements where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Let's see, which elements have that?

Well, hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium, but maybe not relevant here). Helium maybe? Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Or maybe carbon-12? Wait, no, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Oh wait, the molecule of gas W must have the same number of neutrons and protons in each atom. So each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So, possible candidates are H, He, or C-12 (but carbon is maybe too heavy for a gas in this context). Wait, but the molecule of gas W—could it be H2? Because each H atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium, but maybe it's regular H, which has 0 neutrons? No, wait. Oh, no, H has one proton, but only one neutron in deuterium. But if the gas is H2, each H atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium). Or wait, maybe the molecule is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps W is carbon dioxide, but that's just a guess. Wait, but the number of protons and neutrons in each molecule? Wait no, the molecule as a whole? No, the question says each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, I'm misunderstanding. It says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has equal number of neutrons and protons. But that's a bit tricky. Let me think: for example, H2 has two protons and two neutrons (if it's H2 made of deuterium). That would be 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so equal. But H2 is a possible gas. But maybe another option is CO2. CO2 has 1 C (which has 6 protons, 8 neutrons) and two O (each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So each molecule would have (6+8) *1 + (8+8)*2 = 14 + 32 = 46 protons. And for neutrons, (8) *1 + (8)*2 = 8 +16=24. So 46 protons and 24 neutrons, which isn't the same. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is of an element
