Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a Ca-EDTA complex is present. 

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, which probably means that the conditions are such that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex efficiently. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent. It binds to metal ions like Ca²+ to form a stable complex. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A large K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, right? The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10. 

But wait, in some cases, especially when EDTA is in solution, it can exist in different protonated forms. However, the problem states the pH is ideal, which I think implies that EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form. So, I can assume that the concentration of Y^4- (the deprotonated form) is sufficient, and any other forms of EDTA are negligible. This simplifies the calculations because it means I don't have to worry about the various EDTA species and can focus on the complex formation.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote this as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Now, I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions, [Ca²+], in the solution.

The formation constant K is given by the equation:
K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Do I have enough information about the EDTA concentration? Because I don't know [EDTA^4-], but maybe I can relate it with [Ca²+] because the solution is at equilibrium.

Alternatively, perhaps the EDTA is in excess, which would mean that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the initial concentration of EDTA minus the amount that has formed the complex. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let's think.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the solution is prepared by mixing Ca²+ and EDTA in a 1:1 molar ratio. So, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA (assuming all EDTA is Y^4-) would be 0.02 M each. Then, when they form the complex, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

But wait, no, that's not correct. If the solution is 0.02 M CaED
