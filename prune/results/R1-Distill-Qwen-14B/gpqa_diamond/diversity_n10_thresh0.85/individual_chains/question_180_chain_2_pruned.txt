Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just electric potential energy. 

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with calculating the electric potential energy of the system. The potential energy between point charges... wait, but wait. Since the system is isolated, the potential energy is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, since one charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m away, I need to calculate the potential energy due to each pair of charges.

Wait, but when you have multiple charges, the total electric potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each charge at 2m, I need to calculate its potential energy with every other charge, including the one at P.

Wait, but since the charges are identical and all at the same distance except for the fixed one, maybe there's a formula I can use. Let me think.

Each of the 12 charges at 2m will contribute to the potential energy when placed, and also their own interactions with each other. Let me break it down.

First, the charge at P is fixed. Then, each of the 12 charges is brought to 2m from infinity. The potential energy for each of these 12 charges when brought to their position would be the work done against the electric field of the charge at P and the other charges. But wait, since they're being placed one by one, I need to consider the potential created by the charges already placed.

Wait no, maybe it's easier to compute the total potential energy as the sum of all pairwise potentials. Because the problem says the system is isolated, so the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all pairs.

So the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, since all the charges are 2e each, I can compute the potential energy for each pair.

So let's outline the setup:

- Charge Q is fixed at P (charge = 2e)
- Charges q1, q2, ..., q12 are each at 2m from P. So each is 2m away from Q. But what about their distances from each other?

Wait, since all the charges are constrained to stay 2m from P, does that mean they are all at the same point? No, that can't be right because then the distance between each pair would be zero, which would make the potential energy approach infinity. But that's not possible. So perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a spherical shell around P, each at a radius of 2m. So each is 2m away from P, but how far are they from each other?

If they are on a sphere of radius 2m, then the distance between any two charges could be calculated based on how they're arranged. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the arrangement, so maybe it's assuming a certain symmetry, perhaps that they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, but the exact arrangement might not matter because we're looking for the minimum energy. Hmm, but wait, the minimum energy scenario would involve each charge as close as possible to each other. Wait, but since they're all identical and positive (assuming e is positive), they would repel each other. But the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps their positions are fixed, so the distance between any two of them is fixed as well. Hmm, but I don't think the problem gives the distance between them, so maybe I can't calculate that. Oh wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge at P. Because perhaps the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves is negligible or not considered. But that doesn't make sense because it's an isolated system, so all pairs contribute.

Wait, but maybe the question is just considering the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, and not between the 12 charges themselves. Let me read the question again.

The question says that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So the distance between any two of the 12 charges would depend on their arrangement. But without knowing the specific arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same point (which is impossible due to same charge), but that would make the potential energy between each pair zero because the distance would be zero? No, wait, that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge. Because otherwise, without knowing how the 12 are arranged, it's impossible to compute their mutual potential energy. So maybe the problem is only considering the energy due to the 12 and the 13th, not their mutual interactions. Let's see.

If that's the case, then the system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. But wait, each of the
