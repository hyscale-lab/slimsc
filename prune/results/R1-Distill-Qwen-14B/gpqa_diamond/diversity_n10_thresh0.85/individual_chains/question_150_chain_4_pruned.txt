Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and we're supposed to determine the final product after a series of reactions. The reactions are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

The options are four different compounds, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The NMR shows peaks at:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about each peak. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a pretty high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm regions are doublets each integrating to 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. Maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring since the coupling is doublet. So, perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring are in para positions.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but wait, that's 2H. Alternatively, it could be vinyl protons but in a conjugated system, maybe as part of an enol or something. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the protons to be deshielded and broad.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That looks like a methylene group attached to something electron-withdrawing. Maybe an OCH2 group or something similar.

Putting this together. Let's think about the possible structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (8)/2=4. So, four degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (3 DoU), one double bond or ring, and maybe another double bond or a ring. Or, maybe a benzene ring and a double bond and a ring (but that's complicated). Alternatively, benzene (3 DoU) plus a double bond (1) and a ring (another 1), but that would be 5. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, wait, the formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, let me re-calculate: 2(8) +2 = 18. Minus H (9) =9. Minus X (0), plus N (1): 9+1=10. So 18 -10=8. Divide by 2: 4 DoU. So four, which could be benzene (3) plus a double bond (1). So the molecule has a benzene ring and a double bond elsewhere.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton. That would also account for the aldehyde group in the formula. So, the structure might have a benzaldehyde group or something similar.

The 3.66 ppm doublet of 2H could be an OCH2 group. Maybe attached to a carbonyl or something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an aromatic group.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the possible structures given the options and see which one fits the NMR.

The options are A to D:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal
B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal
C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal
D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal

So, all of these are butenals with substituents, except option C which is a butanal (aldehyde group) with hydroxy substituents.

But looking at the NMR, the aldehyde is present, so the starting material has an aldehyde group. Let me think about each option.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal.

Structure would be:

Ph-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Wait, not sure. Let me draw it:

But-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO? No, wait, but-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, but-3-enal would be CH2CH2 with the aldehyde at the end.

Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO? No, but butenals are four carbons. So, but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-enal doesn't make sense because but-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond at C3, but that's not possible because but has four carbons, so the double bond can be between 1-2 (but-1-enal) or 2-3 (but-2-enal). Wait, but-3-enal would be beyond the four carbons. So perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong; maybe but-3-enal is actually but-2-enal. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here, but let's move on.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

So, but-3-enal would have the structure CH2=CHCH2CHO, but with a substituent at the 4th position. Wait, but but has only four carbons, so position 4 would be the aldehyde. Hmm, maybe it's a typo and should be but-2-enal. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a
