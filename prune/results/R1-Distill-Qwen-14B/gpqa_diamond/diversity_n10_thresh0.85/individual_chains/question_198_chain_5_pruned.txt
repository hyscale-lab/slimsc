Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the stability of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. We've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. And the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on what the blue dithiocyanato complex refers to. From what I remember, Co(II) forms several complexes with thiocyanate. The different β values correspond to the different complexes. The blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complex where n is a certain number, maybe 2 or 6. But I need to think about the stability constants and how they relate to the complexes.

Stability constants (β) are the equilibrium constants for the formation of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think about the order. β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β3 is the highest here. So the most stable complex is the one with β3=63.

Wait, but what are the complexes? Let's think about the possible complexes:

The general formula for the nth complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^k+. The stability constant βn is given by the formula:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n^{k+}] ] / ( [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n )

So for each n, we have a different βn.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^m+. Wait, but what's the charge? Co(II) is +2. Each
