Okay, I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to it, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm. The options are A to D, but I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c / n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and n is the refractive index. But in this case, the glass itself is moving, so I think I need to consider the relative motion between the light and the glass.

Wait, wait. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards us, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. The beam is propagating through the glass. So if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, that would affect the speed of light as observed from the lab.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize. The glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer (so, if the observer is in the lab, the glass is moving towards them). The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, which is towards the observer.

Wait, but light is moving through the glass. So the question is, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, but since the speed of light is involved, perhaps I should consider relativistic effects. Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem assumes non-relativistic speeds or not. The velocity v is given, but it's not specified whether it's a significant fraction of c. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe this is a classical problem, using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, because if the glass is moving, the speed of light in the medium might change as observed from the lab
