Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Michael addition reaction, and there are three different reactions given. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question describes three separate reactions, A, B, and C, each involving Michael additions. The task is to determine the major products for each and match them with the options given.

First, I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). 

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack by an enolate on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael acceptor because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Wait, no, actually, I think the Michael donor is the enolate, which is the nucleophile. So in this case, the enolate would be formed from one of the reactants.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. In the Michael addition, the nucleophile is the enolate attacking the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the Michael acceptor). So which compound is the donor and which is the acceptor here?

Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. That's a good Michael acceptor because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the other reactant, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the enolate donor? Or wait, maybe the other way around.

Wait, no. I think I got it mixed up. The enolate is the nucleophile, so the enolate is generated from a compound that can form it. Dimethyl malonate is a di-ester, so it's a good Michael acceptor. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl as well. So perhaps the enolate is formed from the malonate, which then attacks the acrylate.

Wait, no. Or perhaps the other way around. Let me think: the enolate is the nucleophile. So, in
