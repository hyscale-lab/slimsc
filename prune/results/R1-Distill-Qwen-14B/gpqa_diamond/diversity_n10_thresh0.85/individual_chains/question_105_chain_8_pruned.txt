Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about how a star with spots can mimic the light curve of a planet. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, star spots can cause periodic brightness changes as the star rotates and the spots come into and out of view.

The problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar is about the same as our Sun, which is good to note. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor—wait, I think that refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots. But since the star is a sphere, the total area covered by spots would be 0.2 times half the star's surface. Because each hemisphere is half the surface area. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (4πR²/2) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Wait, no, wait. The star's total surface area is 4πR². So one hemisphere is 2πR². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spots cover 0.4πR² of the star's surface.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I think, so their temperature is lower. The problem says the temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots are at 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K? Or do I need to check the wording again. The question says, "temperature difference of 1000K." So spots are either 5000 or 7000 K. Wait, dark spots are usually cooler, so I think they're 5000 K.

The star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation as the spots come and go from view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots block some light, causing a dip. But wait, how does that compare to a planet transiting the star?

The question is about finding the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star. So we need to calculate the relative dip in brightness caused by the spots and set it equal to the dip caused by a planet, then find the planet's radius.

First, let's calculate the fractional change in the star's brightness due to the spots. The star's total flux without spots is based on its effective temperature. Flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So the total flux F is L/(4π), which is R²σTeff^4. But when spots are present, part of the star's surface emits less flux.

The flux from the star when spots are present is F_total = F_normal * (1 - f) + F_spots * f, where f is the filling factor. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So F_total = F_star * (1 - f) + F_spots * f.

Wait, F_star is the flux without any spots, which is R²σTeff^4. The spots have a lower temperature, T_spot = 5000 K. Their flux per unit area is σT_spot^4. So the average flux from the spotted area is σ*(5000)^4 and from the rest it's σ*(6000)^4.

So the total flux is (area without spots) * σ*Teff^4 + (area with spots) * σ*T_spot^4.

Let me calculate this. The area without spots is (1 - f) * surface area, and the area with spots is f * surface area. But wait, the f given is 20% for one hemisphere. So wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty, so the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the entire star has spots covering 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Since the total surface area is 4πR², the fraction of the surface covered by spots is 0.4πR² /4πR² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

So f = 0.1, right? Because 20% of one hemisphere is 10% of the whole star.

So now, the total flux F is:

F = (1 - f) * (R² σ Teff^4) + f * (R² σ T_spot^4 )

Alternatively, since F is proportional to R² σ T^4, we can write it as:

F = R² σ [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ]

The flux when there are no spots would be F0 = R² σ Teff^4.

So the fractional change in flux (delta F / F0) is:

delta F / F0 = [ ( (1 - f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 ] - 1
= (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1
= -f [1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ]

Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait,

F = (1 - f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4.

So F/F0 = ( (1 - f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4

= (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )

Which is also equal to 1 - f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

So the fractional change is F/F0 = 1 - f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

So when the spots are on the visible side, the flux is this value. But wait, when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing the flux to dip because spots are emitting less. So the dip in brightness is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, no. When the spots are on the far side, the entire star is at Teff, so the flux is F0. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F0 *
