Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

So, the problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center of the conductor; its center is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and it's also at a distance l from the center of the cavity. The angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the concept of electrostatic shielding comes into play. But wait, I think that applies when the conductor is a shell, and the charge is inside the cavity. In that case, the electric field outside the conductor is as if the charge were at the center, but only if the conductor was a conducting shell. But wait, in this case, the conductor isn't a shell; it's a solid conductor with a cavity. Oh, wait, no, wait. No, wait, a conductor with a cavity. Hmm.

Wait, when you have a conductor with a cavity and a charge inside the cavity, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the charge +q inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is uncharged overall, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. Then, the outer surface would have a charge of +q to maintain the neutrality of the entire conductor. But wait, no—wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor plus the cavity must be zero. Hmm, let me think again.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the net charge on it is zero. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, because the charge +q inside the cavity would attract opposite charges to the inner wall. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner is -q, so the outer has +q, so total charge is zero.

So, the outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the outer surface is a spherical shell with charge +q, the electric field outside would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

But wait, the options given don't all look like that. Let's look at the options again.

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). That seems straightforward. But wait, is there any consideration of the position of the cavity and the charge inside affecting the outer field? Because the conductor's outer charge is uniformly distributed (since it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium), the field outside should only depend on the total charge and the distance from the center. So regardless of where the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface's induced charge would arrange itself to produce a uniform field as if the charge were at the center.

So even though the charge is off-center, the outer field outside the conductor depends on the total charge on the outer surface. So the electric field at P is the same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the E field is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²).

Looking at the options:

Option B: E = (1/(4π ε0)) * q/(L²)

Option D: E = (1/(4π ε0)) * q/(l²). No, because l is the distance from the cavity's center, which is not the same as the conductor's center.

Wait, but if the conductor's outer surface is uniformly charged, then yes, the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center of the conductor. So the correct formula is option B.

But wait, the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, but the conductor's center is a different point. So l is not the same as L. Let me think again about the setup.

The conductor's center is at some point, and the cavity's center is at a distance s away. So when we're calculating the field outside the conductor, the distance from the conductor's center is L. So the field is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L².

So the right answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center, and its radius is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center and $l$ from the cavity's center. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity of a neutral conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have a charge $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is uniformly distributed due to the conductor's electrostatic equilibrium.

At a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The field is independent of the position of the cavity or the charge inside it, as the outer surface ensures that the field outside the conductor is equivalent to that of a point charge $+q$ located at the conductor's center. Thus, the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
\]

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it involves $(l - s \cos\theta)$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option B**: Correct, as it matches the derived formula for the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it involves $(l + s \cos\theta)$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it uses $l$ (the distance from the cavity's center) instead of $L$ (the distance from the conductor's center).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
