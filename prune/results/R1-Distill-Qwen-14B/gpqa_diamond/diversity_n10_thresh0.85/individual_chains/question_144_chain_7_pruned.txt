Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given parameters are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Gamma_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. So the formula should involve the lifetime (tau), velocity (v), and maybe some other factors. Oh right, the mean decay distance L is approximately c multiplied by tau multiplied by beta gamma, or something like that. Let me think again.

The formula for the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c. But wait, tau is the proper lifetime, which is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So I need to calculate tau first.

Tau (the proper lifetime) is related to the particle's width Gamma. The width is the total decay width, which is connected to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is tau = hbar / Gamma. So, Gamma is the total width, which is the energy width here.

Wait, but Gamma and E are in the same units? Let me check the units. Gamma is given in MeV, and E is in GeV. Oh right, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

But wait, the formula for tau is tau = hbar / (Gamma), but I need to make sure the units are correct. Let me recall the constants. The reduced Planck constant hbar is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

So, tau = hbar / Gamma. Substituting the numbers:

hbar = 6.582e-25 GeV·s
Gamma = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV)
So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Wait 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s? No, wait 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds is 2.056875e-24 s. Hmm, wait, 1e-25 multiplied by 20 is 2e-24, so yeah.

Now, next step: find the velocity beta, which is v/c. But to get beta, we need to find the gamma factor. Gamma (Lorentz factor) is E / (m c²), but since E is given as 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, we can compute gamma.

Gamma (Lorentz) = E / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So gamma is 6.6667. Now, to find beta, because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So compute 1/gamma²: 1/(6.6667)^2 ≈ 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 6.6667 is 20/3. So (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444. So 1/44.444 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775: Hmm, let me think. sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let me see: 0.9887^2 is approximately (0.9887)^2 = (approx) 0.9775. So that's correct.

Now, the gamma factor is 20/3. So gamma is 6.666... as before.

Now, the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime (tau) multiplied by gamma multiplied by beta. Or, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Yes, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by gamma, and the velocity contributes a factor of beta. So, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

So now, let's plug all the numbers in.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute gamma * beta: that's (20/3) * 0.9887.

20/3 is approximately 6.6667. Multiply by 0.9887: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887. Let me compute that:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322; 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6604. So total is approximately 5.9322 + 0.6604 = 6.5926.

So gamma * beta ≈6.5926.

Now, c is 3e8 m/s. tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So, putting it all together:

L = (6.5926) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s)

Wait, because tau is in seconds, and c is m/s, so units would be (m/s)*s = m. So the seconds will cancel.

Let me calculate the numbers:

6.5926 * 3e8 = 6.5926 * 3 * 1e8 = 19.7778 * 1e8 = 1.97778e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.97778e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97778 * 2.056875) * (1e9 * 1e-24) = (approx 4.065) * (1e-15) = 4.065e-15 meters.

Wait, wait, let me compute 1.97778 * 2.056875.

1.97778 * 2 = 3.95556.

1.97778 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1125. So total is approximately 3.95556 + 0.1125 = 4.06806.

So, about 4.068e-15 meters. Hmm. Let me check the options:

Option B is 4.0655 *1e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223 *1e-15 m.

So my calculation is close to option B, but I got 4.068e-15, which is about 4.068e-15. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So I think option B is the correct answer.

Wait, but did I make any miscalculations? Let me double-check.

Calculating gamma, beta, gamma*beta:

Gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... (exactly 20/3).

Beta is sqrt(1 - m^2/(E^2)), since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. So alternatively, beta is (sqrt(E^2 - m^2)) / E * c, but perhaps it's easier to compute beta via gamma.

Wait, another approach for beta:

Since gamma = E/(m c^2), and beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - ( (1.2)^2 )/(8^2) )).

Wait, 1.2 squared is 1.44, 8 squared is 64. So 1.44/64 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which matches what I did earlier.

So beta is about 0.9887.
