Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to figure out what the concentrations are after dilution because we're mixing two volumes. Then, when titrating, I need to calculate the pH at 25% of the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.

Wait, let's break this down. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this is a classic acid-base titration. The reaction will be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

First step: calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The moles of acetic acid initially would be Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the new concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but is that right? Let me double-check. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Diluted into 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of CH3COOH is 0.001, so moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. The volume of NaOH would be moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, no, wait. 0.001 divided by 0.1 is 0.01 L, which is 10 mL or 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is reached when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence point would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, right? Because 25
