Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about a light beam moving through a glass slab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The problem asks for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that when dealing with light moving through different media, the index of refraction comes into play. Also, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum (which is given as 1 here) and n is the refractive index.

But wait, the glass is moving. So this involves relative motion between the glass and the lab frame. I think this might be a problem involving the addition of velocities, perhaps using special relativity? Or maybe it's a case where the glass's motion affects how the light propagates as observed in the lab.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light is propagating through the glass, which is itself moving. So I'm trying to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, but light's speed in a medium is determined by the medium's properties. Oh, but the medium (glass) is moving. How does that affect the measured speed of light in the lab frame?

In classical mechanics, when you have a medium moving at velocity v, and a wave in the medium has a speed u relative to the medium, then the speed of the wave relative to the lab is u ± v, depending on the direction. But wait, that's only in the case of non-relativistic speeds. Since the problem doesn't specify, I might have to consider relativistic effects, but I'm not sure.

But wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c = 1, regardless of the frame. But inside a medium, the speed is lower, v = 1/n. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the speed observed in the lab?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic velocity addition formula? Let me think.

Wait, the velocity addition formula in special relativity is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But in this case, what's the scenario?

In the glass's rest frame (let's call it S'), the light is moving at speed v_light' = 1/n in the direction of the beam. Then, the glass is moving at speed v in the lab frame (S frame). So, we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. So in S' (the glass frame), the light's speed is 1/n. Then, using the velocity addition formula, the speed in S (lab frame) is (v_light' + v_glass) / (1 + (v_light' * v_glass)/c² )

Wait, but wait. No, because the velocity addition formula goes the other way. Let me make sure. If in S', the object (light) is moving at u', then in S (which is moving at velocity v relative to S'), the object's speed u is (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Wait,
