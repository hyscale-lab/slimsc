Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think out loud. The problem is about stars, their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, let's read the question again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, so the transition between the two levels is at 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range. I remember that transitions between energy levels in atoms are governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which the problem states.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The ratio in question is n1/n2, where n1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and n2 is the number in level 2. But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Which makes sense because, according to the Boltzmann factor, as temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, so if E2 > E1, then the ratio n1/n2 would decrease because the denominator (n2) is becoming larger relative to n1.

Wait, so without spots, the Teff is higher (6000 K) and with spots, it's lower (5500 K). So the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when Teff is higher because higher temperature would make the exponential term larger. Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that implies that when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me write the ratio as (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait: no, wait. The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should get the equation right. The general form is n_i/n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E2 is higher than E1, then E2-E1 is positive. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) )

So for level 2 being higher, the exponent is negative. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp becomes larger. So n2/n1 increases with T if (g2/g1) is fixed.

But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1). So if n2/n1 increases, then n1/n2 decreases.

So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K), so n2/n1 is lower than when T was 6000 K. Wait, no, no. Wait, let's think.

Wait, without spots, T is 6000 K. n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)).

With spots, T is 5500 K. So n2/n1 becomes (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)).

Since T has decreased, the exponent is less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is smaller. So n2/n1 is smaller when T is lower, which would mean n1/n2 (the reciprocal) is larger when T is lower. But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, that contradicts what I just thought. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when T was higher (6000 K). But according to the equation, if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases, making n2/n1 larger. So n1/n2 would be smaller when T is higher. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose E2 > E1. So ΔE is positive.

At higher T, the exponential term is larger because the denominator is larger. So n2/n1 is larger when T is higher.

So n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1). So higher T leads to lower n1/n2. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So my conclusion is that when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. Which would mean that higher T leads to lower ratio? Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, the problem statement says: "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So under higher T (no spots), the ratio is higher than when T is lower (spots present). So according to the equation, when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease. But according to the equation, n2/n1 increases with T. So n1/n2 decreases with T. Oh, right! So when T is higher, n1/n2 is lower. So when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is higher. Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the
