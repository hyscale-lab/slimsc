Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and after a series of reactions, I need to identify the final product from the options provided.

First, I think I should analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Once I know the structure, I can then track what happens during each reaction step to determine the product.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So for C8H9NO:

n=8, m=9, x=1 (O), y=1 (N). Plugging in:

(2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18-11)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5? Wait, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation are whole numbers. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, molecular formula C8H9NO: the general formula is CnH2n+2O... Wait, maybe the calculation is different. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me recall: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Where X is halogens, which we don't have here. So, substituting:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1 (but O doesn't affect DoU). So, DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. Oh, okay, that makes sense. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, two rings and one double bond, or a ring and two double bonds, etc.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):

9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me try to interpret this.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. That's a strong downfield shift, so likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm. So, maybe there's an aldehyde group somewhere.

The 6.98 ppm is a doublet (d) of 2H. Aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring since they are a doublet. The same applies to the 6.51 ppm doublet of 2H. Wait, but wait, two doublets each with 2H
