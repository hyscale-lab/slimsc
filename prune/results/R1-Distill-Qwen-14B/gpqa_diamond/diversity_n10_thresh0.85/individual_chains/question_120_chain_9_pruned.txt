Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

Parallax, plx, is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax (d = 1/plx). So higher parallax means closer stars because they move more in their position as we orbit.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with plx. So I'm thinking about the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. But when we observe them, the number of stars we see depends on how far away they are because closer stars have higher parallax and are brighter, so more of them are within our field of view.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit of parallax, not distance. So I need to relate the number of stars to the parallax. Let's say N is the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. How does N depend on plx?

Since d = 1/plx, a small change in plx (dplx) corresponds to a change in distance. Let me think about the volume of space between distance d and d + dd. The volume between two spheres is 4πr²dr. So for a thin shell, the volume is proportional to d^2 * dr. But since d = 1/plx, dr = -dplx/(plx^2) because plx is 1/d. Wait, maybe I should express it in terms of plx.

So, if plx increases, that means d decreases. Let me think about the number of stars as a function of distance. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (constant). So substituting dd in terms of dplx: since d = 1/plx, the derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So dd = -dplx/(plx^2). But since we're dealing with absolute terms, maybe I can write d = 1/p, so dd = - (d p) / (p^2) ) → dd = - d p / p² = - (d p) / p² → Wait, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, since d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. Let me express the volume element in terms of plx. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the same as the volume between d and d + dd, where dd = -d^2 * dplx. Because if plx increases by dplx, d decreases by d^2 * dplx. Wait, let me calculate dd in terms of dplx.

Taking d = 1/plx, so dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So dd = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx.

But the volume element is 4πd² dd. Substituting dd:

Volume = 4π d² (-
