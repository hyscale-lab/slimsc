Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let me try to think this through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's a type of crystal system where all the sides are equal, and the angles can be different, but in this case, all are 30 degrees. 

So, the given data is: interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. We’re supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

Wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the vector product. Or wait, perhaps it's more directly related to the structure factor? No, that's more for diffraction. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles). Or wait, maybe I'm mixing formulas here.

Wait, no, I think the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ) ). Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the a, b, c are equal, right? So a = b = c. So perhaps the formula simplifies.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + ... something with cos terms for the angles. Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (b c)^2 (sin α sin β sin γ) )^{1/2} ] / | (h b c sin α)/(a) + (k a c sin β)/(b) + (l a b sin γ)/(c) ) | 

Wait, no, that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α )

Wait, because in rhombohedral systems, all the angles between the axes are the same (since α=β=γ=30 degrees here). So the formula simplifies.

Wait, let me double-check. The general formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + (hk)/(ab) (cos γ) + (hl)/(ac) (cos β) + (kl)/(bc) (cos α) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0 (let's say a0 is 10 Angstrom
