Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I can check my results against them.

First, let's read the problem carefully. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Alright, so the first thing I should do is figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when we mix equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the concentration will be halved. Let's compute that.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. The volume is in cm³, so I can use cm³ directly. So, 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = 1 mmol. Wait, wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L, and 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Oh wait, no, because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, right. So 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 mol. Then when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 20 mL of 0.05 M is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Adding 20 mL of water makes total volume 40 mL (0.04 L), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the equivalence point volume.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So equivalence volume is 10 mL.

Wait, but the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and equivalence. So for 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 0.25 * 10 mL = 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

So first, let me compute the pH at 25% titration. At this point, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

In 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol. So moles reacted are 0.00025 mol, leaving unreacted acetic acid as 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Also, the moles of sodium acetate (CH3COO-) formed will be 0.00025 mol.

So the total volume of solution at this point is initial solution (40 mL) plus 2.5 mL of NaOH. 42.5 mL total, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.0058824 M

Wait, wait, 0.00075 /0.0425 is approximately 0.017647? Let me compute that.

0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647... yes.

Similarly, 0.00025 / 0.0425 is 0.00588235... approximately 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5.

So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) → Wait, no, pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5).

Let me compute that. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is (log(1.85) + (-5)) → 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So now, [A-]/[HA] is (0.005882) / (0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is log(1/3) which is approx -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26.

Wait, the options have 4.26 as the first pH value in option A, and others have different values. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 4.26; 8.52
B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00
D) 4.57; 6.92  

So for the first part, 4.26 is in option A, but also in option D, I don't think. Wait no, option D has 4.57 as the first value. So for the first part, I think pH is around 4.26.

But wait, let me think again. Because when I added 2.5 mL of NaOH, which is 0.25 × equivalence volume (10 mL). So that's correct.

Wait another point: The total volume after adding NaOH is 40 mL + 2.5 mL =42.5 mL. So the concentrations are as I computed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the dilution correctly.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, we've added 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH. So moles reacted: 0.00025 of acetic acid. Remaining: 0.00075. And 0.00025 moles of acetate ion.

So the solution has 0.00075 moles of acid and 0.00025 moles of conjugate base.

But the total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL. So the concentrations are indeed 0.00075 / 0.0425 and 0.00025 / 0.0425.

So the ratio is (0.00025/0.0425)/(0.00075/0.0425) = 1/3. So that's correct.

So the Henderson equation gives pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.25, which rounds to 4.26. That matches option A's first value.

But wait, what about the second part—the pH at equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to sodium acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

So, the concentration of acetate ion is (moles) / (total volume). Let's compute that.

Moles of sodium acetate: 0.001 mol (because initial acetic acid was 0.001 mol, all converted).

Total volume at equivalence point is initial 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL (0.05 L).

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M
