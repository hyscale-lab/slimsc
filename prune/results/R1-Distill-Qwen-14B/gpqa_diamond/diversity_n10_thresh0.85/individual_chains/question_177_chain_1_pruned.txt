Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, wait, but wait. The problem then says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, because for a black body, the peak wavelength depends on its temperature. So if both have the same peak wavelength, they must be at the same temperature. That's from Wien's law, right? Wien's displacement law says lambda_max * T = constant. So if lambda_max is the same, then T must be the same for both stars.

Okay, so both stars have the same temperature. Now, the question is about their luminosities. The options are about how much more luminous Star_1 is compared to Star_2.

Wait, I remember that the luminosity of a star (if it's a black body radiator) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. Oh right, because the surface area is 4πR², and each square meter emits σT⁴ per second.

So, since both stars have the same T, the luminosity ratio should depend on the ratio of their radii squared. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same, so L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²).

Wait, but wait. R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² is (1.5)^2 times R2². (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. But wait, what about the masses? The problem mentions mass but I don't see how it affects luminosity here. Oh wait, because the problem says the stars are radiating as black bodies, so their luminosity is just a function of radius and temperature. Mass might affect other things, but in this case, since temperature is the same, mass doesn't influence the luminosity ratio in this calculation. So the mass information is probably a red herring, or perhaps it's there for another part of the problem but not this particular calculation.

Wait, but the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift. So if the star is moving towards or away from us, it causes a shift in the observed wavelength. But earlier, the problem stated that the wavelength at which each star appears brightest is the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same because of the Doppler effect? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the peak wavelength emitted by the star is determined by its temperature. But if the star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift which changes the observed wavelength. So if both stars
