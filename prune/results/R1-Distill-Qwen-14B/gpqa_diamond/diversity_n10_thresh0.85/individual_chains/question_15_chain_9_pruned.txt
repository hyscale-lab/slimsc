Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, and their orbits are circular. Also, the host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. 

Wait, the question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Oh right, the formula for the probability P is roughly (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - eÂ²)) or something like that. But wait, since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part is 1. So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, plus the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, I think it's P = (R_star / a) * (something else). Or perhaps it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but actually, since the planet's size is much smaller than the star's, R_planet is negligible. So it's approximately R_star / a. But wait, actually, the formula is more accurately (R_star / a) * ( (1) / (1 - (R_star / a)^2 )^{1/2} ), or something like that? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is approximately (R*/a), but actually, the exact formula is a bit more involved. Oh right, the transit probability for a circular orbit is given by P = (R* / a) * (1 / (1 - (R*
