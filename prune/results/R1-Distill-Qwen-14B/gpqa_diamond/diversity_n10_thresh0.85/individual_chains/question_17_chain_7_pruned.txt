Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_ca-edta, is 5×10^10. We have to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. So the Ca-EDTA complex forms when Ca^2+ ions combine with EDTA^4- ions. The reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So does that mean the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we have to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions?

Yes, I think that's right. So the complex is formed by the reaction between Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5×10^10, which is a pretty large number, indicating that the complex is very stable.

So the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Since we're assuming that the pH is ideal, I suppose that the concentration of EDTA^4- is known or can be considered as a certain value. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of CaEDTA^2-.

So let me set up the variables:

Let [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

We can let x be the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions. Then, since each CaEDTA^2- dissociates into one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of free EDTA^4- would be x as well? Wait, no. Wait, I think that's the case if all the EDTA is in the free form, but in reality, most of the EDTA is bound into the complex.
