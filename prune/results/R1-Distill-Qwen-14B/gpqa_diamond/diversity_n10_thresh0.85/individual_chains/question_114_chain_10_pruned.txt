Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes I get a bit confused with the reactions, but I'll take it slow.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with something that has CN, like cyanide, I think this is a nucleophilic addition. Oh, right! The reaction is the addition of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) to the ketone. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in a protic solvent, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But butan-2-one is a cyclic ketone? No, wait, butan-2-one is just a regular ketone, (CH3)2CO.

So when a ketone reacts with HCN (or CN- and H+), it forms a cyanohydrin. The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see, the structure of that product. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would add H to the carbonyl O and CN to the carbonyl C. So the product should be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. Butanen
