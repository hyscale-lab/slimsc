Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. Okay, so I've got a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me think about what functional groups are present here. The formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. The NMR data is given, so that should help identify the structure.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t, 1H). That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehyde protons usually show up around 9-10 ppm. And it's a triplet. Wait, but aldehydes are typically deshielded and split into doublets if adjacent to something. Hmm, maybe the triplet is because it's next to a CH2 group? Or maybe it's an alpha proton to something else.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the aldehyde proton can be split if it's near another proton. Or perhaps it's a conjugated system. Let me think. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton, but 9.7 seems high for that. Wait, no, aromatic protons are usually lower, like around 6-8 ppm. So aldehyde is more likely.

Then, at 6.98 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That's probably aromatic protons. 6.51 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H) as well. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Oh wait, because they're doublets and integrating to 2H each. So two sets of doublets, each 2H, probably on a benzene ring in para positions. So maybe two substituents on benzene rings?

Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of U = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation: that could be, for example, a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and maybe an aldehyde (another double bond? But aldehyde is a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So perhaps a benzene ring, an aldehyde, and maybe an ether or something else. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me see: benzene is 6C, so the remaining 2C plus the N and O.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, 8 carbons: maybe a benzene ring (6C) plus two more carbons. One of those could be a carbonyl (like aldehyde), and the other perhaps an oxygen-containing group.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton, but it's a singlet. But wait, integrating to 2H. Hmm. Another possibility is vinyl protons, but in a conjugated system. Or perhaps the protons are adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen.

Then the last peak is 3.66 ppm, a doublet (d, 2H). 3.6 is usually indicative of something like an OCH2 group, maybe an ether or an ester, but perhaps a methylene next to oxygen, like in an enol ether or something.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, another benzene ring (since 2 substituents on a benzene?), and some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene rings would account for 6 carbons. So the remaining 2 carbons: if one is part of the aldehyde group (CHO), that's 1 carbon. The other could be a CH2 group connected to something else. Let me think: so maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with some substituents.

Wait, another approach: the N
