Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, and HIRES can go down to 16. So, the stars have to be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, meaning that the apparent magnitude has to be less than or equal to 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star has an apparent V magnitude of 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Same for HIRES: stars brighter than 16 (so apparent V ≤16) can be observed.

Now, each star has different properties. Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: RA=15 deg, DEC=-75 deg. Absolute V mag=15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc. Since this star is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is the same as its absolute magnitude, right? So apparent V is 15.5. That's brighter than both 16 and 17. So it would be observable by both spectrographs. Because 15.5 is less than 16 and 17, so both can see it.

Star2: RA=30, DEC=55. Apparent V mag=16.5. Distance 5 pc. So the apparent mag is given; that's the measure we need. 16.5 is brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But for HIRES, which requires V mag ≤16, 16.5 is dimmer than that. So HIRES can't observe it. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48
