Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

So the question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. They used the RV method to detect them. RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The amplitude of this velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital characteristics. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * (1/(P * (2π)^(1/3))) )? Or wait, maybe I should recall the simplified version. Since the planet's mass is much less than the star's, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So the formula simplifies a bit. I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²))) ) ) / (2π * (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. I remember K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ), but that seems confusing. Alternatively, another form: K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars are like the Sun, the M_p << M_*, so the +M_p can be neglected. Also, the eccentricity e is probably small for circular orbits, so (1 - e²)^½ ≈ 1.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) * (1) / ( P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P and the mass of the planet. Let me think about the relation between K and P.

Another way: The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so we can approximate as:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But wait, this might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, I remember that for the same star mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because the formula for K includes P^(-1/3). So K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3) ), assuming all else equal.

Wait, because K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. But in this problem, the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like). So M_p is the same for both planets. So the K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, but the question states that the detected shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7? Because the shift is the semi-amplitude, right. So K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3).

So for K1 and K2, since K2 is larger than K1, that would imply that P2 is smaller than P1, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).
