Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Right, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The question gives me some initial concentrations and volumes, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Plus, there are options to choose from.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. 

Wait, the first part is about finding the pH at 25% titration. Oh right, 25% would mean that a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Then, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH.

Let me break it down step by step.

Starting with the initial acetic acid solution:

Volume of acetic acid = 20 cm³ (0.02 L)
Concentration = 0.05 M
Moles of acetic acid = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

When we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is (0.001 mol) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Because when you dilute, moles remain same. So yes, that part is correct. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating this with NaOH (0.1 M), the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence = 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 25% titration. So for 25% titration, how much NaOH is added? 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

So now, I need to calculate the pH at two points: when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added (25% titration), and when 10 cm³ has been added (equivalence point).

First, let's tackle the 25% titration point.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Let's find out how much.

Moles of NaOH added:
