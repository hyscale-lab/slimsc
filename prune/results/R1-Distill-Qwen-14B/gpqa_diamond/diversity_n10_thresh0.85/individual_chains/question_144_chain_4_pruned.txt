Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see if I can work through this. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X.

Alright, the given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters. 

Wait, mean decay distance. I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The decay width Γ is connected to the particle's lifetime τ via the uncertainty principle. The formula I think is Γ = ħ / τ, but wait, actually, it's the other way around. Let me think. The natural linewidth is Γ, and τ is the lifetime. So the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, but to find the mean decay distance, I also need to consider the velocity of the particle. Because the mean distance L is the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

Wait, but how do I find the velocity v? I think we can use relativistic mechanics here. The energy of the particle is given as E_X = 8 GeV. Its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So, the total energy is E = γ m c². So γ is E_X divided by m_X c
