Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about the density matrix of a qubit. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what a density matrix represents.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, but this looks like a mixed state because it's a sum of two projectors divided by 2.

Wait, |0> and |1> are the standard basis states. So this matrix is a mixture of the two basis states. Since each term is |0><0| and |1><1|, each has a coefficient of 1/2. That means the state is a completely mixed state in the computational basis.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I think qubit space is represented as a Bloch sphere. Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. For a completely mixed state, like when the density matrix is I/2, it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, wait. What's the density matrix for the completely mixed state? The identity matrix multiplied by 1/d, where d is the dimension. Since we're in qubit space, d=2. So the mixed state density matrix is (I)/2, which is exactly what ρ is here. Because |0><0| + |1><1| equals I, so 1/2*(I) is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2.

So in the Bloch sphere representation, the pure states |0> and |1> are at the poles: (0,0,1) and (0,0,-1) if the sphere is normalized to radius 1. But the completely mixed state would be at the center, which is (0,0,0). Because when you have equal probability in all directions, it's the center.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that must be the answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state in the computational basis, as it is an equal mixture of the projectors onto the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states like \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) are located at the poles \((0,0,1)\) and \((0,0,-1)\), respectively. However, a completely mixed state, such as \(\rho\), corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is at the origin \((0,0,0)\). This is because a mixed state with equal probabilities for all possible outcomes has no net direction in the Bloch sphere.

Among the given options, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix \(\rho\) in the qubit space is:

**A) \(r=(1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere.  
**B) \(r=(0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\).  
**C) \(r=(0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as this is the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state.  
**D) \(r=(1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid point in the Bloch sphere for a qubit.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
