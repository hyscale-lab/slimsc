Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the question is about its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are A to D, each with different r vectors.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. A pure state would be a density matrix that's a projection operator, like |ψ><ψ|, but this one is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with a coefficient of 1/2. So ρ is a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |θ, φ>, the corresponding point on the Bloch sphere has coordinates (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But wait, this is for pure states. How about mixed states?

I remember that for a mixed state, the density matrix can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere. The idea is that any density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space with |r| ≤ 1.

Wait, let's write that out. The identity matrix I is 2x2, and r·σ is the sum of the components of r multiplied by each Pauli matrix. So, ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Wait, no, actually, I think it's (I + r·σ)/2. So, each component of r corresponds to a Pauli matrix. So for each term, you have r_x σ_x, etc.

So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

Given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1| ) / 2.

Let me write out |0><0| and |1><1| in matrix form. |0> is [1, 0]^T, so |0><0| is [[1, 0],[0, 0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I.

Wait a minute, ρ is 1/2 multiplied by (I), because 1/2 (I) would be [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]].

Wait, but the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which equals I/2. Because |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix I. So ρ is I/2.

So ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2. Because r would be zero vector here. Because if r is (0, 0, 0), then r·σ is zero, so ρ would be I/2.

Wait
