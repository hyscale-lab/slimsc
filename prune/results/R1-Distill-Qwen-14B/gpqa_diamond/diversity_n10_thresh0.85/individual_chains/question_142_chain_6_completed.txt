Okay, so I need to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this ρ doesn't look like that.

Looking at the given ρ: it's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this might be a maximally mixed state. Because when you have equal probabilities for all possible states, that's usually the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. For a single qubit, the maximally mixed state is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. So that's exactly what ρ is because |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are the diagonal elements, and adding them together and multiplying by 1/2 gives the identity matrix divided by 2.

Now, about the geometrical position. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and the maximally mixed state is at the origin. The Bloch vector r describes the state in terms of its coordinates (x, y, z). For a pure state, the vector has a length of 1, but for a mixed state, it's shorter. The completely mixed state has r = (0,0,0), which is the origin.

So ρ must be at the origin. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). The other options don't make sense because (1,1,0) would imply a state outside the Bloch sphere, which isn't possible. (0,0,1) would be the state |0⟩ if it's a pure state, but ρ isn't pure. And (1,1,1) is way outside the sphere, so that's not right either.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states correspond to points on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside the sphere. The maximally mixed state, in particular, is represented by the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the Bloch vector \( r = (0,0,0) \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (\( r = (1,1,0) \))**: This would correspond to a state outside the Bloch sphere, which is not possible.
- **Option B (\( r = (0,0,1) \))**: This represents the pure state \( |0\rangle \), but \( \rho \) is not a pure state.
- **Option C (\( r = (0,0,0) \))**: This correctly represents the maximally mixed state at the origin.
- **Option D (\( r = (1,1,1) \))**: This is outside the Bloch sphere and not valid.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of \( \rho \) in the qubit space is \( r = (0,0,0) \).

Answer: C
