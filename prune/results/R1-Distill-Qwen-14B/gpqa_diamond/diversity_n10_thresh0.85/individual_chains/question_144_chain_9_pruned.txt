Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance means it's a particle that exists for a very short time. I remember that the decay distance has something to do with how long the particle lives and how fast it's moving when it's produced.

The question gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I think I need to figure out the mean decay distance using these values.

Wait, I remember something about the mean lifetime being related to the particle's width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is approximately hbar over 2. So, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the mean lifetime τ is related by Γ * τ ≈ ħ. But wait, is it ħ or 2ħ? Let me think. The uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, so for Γ (which is ΔE), τ (which is Δt) would be approximately ħ/(2Γ). But I've also heard that sometimes people use τ ≈ ħ / Γ, so I'm a bit confused here. I think I should check the formula.

Wait, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, I think that's right because Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime. So Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime τ, I can find the mean decay distance, which is the particle's speed multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ.

But wait, to get the speed, I need to know the velocity of the meson when it's produced. Since it's produced with energy E_X, which is much larger than its rest mass (8 GeV vs 1.2 GeV), I can assume it's ultra-relativistic. So the velocity v is approximately the speed of light, c. But maybe I should calculate it more precisely.

The energy E is given by the relativistic energy formula: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So for E_X =8 GeV, m_X=1.2 GeV/c
