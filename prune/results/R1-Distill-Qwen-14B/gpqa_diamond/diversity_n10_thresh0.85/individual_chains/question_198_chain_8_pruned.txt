Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on coordination chemistry, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^something. Wait, the question refers to blue dithiocyanato complexes. From what I remember, cobalt complexes with different numbers of SCN ligands have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is blue, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure. Oh wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato," which would mean two SCN ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n+.

But wait, the stability constants are given up to β4, which suggests complexes with 1 to 4 SCN ligands. So the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

Wait, no, the charge would depend on the number of SCN- ions. Co(II) is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+:

Charge m = 2 - n*(1) = 2 -n? Because each SCN is -1, so for n SCN, the total charge would be +2 - n.

So, for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1)
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral)
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- (charge -1)
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^3- (charge -2)

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, each SCN- contributes -1. So for each ligand, the charge is -
