Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, the problem says they're using black body radiation, so that's correct. So both stars have the same temperature since their peak wavelengths are the same.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. I remember the luminosity of a star (assuming black body) depends on its radius squared and temperature to the fourth power: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. But since T is the same for both, L is proportional to R².

Wait, no, wait. Because Star_1 has a larger radius and same T, so L1 would be (R1² / R2²) * L2. Let me compute that. R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Then R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2? But wait, wait. The problem says that the calculated luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So could it be 2.25?

But wait, the options have more precise numbers. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So option A is exactly 2.25. But wait, is there any other factor I'm missing here?

Wait, the problem also mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. So does that affect the observed luminosity? Hmm. Oh wait, when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. But wait, the peak wavelengths are the same, so maybe the Doppler effect was already accounted for in the observed wavelengths. Oh wait, the peak wavelengths as observed are the same, so any Doppler shift would have been considered when determining the temperature. So perhaps the actual emitted wavelengths are adjusted by the Doppler effect, but since the observed peak wavelengths are same, perhaps the temperatures as calculated are the same regardless of velocity.

Wait no, because the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), approximately, for non-relativistic speeds. But wait, radial velocity (v_r) is the component along the line of sight. But if Star_1 has v_r=0, its emitted wavelength is the same as observed. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 would have a Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, so that the temperatures calculated from the observed wavelengths are the same. So when calculating T using Wien's law (lambda_max = b / T), the T is the observed T, which would be different from the actual T if there's a Doppler shift.

Wait, that complicates things. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, it would have a blueshift, so the observed lambda_max would be shorter than the actual lambda_max. But since the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same, perhaps the actual temperatures are different.

Wait, now this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (i.e., their observed wavelengths) are the same. So, when calculating T from their observed emission, we're using the same lambda_max for both. But the actual temperatures of the stars would be different if there's a Doppler shift.

Let me try to model this.

For Star_1: v_r1 = 0, so no Doppler shift. So observed lambda_max1 = emitted lambda_max1. So T1 = b / lambda_max1.

For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving towards us (since v_r is positive away? Or is it towards? Wait, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. The sign depends on the convention, but let's say v_r is positive when moving away. So if Star_2 has v_r = 700, it's moving away, so the observed wavelengths
