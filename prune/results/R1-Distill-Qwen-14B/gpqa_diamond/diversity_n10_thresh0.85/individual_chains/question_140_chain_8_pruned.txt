Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius. 

Hmm, melting point of 277 K... wait, that's 4째C. What substances have that melting point? Maybe something like water? Wait, water freezes at 273 K (0째C), but maybe it's a different compound. Alternatively, maybe B is something like dry ice, but that's carbon dioxide. Wait, no, dry ice sublimates, not melting. Wait, another thought: maybe B is something like mercury, but mercury is a liquid. Or perhaps something else. Wait, another approach: what is 277 K in Celsius? 277-273=4, so 4째C. So B is a solid at 4째C, probably a metal maybe. Or maybe it's something else.

So the reaction between X and Y produces W, G. Then G when heated gives B. Let's think about possible reactions. What about metals reacting with acids? For example, maybe a metal reacting with sulfuric acid. The metal would produce hydrogen gas (W), form a sulfate precipitate (like if the metal is lead, but lead sulfate is a precipitate?), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction with a carbonate. Wait, but the gas would be CO2 then.

Wait, the gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. That means the molecule is either H2O, but wait, H2O has 1 proton and 1 neutron each for H, but O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons? No, wait, for the molecule as a whole, the number of protons and neutrons must be the same. So the molecule's total protons equals total neutrons.

Let me think: possible gases that fit this. For example, CO2 has 2 protons (C has 6, O has 8 each; wait, no, wait I'm getting confused. Wait, each molecule has a certain number of atoms. So for CO2,
