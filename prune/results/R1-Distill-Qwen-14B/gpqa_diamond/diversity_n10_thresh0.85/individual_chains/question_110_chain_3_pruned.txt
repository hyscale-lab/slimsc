Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I think I should understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can detect stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter than 17? Because lower magnitudes are brighter, right? So if a star's V magnitude is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So a star needs to have V magnitude less than or equal to 16 for HIRES.

Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me re-read: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So that means if the V magnitude is 17 or lower (since brighter means smaller numbers), then ESPRESSO can detect it. So ESPRESSO's limit is V ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V ≤16.

So a star must be V ≤17 for ESPRESSO and V ≤16 for HIRES. But wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, no, both spectrographs
