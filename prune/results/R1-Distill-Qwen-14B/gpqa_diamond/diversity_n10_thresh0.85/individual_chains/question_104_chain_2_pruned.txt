Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity (RV) detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom (that's 5e-3 angstrom) shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so what's the relation between the RV shift and the orbital period? I remember that the RV method's signal depends on the planet's mass and the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit.

The RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) )/( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) * ( (1/(1 - e²)) ) )^(1/3) ) ... Wait, but since the planets are Neptune mass and stars are like Sun, M_p is much less than M_star. So M_p + M_star ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, the formula for RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ] * [ (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] / ( ( (P) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Wait, perhaps a more straightforward approach. I think the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + (M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) ), but considering that M_p << M_star, it can be approximated as K ≈ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * something.

Wait, another approach.
