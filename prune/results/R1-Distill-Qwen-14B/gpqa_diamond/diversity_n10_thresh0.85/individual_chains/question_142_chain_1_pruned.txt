Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the density matrix ρ given by (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different r coordinates.

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. For a qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, right? Because the space of 2x2 density matrices is 3-dimensional (since a density matrix has 4 elements, but due to trace 1 and Hermiticity, it's 3-dimensional).

Wait, I think the Bloch sphere comes into play here. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, and its representation on the Bloch sphere is a point on the surface. But for mixed states, like this one, the density matrix describes a statistical mixture, so the corresponding point would be inside the Bloch sphere.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space—the Bloch vector. The components of r correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. Also, the length of r determines whether the state is pure or mixed. If |r| = 1, it's a pure state, otherwise, it's mixed.

So, given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, let me compute r. Expanding this, let's compute each term.

Wait, |0><0| is the outer product, which is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (1/2) I. That simplifies things.

So ρ = (I)/2. Now, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So in this case, we have (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. So the vector r is the zero vector because (r·σ) is the sum of r_i σ_i. So for their sum to be zero, each component must be zero.

Wait, wait. Let me think about this. The equation is (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I + r·σ = I. Subtract I from both sides: r·σ = 0. So each component of r must be zero because otherwise, the sum would not be zero. Because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and each term would contribute. So if r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz = 0, then all r components must be zero.

So
