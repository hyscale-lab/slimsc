Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different products. I need to figure out what each reaction produces and then match them with the options.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So the reaction is a Michael addition. 

From what I remember, the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

In this case, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. Malonate can act as the enolate source because it's a strong enough acid when deprotonated. The base NaOEt would deprotonate the malonate to form the enolate.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituents might be different. Wait, no, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with the substituent at the alpha position. Wait, maybe it's more like the alpha position (the carbon next to the carbonyl) has a substituent. Let me think: the structure is probably CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's the substituent on the double bond. For (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituents on the double bond would be the p-tolyl group and the ester group.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O-OCH3)-p-tolyl? No, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again. The formula for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the double bond. Or perhaps it's more like the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 3. Hmm, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3, but wait, that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-p-tolyl group at the third position. No, maybe let me draw it mentally. The acrylate has three carbons: CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is at the third carbon, which is the COOCH3. No, that doesn't
