Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question involves several reaction steps, and I need to determine the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage with multiple rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. The product is a light yellow solid. Looking at the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. What's that IR peak? 1720 is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so maybe an ester or ketone group.

So when dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, probably elimination is happening. Since there are two bromines, it might form an epoxide? Wait, wait. Oh wait, more likely, KOH would cause a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, since KOH is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a diene? Or wait, could it be an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides form from vicinal diols or via peracid epoxidation, not from dihalides with KOH. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of some sort. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Br atoms) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they can undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But in this case, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, which are not adjacent (since adamantane's structure would have those positions across the structure). Wait, but maybe it's more about the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but that might not make sense.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone. How could that happen? If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, but in adamantane, they are on opposite ends. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage. Wait, another thought: in some cases, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can form an elimination product with each Br leaving, but since the two Brs are not adjacent, perhaps each elimination occurs on separate carbons, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually applies to amines. Hmm. Wait, perhaps it's a retro-aldol reaction? Or maybe it's a diepoxide opening? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the NMR data: 4.79 ppm is a singlet integrating for 2H. That's often indicative of an OCH2 group, like in an ether or ester.
