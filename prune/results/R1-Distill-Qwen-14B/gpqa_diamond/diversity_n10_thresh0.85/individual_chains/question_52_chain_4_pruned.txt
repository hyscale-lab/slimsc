Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star whose surface is partially covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes between no spots and when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star has spots, it can affect the observed spectrum because the spots are cooler. But the question is about the ratio of two energy levels of Ti in the photosphere. So, I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation because it deals with the distribution of atoms in different energy levels under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). But wait, the Teff is the overall photospheric temperature; but the spots are cooler, so the photosphere's average temperature is lower. But for the photosphere itself, do the spots affect the local temperature? Or is the entire photosphere considered to be at the same effective temperature?

Wait, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases. So the effective temperature is lower when spots are present. But when considering the photosphere, perhaps the spots are regions where the photosphere is cooler. Oh, but the question is about the photosphere as a whole. Wait, no. The question says when the star's surface is not covered, Teff is 6000. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but the photospheric conditions would vary between the spotted and unspotted regions. So when the star has spots, part of the photosphere is cooler.

Wait, but the problem says, "in the stellar photosphere" when observing the ratio. So does that mean we're considering the photosphere as a single temperature, or are we considering the mixture of spot and non-spot regions?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think. The effective temperature is an average, but the actual photosphere in the spotted regions is cooler. So when the star has spots, the photosphere in those regions is at a lower temperature. But for the line formation, the transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet? Wait, 1448 Å is about 0.1448 microns, which is in the
