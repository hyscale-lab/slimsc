Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about determining the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, molecules can absorb photons and transition between energy states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So, the molecule is currently in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon to go to the next state. But what's the next state with the lowest energy?

Oh right, for diatomic molecules, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (probably J=0). So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either change its vibrational state or rotational state.

Wait, but the problem is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule would transition to the next higher energy state, which could be a vibrational or rotational transition. I think the vibrational energy levels are quantized as well, each with a certain energy spacing.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is a bit different from the rigid rotor. Oh wait, no, the non-rigid rotor (also called the hindered rotor) model allows the bond length to vary, which affects the rotational energy levels. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning from its lowest energy state (v=0, J=0) to the next higher energy state, which could be either J=1 or v=1. But which one has lower energy? Because the energy levels of rotation and vibration are different.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. For v=0, the energy is (1/2)ħω. The next vibrational state would be v=1, which is (3/2)ħω, so a difference of ħω.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For J=0, E=0, and for J=1, E=2B. So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1
