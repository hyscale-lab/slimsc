Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? And the standard lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons because it has 4 protons (since 7 is 3 protons plus 4 neutrons? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Let me think. The atomic number of lithium is 3, so Li-7 has 7 nucleons. So 3 protons and 4 neutrons. But the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Because 6 is 3+3. So X is a Li-6 nucleus. So its mass number A is 6.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me confirm. Lithium has atomic number Z=3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3+3=6. So X is Li-6, which is a common isotope, I think.

Next, I need to calculate the energy of the RHIC. RHIC is a collider, so it's dealing with relativistic particles. Oh, right, the energy here is the total relativistic energy of the nucleus, not rest mass energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m_0 * c². But wait, the options are given in GeV, so maybe I can work in natural units where c=1, so it's E = gamma * m_0.

But wait, the mass of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is Li-6, so I need its mass. Do I know the exact mass? Probably, I can look up the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it using the atomic mass.

Wait, I'm not given any specific data, so perhaps I can rely on standard values. Let me think. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c² (since they're similar but neutrons are slightly heavier). But wait, I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, maybe I can use the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Because, for example, carbon-12 has a mass of 12 u, so each u is about 1.66e-27 kg. But maybe I should just use the molar mass in u and then convert to GeV/c².

Wait, another approach: the mass of a proton is about 938.3 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be (3 * 938.3) + (3 * 939.565) MeV/c².

Let me compute that:

3 * 938.3 = 2814.9 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total = 2814.9 + 2818.695 = 5633.595 MeV = 5.633595 GeV. So m_0 ≈ 5.6336 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than that because in the nucleus, the binding energy reduces the mass. Oh no, wait, no, the binding energy is accounted for in the mass of the nucleus. Wait, no, nuclear binding energy comes from the mass defect. So the sum of the individual protons and neutrons would be higher than the actual nucleus. So the actual mass of Li-6 is lower than 6 * average nucleon mass.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass as simply 6 times the proton mass, which is an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the proton mass as 938 MeV/c², and for the nucleus, it's 6 * 938 MeV.

But wait, maybe that's not accurate. Let me think. The actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 5.639 GeV/c². Because, for example, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV, and a neutron is about 939.56
