Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. All other reactions remain the same. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, the ratio is flux of band 1 divided by flux of band 2.

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. Oh right, the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-III branch involves reactions where a proton captures a helium-4 nucleus (alpha particle) to form beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to become boron-8, which then decays into lithium-7 and emits positrons and neutrinos. Oh wait, no, actually, the pp-III branch is when a proton combines with a helium-4 nucleus (He-4) to make beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to become boron-8, which then decays into lithium-7 plus a positron and a neutrino. So, this is one of the steps in the proton-proton chain for hydrogen fusion into helium.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, that would stop the production of boron-8. And since boron-8 decays into lithium-7 and emits a neutrino, stopping pp-III would mean less of these neutrinos. But wait, the question is about the flux of solar neutrinos, which comes from various sources.

Wait, the solar neutrinos are mainly from two main processes: the proton-proton (pp) chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp-chain contributes about 90% of the solar neutrinos, and the CNO cycle contributes the remaining 10%. But wait, the pp-chain has two main branches. The pp-I branch (the most common) produces helium-4, and the pp-II and pp-III branches are minor. Oh, right, pp-III is the one involving He-4 capture.

So, in the pp-III branch, when Be-7 captures a proton to form B-8, which then decays into Li-7, positron, and a neutrino. So, the neutrinos from pp-III have a certain energy spectrum. But if the pp-III branch stops, those neutrinos won't be produced anymore.

Wait, but the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So, only the pp-III is stopped. So, the other branches (pp-I and CNO) are still active.

Now, the neutrino flux from the Sun comes from various sources. The dominant neutrinos are the electron neutrinos (Î½_e) from the pp-chain and the CNO cycle. The pp-chain neutrinos have lower energies compared to the CNO neutrinos. Because the CNO cycle involves higher temperatures and heavier elements, so the neutrinos emitted are higher energy.

So, when the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III neutrinos are part of the pp-chain, so their production would stop. But since other branches of the pp-chain (like pp-I) continue, the overall neutrino flux from the pp-chain would decrease but not entirely stop. But wait, the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands, so I need to think about how the pp-III neutrinos contribute to each band.

Wait, the bands in the question are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, if the pp-III neutrinos are in a certain energy range, stopping their production would affect these bands.

I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in a higher energy range than the main pp-I neutrinos. Because, in the main pp-I process, the neutrinos are emitted when a boron-8 decays. Beryllium-8
