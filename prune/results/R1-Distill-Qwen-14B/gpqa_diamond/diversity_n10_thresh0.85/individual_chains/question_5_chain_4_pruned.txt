Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each of which is given as ħ/2 multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices.

Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator is often represented by P, which is a vector operator with components in x, y, and z directions. So I think this P is analogous to the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, like an electron or muon.

Each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) is given by ħ/2 times a matrix. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

These look familiar. They're the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is a spin-1/2 system, probably. So the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2 for each component.

The question is to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along a direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, so the operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n. So I think we need to find the eigenvector for the operator in that arbitrary direction.

Wait, the operator P is along n, so the operator is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, that means n_y is zero. So n is in the x-z plane, so its direction is given by angles θ and φ, but since it's in x-z, φ is either 0 or π, right? Or perhaps, in x-z plane, the direction can be parameterized as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, usually, for a direction in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle. If n is in the x-z plane, then φ is 0 or π. But wait, x-z plane is φ=0 or 180 degrees because that's where the projection on the y-axis is zero.

But the problem says "an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane". So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle between n and the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the φ angle is 0, so the direction is given by (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is from 0 to π.

Wait, no, the standard spherical coordinates have θ between 0 and
