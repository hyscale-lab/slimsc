Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And its mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. They observed the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest, and found them to be the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelength at which a star appears brightest is related to its temperature. Oh right, that's Wien's Law. So if the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same since Wien's displacement law says lambda_max * T = constant.

So, both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point.

The radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight, so it affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the velocities are causing a Doppler shift, but since the observed lambda_max is the same, perhaps we have to account for that when considering their actual temperatures?

Wait a second, no. Because the problem states that through spectroscopy, they found the wavelengths to be the same. So in their observed frames, the lambda_max is the same. But that might imply that their rest-frame temperatures differ because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating that. Let me think again. The star emits at a certain lambda_max, but due to Doppler shift, the observed lambda could be different. But the problem says that the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. So the Doppler shift might affect the calculation of their actual temperatures.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity. Luminosity L is given by 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

But wait, if they have the same observed lambda_max, but their velocities are different, then their actual temperatures (in rest frame) might be different. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so observed lambda is shorter than emitted. Conversely, if moving away, redshifted, longer lambda.

So, let's denote that:

For Star_1, radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s. So no Doppler shift. Observed lambda_max = emitted lambda_max_1.

For Star_2, v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so observed lambda_max_2 is longer than emitted. But problem says that observed lambda_max_1 = observed lambda_max_2. So their emitted lambda_max's must be different.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So that's the observed lambda_max. So both have the same observed lambda_max, but their actual emitted lambda_max's (rest frame) would differ
