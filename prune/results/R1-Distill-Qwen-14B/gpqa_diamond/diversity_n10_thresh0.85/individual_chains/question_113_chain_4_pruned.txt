Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the chemical formula from the options given.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peakâ€”maybe it's an -OH group. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Oh, those are important. The 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 could be either another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, sometimes conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? Or maybe an amide? Hmm.

Wait, for example, a ketone or an ester would have a carbonyl around 1700. If there's another peak at 1650, maybe it's an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Or maybe another carbonyl in a different environment, like conjugated with something. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe a conjugated double bond.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. They mention peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, right? So that suggests that the molecule has a double bond, maybe conjugated with something else. Like an aromatic ring or a carbonyl group.

Now the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z =45. I'm trying to think what fragments would give that. 45 is a common mass. Let me think about possible fragments. For instance, the CH3CO+ ion is 43, but that's not 45. Maybe a CO2 loss? Or perhaps something else. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O+ (which is 45: 12*2 + 1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46? Wait, no. Hmm. Maybe a fragment like C3H7O+? No, that's 58 (12*3 +7 +16=36+7+16=59? Not quite. Alternatively, maybe a ketene fragment? Or perhaps the fragment is from a methyl ester or something. Wait, another thought: the molecular ion might break down into smaller parts. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, the ester could cleave, producing a fragment like the acid part and the alcohol part. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a small ring like cyclopropane, but that doesn't fit with the other data.

Let me think about the possible molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, four options, all with six carbons. Let's think about each possibility.

FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 could be O-H from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But the presence of two carbonyl peaks is interesting. Wait, 1700 and 1650. Could one be a ketone and the other an ester? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds.

Wait, another possibility: one of the peaks is from a carbonyl, the other from a conjugated double bond, like in an aromatic ring. For example, if the structure has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring, the carbonyl might be at 1700, and the aromatic C=C around 1650. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an amide's carbonyl, but that's less likely given the other data.

Looking at the NMR: vinyl hydrogens. So that means there's a double bond with adjacent H's. So maybe an alkene, perhaps conjugated with another group.

Mass spec: m/z 45. Let's think of possible fragments. Maybe the molecule has a methyl group attached to something else. If the molecular formula is C6H12O2, for example, the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. If a fragment is at 45, perhaps a (CH3)2CO group? Wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is 58 (12*3 +6*1 +16=
