Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on their form. Oh right, in general relativity, the metric can tell us about the curvature of spacetime, but here maybe it's a 2D spacelike surface?

So, the question is about a pseudosphere. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a saddle shape. And the area of a pseudosphere... I think it's infinite. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Hold on. I'm a bit confused because I know that a sphere has a finite area, but a pseudosphere, which is like a hyperbolic surface, might have an infinite area. Or is that right?

Wait, the given metric is ds^2 = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's see. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks similar to the metric for a sphere. Oh wait, no. Wait, for a sphere in 2D, the metric is (R²/(R² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), or something like that. Or maybe for a hyperboloid, the denominator would be (a² - x² - y²) or similar.

Wait, let's think about the form. The given metric is in terms of x and y, so it's a 2-dimensional metric. The line element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm. Let me see. If I rewrite this, it's like ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr², where r² = x² + y². So, if r² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, meaning the metric blows up. So that suggests that the surface extends up to r² =4, which is radius 2. But wait, wait. No, because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the area element (which is sqrt(det g) dx dy) would blow up. So perhaps that's the boundary, the edge of the pseudosphere.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the metric. The metric ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dx² + dy²). So let's compute the area of a region in this space. The area element would be the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor here is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]², where r² is x² + y². Wait, no. Because determinant for a 2D metric in diagonal form is (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy)^2, but since g_xy is zero, it's just g_xx * g_yy. So determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]².

But wait, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt of that determinant is 32/(4 - r²). So the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. 

Wait, but to find the area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined. What's the domain of x and y here? The denominator 4 - r² must be positive, because otherwise you'd have a negative or zero in the denominator, which would make the metric undefined. So 4 - r² > 0 → r² <4 → r <2. So the metric is defined for points where x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but that's just the flat space inside a circle of radius 2. But the metric here isn't flat; it's scaled by 32/(4 - r²). So the area element isn't flat either. So the total area would be the integral of [32/(4 - r²)] over all r <2.

Wait, but let me think about the pseudosphere. I thought the pseudosphere (a tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature. But here, the metric is in 2D, but perhaps it's embedded in 3D, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2."

Wait, another approach. Let's recall that in 2D, a pseudosphere of radius a has Gaussian curvature K = -1/a². The area of a pseudosphere is infinite because it's a non-compact surface. For example, consider the tractrix, which forms a surface when rotated, and this surface has finite volume when embedded in 3D, but I'm not sure about the 2D area. Wait, wait, in 2D, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface, so the area would be infinite.

But wait, the given metric looks like a hyperbolic metric. Let's check the Gaussian curvature. The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = E(dx² + dy²), where E is a function, can be found using the formula. Alternatively, for conformally flat metrics, the Gaussian curvature can be computed using the formula involving the function's derivatives.

Wait, the metric is conformally flat because it's just a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric. The Gaussian curvature K for a conformal metric (f(dx² + dy²)) is given by K = - (1/(2f)) Δ ln f, where Δ is the flat Laplacian. Let me compute that.

So, f(r) = 32/(4 - r²), where r² =x² + y². So first, compute ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²). The Laplacian in 2D for a radially symmetric function is Δ ln f = (1/r) d/dr (r d(ln f)/dr).

Compute d(ln f)/dr = d/dr [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ) ] = [ 0 - (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = (2r)/(4 - r²).

Multiply by r: r*(2r)/(4 - r²) = (2 r²)/(4 - r²).

Then take the derivative with respect to r: d/dr [2 r²/(4 - r²)] = [ (4r)(4 - r²) + 2 r² * 2 r ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, let me compute that correctly. Using the quotient rule: derivative of numerator times denominator minus numerator times derivative of denominator, all over denominator squared.

Numerator of the big fraction is 2 r². Denominator is (4 - r²).

So, derivative of numerator: 4 r.

Derivative of denominator: -2r.

So, d/dr [2 r²/(4 - r²)] = [4r*(4 - r²) - 2 r²*(-2r)] / (4 - r²)^2.

Let me compute numerator:

4r*(4 - r²) = 16r -4 r^3.

2 r²*(-2r) = -4 r^3. But since it's minus that term, it becomes +4 r^3.

So total numerator: 16 r -4 r^3 +4 r^3 = 16 r.

So the derivative is 16 r / (4 - r²)^2.

So, putting it all together, Δ ln f = (1/r) * [16 r/(4 - r²)^2] = 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, K = -(1/(2 f)) * Δ ln f.

f is 32/(4 - r²), so 1/(2f) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So K = -( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 ) )

Simplify:

(4 - r²) cancels with denominator (4 - r²)^2, leaving 1/(4 - r²). So:

K = - (16 * (4 - r²) ) / (64 (4 - r²)^2) ) → Wait, wait let me compute again.

Wait:

K = - [1/(2f)] * [Δ ln f]

Δ ln f is 16/(4 - r²)^2.

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/(64) ) ] * [16/(4 - r²)^2 ]

Multiply: (4 - r²) * 16 / [64 (4 - r²)^2 ] → 16 / [64 (4 - r²) ) ] = (1)/(4 (4 - r²)).

Wait, 16 /64 =1/4. So K= - [1/(4 (4 - r²)) ].

Hmm, wait, that gives K= -1/(4(4 - r²)). But that's varying with r, which suggests that the curvature isn't constant, which conflicts with the idea of a pseudosphere (which should have constant negative curvature).

Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me go back. The function f is 32/(4 - r²). So ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²). The Laplacian of ln f is:

Δ ln f = (1/r) d/dr (r d/dr ln f )

d/dr ln f = (2r)/(4 - r²).

So r d/dr ln f = r*(2r)/(4 - r²) = 2 r²/(4 - r²).

d/dr of that is d/dr [2 r²/(4 - r²)].

Let me compute that again. Let me set u=2 r², v=4 -r². Then u’=4 r, v’=-2 r.

So derivative is (u’ v - u v’ ) / v² = (4 r (4 - r²) - (2 r²)(-2 r )) / (4 - r²)^2.

Compute numerator:

4r *4 =16 r

4r*(-r²) = -4 r^3

2 r² * 2 r =4 r^3

So terms:

16 r -4 r^3 +4 r^3 = 16 r.

So numerator is 16 r, denominator (4 - r²)^2.

So derivative is 16 r/(4 - r²)^2.

So Δ ln f = (1/r) * (16 r)/(4 - r²)^2 ) → 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, K = - (1/(2 f)) * [16/(4 - r²)^2 ].

Since f=32/(4 - r²), 1/(2f) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So K= - [ (4 - r²)/(64) ) * (16)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Simplify: (4 - r²) in numerator and denominator cancels, so (16)/(64 (4 - r²)) → 16/64 = 1/4 → K= -1/(4(4 - r²)).

Wait, that's still variable. So the curvature depends on r, which implies this isn't a surface of constant curvature. Hmm. So maybe the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere. But the question states it's a pseudosphere. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is a representation of a pseudosphere but using a different coordinate system. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the area instead of worrying about the curvature.

The area is the integral over all x and y where 4 - x² - y² > 0, so within the circle of radius 2.

The area element is [32/(4 - r^2)] dx dy.

So in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So the area becomes the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2.

So area = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The θ integral is straightforward: 2π. So area = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let's make substitution: let u=4 - r², then du= -2r dr. So r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (u=4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2) ) / u ].

Which is ∫ (u=4 to 0) [ (-16) / u ] du = ∫ (u=0 to4) [16/u] du.

Wait, wait, let me go step by step.

Our integral is ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Substitute u=4−r² → du=−2 r dr → r dr= - du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 * (-du/2)) / u.

= ∫ (-16 du) /u.

But the limits change: r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral becomes from u=4 to u=0: ∫ [ (-16)/u ] du.

Which can be rewritten as ∫ from u=4 to 0: (-16)/u du = ∫ from 0 to4: (16)/u du.

So 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du =16 [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

But as u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches -infty. So the integral diverges to +infty because 16 times (ln4 - (-inf)) is +infty.

Wait, but that can't be right because the integral becomes:

16 [ ln(4) - ln(0) ] → ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(4) is finite. So it's (ln4 - (-infty)) → positive infinity.

Thus, the integral diverges, so the area is infinite.

Wait, but wait, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the area element blows up. So the area is infinite.

So the answer would be D) +infty.

Looking at the options, option D is "+\infty", which matches.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). 

### Key Observations:
1. **Metric Analysis**: The metric is conformally flat, meaning it is a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric. The function scaling the metric is \( f(r) = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \), where \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \). The denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) ensures the metric is defined only for \( r < 2 \), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

2. **Area Element**: The area element in this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. For a diagonal metric \( ds^2 = E(dx^2 + dy^2) \), the area element is \( \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \). Here, \( \det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2 \), so the area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

3. **Integration in Polar Coordinates**: To compute the total area, switch to polar coordinates where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The area integral becomes:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Integral**: Separate the angular and radial integrals. The angular integral over \( \theta \) gives \( 2\pi \), leaving:
   \[
   A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]

5. **Substitution**: Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). Changing the limits:
   - When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \).
   - When \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \).

   The integral becomes:
   \[
   A = 2\pi \int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 2\pi \int_0^4 \frac{16}{u} \, du.
   \]

6. **Divergence of the Integral**: The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{16}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \frac{1}{u} \) approaches infinity as \( u \to 0 \). This implies that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

### Conclusion:
The area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.
