Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction scheme with compounds A to E, and I need to find out what E is. There are four options given, all ketones, based on their structures.

Let me start by jotting down the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form E.

Then, there are two hints. 

Hint a) says that Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are usually used in Wittig reactions. So A might be a carbonyl compound because Wittig reactions typically form alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. So A is probably a ketone or aldehyde.

Hint b) IR spectra: A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower, maybe an aromatic ketone or a more substituted ketone? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

Let me go step by step. 

First, Reaction 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone or aldehyde, adding HCN would likely form a cyanohydrin. Wait, but I remember that when ketones react with HCN, they form cyanohydrins, which have an -OH and -CN group on adjacent carbons. So B would be a cyanohydrin.

Reaction 2: B is then reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So what happens when a cyanohydrin is hydrogenated? The -OH and -CN might get reduced. Wait, the -CN group is a nitrile, which upon hydrogenation becomes an amine, but under certain conditions, maybe it's hydrogenated to an alkane. Wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of nitriles with H2 and a catalyst like palladium would typically give a primary amine. But wait, maybe the hydrogenation is partial or under different conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl groups are hydrogenated first. Let me think.

Wait, cyanohydrins have a structure like R-C(OH)-CH2-CN? Or perhaps more accurately, the structure would be R-C(OH)(CN)-R'. Wait, no, the actual structure would be R2C(OH)-CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I should think of the structure of B. When a ketone like R2CO reacts with HCN, it becomes R2C(OH)-CH2CN. So when B is hydrogenated, the nitrile (CN) group would become a CH2NH2 group? Or maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation reduces the nitr
