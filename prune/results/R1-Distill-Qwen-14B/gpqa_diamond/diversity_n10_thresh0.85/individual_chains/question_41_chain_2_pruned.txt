Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question says there's a light beam propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, speed of light in glass... Normally, when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the glass itself is moving. So I can't just say it's c/n, because the glass's movement affects how the observer perceives the light.

But wait, the observer is in the lab, which is the stationary frame. The glass is moving towards the observer. So I'm probably dealing with a scenario where I have to consider the velocity of the medium (glass) and how that affects the observed speed of light.

I remember that when a medium is moving, the way light is observed changes. If the medium is moving towards the observer, the light's speed might be different than if the medium were stationary. But wait, isn't the speed of light in a vacuum always c, regardless of the source's motion? Oh right, that's Einstein's postulate. But here, the medium is moving, not the source of light. So maybe I need to think about it in terms of the medium's velocity affecting the light's speed in that medium.

Wait, the light is inside the glass, which is moving. So in the glass's rest frame,
