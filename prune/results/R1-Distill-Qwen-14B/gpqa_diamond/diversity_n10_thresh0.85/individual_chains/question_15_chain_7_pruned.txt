Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, and based on that, which one the researchers should observe. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I remember that the transit method detects a planet when it passes in front of its star, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight.

Wait, actually I think the probability also depends on the orbital period and the size of the star. I recall that the transit probability can be approximated by the formula P = (R_planet / a) * ( (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5) ), but wait, since both orbits are circular, e is zero. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, no, I think the formula for the transit probability when we don't have inclination information is P = (R_s / a_p) * ( (R_s + R_p) / (a_p * sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since e=0, it's just (R_s + R_p)/a_p * (R_s/a_p). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing parts.

Wait, I think more accurately, the probability P is approximately (R*/a) * ( (R* + Rp) / (a * sqrt(1)) ), but perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ), but since e=0, it's (R* + Rp)/a.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the relative sizes. The transit probability is higher when the planet’s orbital plane is edge-on to our line of sight. But since we don't know the inclination, the probability is the fraction of possible inclinations that would result in a transit. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, I think the probability is 2/R (something like that). Wait, no, perhaps the formula is P = (R_p + R_s) / a * 1/(sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2))? Or maybe it's (R_p / a)^2 * (1 +
