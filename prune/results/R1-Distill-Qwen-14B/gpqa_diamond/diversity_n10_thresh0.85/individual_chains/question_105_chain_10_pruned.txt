Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The question is about how the star's brightness variations compare to the signal from an exoplanet. Specifically, when only one hemisphere is spotted, the brightness changes over time because the star rotates, showing the spots. This can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star when observed from Earth. 

The question is asking what radius a hypothetical exoplanet would need to have to produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spotted star, assuming the star wasn't spotted. So, we need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, okay. So when a planet transits in front of a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. Because the area blocked is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So the amplitude of the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But in this case, the star's brightness variation isn't due to a planet, but due to spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing towards us, they make the star appear dimmer because they're blocking part of the star's hotter surface. Wait, no, actually, the spots are dark, so when they're on the hemisphere facing us, the total brightness we receive decreases.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view as the star spins. The amount of brightness variation depends on how much of the spotted area is visible as the star rotates.

Wait, but in this scenario, it's only one hemisphere that's spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The star's brightness would dip when the spots are on the side facing us.

So the brightness variation due to the spots would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature compared to the rest of the star. Because the spots are cooler, they contribute less to the star's light.

Wait, but the problem says that the brightness variations can be similar to those caused by an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots is the same as that caused by a planet. We need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

So the approach would be to calculate the fractional change in brightness due to the spots and set that equal to the fractional change due to the planet.

Let me think. The star's brightness without spots is L = 4πR^2σTeff^4. The spots have a lower temperature, T_spot = Teff - 1000K = 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots in the hemisphere is 0.2. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the total area of the spots on the star is 0.2 * (2πR^2) / 2? Wait, not sure. Wait
