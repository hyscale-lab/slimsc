Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots cover part of it. The main thing we're looking at is the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember something about Boltzmann's equation from my studies. Oh right, in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of different energy levels depends on temperature. 

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that happen? Oh, right, the spots are cooler, so when a significant portion is covered, the average temperature of the star's photosphere goes down. 

The problem says that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 (let's call it n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is spotted, this ratio is lower. But we need to find the factor by which it changes. Basically, we want (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted, or the other way around? Wait, the question says, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So unspotted has a higher ratio. So the factor is (unspotted_ratio)/(spotted_ratio) = factor.

Boltzmann's equation says that the ratio of populations is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet. But wait, the exact wavelength might not be directly needed if we can find the energy difference from the wavelength. Alternatively, maybe we can use the relation between energy and wavelength, E = hc/λ. 

Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Calculating that: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J. 

But wait, we might need this in terms of energy per photon, but Bolt
