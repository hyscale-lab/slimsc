Okay, so I have this astronomy question to solve. Let me read it again and think through what it's asking. Hmm.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' or 'plx', right? So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. They want to know how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance, r.

Wait, parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right! Parallax p is equal to 1 divided by distance d in parsecs. So p = 1/d. So if p increases, d decreases, and vice versa.

The number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5, which I can write as N ∝ 1/(p^5). Since p is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think they're asking about the differential number of stars, like how many stars you get per additional distance unit. So that's the derivative of N with respect to d, I think.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then the derivative dN/dd is proportional to 5 d^4. Wait, but wait, the question is about the change per unit range of distance, r. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're just looking for the dependence, not the exact derivative.

Let me think again. They say N is proportional to 1/(p^5). Since p = 1/d, N is proportional to d^5. So as distance d increases, the number of stars increases with d^5.

Wait, but the options given are about how the number changes with distance. So per unit r, which I think refers to a small change in r. Oh wait, perhaps the question is about the differential, like the number of stars per unit distance. So it's about the number density as a function of distance.

So if N = k * d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (like stars per parsec) would be dN/dd, which is 5k d^4. So that would imply that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but the question says, "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit r, meaning the number per unit distance interval. Oh wait, maybe the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r, with thickness dr. So the number would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this correctly. Let's define N as the number of stars in a volume element. Let's say the volume element is a spherical shell at distance r with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is 4π r² dr.

But wait, the number of stars per unit volume is given by some function. Wait, in the question, it's said that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/p^5. So N is proportional to 1/p^5. But p is 1/r, since p=1/d and d is the distance.

So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5. So the number of stars in the shell would be N_shell = (r^5) * (volume element). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because N is the number of stars, which depends on the volume and the density.

Wait, I'm getting a
