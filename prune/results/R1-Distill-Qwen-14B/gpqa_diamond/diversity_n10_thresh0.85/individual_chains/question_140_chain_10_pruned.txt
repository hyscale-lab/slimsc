Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again and figure out what's going on.

So, the question talks about Substance X reacting violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Oh, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. 

Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.

First, let's think about the reaction. So, X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and B when heated. The gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For a molecule, same number of protons and neutrons. So, each atom in the molecule would have equal p and n. Wait, no, the molecule's entire molecule has same number of p and n. Wait, no, I think it's that the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Like, H2O has 10 protons (H:1 each, O:8) and 10 neutrons (O has 8 neutrons, H has 0). Wait, but H2O's molecule would have 10 protons and 8+0+0 =8 neutrons? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the molecule has the same number of protons as neutrons. So, if W is H2O, protons are 2 (H) + 8 (O) =10. Neutrons: O has 8, so 8. So 10 protons vs 8 neutrons. Not the same. So that's not it.

Another possibility is CO2. Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's the isotope ^12C). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (if ^16O). CO2: protons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So that's equal. So W could be CO2.

But wait, the reaction is violent. So what reactions produce CO2? Maybe metal carbonates reacting with acid? But Y is a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps a reaction between a metal and an acid producing CO2. But that would require the metal to be more reactive, but the acid would be perhaps HCl or something. Wait, but if W is CO2, then perhaps X is a carbonate reacting with an acid (like HCl) to produce CO2, water, and a precipitate.

Alternatively, another gas could be something else. Maybe NH3? But NH3 has 14 protons (N has 7, H has 1 each, so 7 + 3 =10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 (if ^14N?), or maybe not. Wait, ammonia has 10 protons (N:7, 3 H:1 each) and 7 (N's neutrons) + 3*0 (H) =7. So 10 vs 7, not equal.

Wait, another possibility is CH4. Protons: C (6) + 4 H (1 each) =10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if ^12C), H has 0. So 6 neutrons. 10 vs 6, not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe O2? O2 molecule: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons in O2: 16. Neutrons: 16. So that's equal. So O2 could be the gas W. But under what reaction conditions would O2 be released? Maybe a decomposition reaction, but that seems less likely in a violent reaction.

Wait, what about H2? Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. So 2 vs 0, not equal.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the gas is D2 (deuterium), but that's not a molecule with multiple atoms. Alternatively, maybe something like C2H2? Let's see: C has 6 protons, H has 1 each. So 2 C's give 12, 2 H's give 2. Total protons:14. Neutrons: C would have 6 each (assuming ^12C), so 12, and H has 0, so total 12. 14 vs 12—nope. Doesn't match.

Wait, another possible gas is CO. Let's calculate. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons:14. For neutrons: C has 6, O has 8. So 14, same as protons. So CO would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that's equal. So W could be CO. What reactions produce CO? Maybe the decomposition of certain compounds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, what about H2O? Wait, earlier I thought it didn't match, but let me recalculate. H2O: H has 1 each, O has 8. So 2*(1) + 8 =10 protons. O has 8 neutrons, H has 0. So 8 neutrons. 10 protons vs 8 neutrons—nope.

Wait another thought: Ozone, O3. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O3 has 24 protons and 24 neutrons. So that's equal. But is O3 a likely gas in such a reaction? I
