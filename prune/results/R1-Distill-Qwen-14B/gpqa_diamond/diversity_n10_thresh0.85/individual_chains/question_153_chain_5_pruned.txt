Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about three different Michael addition reactions, labeled A, B, and C, each with their own set of reactants and products. I need to figure out what the major products are for each and match them with the given options.

First, let's recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (like an enolate) to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the beta position of the carbonyl compound, which is more electrophilic. This results in a new carbon-carbon bond formation.

Looking at the first reaction (A):

The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it likely deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate.

So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form a resonance-stabilized enolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with the substituent at the 3 position being p-tolyl. Wait, no, waitâ€”actually, the structure would be CH2-CO-OCH3 attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it mentally. The formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and carbon 3 is connected to the p-tolyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, alternative: the structure is (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-p-tolyl. No, perhaps I should think of it as the double bond being between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, the numbering can be tricky.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon of the acrylate. But the acrylate is only three carbons: the double bond is between C1 and C2 (CH2=CH-), then the third carbon is connected to the COO
