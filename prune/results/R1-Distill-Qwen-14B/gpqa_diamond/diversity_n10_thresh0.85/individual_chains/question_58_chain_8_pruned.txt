Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work out by introducing a cutoff or something temporary to handle the infinities, and then you take that away in the end.

So the options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) does have issues with renormalization. Wait, no, wait. Regularization is part of renormalization. So QED does require renormalization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get these divergences. So you need to regularize them, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization, then renormalize.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is similar. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, and it also has issues with renormalization. But I think in QCD, the theory is asymptotically free, so at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, which is why perturbation theory works. But does it require regularization? I think yes, because even though it's asymptotically free, the calculations still involve divergences, so you need to regularize and renormalize.

Superstring Theory is a bit different. Strings are supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? And they're background-dependent. Oh, wait, and string theories have a sort of natural UV completion. Because string theory doesn't have point particles, the perturbative expansion is in terms of strings, and maybe the infinities are handled differently. Or wait, do string theories require regularization? I'm a bit confused here. I think that in string theory, you don't have the same kind of divergences as in QFT because the stringy nature smooths things out. Or maybe they do require it, but in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps string theory doesn't need it because it's a theory that is already finite, or perhaps it handles the infinities through other mechanisms like the string tension or higher-order corrections.

Wait, another point: in QED and QCD, you have to regularize because the loop integrals give you divergences. But in string theory, the loop expansion corresponds to different loop orders, which might not have the same kind of divergences. Or maybe in string theory, the infinities are tamed by the theory's structure, so you don't need to do the same kind of regularization as in QFT. Or I might be mixing up things. Alternatively, maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's a different approach to the problem.

Oh, wait, I remember that in string theory, the concept of regularization isn't the same. Instead of using cutoffs or dimensional regularization like in QFT, string theory handles UV divergences through the structure of the theory itself. For example, the higher-order terms in the string expansion might cancel the divergences. Or perhaps in string theory, you don't have the same issues because the interactions are different, like in a non-perturbative way. Hmm,
