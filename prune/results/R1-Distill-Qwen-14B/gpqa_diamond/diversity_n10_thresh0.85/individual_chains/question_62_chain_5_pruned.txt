Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde means there's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. But wait, the substituents are more complex. There's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Oh, right, so the main chain is cyclohexane with a CHO group and a branch that's a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2OH group.

Wait, no. Let me parse the name again. 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. On carbon 1 of this ring, there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. The cyclohexyl is connected to a CH2OH group, which is attached to carbon 1. Also, the main ring has a carbaldehyde groupâ€”so a CHO attached to carbon 1 as well. Wait, no, wait. Carbon 1 is the same as where the substituents are attached? So, carbon 1 has two groups: the cyclohexylCH2OH and the CHO? Or wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2OH attached to cyclohexyl, and that's on carbon 1 of the cyclohexane. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this mentally. The main structure is a cyclohexane ring. At position 1 (let's pick a carbon), there's a CH2 group attached. This CH2 is connected to a hydroxyl group (OH) on one side and a cyclohexyl group on the other. So, the structure is like cyclohexane with a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on carbon 1. Additionally, the same carbon (carbon 1) has a formyl group (CHO). So, the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that is a CH2OH connected to cyclohexyl, and a CHO group attached to the same carbon. So, it's something like:

cyclohexane ring with CHO at C1, and a CH2 group connected to C1, which is itself connected to OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, but the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has, at position 1, a methyl group (CH2-) that has two substituents: hydroxy (OH) and cyclohexyl. So, it's a CH2 group with OH and cyclohexyl attached. And in addition, the same carbon (C1) has a CHO group.

Wait, but that would mean C1 has three substituents: the cyclohexane ring itself, the CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group, and the CHO
