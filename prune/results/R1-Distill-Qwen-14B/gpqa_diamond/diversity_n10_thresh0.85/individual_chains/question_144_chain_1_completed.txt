Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to work through this. The question gives me the production energy, mass, and width of the meson X. I need to find the mean decay distance. 

Wait, I remember that decay length has something to do with the particle's lifetime and velocity. Oh right! The formula for mean decay distance is c multiplied by the lifetime (tau) multiplied by the velocity (beta times c). So L = c * tau * beta. 

But wait, how do I find the lifetime tau from the given width Gamma? I think the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Gamma is related to the mean lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is Gamma = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Gamma. Oh wait, no, wait. Gamma is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime. So tau is approximately hbar divided by Gamma.

Wait, let me get the exact formula right. Gamma is the total decay width. The relation is Gamma = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Gamma. But wait, no, I think it's actually Gamma = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Gamma. So Gamma is the energy width, and tau is the lifetime.

But wait, the units might be tricky. Gamma is given in MeV. Hbar is in J·s. Hmm, I'll need to make sure the units work out.

First, let's note down the given values:

E_X = 8 GeV (production energy)
m_X = 1.2 GeV (mass)
Gamma_X = 320 MeV (width)

Wait, but for decay length, production energy might not be directly needed. Because the decay happens when the particle is produced, so perhaps it's the mass that's more relevant for the lifetime. Or perhaps it's the total energy? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Maybe the production energy relates to the velocity of the particle, which would affect the decay length.

Wait, but in the formula, L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Oh wait, because tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma times tau. Wait, no, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c^2). So the lifetime observed is gamma times tau. So the decay length would be velocity multiplied by the lifetime, which is beta c * tau_observed. But tau_observed is gamma * tau_proper. So putting it together, L = beta c gamma tau_proper.

Alternatively, since tau_proper is hbar / Gamma, and gamma is E/(m c^2) / hbar? Hmm, maybe I should get the expressions right.

Wait, let's break it down step by step.

First, find the lifetime tau. Tau is hbar divided by the width Gamma. So tau = hbar / Gamma.

But Gamma is in MeV, and hbar is in J·s. So I'll need to convert Gamma from MeV to Joules.

Wait, another approach: I remember that in particle physics, c=1 in these units, but when converting to SI units, I have to be careful.

Alternatively, I can use natural units where ħ = c = 1. But when converting to meters, I need to reintroduce the constants.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the decay length in terms of production energy, mass, and width. Let me think.

The mean decay length should be given by L = (c * tau) * beta gamma, but wait, beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). Alternatively, the formula is L = (gamma beta c tau). 

So the steps are:

1. Compute gamma from the energy. Gamma is E/(m c^2). But E is the total energy, which is given as 8 GeV. Wait, but the mass is 1.2 GeV, so E = gamma m c^2. So gamma = E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but I'm not sure if E is the total energy. Alternatively, I'm assuming that the production energy is the total energy of the meson, so E = gamma m c^2. So yes, gamma is E/(m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

2. Compute beta. Since gamma is 6.6667, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ 1 - 1/(2 gamma^2) for large gamma. But let's compute it exactly.

gamma = 6.6667. So gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444. So 1/gamma^2 = 9/400=0.0225. So 1 - 1/(gamma^2)= 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

3. Now compute tau. Tau = hbar / Gamma. Wait, but Gamma is in MeV, and hbar is in J·s. So I need to convert Gamma into Joules.

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1.60218e-13 J. Gamma is 320 MeV, so Gamma = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 5.126976e-11 J.

So tau = hbar / Gamma. Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s. So hbar is h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So tau = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.126976e-11 J) ≈ 2.055e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

hbar is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 320e6 eV.

Each eV is 1.60218e-19 J, so 320e6 eV =320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 320 * 1.60218e-13 J = 512.6976e-13 J = 5.126976e-11 J.

So tau = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = Let's compute that.

1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = (1.0545718 /5.126976) * 1e-23. Let's compute 1.0545718 /5.126976 ≈ 0.2055. So tau ≈ 0.2055e-23 seconds = 2.055e-24 seconds.

4. Now, compute the decay length L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Beta is approximately 0.9887, gamma is 6.6667, c is 3e8 m/s.

So let's compute each part:

beta * gamma ≈ 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.055e-24 s = 6.165e-16 meters.

Wait, 3e8 * 2.055e-24 = 3 * 2.055 = 6.165, and 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16. So 6.165e-16 meters.

Then multiply by beta*gamma: 6.591 * 6.165e-16 = Let me compute that.

6 *6 =36, 6 * 0.165e-16 is 0.99e-16, 0.591*6=3.546e-16, and 0.591*0.165e-16≈ 9.7515e-18.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

6.591 *6.165e-16.

Calculate 6 *6.165e-16 =36.99e-16.

0.591 *6.165e-16 = let's compute 6.165e-16 *0.591.

6.165 *0.591 ≈3.6397. So 3.6397e-16.

So total is 36.99e-16 +3.6397e-16 =40.6297e-16 meters. Which is 4.06297e-15 meters.

Wait, 40.6297e-16 meters is 4.06297e-15 meters. So approximately 4.063e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15. So our calculation is about 4.06e-15, which matches option B.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in computing beta*gamma.

Wait, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666..., which is 20/3. So gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444.

So 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = approximately 0.9887, as I had before.

Beta*gamma = (20/3) * sqrt(1 - 9/400) = (20/3)* sqrt(391/400) = (20/3)*(sqrt(391)/20) )= sqrt(391)/3. Let me compute sqrt(391). 19^2=361, 20^2=400. 391 is 10 less than 400, so sqrt(391)≈19.774. So 19.774 /3≈6.591. So that part is correct.

Then c*tau: c is 3e8 m/s. tau is 2.055e-24 s. 3e8 * 2.055e-24 = 6.165e-16 m.

Multiply by beta*gamma: 6.591 *6.165e-16 m.

Wait, 6 *6.165e-16 is 3.699e-15. 0.591 *6.165e-16 = 3.639e-16. So total is approx (3.699e-15 + 3.639e-16) = 4.0629e-15 m.

So the result is approximately 4.063e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close enough, considering rounding errors in the calculation steps.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \),
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Here, \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), so:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma^2 = (6.6667)^2 \approx 44.4444 \), we find:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} \), we convert \( \Gamma \) to joules. Using \( 1 \, \text{MeV} = 1.60218 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \), we find:

\[
\Gamma = 320 \times 1.60218 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \approx 5.126976 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is \( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Thus:

\[
\tau = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{5.126976 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.055 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.055 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.055 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, compute \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma \approx 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.591
\]

Next, compute \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.055 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.165 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = 6.591 \times 6.165 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.063 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated decay length is approximately \( 4.063 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B**.

**Answer: B**
