Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature of the star. Oh right, this is probably about the Boltzmann equation because it deals with the distribution of energy states in a system.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. I think the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution gives the probability of atoms being in a certain energy state, so the ratio of populations in two states should depend on the temperature and the energy difference.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. Oh, but in this case, we're comparing the same energy levels in two different stars. So maybe the ratio of the populations in star 1 and star 2 is given by their respective Boltzmann factors.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Let me clarify: does that mean the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same level? Or is the excitation higher in a higher energy level? Hmm, the wording says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the number of atoms in a specific excited state compared to the ground state? Or perhaps it's the ratio of the populations of two energy levels for each star.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's say for each star, the ratio of atoms in energy level E2 to E1 is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio is (n2/n1)_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between E2 and E1. Similarly, for star 2, (n2/n1)_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But wait, the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe (n2/n1) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So, the ratio n2/n1 for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

Wait, wait. Let me reread the question: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, perhaps the number in a specific excited state (like E2) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or maybe it's the ratio of E2 to E1 populations. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation potential is higher, which would mean higher energy states are more populated when the temperature is higher. So if star_1 has higher excitation, it's hotter than star_2.

Wait, the problem says the energy
