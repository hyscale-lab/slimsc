Okay, so I've got this question here about stars observable by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key here is their apparent magnitudes because each instrument has different brightness limits. From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So a star must have an apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17 to be seen by ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the way the question states it is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, but wait, no, brightness in astronomy is counterintuitive. Lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would mean its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because the scale is inverted; like, Sirius is about magnitude -1, which is brighter than a 0 magnitude star. So higher magnitude means fainter. So, if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means apparent V magnitude ≤17. Because if a star is, say, 16 mag, it's brighter than 17.

Wait no, no. Let me think again. The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse that. "Brighter than 17" would mean their magnitudes are lower than 17. So for example, a star with V magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V ≤16 because they're brighter than 16. So a star that is brighter than (apparent mag ≤) 16 would be observable by both? Or wait, no: ESPRESSO can go up to 17 mag, meaning it can observe stars as faint as 17. HIRES can observe up to 16, meaning fainter stars than that would not be seen. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 because HIRES can't go beyond 16. Because if a star is 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So to be detected by both, the star has to have V ≤16. Because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial conditions. The question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Oh! Wait, "brighter than 17 mag" means the V magnitude is less than 17. Because lower magnitude means brighter. So stars with V <17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. For HIRES, it's stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16. So a star with V=16 could be observed by HIRES? Or
