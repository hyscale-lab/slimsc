Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Wait, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. 

So the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the excitation level relates to the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)), where g's are the statistical weights and E's are the energies.

Wait, in this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me think. Let's denote the excited state as level 2 and the lower as level 1. So the ratio N2/N1 would be (g2/g1) * exp( -Î”E/(kT) ). 

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, N2,N1 ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1. Hmm, wait no, wait. It says in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as in star_2. So maybe the ratio N2 of star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm, but I might need to think more carefully.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So let's denote the ratio for star 1 as (N2/N1)_1 and for star 2 as (N2/N1)_2. The given is that (N2/N1)_1 = 2 * (N2/N1)_2. Or wait, maybe the ratio is twice as much; like, star_1 has double the excitation. So perhaps (N2/N1)_1 = 2 * (N2/N1)_2.

But wait, I should clarify. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy level. So
