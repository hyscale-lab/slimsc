Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is much closer to its star since orbital period is related to distance via Kepler's third law.

The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, more massive star but same radius. Well, more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe in this case, maybe the other star is less evolved or something. But the important thing is the radius for transit probability.

Wait, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. But wait, more factors are involved. Oh right, the probability also depends on the inclination of the orbit. The chance that the orbit is aligned such that the planet transits is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us.

The probability (P) of a transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (a + R_s)), but wait, I might be mixing some terms. Alternatively, I think the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (a/(R_s))^{1/2})) or something? No, maybe that's not right. Wait, let me think again.

The transit probability formula, as I recall, is P â‰ˆ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (1 / (1 + (a/(R_s))^{1/2}) ) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius over the distance between the star and the planet. Or perhaps another approach: the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 +
