Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think through this.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch stops suddenly in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is about the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if that reaction stops, the neutrinos produced from that process would stop reaching us after that time. But neutrinos are fast, so they should have been able to escape the Sun before then. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, so the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which is the primary source of solar energy. I remember that the pp chain has a few branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch involves higher energy reactions, perhaps producing higher energy neutrinos. Oh, right! The pp-III branch is responsible for producing the boron-8 isotope, which then goes on to form carbon-12 in the CNO cycle, I think. But wait, actually, maybe the pp-III is a part of the pp chain itself, not the CNO.

Oh, right, the pp chain steps: protons fuse into deuterium, then into helium-3 via the pp-I branch. Then, the two helium-3 nuclei can either combine into helium-4 (pp-II branch) or one can undergo a reaction to become boron-8 (pp-III branch). Boron-8 then decays into helium-4 and two positrons, releasing neutrinos in the process. So those neutrinos are from the pp-III branch.

So if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, that means no more boron-8 production. But wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. Hmm, but the pp-III is a part of the main pp chain. So the question is, what happens to the neutrino fluxes in two specific energy bands.

The neutrinos in question are the ones from the B-8 decay. They have a certain energy spectrum. The energy bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). What's the typical energy of solar neutrinos from pp-III?

I recall that the B-8 decay emits neutrinos with an average energy of about 1.4 MeV. Wait, but the question is about lower energy bands, so I'm a bit confused. Wait, maybe the neutrinos from B-8 decay are higher energy than what's in these bands. Are there other neutrino sources in the Sun?

Ah right, the dominant solar neutrinos are from B-8 decay, which have energies around 1.4 MeV. Then there are the CNO cycle neutrinos, which have lower energies, around 0.5 MeV or so. Wait, but the question is about two bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV, which is 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So these are lower energies than the
