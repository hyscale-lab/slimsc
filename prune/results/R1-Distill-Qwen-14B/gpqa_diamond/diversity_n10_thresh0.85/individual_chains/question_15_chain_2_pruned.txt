Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet detection methods, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So, they've already detected both via the radial velocity method, which gives them minimum masses and orbital periods. But now, they want to observe which one has a higher chance of transiting. Limited time, so they pick the one more likely.

The two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star since the period is shorter. Because orbital period relates to the distance from the star, right? Using Kepler's third law, which says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So for Planet_1, P1 = P2 /3. So (P1)^2 = (P2/3)^2, so (a1^3)/(a2^3) = (P1^2)/(P2^2) = 1/9. So a1^3 = a2^3 /9 â†’ a1 = a2/(cube root of 9). Cube root of 9 is about 2.08, so a1 is roughly a2 /2.08. So Planet_1 is closer.

Next, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, same radius but different masses. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something, but same radius as the other. Interesting.

So the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Since both have the same mass, but the radius depends on their respective stars. Wait, the planet has the same mass, but the star's radius is the same. So the ratio of planet radius to star radius is same? Or wait, no, because the planet's actual radius isn't given, but the question is about transit probability.

Wait, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit (which is 1% if random, but higher if edge-on), and also the size of the star relative
