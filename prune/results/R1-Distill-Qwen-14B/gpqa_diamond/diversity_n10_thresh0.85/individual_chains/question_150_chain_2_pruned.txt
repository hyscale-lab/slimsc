Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's see. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find out what the final product is from the options.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR peaks are as follows: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). 

Let me break this down. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group somewhere.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those are two doublets each integrating to 2H. Since they're doublets, maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but each is a doubletâ€”so perhaps a para-substituted benzene with two substituents on adjacent carbons? Or maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where each substituent is causing coupling with one neighbor.

Wait, another thought: if each substituent is on a benzene ring, perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings connected. For instance, a biphenyl structure. Let me think about that.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad suggests maybe an -OH group, but wait, those are 2H. Hmm, maybe it's a vinyl group. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with some substituents that cause splitting, but I'm not sure.

The 3.66 ppm is a d (doublet) for 2H. That's in the range of CH2 groups, possibly next to an electronegative atom. So maybe an OCH2 group or something similar.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72. So maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde attached to another group. Let's consider the substituents.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus an aldehyde (1 DoU) and maybe a double bond or an ether or something. 

Alternatively, benzene (3 DoU), a double
