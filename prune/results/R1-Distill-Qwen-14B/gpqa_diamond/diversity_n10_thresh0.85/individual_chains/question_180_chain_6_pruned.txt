Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e, and they have negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system in Joules, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, alright. So, since these are charged particles, this is probably a problem about electric potential energy. I remember that the potential energy between two charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, right? U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But wait, I think that's for the potential energy between two point charges.

But in this case, we have multiple charges. So, maybe I should think about the total potential energy of the system. Because when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but the system comprises 13 charges. The thirteenth is fixed at point P, and the other twelve are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the twelve is at 2 meters from the fixed charge. Hmm.

Wait, so the setup is that each of the twelve charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, which is where the 13th charge is. But are these twelve charges arranged in some specific way? Like, are they forming a regular structure, or are they all at the same point? No, wait, the question says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, each of them is at a distance of 2 m from P. So, P is where the 13th charge is located, and the others are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m centered at P.

But for potential energy, each pair of charges contributes. So, the total potential energy is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair.

But wait, so how many pairs are there?

So, the system has 13 charges: 1 at P, and 12 around it. So, each of the 12 charges is interacting with the fixed charge at P, but they're also interacting with each other.

Ah, right! So, the total potential energy U
