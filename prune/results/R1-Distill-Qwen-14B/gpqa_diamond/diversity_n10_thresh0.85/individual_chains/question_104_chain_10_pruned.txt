Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of two planets compare based on the given data. Let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, so the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected both. The question is about the orbital periods.

The data given is the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

So the Doppler shift (the spectral line shift) is related to the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for Doppler shift is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, right? But wait, I think it's (v/c) when v is the velocity relative to the observer. So the shift is proportional to the velocity of the star.

But wait, in the RV method, the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is what's measured. K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. So K is proportional to the shift in wavelength. So if Planet #1 has a 5 milliangstrom shift and Planet #2 has 7, then their K values are in the same ratio as the shifts, assuming the same wavelength observed.

Wait, but the wavelength shift depends on the star's velocity and the rest wavelength. Since the stars are similar (same mass as Sun), and the same spectral line is observed, the rest wavelength is the same for both. So the ratio of their K velocities is 5 :7. So K2/K1 =7/5=1.4.

But how does K relate to the orbital period of the planet? Hmm, I think the formula involves the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the velocity of the star.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v * (M_planet) ) / (M_star) ) * ( (4π²)/(G P²) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should recall the correct formula. Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (as M_planet is Neptune-like, M_star is Sun-like), we can approximate this as K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet) / M_star^(2/3)

Wait, but wait, I think another approach is better. Let me think. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity is K, and the planet's velocity is larger, but since planet's mass is much smaller, K is the velocity of the star.

The formula for K is:

K = [ ( (G P) / (
