Okay, I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let's see what the question says. 

So, the key point is the apparent magnitude each spectrograph can handle. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, meaning apparent magnitude up to 17 is observable. HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So, a star has to have an apparent V magnitude that's <=16 for HIRES and <=17 for ESPRESSO. But wait, wait—the way it's phrased, "brighter than", so stars with V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and those ≤16 by HIRES. So the star must be <=16 in V mag because that's the stricter condition. Because both instruments have to observe it, the star's apparent magnitude needs to be within both's capabilities. So, it can't be brighter than 16 mag.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if a star is brighter than 17 (so, magnitude less than 17), that's acceptable for ESPRESSO. For HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so magnitude less than 16. So, a star that's brighter than 16 (i.e., magnitude 16 or lower) can be seen by both. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES can't. So only stars with apparent magnitude <=16 can be observed by both.

But wait, actually, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO". Hmm, wait, in astronomy, a lower magnitude number means brighter. So a star with V=15 is brighter than V=17. So, for a star to be observable by ESPRESSO, its V must be <=17. For HIRES, it's V <=16.

So any star that has V <=16 mag can be detected by both. Because HIRES can't see beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can; so for both, the star must be <=16.

So our goal is to find stars whose apparent V magnitude is <=16.

Now, looking at each star:

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5, distance 1
