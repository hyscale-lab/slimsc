Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that this model treats the molecule as a rotating dumbbell and accounts for both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused about whether this transition involves a change in both rotational and vibrational energy levels or just one of them. Oh, wait, the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, I think that would be the next higher state in either rotation or vibration, whichever requires less energy. But I'm not sureâ€”maybe it's the next state in the vibrational levels or rotational.

Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would then be the next available level, which could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). Since the question is about the next lowest energy state, I need to find which transition requires less energy.

Wait, but the question is about the photon's momentum. Photons carry energy equal to their frequency, and their momentum is E/c. But wait, in quantum transitions, the energy change corresponds to the photon's energy
