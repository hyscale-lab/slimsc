Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it again carefully.

The question is asking about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components of the operator P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Hmm. Oh, right, because the direction is in x-z, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, I think. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, in x-z plane, phi would be 0 or pi, I think. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Because in the x-z plane, the angle φ around the y-axis is zero or pi, but for a general direction, maybe it's better to just say the state is in the x-z plane, so the direction is given by an angle θ from the z-axis.

But wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the state should be a spin-1/2 state along that direction. The operator P is the vector operator, so its components are given as matrices. Wait, but each component is a separate 2x2 matrix. So the operator P would be in the form of the dot product of the vector n with the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the general form for a spin operator in an arbitrary direction is given by (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. But in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, if φ is 0, then x = sinθ cos0 = sinθ, and z = cosθ.

So the operator P along n would be (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z). Oh wait, no, because σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. So the operator would be (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P = (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ).

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Wait, no, because the problem states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we have P |ψ> = (ħ/2) | ψ>.

Wait, but P is a vector operator, so the eigenvalue equation would be for the component in the direction of n. Alternatively, perhaps the operator is P_n = n · P, which would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. So each component of P is given: P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the σ_x matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is σ_y. P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σ_z.

So the operator P for direction n is the vector operator. So the operator in the direction of n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. Since n is in x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So P = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z. Each P component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

So substituting, P = (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ). So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = ( ħ/2 ) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, wait, the problem says the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So when I write the eigenvalue equation, it's (P) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

But P is (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ), so the equation becomes (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Divide both sides by ħ/2: ( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So that's the eigen equation. Now, the matrix is M = sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z.

Let me write down M. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:

M = sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

So the matrix M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. We can write this as:

[ [ cosθ,    sinθ ],
  [ sinθ,  -cosθ ] ]

We're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix M with eigenvalue 1, because when M |ψ> = |ψ>, the eigenvalue is 1.

Wait, no. Because the equation after substitution is (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ> multiplied by 1, so the eigenvalue is 1.

So the eigenvalue is 1, and we're finding the eigenvector.

So the characteristic equation is det(M - I) = 0.

Which is:

| cosθ - 1    sinθ      |
| sinθ        -cosθ -1 |

The determinant is (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0.

Let me compute that:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1*(cosθ -1) = [ -cos²θ + cosθ ] + [ -cosθ +1 ] = -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ +1 = -cos²θ + 1.

Then subtract (sinθ)^2, so the determinant is (-cos²θ +1) - sin²θ = ?

Wait, but 1 - cos²θ is sin²θ. So it's sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So the determinant is (sinθ)^2 - (sinθ)^2 = 0. So the determinant is zero, which makes sense because M has eigenvalues 1 and -1.

Wait, but M is a 2x2 matrix, so it's trace is (cosθ - cosθ) = 0, and determinant is (cosθ)(-cosθ) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = -cos²θ - sin²θ = -1. So the determinant is -1. Hmm, but when finding the eigenvalues, the product is -1, and the sum is 0. So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So yes, the eigenvalues are ±1.

So for the eigenvalue 1, the matrix equation is (M - I)|v> = 0.

So (M - I) is [[cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1]].

So we can write the equations:

( cosθ -1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
sinθ v1 + ( -cosθ -1 ) v2 = 0

We can take the first equation:

( cosθ -1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → (1 - cosθ) v1 = sinθ v2 → v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

Using the identity (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(theta/2) and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), so (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = tan(theta/2).

So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, tan(theta/2)].

Wait, but let me double-check that. So v1 is the first component, v2 is the second. So the vector can be written as [1, tan(theta/2)] multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but let me see:
