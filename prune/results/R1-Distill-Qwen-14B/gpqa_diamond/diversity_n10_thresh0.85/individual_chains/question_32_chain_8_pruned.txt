Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. So, Li is lithium. Let me think. Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember from my studies that the energy in particle accelerators is often calculated using the relativistic energy equations. Since they're giving the speed as 0.96c, it's a high-energy scenario, so relativistic effects are definitely in play.

The formula I think I need is the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, I should calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let's plug that in. Let me compute 1 - (v^2/c^2) first. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that gives sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784 (0.28 *0.28= 0.0784). So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1 over 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, I should double-check that calculation. Let me compute 0.96 squared again. 0.96 * 0.96. Let me think, 96*96 is 9216, so 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

But wait, wait. Let me do it more precisely. Oh, because 0.28 * 3.5714 is exactly 1. So yes, gamma is 10/2.8 approximately? Wait, 1/0.28 is same as 10/2.8, which is 3.57142
