Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the 10^-15 to 10^-16 meters range. So I need to find the mean decay distance, which I think is related to the particle's lifetime.

Wait, right, the mean decay distance is usually given by the product of the particle's speed and lifetime. But wait, the lifetime is linked to the width through the uncertainty principle. I remember that the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula I think is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ is ħ divided by Γ.

So first, I need to find the lifetime τ. Once I have τ, I need to find the velocity of the meson to multiply by τ and get the decay length.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? I think it's related to the energy and mass. Since the meson is produced with a certain energy, I can find its velocity from that. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, but the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving with kinetic energy plus rest mass energy.

Wait, but in particle physics, energy is often considered in the center-of-mass frame. Or maybe I should think in terms of relativistic energy. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So the relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can find the momentum p from that.

Let me write down the equation: E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Solving for p:

p = sqrt( (E/(c²))^2 - (m)^2 ) / c.

Wait, units might get a bit messy. Let me think in terms of units where c=1, but I'll have to remember to convert back when necessary.

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So p in units where c=1 would be sqrt(8^2 - 1.
