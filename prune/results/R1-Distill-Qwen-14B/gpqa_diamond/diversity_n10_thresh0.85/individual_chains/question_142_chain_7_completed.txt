Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are different points in a 3D space, like r=(1,1,0) and so on.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. A pure state is a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and a mixed state is a statistical mixture of projectors. So here, the density matrix seems to be a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states.

Wait, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Since both |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthonormal basis vectors, their projectors add up to the identity matrix. Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| = I, right? Because when you add those two, you get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So substituting that in, ρ becomes (1/2)I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

So ρ is (1/2) times the identity matrix. Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. I think this refers to how density matrices are represented in the Bloch sphere, which is a geometric way to visualize qubit states.

The Bloch sphere is a way to represent all possible states of a qubit. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a pure state is a vector on the surface, but for a mixed state, it's somewhere inside, maybe at the center or another point.

Wait, the density matrix for a completely mixed state is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Oh wait, that's exactly what ρ is here! Because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal, their sum gives the identity, so ρ is (I)/2. This must be the maximally mixed state because it's completely random—no information about the state at all.

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are vectors pointing from the origin to the surface. For example, |0⟩ would be at (0,0,1) and |1⟩ is at (0,0,-1), but wait, I'm not sure about the exact coordinates. Alternatively, the Bloch vector for a state is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

The general form for a density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3D vector (the Bloch vector). So if I can write ρ in this form, the vector r will directly give me the position.

Given that ρ = (I)/2, that would mean that I can rearrange it as (I)/2 = (I + 0·σ)/2. So r must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is at the origin, which is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which would be the origin. So the density matrix is at the center of the Bloch sphere since it's a maximally mixed state.

Wait, but let me double-check. The maximally mixed state has no coherence and equal probabilities for both states, so yes, it's represented by the origin. So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. This represents a maximally mixed state, as it is an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), with no coherence or preference for either state.

In the Bloch sphere representation, density matrices are expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is a 3D vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which is the representation of a maximally mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
