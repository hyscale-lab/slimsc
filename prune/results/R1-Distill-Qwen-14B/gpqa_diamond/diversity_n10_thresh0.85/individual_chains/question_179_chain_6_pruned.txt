Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. The question gives four matrices W, X, Y, Z and asks which statement is correct among options A to D. I need to think through each option carefully.

First, let me understand each matrix. I'll write them down as per the question.

Matrix W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Matrix X is:
i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1  -i

Matrix Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Matrix Z is:
3    2i    5
-2i  -2   -4i
5    4i    4

The options are about properties of these matrices. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. So this is about the exponential of matrix X. I remember that for a matrix exponential e^A to preserve the norm (i.e., be unitary), A must be skew-Hermitian. Because then e^A would be unitary. So if X is not skew-Hermitian, then e^X might not preserve the norm, meaning the vector's norm could change when multiplied by e^X.

So I need to check if X is skew-Hermitian. A matrix is skew-Hermitian if X† = -X, where † denotes the conjugate transpose. Let's see what X† is.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† (conjugate transpose) would be the transpose of the conjugate of each element.

Transposing X gives columns as rows:

Column 1 becomes [i, 1, 2i], but conjugated:
So first row of X† is [ -i, 1, -2i ]

Wait, wait. Let me compute it step by step.

Original X:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Conjugate each element:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then transpose it, so rows become columns.

So X† will be:

Column 1: (-i, 1, -2i)
Column 2: (-1, 0, -1)
Column 3: (-2i, 1, i)

Wait, no, the transpose would have each column as the original row's elements. Wait, original X as rows, so X† is the conjugate transpose, so first row of X becomes first column of X†, but after conjugate.

So, first row of X is [i, -1, 2i]. Conjugate each: [-i, -1, -2i]. So first column of X† is [-i, 1, -2i]? Wait, no: The first row of X becomes the first column of X†, but after conjugation. So:

X† is:

Row 1: [-i, -1, -2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [-2i, -1, i]

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me write down each element.

After conjugation, the matrix becomes:

[ -i, -1, -2i ]
[ 1, 0, 1 ]
[ -2i, -1, i ]

Then transpose
