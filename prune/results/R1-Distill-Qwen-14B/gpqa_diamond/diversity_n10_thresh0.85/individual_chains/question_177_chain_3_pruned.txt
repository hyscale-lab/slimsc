Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times bigger than Star_2's. The question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's probably related to their temperatures. Because for a black body, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same too. Because if lambda is the same, T is the same.

Wait, but mass and radius? I'm not sure how that ties in. Maybe it's a red herring. Or perhaps they're using the mass to find something else. Hmm. The problem mentions that the stars are radiating as black bodies, so I think the key here is using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity.

Stefan-Boltzmann law says that Luminosity L is equal to 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, since both stars have the same T (because lambda_max same), their luminosities should depend on their radii squared. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2? So the factor is 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait, wait, let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, radial velocity. How does that affect anything here? Oh, I think I might have missed something. Because the actual observed wavelength could be different due to Doppler shift, but the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, maybe the peak wavelengths are the same as observed, so that would imply that their actual temperatures are different due to Doppler shifting?

Wait, that might complicate things. Let me think. The peak emission wavelength of a star is in its rest frame. But if the star is moving towards or away from us (radial velocity), the observed wavelength would be shifted.

Wait, the question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the observed lambda_max for both is the same, but their actual (intrinsic) temperatures might be different because of their Doppler velocities.

Hmm, this adds a twist. Because if Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, its observed lambda_max is the same as its intrinsic lambda_max. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but how do we know if it's moving towards or away? The sign might matter, but the problem just says 700 km/s, so perhaps it's moving away, causing redshift, or towards, causing blueshift.

Wait, but the problem says the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1: observed lambda1 = lambda1_rest. For Star_2: observed lambda2 = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c), assuming it's moving away. Or (1 - v2/c) if moving towards. Wait, let me get the Doppler shift formula right. The relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ) ), where beta is v/c. But that's for transverse Doppler shift. Alternatively, the non-relativistic approximation is lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest (1 + v/c) when the object is moving away (v positive) or (1 - v/c) when moving towards.

Wait, but Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me compute the factor. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is about 0.00233c. So v/c is approximately 0.00233. So the non-relativistic approximation would be good here.

So for Star_2, if it's moving away, observed lambda2 = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c). But the observed lambda2 is the same as Star_1's observed lambda, which is lambda1_rest.

So lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest = lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed lambda would be longer (redshifted). So Star_2's observed peak would be at a longer wavelength than its rest frame. But the problem says that both observed peaks are the same. So Star_1's observed lambda is lambda1_rest, and Star_2's observed is lambda2_rest * Doppler shift factor.

Setting them equal: lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but Star_1's lambda is its own rest frame, and Star_2's observed is their rest frame multiplied by the Doppler factor.

So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But we also know that, from Wien's law, lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. So,

lambda1_rest / lambda2_rest = T2_rest / T1_rest

Because lambda_max = b / T, so lambda is proportional to 1/T.

So,

lambda1_rest / lambda2_rest = T2_rest / T1_rest

But from the equation above,

lambda1_rest =
