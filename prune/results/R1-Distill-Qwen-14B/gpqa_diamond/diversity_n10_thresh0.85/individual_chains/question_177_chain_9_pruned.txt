Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength for each star. And the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² times T⁴.

But wait, the problem says they're black bodies. So using the black body radiation law, the peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's Law: λ_max ≈ constant / T. Oh right, Wien's displacement law says λ_max * T = b, where b is Wien's constant (about 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is the same, so T1 = T2. Wait, no, wait. Because λ_max is the same, but that might be due to different temperatures because of their velocities? Hmm, no, wait. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their λ_max are the same, so according to Wien's Law, their temperatures would be the same. Unless there's a Doppler shift because of their velocities, right?

Wait, the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength. So if a star is moving towards us (blue shift) or away (red shift), the observed wavelength changes. So Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Does that affect its observed λ_max? Because the star's actual temperature would be different when considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, the observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ),
