Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, so that's like the unit cell edge length, right? So the a, b, and c in a rhombohedral unit cell are all the same because it's rhombohedral. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms.

The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees each. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, all the angles are the same. So that's a specific type, maybe called a trigonal system or something. 

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember the formula for interplanar distance (d) is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with angles) but wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is d_hkl = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), but wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, I think I mixed up with something else. Let me recall. Oh right, for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit more complicated. Wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of triclinic system but with a=b=c and angles equal but not necessarily 90. Wait, maybe I should think about the Miller indices and the plane equation.

Alternatively, I remember the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Because in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so cos θ is zero, and the formula simplifies to a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But here, θ is 30 degrees, so cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1. Let's plug in the numbers.

So the denominator is sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos 30° )

Wait, 1+1+1 is 3, and 2*(1+1+1) is 6. So 6 * cos 30°. Let me compute that:

cos 30° is about 0.866, so 6 * 0.866 ≈ 5.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

Then d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstroms? Wait, that's way smaller than the options given. The options are around 9 or so. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for rhombohedral is d = a / [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ]^(1/2), where α is the angle.

So let me recalculate.

Wait, no, I think I did that correctly. Let me recompute the denominator.

h = k = l =1.

h² +k² +l² = 3.

2(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1+1+1)=6.

Now 6 * cos(30) = 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 Angstroms. But all the options are around 9, so that doesn't make sense. Did I get the formula wrong or is there another approach?

Wait, another thought: maybe I confused interatomic distance with the lattice parameter. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length a, if the atoms are at the corners of the unit cell. But wait, that depends on the structure. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, but in other structures, like BCC or FCC, it's different. But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps a is 10 Angstroms.

Wait, maybe the formula is actually different. I think I might have confused the formula for interplanar spacing. Another way: the interplanar distance for rhombohedral can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha}}}

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to around 3.49 Angstroms, but the options are much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rhombohedral system has a different formula. Maybe I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors and calculate the plane distance using vector methods.

The planes (hkl) in a rhombohedral system have the normal vector (h, k, l). The interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of this normal vector projected onto the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, I'm getting too tangled up. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is correct, but the given interatomic distance isn't a. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding what the interatomic distance is. Suppose the crystal is a primitive rhombohedral structure, where each atom is at a lattice point. Then the interatomic distance would be the distance between neighboring atoms, which is a, the lattice parameter.

Wait, but that can't be because in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√(something), not necessarily a. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√1, which is a. In a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2, which is a√(1/2). But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance could be a multiplied by some function of the angles.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance. So maybe I should find a in terms of that.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two nearest atoms, which might be along a certain direction in the crystal.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the concepts here. Let me try to think again.

In a rhombohedral unit cell, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, all equal (a=b=c), and all angles are α=β=γ=30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms. Since the unit cell is rhombohedral, the atoms are at the corners
