Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The formula I recall is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance. So, a star that's farther away has a smaller parallax. Oh wait, right, the parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d. So plx = 1/d, or something like that.

Now, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Maybe uniformly in space, so their density is constant. But wait, if they're uniformly distributed in the sky, perhaps it's a uniform number per unit volume? Or maybe they're spread out uniformly in space but we're observing them from Earth.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, like, how many stars have a parallax between plx and plx + dplx. And how does that number change with plx.

I think I need to consider the relationship between the number of stars in a certain volume and the parallax. Let's think about volume in terms of distance. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the volume of space that corresponds to a certain range of parallax probably depends on plx squared or something like that.

Let me outline the steps. Suppose we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. I want to find how many stars are in that range. Since parallax is 1/d, this range corresponds to a certain range in distance.

Let me express this. If plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, the distance range is from d to d + dd, where dd is the change in distance corresponding to dplx.

Wait, plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, if I have a change in plx, dplx, how does that translate into a change in distance, dd?

Let me compute dd. Since d = 1/plx, then dd/dplx = d/dplx * (-1) [because d = 1/plx → dd = -1/plx^2 dplx]. So, dd is approximately -dplx/(plx^2). The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, which makes sense.

But for the sake of volume, I think the important part is the absolute value. So, the distance range is from d to d+dd, where dd = dplx/(plx^2) * (d?), wait no, let me re-express.

Wait, plx is 1/d. So, if I have plx and plx + dplx, the corresponding distances are d and d + Δd. Let's compute Δd:

d = 1/plx
d + Δd = 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ 1/(plx (1 + dplx/plx)) ) ≈ (1/(plx)) [1 - (dplx/plx)] using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So, d + Δd ≈ d - d * (dplx/plx) → Δd ≈ -d * (dplx / plx)

But wait, since plx =1/d → d = 1/plx.

So, Δd ≈ -(1/plx) * (dplx)/(plx) ) → Δd ≈ -dplx/(plx^2)

Wait, but this gives the change in distance as a function of plx. But we're trying to find the volume between plx and plx + dplx. So, the volume is the volume of a spherical shell between distances d and d+Δd.

The volume of a spherical shell is (4/3)π ( (d + Δd)^3 - d^3 )

Since Δd is small compared to d, we can approximate this as 4π d² Δd.

But wait, wait, I think I should think about it differently. The volume between two distances is (4/3)π (d_upper^3 - d_lower^3). So, the volume is proportional to the difference of cubes of distances.

But if I have a small range in plx, then the corresponding range in d is small, so using the approximation for small Δd:

d_upper = d + Δd ≈ d (1 - (dplx / plx))

So, d_upper ≈ d (1 - (dplx / plx))

Thus, d_upper^3 ≈ d^3 (1 - 3 (dplx / plx) )

So the volume between d and d_upper is (4/3) π (d_upper^3 - d^3) ≈ (4/3) π ( -d^3 * 3 (dplx / plx) )) )

Wait, because d_upper^3 - d^3 is approximately 3d^2 Δd (using the expansion (d + Δd)^3 ≈ d^3 + 3d^2 Δd + ... ). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express the volume in terms of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the volume as a function of plx. Since plx = 1/d, let me let u = plx, so that d = 1/u.

The volume between u and u + du is the volume between distances 1/u and 1/(u + du). Let me compute that:

Volume = (4/3) π [ (1/(u + du))^3 - (1/u)^3 ]

Factor out (1/u)^3:

= (4/3) π (1/u^3) [ 1/(1 + (du/u))^3 - 1 ]

Using the approximation (1 + x)^{-3} ≈ 1 - 3x for small x, since du is small so du/u is a small quantity.

So,

Volume ≈ (4/3) π (1/u^3) [ (1 - 3 (du/u) ) - 1 )
= (4/3) π (1/u^3) [ -3 (du/u) ) ]
= (4/3) π ( -3 (du) ) / u^4 )
= (4/3) π * (-3) * du / u^4
= -4 π du / u^4

But Volume is positive, so I'll take the absolute value, which gives 4 π du / u^4.

Wait, but wait! I'm getting the volume element as 4 π du / u^4. Hmm, but I'm trying to find the number of stars in a range of du in
