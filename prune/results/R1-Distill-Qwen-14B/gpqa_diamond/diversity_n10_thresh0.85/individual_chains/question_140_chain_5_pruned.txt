Okay, I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem. Let's go through it step by step. 

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Finally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and we're to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the reaction between X and Y produces gas W. Let's think about possible reactions. Since it's violent, maybe it's a strong acid reacting with a metal. For example, metals reacting with acids to produce hydrogen gas. But wait, W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about what that could be. The most common gas from such reactions is hydrogen (H2), but let me check. Hydrogen's molecule is H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So, each H has 1 p and 0 n; so for the molecule, two H atoms: 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's another gas. Let's think of another possibility.

Wait, maybe it's carbon dioxide (CO2). But CO2 has 22 protons (C:6, O:8 each) and 22 neutrons (C has 6, O has 8, but wait, isotopes vary, but if considering standard, C is 12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons), O is 16 (8 p, 8 n). So CO2 would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh, that fits! Same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So W is probably CO2.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, correct. So if Y is a carbonate solution, reacting with an acid? Wait, no. Let's think about the reaction.

Wait, but wait, if X is a metal, reacting with an acid Y, which might be a carbonate? Or perhaps Y is water? Or maybe Y is something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution that, when reacted with X, produces CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, but that might not fit. Let's think again.

Wait, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. When heated, G releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. What's 277 K? That's about 4 degrees Celsius. What solid has a melting point near 4 C? Maybe water? No, water's melting point is 273 K. Oh, wait, 277 K is about 4Â°C. Alternatively, maybe something like ammonium nitrate, which has a lower melting point. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, another thought: If X is a metal, and Y is an acid, the reaction might produce a salt and hydrogen gas. But we thought W could be CO2, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe W is O2 or another gas. Let me think again.

Wait, if W is carbon dioxide, then the reaction must produce that. So X and Y reacting to form CO2. So maybe Y is a carbonate. For example, X could be an acid, but the question says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Hmm, perhaps X is a strong acid but more likely, maybe X is a metal that reacts with carbonate to produce CO2.

Wait, but if X is a metal, like sodium, reacting with carbonate solution (Y) would produce sodium carbonate and CO2 gas. But wait, the reaction would be Na2CO3 reacting with acid (like HCl) to produce CO2, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, if X is a metal, and Y is a carbonate, then the reaction would produce the corresponding metal carbonate and CO2. But then, the precipitate G would
