Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A. They represent Ay as a 2x2 matrix, and it's given by Ay = c·S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Oh right, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. So I need to solve this matrix equation.

First, let's write down the matrix S. S is:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

So Ay is c multiplied by this. So Ay = cS = (h/(4π)) * S.

So Ay would be:

[c*0, c*(-i)]
[c*i, c*0]

Which is:

[0, -i c ]
[i c, 0 ]

Since c = h/(4π), substituting that in, Ay becomes:

[0, -i*(h/(4π))]
[i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Hmm, so the matrix Ay looks like this. Now, to find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a,          -i c ]
[ i c,        -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - (i c * i c) wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly. The determinant is (top left * bottom right) minus (top right * bottom left). So:

det = (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c) (i c) )

Which is a² - ( (-i c)(i c) ). Let's compute (-i c)(i c): (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = +1. So (-i c)(i c)= (1) * c^2 → c². So the determinant is a² - c² = 0.

So the equation is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues a are c and -c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, so the eigenvalues are real? Because I was thinking they might be complex, but no, the matrix Ay is Hermitian because S is Hermitian. Because S^dagger = S? Let me check S's conjugate transpose. S is [[0, -i],[i,0]], so S^dagger is [[0, i],[-i,0]], which isn't the same as S. Wait, no, S is Hermitian if S^dagger = S. So in this case, S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose would be [[0, i
