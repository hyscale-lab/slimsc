Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll go through it step by step.

So, the problem is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Let me first parse what's given.

The state of the electron is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's a scalar multiple. So probably, I should normalize this state. Because the probabilities have to add up to 1, right?

The operator in question has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and zero otherwise. Oh wait, so this is a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states. Let me write that out. So for a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no. Because i and j are indices. So for A_12 and A_21, it's hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So yes, that's correct. That matrix represents the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2, since the Pauli X is [[0 1], [1 0]]. So A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually defined as sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y= [[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z=diag(1,-1). So yeah, this operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. Because the given Aij is zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

So, the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. Those are superpositions of |up> and |down> states. Wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

So, to find the probability of measuring the electron in each of the eigenstates of A, we need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Wait, but before that, perhaps I should normalize |alpha>. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So the coefficients are a = 1+i and b=2 - i.

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Let's compute that:

|a|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2 (Wait, no, (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.)

|b|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |−x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Right. So let's write |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Then, any state can be expressed in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

So to find the probability of measuring in each eigenstate, I need to project |alpha> onto
