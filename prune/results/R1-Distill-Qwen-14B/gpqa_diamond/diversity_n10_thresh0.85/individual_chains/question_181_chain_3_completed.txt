Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. And we're supposed to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C) 1, D) 0.1.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, like the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. The pp-III branch is a side reaction that contributes to the overall fusion process, right?

Oh, right, the pp-III branch involves reactions where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus (He-3) to form a helium-4 (He-4) and two protons. The main pp-I branch is the more common one. But I think the pp-III branch contributes about 0.8% of the Sun's total energy production, or something like that. So it's a smaller part, but still significant.

Now, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrinos? Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the fusion reactions. The main source of high-energy neutrinos comes from the decay of beryllium-7 (Be-7) into lithium-7 (Li-7), which releases a positron and a neutrino. This is part of the pp-III branch, I think.

Wait, when the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that process would stop. So the number of neutrinos coming from the pp-III reactions would drop. But what about the other sources of neutrinos? Are there other reactions that produce neutrinos?

Wait, another major source is the CNO cycle, right? Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle. That produces neutrinos through the decay of Be-7 as well, but I think the CNO cycle is more dominant in higher mass stars, not in the Sun. Oh wait, no, the Sun's core does have a proton-proton chain, but a significant fraction (maybe around 20%) of the energy comes from the CNO cycle. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the CNO cycle produces a lot of neutrinos in the Sun.

Wait, neutrinos in the Sun are mainly produced via the pp chain. The dominant process is when Be-7 captures a proton to make Li-7, emitting a neutrino. So in the pp chain, pp-I is the main branch, and pp-III is a minor one. So if pp-III stops, the neutrino production from that particular branch stops.

But the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands. So, the flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the total neutrino flux will be lower because some sources are gone.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of flux between two bands. So, if one band's flux is more dependent on pp-III, and the other less, their ratio would change.

So, let's think about what energy range the neutrinos from each process have. Be-7 decay produces neutrinos with energies around 400 keV to a few MeV, but I'm not certain. Wait, the neutrinos from the pp chain are lower energy on average than those from other processes like the CNO cycle. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, in the pp chain, the main neutrino emission is from the decay of Be-7, which produces a neutrino with a mean energy of about 0.66 MeV (660 keV) or so. So, the neutrinos from the pp chain are around 600 keV or so.

The pp-III branch: I think in that process, a He-3 captures a proton to form He-4, and then another He-3 captures a proton to form He-4 again. But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the pp-III branch is where two He-3 nuclei fuse into He-4, but that requires a higher energy and is less likely. Oh wait, I'm confusing different aspects here.

Alternatively, the pp-III branch might involve reactions that produce more energetic neutrinos. Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in a different energy range than the main pp-I branch.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely clear on that. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. Because the reactions involve more mass or higher binding energies.

Wait, the main neutrino emission in the Sun is from the decay of Be-7, which is part of both the pp-I and pp-III branches. So if pp-III stops, the Be-7 would still be produced via the pp-I branch, right? Or does pp-III contribute to the production of Be-7?

Wait, let me retrace. The pp chain starts with two protons (p) fusing into deuterium (D), then another proton fuses to form He-3. The He-3 can either capture a proton (pp-I) to form He-4, or combine with another He-3 (pp-III) to form He-4 and two protons. Either way, He-3 is a product. Then, in the pp chain, He-3 can capture a neutron (but wait, there are no neutrons; perhaps it's a proton and a He-3 fusing again) to form Be-7. The Be-7 then captures electrons or positrons to emit a neutrino.

So, the production of Be-7 comes from both pp-I and pp-III branches. So if pp-III stops, the amount of Be-7 produced would decrease because one of the sources (pp-III) is gone.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, the overall production of He-3 would decrease because in the pp-III branch, two He-3's combine to make He-4, but if that process stops, perhaps the He-3 abundance in the core increases. Because normally, the pp-III branch would be converting He-3 into He-4.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: in the pp chain, the initial steps are two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton fusing to form He-3. That He-3 can either capture a proton (pp-I) to form He-4, or two He-3's can combine (pp-III) to form He-4 and two protons. So, if pp-III stops, then the He-3 can only decay via the pp-I branch. So, the He-3 generated in the pp chain would not be processed as quickly, leading to a higher abundance of He-3. But wait, that might not be correct because the pp-III branch consumes He-3.

Wait, if the pp-III stops, then the He-3 that would have been used in the pp-III reactions is now not being consumed. So the He-3 concentration would increase, because production continues (from earlier steps) but destruction via pp-III is stopped. So more He-3 would accumulate.

But in the reaction where He-3 captures a proton to form He-4 (pp-I), does that contribute to the production of Be-7? Because He-3 can capture a neutron (but there are no neutrons), so maybe He-3 captures an electron or a positron? Wait, no, I think the main process is He-3 plus a proton becoming He-4. But for Be-7 production, I think the He-3 captures a proton and then another proton to form Be-7. Let me think: the steps are p + p → D; D + p → He-3; He-3 + p → He-4 + e+ + ν_e? Or something else.

Wait, no, the Be-7 is formed through the reactions:

He-3 + p → Be-7 + e+ + ν_e

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct this. The process is: He-3 captures a proton (p) to form Be-7, which then captures an electron (beta decay). Let me think: He-3 (which is actually a helium-3 nucleus, two protons and one neutron) plus a proton becomes Be-7 (which has four protons and three neutrons). But Be-7 is unstable and undergoes beta decay to become Li-7, emitting an electron and an antineutrino (since beta plus decay emits a positron and a neutrino). Wait, yes, Be-7 → Li-7 + e+ + ν_e. But the neutrino is emitted in the decay, which is part of the neutrino production in the Sun.

So, the production of Be-7 depends on the availability of He-3 and protons. If the pp-III branch stops, then the rate of He-3 being consumed (either via pp-I or pp-III) would decrease. So, the concentration of He-3 increases because it's not being used as much. That would mean more He-3 available to react with protons to form Be-7, right?

Wait, no. Because if pp-III stops, the He-3 isn't being used as much, so the He-3 abundance would increase. So He-3 levels go up. That would mean more He-3 available to react with protons to form Be-7. So the production of Be-7 would increase, not decrease. Oh wait, but wait: if the main source of He-3 is from the pp chain, and the pp-III stops, but the pp-I continues, then He-3 is being produced as before, but not being consumed as much via the pp-III branch.

Wait, the production rate of He-3 depends on the proton density. He-3 is formed when two protons fuse with another to form He-3. So, the production rate of He-3 is the same as before, but its destruction via both pp-I and pp-III branches is now only via pp-I. So if the pp-III branch stops, He-3 is being produced at the same rate but being consumed more slowly, leading to a higher concentration of He-3. That would mean more He-3 to react with protons to form Be-7.

So, more Be-7 production would occur because there's more He-3 available. But wait, because the pp-III branch is stopped, He-3 isn't being used as much, so its concentration increases. So when He-3 is abundant, it can capture protons more to form Be-7, which then decays into Li-7, emitting neutrinos.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, the production of Be-7 increases because there's more He-3 available. So the neutrino flux from the Be-7 decay would increase. But wait, wait a second. Because the pp-III branch also produces neutrinos, right? Or does it?

Wait, the main neutrino flux in the Sun comes from the decay of Be-7 into Li-7, which is part of the pp chain. So if the pp-III branch stops, but the production of Be-7 increases, maybe the overall neutrino flux would increase? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because the pp-III branch is a source of neutrinos.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The pp-III branch is a process that occurs after some He-3 has been produced. So if the pp-III branch stops, the He-3 is not being consumed as much, so more He-3 is available to react with protons to form Be-7. So the production of Be-7 should increase, leading to more neutrinos, right?

Wait, but the pp-III branch may not directly produce neutrinos. The neutrinos come from the decay of Be-7. So if more Be-7 is produced, more neutrinos are emitted. So the total neutrino flux would increase, not decrease. But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. If the pp-III branch was a source of neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the flux. But perhaps the pp-III branch contributes less to the neutrino flux than the Be-7 decay.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think about the various sources of solar neutrinos. The dominant source is the Be-7 decay, which contributes about 90% of the solar neutrino flux. The other sources are the CNO cycle and the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction, which contribute less. So, the pp-III branch might be part of the main pp chain's production of Be-7, or perhaps it's a separate process.

Wait, the pp chain produces He-3, which then can either react via pp-I or pp-III. If pp-III stops, then more He-3 is available to react via pp-I, so the production of Be-7 increases, which would result in more neutrinos from Be-7 decay.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the Be-7 production would increase, leading to more neutrinos. But wait, the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands. So, if the production of Be-7 increases, the total neutrino flux would go up, but the energy distribution may change.

Wait, but neutrinos from Be-7 decay are all around 660 keV on average, so the flux in the 700-800 keV band might increase, and the 800-900 keV band would also have some, but perhaps the higher energy neutrinos are less common. Or maybe not. Wait, neutrinos from Be-7 have a spectrum, not a single energy. The average is around 660 keV, but some are higher and some lower.

So if the production of Be-7 increases, perhaps the neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) would increase more than in the 800-900 keV band (band 2), because the average is around 660, so higher energy neutrinos are less. Alternatively, the flux in band 1 might decrease, because the average is lower. Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, let me think about the solar neutrino spectrum. The main neutrinos are from Be-7 decay, with an average energy of about 0.66 MeV (660 keV). So the majority of them are in the 0.5-1 MeV range. So, the 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) band would have a significant number of neutrinos, and the 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV) band would have fewer, as they're higher than the average.

But wait, if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrino production from Be-7 increases. So the overall flux in band 1 (700-800) would increase, and band 2 (800-900) would also increase, but perhaps less so because higher energies are less likely.

Wait, but wait. The pp-III branch itself might produce neutrinos through some other process. Oh, perhaps in the pp-III branch, the He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2 protons. Does that process produce neutrinos? Or is that a fusion process that doesn't involve neutrinos?

Hmm, I think the He-3 + He-3 fusion produces He-4 and two protons, via the reaction He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2p. Since this is a fusion reaction, it doesn't involve neutrinos. So the neutrinos come primarily from the decay of Be-7, which is part of the pp chain, not directly from the pp-III branch.

So, the main source of neutrinos is Be-7 decay, which is influenced by the availability of He-3. So if the pp-III branch stops, more He-3 is available, leading to more Be-7 production and more neutrinos.

So, the total number of neutrinos would increase, but how does that affect the flux in the two bands?

Wait, the pp-III branch's stoppage doesn't directly affect the energy of the neutrinos, because the neutrinos come from Be-7 decay, which is the same process regardless of where the He-3 came from. So the neutrino energy spectrum from Be-7 decay remains the same, but the total number increases.

If the total number of neutrinos increases uniformly across all energy bands, the ratio between the two bands would remain the same as before. But the question states that the pp-III branch stopped, so perhaps the Be-7 decay rate is affected.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. I'm not sure. Wait, if the pp-III branch stops, and the pp-I continues, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-I branch are of a different energy.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos. For example, in the pp-III branch, the fusion of He-3 into He-4 would release more energy, leading to higher-energy neutrinos. But no, the neutrinos in the Sun are all from the Be-7 decay, which is part of the pp chain regardless of which branch the He-3 came from.

So, the energy of the neutrinos is determined by the decay process of Be-7, which emits a neutrino with an average energy of about 0.66 MeV. So, the majority of neutrinos are in the 0.5-1 MeV range. So, band 1 is 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is in the higher end of the average. Band 2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV, which is even higher.

So, if the total number of neutrinos increases, the flux in band 1 would be higher than before, and band 2 would also be higher, but perhaps the ratio between them remains similar because the energy distribution is the same.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, but the pp-I continues, maybe the neutrino production from the pp-I is the same. So, the main change is that more He-3 is available, leading to more Be-7 production, so more neutrinos. So, the flux in both bands increases, but the ratio between them remains the same as before.

But the question is about the ratio after the pp-III branch stops. So, what was the ratio before the pp-III stopped? Let's think.

Assuming that the pp-III branch contributed a certain amount to the neutrino flux, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch were of higher energy than those from the main pp-I branch.

Wait, if the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, then when it stops, the flux in the higher bands (like band 2) would decrease more than band 1. So, the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would increase.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch neutrinos are in a different part of the spectrum. For instance, the main pp chain neutrinos (from Be-7) are at around 0.66 MeV, but the pp-III branch might produce some higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps from other decay processes.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Another angle: the pp-III and other branches may contribute to the production of carbon in the CNO cycle, which also produces neutrinos. But I'm not sure how significant that is.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch isn't a major source of neutrinos. Since most neutrinos come from Be-7 decay, which is part of the main pp chain, the stopping of the pp-III branch would have a minimal effect on the overall neutrino flux because the main source (Be-7) isn't affected. But earlier I thought that the pp-III stopping would lead to more He-3, more Be-7, and more neutrinos.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. So, the production of He-3 via the pp chain remains the same, but its destruction via pp-III stops, so He-3 accumulates. Thus, the production of Be-7 increases, leading to more neutrinos.

So, the total number of neutrinos increases. So, the flux in both bands would increase, but the ratio depends on the energy distribution.

But the question is about the ratio of band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV). The average neutrino energy is around 660 keV, so band 1 is higher than average, and band 2 is even higher.

If the neutrino energy spectrum is such that the flux decreases with increasing energy, then the flux in band 1 is lower than the peak, and band 2 is even lower. So, before the pp-III branch stopped, the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would be, say, 1.5 or something.

But if the pp-III branch stopped, and the production of Be-7 increases, leading to more neutrinos in all energy bands, but the same shape. So, the ratio would remain the same.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, which might have contributed to a certain part of the neutrino spectrum. So, if pp-III produced neutrinos in higher energy bands, then their stoppage would reduce the flux in those bands, but not others.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think differently. The pp-III branch stops. So, all reactions except pp-III remain the same. So, the main pp-I branch and other processes (like CNO) continue.

Assuming that the pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the total neutrino flux, stopping it would reduce the total flux. But the question is about the ratio between two bands.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are at higher energies than those from the pp-I branch. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the higher energy bands (like band 2) would have a lower flux compared to band 1. So the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would increase.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch's neutrinos are at lower energies, so stopping it would reduce the flux in lower bands more than higher ones, making the ratio of band 1 to band 2 increase.

Wait, this is getting too speculative. Let me think about the energy distributions.

The main solar neutrinos from Be-7 decay have a spectrum peaking around 0.66 MeV, with a tail extending to higher energies. So, the 700 keV band is at 0.7 MeV, which is higher than the peak. The 800-900 keV band is even higher. So, the flux in band 1 (700-800) is less than the peak, and band 2 (800-900) is even less.

If the pp-III branch produced neutrinos that were in these higher energy bands, stopping it would reduce the flux in higher bands. So, the ratio of band1 to band2 would increase.

But if the pp-III branch's neutrinos were in the lower energy part, then stopping it wouldn't affect the higher bands as much, so the ratio would remain about the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch's neutrinos are in the same energy range as the main Be-7 neutrinos. So, stopping it would reduce the total flux, but the ratio between the bands remains the same.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2, and the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. So, the ratio could be 1 if the energy distribution doesn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes more to the higher energy bands, so when it stops, the flux in band 2 decreases relative to band 1. So, the ratio (band1/band2) increases.

If prior to stopping, the ratio was around 1, then after stopping, band2's flux is much lower than band1, making the ratio higher, say 10. So the answer would be A) 10.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch's neutrinos are in the lower energy range, so stopping it would make the flux in band 1 decrease more than band 2, lowering the ratio.

But without knowing the exact energy distribution of the pp-III neutrinos, it's hard to say. However, the question states that the pp-III branch stopped, and the other reactions remained as they were.

If the pp-III branch was a significant source of higher-energy neutrinos, then stopping it would make the flux in higher bands drop, leading to a higher ratio of band 1 to band 2.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are all in the higher energy bands, then when they stop, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be significantly reduced, while band 1 (700-800) would also be reduced, but perhaps less so. So the ratio (flux1/flux2) would increase.

But I'm not certain about the actual energy distributions. Another approach: think about the dominant neutrino sources.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, but the main pp chain continues, the main source of neutrinos (Be-7 decay) would increase because He-3 is more abundant, leading to more Be-7. So the flux in all bands increases, but the ratio remains the same.

So, the ratio would be the same as before. So, what was the ratio before?

The neutrino spectrum from the Sun peaks around 660 keV, so the flux decreases with higher energy. So, the flux in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) is lower than the peak, and band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is even lower. So the flux in band 1 is higher than in band 2. So, the ratio of flux1/flux2 is greater than 1.

How much greater?

The solar neutrino spectrum is such that the flux decreases as energy increases. So, the flux in 700-800 keV (band 1) is higher than in 800-900 keV (band 2). So the ratio is greater than 1.

If the pp-III branch produced neutrinos in higher energy bands, which are now stopped, the flux in band 2 would drop more than in band 1, so the ratio would increase.

But the options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

If the ratio was about 1 before, and it's now higher, perhaps 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band 2 comes mainly from the pp-III branch, so when it stops, the flux in band 2 drops to almost zero, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) very high, like 10 or higher.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes neutrinos that are in the same energy range as the main Be-7 neutrinos. So stopping the pp-III would not change the energy distribution much, leading to the same ratio of about 1.

But the options have option C as 1.

Wait, another thought: if the pp-III branch is stopped, and the Be-7 production increases, the total number of Be-7 neutrinos increases. So, the neutrino flux in all bands would increase, but the ratio between bands would stay the same because the energy distribution hasn't changed.

So the ratio would be the same as before, which is perhaps around 1. So, the answer would be option C) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch doesn't produce neutrinos, so stopping it doesn't change the energy distribution, so the ratio remains the same.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, but other reactions (which include the Be-7 decay) continue. So, if the pp-III branch didn't produce neutrinos, then the flux ratio remains the same.

But I think the main neutrino flux comes from Be-7 decay, which is part of the pp chain, so the pp-III stopping would increase Be-7 production, increasing the neutrino flux.

So, the ratio between the two bands would depend on how the energy distribution shifts.

Wait, but if the energy distribution is the same, the ratio stays the same. So, the answer would be C)1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: consider that the pp-III branch is a minor contributor. So, if it stops, the change in the neutrino flux would be small, so the ratio remains approximately 1.

Hmm. Alternatively, if the pp-III neutrinos are in band 2 (800-900 keV), then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2 more than band 1. So, the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would increase.

If the ratio was 1 before, and band 2's flux drops, the ratio becomes 10 or higher.

So, the answer would be A) 10.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. I think I need to make a decision. So, putting it all together:

- If the pp-III branch stops, more He-3 is available, leading to more Be-7 and thus more neutrinos. So the total flux increases.

- The neutrino energy spectrum from Be-7 is around 0.66 MeV, so the majority are in lower bands. Higher bands have less flux.

- If the pp-III neutrinos are at higher energies, then stopping it would reduce band 2's flux more than band 1, increasing the ratio.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the same energy range as Be-7, so the ratio would stay the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes neutrinos to band 2, so stopping it would make band 2's flux drop, thus increasing the band 1/band 2 ratio.

If the ratio was approximately 1 before, and now it's 10, then the answer is A)10.

Alternatively, if the ratio is about 1, then option C is correct.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Another angle: the pp chain's main process produces neutrinos at 0.66 MeV. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor, so its stopping would not significantly affect the overall neutrino flux. So the ratio remains approximately 1.

So, the answer is C) 1.


The question involves analyzing the impact of the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the Sun's energy production and primarily involves the fusion of helium-3 nuclei. Neutrinos in the Sun are predominantly produced through the decay of beryllium-7 (Be-7), which is part of the proton-proton (pp) chain, not directly from the pp-III branch itself.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Production and Energy Distribution**:
   - The majority of solar neutrinos come from the decay of Be-7, which emits neutrinos with an average energy of ~660 keV. The flux decreases with increasing energy, meaning higher energy bands (e.g., 800-900 keV) have fewer neutrinos than lower energy bands (e.g., 700-800 keV).
   - The pp-III branch does not directly produce neutrinos but influences the abundance of helium-3 (He-3), which is a precursor to Be-7 production. If the pp-III branch stops, the He-3 abundance increases, leading to more Be-7 production and, consequently, more neutrinos overall.

2. **Impact of pp-III Branch Stoppage**:
   - The stoppage of the pp-III branch would increase the availability of He-3, boosting the production of Be-7 and the resulting neutrino flux. However, the energy distribution of the neutrinos remains largely unchanged because the neutrinos still originate from Be-7 decay, which has a characteristic energy spectrum peaking at ~660 keV.
   - Since the energy distribution of neutrinos is not significantly altered, the ratio of flux between the two bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) would remain approximately the same.

3. **Flux Ratio**:
   - The flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) is higher than in band 2 (800-900 keV) due to the decreasing neutrino flux with increasing energy. The ratio of flux between these bands is determined by the shape of the neutrino spectrum, which is unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch.
   - Therefore, the ratio of flux between the two bands remains approximately 1.

### Conclusion:
The stoppage of the pp-III branch does not significantly alter the energy distribution of neutrinos or the ratio of flux between the two bands. The ratio of flux between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) remains approximately 1.

**Answer: C**
