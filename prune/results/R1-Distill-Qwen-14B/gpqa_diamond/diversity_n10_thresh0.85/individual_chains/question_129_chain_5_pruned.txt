Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme based on several steps. There are multiple-choice options, so I'll need to figure out each step carefully.

Let me start by parsing the problem. The reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are some hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different ketones (since they end with "-one"), which suggests that E is a cyclic ketone.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's think about the reaction between A and HCN to form B. HCN is a nucleophile and tends to add to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl group, adding HCN would form cyanohydrin, but wait: Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. But wait, maybe A is an aldehyde, but the IR of A is 1750 cm^-1, which is more indicative of a ketone. So A is likely a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The reaction A + HCN → B. If A is a cyclic ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, maybe A is an ester or something else. Hmm, but the IR of A is at 1750, which is a strong carbonyl peak. So either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But aldehydes usually have higher wavenumber peaks, like around 2800 cm^-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. But the strong peak around 1750 is more in line with a ketone or an ester.

But given that the product when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide forms a cyclopentane derivative with a substituted group, perhaps that suggests that A is a cyclopropane or something else. Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, the structure seems to have a cyclopentane ring with substituents.

Wait, that product has a cyclopentane ring. Considering the structure, it's 1,2-dimethyl, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is a substituent where the cyclopentane is attached to a carbene group (like a substituted cyclopropane perhaps). Alternatively, the ylide would add to a carbonyl group in A, leading to the formation of a new ring.

Wait, the reaction of A with a phosphorous ylide is giving a cyclopentane with substituents. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. So if A has a carbonyl group, like a ketone, the Wittig reaction would convert the carbonyl into a double bond. But in this case, the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent—maybe A has a carbonyl that's part of a ring.

So perhaps A is a cyclopentanone or similar. Let's imagine A is cyclopentanone. Then, the Wittig reaction with a ylide would form a cyclopentane ring with a double bond. Wait, but the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents on the cyclopentane are methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at 4.

Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH2CH(CH3))=CH2? Or is it something else? Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a group where the cyclopentane is attached to a carbene (a double bonded carbon). Or maybe it's a group where the substituent is a propene group attached via the central carbon.

Alternatively, the ylide could be adding to the carbonyl of A, leading to a ring expansion or contraction. Hmm, perhaps A is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the reaction steps again. Step 1: A + HCN → B. So if A is a cyclic ketone, B would be
