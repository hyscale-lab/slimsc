Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So plx is in parsecs, right? So the larger the distance, the smaller the parallax.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars as a function of distance. So they've given the relationship between N and parallax, and I need to express N in terms of distance.

Let me think about parallax and distance more. Parallax plx is equal to 1 divided by distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

But wait, the given relationship is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So substituting d into that, I can write this as N ∝ (d)^5, because 1/(plx)^5 becomes (d)^5 since d is 1/plx.

Wait, no. Wait a second. If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then substituting plx =1/d, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplify that: (1/d)^-5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So it's the rate of change of N with respect to distance. Or is it the density of stars as a function of distance? Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Oh, wait, maybe the problem is about the differential number of stars per unit distance. So like, how many stars are there per light-year, or per parsec, as you go further out.

So if N is proportional to d^5, and we're considering the number per unit distance, then it's the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, dN/dr = derivative of (proportional to d^5) → dN/dr ∝ 5d^4. But wait, the options don't have a 5. They have options with r^3, etc. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dr is proportional to N ~ 4π (d)^2 × something, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is set up so that the number is varying as 1/plx^5, which we converted to d^5.

Wait, let's go back. The initial statement is that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And because plx ∝ 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. Maybe it's looking for the density, which would be dn/dr, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume or per unit distance? Hmm, but the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So I think they just want the dependence of N on r, where r is the distance.

Wait, if N ∝ r^5, then with increasing distance, the number of stars increases rapidly. But maybe the question is about the number of stars in a given volume as you move further out.

Wait, but the initial statement says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

So if you go from r to r + dr, the number of stars increases by a factor proportional to (r+dr)^5 - r^5. But for small dr, that's approximately 5 r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is proportional to r^4 dr. So the density of stars at a distance r is dn/dr = 5 k r^4. But the options don't have a 5. The options are about the dependence, so perhaps the answer is r^4. But wait, looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but let's double-check. The initial question says N varies as 1/plx^5. So N = C / plx^5. Plx = 1/d → plx^5 = 1/d^5 → N = C d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

The question says, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range. So perhaps they are considering the number of stars in a volume element. Or maybe it's the number in a shell of radius r and thickness dr.

The number of stars in a spherical shell between r and r+dr is approximately 4πr² dr multiplied by some density. But in this case, the density is N(r) = C r^5. Wait, that's not right. Because N is the number in the shell, but wait, if N is proportional to r^5, that can't be correct because shells at larger r have more volume.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, so N ∝ r^5. So as you go further, more stars. But that's not very realistic because in reality, the number of stars per volume decreases with distance, but perhaps in this problem, it's different.

But the question is, the number of stars in that region varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So as parallax decreases (distance increases), N increases.

Wait, but we're being asked, per unit range of distance. So for each distance interval, how does the number of stars change. So perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell (like dr) is proportional to something.

Wait, if N is the total number of stars up to a certain distance, but I think the problem states that for each region, the number varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps per unit distance, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So if distance is r, then N ∝ r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, meaning the rate of change.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think: parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d → plx = k/d, where k is a constant.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5 → N ∝ d^5.

So N = C * d^5, where C is a constant.

But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. That is, what is the slope of N as a function of d? So the derivative dN/dd = 5 C d^4 → which means the number of stars increases as d^4 per unit d.

Wait, but that would suggest that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars in a given distance range (like from r to r + dr) is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but looking back, the number of stars in a thin shell would be the surface area (4πr²) times the number per area. Wait, but that's only if stars are distributed uniformly in space with a certain density. That's a different assumption, but the question might not be considering that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't about the number in a shell but the total number. So N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, the total number of stars in that region increases as d^5.

But the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Ah, perhaps the question is asking for the differential, how N changes with r. So dN/dr = 5 C r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4.

But wait, the options don't have 5, so the dependence is r^4.

So the answer would be C) ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) as \( \text{plx} = 1/d \), substituting \( \text{plx} = 1/d \) into the given relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), or \( dN/dr \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find \( dN/dr \propto 5d^4 \). The factor of 5 is not relevant to the functional dependence, so the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
