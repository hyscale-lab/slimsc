Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star with some spots and how their presence affects the observed brightness variations. The setup is that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar is about the same as R_sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing brightness changes. The question says this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the same brightness variations. So, we need to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same signal as the spots.

Wait, wait. The question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So whether it's a planet or spots, the change in brightness (the dip when the planet transits, or the dip when spots rotate in/out) should be the same.

But wait, the star has spots, so when it's observed, the brightness changes because the spots are cooler and less bright. So, when the star rotates, more or less of the spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing the observed brightness to dip or rise.

The problem says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So, the amplitude from the planet transit should match the amplitude from the spots' modulation.

Hmm. So to find the planet's radius relative to the star, Rpl/Rstar, such that the dip caused by the planet (when it transits) is the same as the dip (or variation) caused by the spots.

Wait, but the spot effect is a bit more complicated. The spots are cooler, so when the spotted area is on the facing side, the star's brightness decreases. The variation depends on the area of the spots, their temperature, and how much of them are visible as the star rotates.

But wait, the problem is about photometric variations. So when the star has spots, as it rotates, the spots come into view more or less. The brightness change is due to the spots being cooler regions, so when they are on the visible side, the star appears dimmer.

So, when the spots are on the far side, the star is brighter. When the spots rotate into view, it's dimmer. So the brightness variation is about the difference in flux when spots are visible vs when they're not.

So, the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots would be the difference in flux due to the spots being present or not, depending on the star's rotation.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the observed light curve's dip would be similar to what a planet transiting would cause. So the depth of the dip is the same.

So, the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But the spot effect's depth is a bit different. The spot's effect is based on their area, their temperature compared to the rest of the star, and how much of the star is covered.

Let me think about the flux from the star. The total flux without any spots is L = 4Ï€
