Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The setup says that Ay equals c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

The task is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which statement among the options is correct.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can approach this by solving the characteristic equation.

Let me write down matrix Ay. Since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), I can think of Ay as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

So S matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiply by (h/(4π)) each element. So Ay looks like:

[ 0*(h/(4π))   (-i)*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    0*(h/(4π)) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0         ]

To find the eigenvalues (a), I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[ -a          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a         ]

The determinant of this is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) h² ) / (16 π²) ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (1 * h²)/(16 π²) ) = h²/(16 π²).

So the determinant is a² - [ h²/(16 π²) ] = 0.

Setting that to zero: a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me re-calculate the determinant.

The determinant is (Ay - a I)_{11} * (Ay - a I)_{22} - (Ay - a I)_{12} * (Ay - a I)_{21}.

So that's (-a)*(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

The first term is a². The second term is [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ].

Since (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes [ 1 * h²/(16 π²) ].

So the determinant is a² - [ h²/(16 π²) ] = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B talks about eigenvalues with imaginary parts, but according to this, the eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4 π). Wait, that's only if the matrix is Hermitian, right? Let me check if Ay is Hermitian.

Wait, matrix S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Is S Hermitian? The conjugate transpose of S would swap the off-diagonal terms and take their complex conjugate.

The conjugate transpose (S†) would be [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ].

Comparing with S, it's not the same, right? Because S's first row is (0, -i), and S† would have (
