Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal structures, right? It has all sides equal and all angles equal too. Wait, wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, so it's a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron. Oh right, sometimes it's also called a trigonal crystal system.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance? So that's the distance between adjacent atoms in the crystal structure. But wait, in a crystal, that's usually the lattice parameter 'a', since in a cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be 'a'. But here it's a rhombohedral structure, so maybe the lattice parameter is a, and all the angles are alpha, beta, gamma. Here, all angles are 30 degrees, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

Wait, wait, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So is the lattice parameter a equal to 10? Or is there a difference because the structure is rhombohedral? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But I think in the case where the structure is primitive or not, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter. So I'm going to assume a = 10 Angstrom.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The interplanar distance, d, is calculated using the formula derived from the Miller indices (hkl). The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + ... something about the angles, right? Oh wait, no, I think for a general crystal system, the formula involves the unit cell parameters and the angles between them.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - 2hk cos(beta gamma)/(a b
