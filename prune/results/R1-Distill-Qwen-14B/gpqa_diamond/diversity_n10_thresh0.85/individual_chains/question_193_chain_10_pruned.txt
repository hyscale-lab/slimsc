Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, let's start by reading the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/(plx^5). I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance in parsecs (d) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (p), so d = 1/p. So parallax p is inversely proportional to distance. That means if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

Wait, but in this question, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(p^5). So N ∝ 1/p^5. But since p is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5, which would be N ∝ d^5. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, if p = 1/d, then 1/p is d. So 1/p^5 would be (d)^5, right? So N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r. Hmm, maybe they're asking about the differential, like the change in N with respect to r. Or perhaps it's about the number density, the number per unit volume or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the volume. Because when considering how stars are distributed in space, the number of stars you observe would depend on the volume of the region you're observing, assuming stars are uniformly distributed. So volume increases with the cube of the radius. But that's when the distribution is uniform. But in this case, the relation is given as 1/plx^5, which is something else.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach it mathematically. Let's define variables properly.

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx^5). So N = k * (1
