Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. It has a small spherical cavity inside it. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are four different expressions for the electric field E at point P.

I remember from my physics classes that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the concept of electrostatic shielding and the method of image charges might come into play. Wait, but wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we put a charge +q inside the cavity, I think the conductor itself remains neutral, but the charges inside the conductor might redistribute.

But wait, in a conducting shell with a cavity, any charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Oh right, but since the conductor was initially neutral, the charges induced on the inner surface would be -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it out. So the net charge on the conductor's outer surface is +q.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged. So when we add +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor's cavity must have a charge of -q (as the conductor being a conductor, the charges would move freely). So the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of +q to make the total charge of the conductor zero, since it started uncharged.

But wait, no, the conductor was uncharged, meaning its total charge is zero. Adding +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface to have -q and the outer surface to have +q. So the conductor now has a net charge of +q on its outer surface.

But wait, that's not right because the conductor's total charge is the sum of the inner and outer surface charges. So if the conductor was initially neutral, inner surface has
