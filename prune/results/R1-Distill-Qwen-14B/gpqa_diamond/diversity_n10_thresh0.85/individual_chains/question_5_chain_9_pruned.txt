Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I remember that the operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the components first to have them clear.

P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So that matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so P_x = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]].

P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So that's [[0, -i],[i, 0]], so P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

P_z is (ħ/2) times a diagonal matrix with (1,0) and (0,-1), so the matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so P_z = ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Now, the operator vector P is given along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So direction n can be expressed as a unit vector, perhaps as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because in x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal) is zero. Wait, no, the direction in the x-z plane would have y-component zero. So any direction in x-z plane can be written as n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ sinφ?), wait, no. Wait, more accurately, in spherical coordinates, a direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0, so the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because the azimuthal angle φ is the angle from the x-axis in the x-y plane. But since we're in x-z, maybe phi is 90 degrees, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to represent the direction n as (n_x, 0, n_z), but since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, perhaps. Wait, actually, let me think: in the standard spherical coordinate system, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis. So the direction in x-z plane would have φ=0, so the components would be (sinθ cos0, 0, cosθ) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), and it's a unit vector because sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

Wait, wait no: the standard unit vectors are usually r, θ, and φ, where θ is the polar angle. So a
