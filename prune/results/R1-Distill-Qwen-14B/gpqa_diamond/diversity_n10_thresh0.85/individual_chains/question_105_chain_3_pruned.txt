Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on it. They're talking about photometric observations, which I remember measure the brightness of the star over time. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing the star's brightness to vary periodically. But the twist here is that this scenario can be mistaken for an exoplanet causing the same brightness changes. So the question is asking what the radius of such an exoplanet would have to be to produce the same signal in the light curve as the spotted star does.

Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So Rstar is equal to R_sun. The problem gives some parameters: the spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are cooler or hotter? Oh, wait, the temperature difference is 1000K. Spots are usually cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so I think their temperature is 5000K. Because 6000K minus 1000K is 5000K. But wait, does the question say the spots are hotter or cooler? Oh, the problem says "temperature difference of 1000K," but it doesn't specify if the spots are hotter or cooler. Hmm. Wait, in the context of stars, spots are typically cooler. So probably the spots are 5000K.

So, the star's brightness variation is due to spots rotating into and out of view. The exoplanet scenario would involve the planet transiting in front of the star, blocking some light. The goal is to find the radius of the planet (Rpl) relative to the star (Rstar) so that the brightness dip is the same amplitude as the spotted star's variation.

So, first, I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transit. The planet's signal would be the area of the planet divided by the area of the star, right?

Wait, but wait. The brightness variation depends on the area blocked and the temperature difference. Because the spots are cooler, when they come into view, the total brightness of the star decreases. So the change in brightness (delta F) is the area of the spots times their temperature difference relative to the star.

But for the exoplanet, when it transits, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount blocked is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, assuming the planet is completely opaque (which it is for the purpose of this calculation). But wait, no—because the planet blocks the star's light, the brightness change is (Area_planet / Area_star). But the spots are not just covering part of the star; they're emitting less flux because they're cooler.

So, let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the fractional change in brightness due to the star's spots.

Fractional change in brightness, ΔF_spot = (Area of spots) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) / (T_star^4) 

Wait, because the spots are cooler, their flux per unit area is lower. So when they come into view, the total flux decreases. The fractional change would be the difference in flux from the spots compared to the surrounding area.

Alternatively, the star's total flux without spots is F0 = σ Tstar^4 * 4π Rstar^2. When the spots are present, F = F0 - (number of spots area) * σ (T_spot^4 - Tstar^4) ?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the contribution of the spots. Let me model the star as having a certain area, and the spots as a fraction of that area.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the area of spots divided by the area of the hemisphere. So one hemisphere has 20% spots. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2π Rstar^2), but wait, the total surface area of the star is 4π Rstar². So one hemisphere is 2π R². If the filling factor is 20%, that's 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Since one hemisphere is covered (so 50% of the surface), and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4π Rstar²) ) = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². Alternatively, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.
