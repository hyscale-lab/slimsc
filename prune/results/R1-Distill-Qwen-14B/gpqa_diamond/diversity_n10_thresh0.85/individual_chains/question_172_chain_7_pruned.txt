Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I should start by understanding what the question is asking. The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Actually, it says the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Wait, does that mean their energy is twice as high, or maybe the number of excited atoms is twice as much?

Wait no, I think when they say "excited," they're talking about the excitation state. So perhaps the number of atoms in that excited energy level is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2. Oh right, but in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

So Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the degeneracy, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call this ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. But wait, the problem says that for star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. So, the ratio n1_2 / n1_1 = 2, where n1_2 is the population in the upper level for star_1, and similarly for n2_2 in star_2.

Wait, actually, let's clarify the variables. Let me define for star_1: the number of atoms in the excited state is n1, and the ground state is n0. Similarly for star_2: n1' and n0'.

The question states that n1 (star_1) is twice as much as n1' (star_2). So, n1 = 2 * n1'.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is:

n1/n0 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Assuming that the ground state and excited state have the same degeneracy, which is sometimes the case, then g_upper = g_lower, so the ratio simplifies to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, but I don't know if the degeneracies are the same. The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I can assume that they are the same for both stars, so that the g factors cancel out when taking the ratio of the two stars.

Wait, but the problem says that for star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So, perhaps I should write the ratio of n1 (star_1) to n1' (star_2) is 2.

So:

n1 / n1' = 2.

But from Boltzmann, each n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)) for each star. Wait, no. Wait, for each star, n1 = n0 * exp(-ΔE/(k
