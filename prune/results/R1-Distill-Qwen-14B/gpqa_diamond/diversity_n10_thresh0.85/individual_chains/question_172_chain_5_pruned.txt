Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature through something called the Boltzmann equation. Let me think about how that works.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, right, the Boltzmann distribution formula is probably involved here. The Boltzmann factor tells us about the population of different energy levels. The formula is something like the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is the Boltzmann constant.

So for two levels, E1 and E2, the ratio n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ). But wait, in this case, the higher energy level is more populated in star_1. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. If an energy level is more excited, that means more atoms are in that higher state. So star_1 has more atoms in the higher energy level compared to star_2. 

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? So the energy level difference ΔE is the same. So for star_1, the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is twice that of star_2. Or is it the other way around? Wait, let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So star_1 has a higher excitation, meaning more atoms in the higher energy state.

So for each star, the ratio of the upper to lower state would be n1_upper / n1_lower and n2_upper / n2_lower. And according to the question, n1_upper/n1_lower is twice n2_upper/n2_lower. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, but each star's photosphere is in LTE, so the ratio within each star is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, the ratio is (n_upper/n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). For star_2, the same ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But wait, wait, no. Wait, because if you're going from a lower to a higher energy level, the ratio should be exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but I'm a bit confused about the direction. Let me get that right.

The Boltzmann distribution states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower. So for the higher state, the population is lower if ΔE is positive. But wait, in this problem, the atoms in star_1 are more excited, so more in the higher state. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower
