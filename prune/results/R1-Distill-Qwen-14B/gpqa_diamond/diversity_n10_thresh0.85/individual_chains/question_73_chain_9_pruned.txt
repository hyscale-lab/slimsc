Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to figure out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. We're looking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting their velocities, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition. I remember that you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me try to recall the formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Oh wait, but wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So if I'm astronaut A and I want to find the speed of astronaut B relative to me, I subtract their velocities. So u would be B's speed (0.5c), and v is my speed (0.6c). So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let's compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.5 - 0.6 = -0.1 → -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. But since speed is a positive quantity, the relative speed is 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So I can eliminate options A and B because their relative speed doesn't match.

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the direction. Oh, wait, because when I subtract u and v, if u is moving slower than v, then from A's frame, B is moving backward? No, wait, no, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So in A's frame, B is moving slower, so the relative speed is (0.6 - 0.5)c? Wait, no, because that would be 0.1c. But according to the relativistic formula, it's (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - (0.5*0.6)/1) c.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. The numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = (-0.1c), denominator is 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c². Oh, wait, (0.5c)(0.6c) = 0.3 c². So 0.3 c² / c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So (-0.1c)/0.7 is approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but speed is absolute, so 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, so either option C or D.

Now for the total energy. Oh right, the total energy of a system is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy equation is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma A is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma B is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc². Option D says E=5 mc². So the correct total energy is 5.96.

So the options that match are C: relative speed 0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but wait. Oh no—wait, I think I miscalculated the gamma for B. Let me recalculate. 0.5c is the speed, so v^2 = 0.25 c². 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. So sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547. Yes, that's correct. Then 3 * 1.1547 is 3.4641, so 3.4641 * mc². So E_A is 2.5, E_B is
