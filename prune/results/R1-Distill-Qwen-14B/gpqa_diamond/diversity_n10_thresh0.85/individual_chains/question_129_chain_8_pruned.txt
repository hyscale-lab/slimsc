Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives a reaction scheme with four compounds, A to E, and some hints. The goal is to figure out what compound E is from the options provided.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form D.
4. D loses an inert gas to form E.

The hints are:

a) A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR of A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is ~1715 cm^-1.

The options are four cyclic ketones because they all end with -one, which is a ketone suffix.

Let me break down each step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B.

HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. So, B would be a cyanohydrin. Wait, but wait—what if A is an aldehyde? No, because if A is a cyclic ketone, the reaction with HCN would form a secondary cyanohydrin. Alternatively, sometimes HCN can add to esters or other carbonyls, but in this case, I think A is a ketone.

So, let's think A is a cyclic ketone. Then, B would have an -OH and -CN group added across the carbonyl.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. So the reduction of a cyanohydrin—what happens then? The -C≡N group is a good leaving group under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Wait, upon hydrogenation, maybe the nitrile group (-CN) gets reduced. Because in the presence of H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but I'm not sure. Wait, wait, wait. Another possibility: the reduction of the nitrile group to an amine could happen, but another possibility is that the nitrile group is hydrogenated to an amine. Wait, but in the context of a cyanohydrin, perhaps the nitrile is adjacent to an alcohol. Or perhaps the reduction is of the alcohol group.

Wait, looking again: B is the cyanohydrin. Structure-wise, if A is a cyclic ketone, say cyclopentanone, then adding HCN would add a hydroxyl and a cyanide group across the carbonyl. So, B would have an -OH and -CN on adjacent carbons. Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group (-CN) is hydrogenated. What's the product when a nitrile is hydrogenated? It becomes an amine: -CH2NH2. Wait, but in the
