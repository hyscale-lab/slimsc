Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, for C8H9NO: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2? Wait, X (halogens) are zero here, so that's (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5 degrees. So that's five degrees of unsaturation. Could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or another double bond (1). Or maybe a benzene and a carbonyl group. 

Looking at the NMR data: The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

So the 9.72 is a triplet integrating for one proton. That's a strong signal. Triplet usually implies two neighboring protons. But wait, a triplet in an aromatic region? Or perhaps it's an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes usually are around 9-10 ppm, singlet or maybe a triplet if coupled with another proton. Wait, aldehydes have a deshielded proton, so a triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde. But aldehyde protons are typically singlets because they don't have neighboring hydrogens. Hmm, but wait, depending on the structure, maybe it's part of something else.

Wait, the triplet with 1H—could it be an aldehyde adjacent to another group? Or maybe it's a vinyl proton next to something else.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets each with 2H suggest a symmetrical substitution. So maybe two substituents in para positions. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be the protons on the benzene ring, perhaps ortho to substituents.

Then there's a 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, integrating for two protons. Maybe an -OH group, but that's usually downfield and a broad peak. But wait, 6.27 isn't that downfield for an -OH. Or perhaps it's another type of proton. Maybe a conjugated system, like an enol or something.

The 3.66 (d, 2H) is a doublet, integrating two protons. That could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or ester. Or perhaps an OCH2 group. The doublet suggests each proton is next to one other, maybe in a -CH2- group attached to something else.

Putting this together: The molecule has a benzene ring (since the aromatic signals are present), a group with two substituents in para positions (since the two doublets), perhaps an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 ppm peak), and another group attached.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons. Benzene is 6, so the substituents would be two groups of two carbons each? Or maybe a benzene ring with two substituents, each a phenyl group? No, the formula is C8, so benzene is 6, so substituents add two more carbons. Maybe something like a propyl group attached to benzene, but that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think. The 9.72 ppm could be the aldehyde proton. Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be from a para-substituted benzene ring attached to the aldehyde. Wait, but that would give a compound with a benzaldehyde group and a para-substituted phenyl group.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the reaction steps. The reagents are NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O, then aq. KOH and heat.

NaNO2 and HCl are used for diazotization, typically with aryl amines. So the starting compound probably has an aromatic amine group, like a phenylamine or something similar. Then, after diazotization, the next step is H2O — maybe hydrolysis. The third step is KOH aqueous with heat, which is typical for elimination reactions, like the formation of aldehydes from amides, or perhaps some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting compound is C8H9NO. Let's see: if it's an aromatic amine, then the molecular formula would have the amine group. So after diazotization, we could form a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis (like with H2O) might give a phenol (if acidic conditions, like with H2O and heat). But wait, the second step is just H2O. Then, the third step is KOH and heat, which might be a Hofmann or Curtius type elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the process is: the starting compound has an amine group. Then, it's converted to a diazonium chloride. Then, treated with water (maybe under acidic conditions) to form a phenol. Then, treated with KOH and heat — perhaps an elimination reaction to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an aniline derivative. For example, a benzylamine or aniline. When treated with NaNO2 and HCl, it forms the diazonium salt. Then, under certain conditions, this can undergo various reactions. For example, if the diazonium salt is treated with water (like a hydrolysis), it can form a phenol. But more commonly, diazonium salts are hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form phenols or to form N2 and the corresponding phenol. But if the starting compound had an amine group attached to another structure, perhaps a nitro group or something else.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. So if the starting compound is an aniline derivative, the formula would have an NH2 group. Alternatively, maybe an amide?

Wait, but the NMR data has a peak at 6.27, which is broad singlet for two protons. Maybe that's an -OH group. So perhaps the starting compound has a phenol group as well as an amine group. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring with an amine substituent and another substituent.

Let me think about the possible structure. The NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene, as the two doublets (each 2H) in the aromatic region. So if we have a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each substituent would contribute to the splitting. So, maybe one substituent is a nitro group (NO2), but that might not fit the molecular formula. Or perhaps each substituent is a CH2 group attached to something else.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of two protons. So maybe a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. Like OCH2CH2... or something. But it's a doublet, so each proton is next to one other, so maybe it's a CH2 group connected to something that causes coupling.

Another approach: let's look at the options. The options are all aldehydes (since they end with 'al' or 'al'), except C which is a butanal but with hydroxy groups. Let's see.

Options:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with substituents? No, wait, 2 and 4 positions might have phenyl groups. Structure: CH2=CH-Ph-CHO? Not sure.

Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CHO with a double bond at position 3? Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2CH2-CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible. Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO? No, wait, but butenals have four carbons. Let me get the structure right.

But-3-enal: It would be CH2CH2 with a double bond starting at C3. So structure is CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between C2 and C3. So CH2=CHCHO?

Wait, no, butenals have four carbons. So for but-3-enal, the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, that's not possible because that would make it a three-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph groups attached at positions 2 and 4 of a buten-aldehyde. So something like:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond? No, but that's but-3-enal. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-Ph-CHO? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that wouldn't explain the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound has two benzene rings attached. Let's think: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If there's a benzene ring (6 C), then the remaining 2 C would be, for example, a CH2-O group or something else.

Looking back at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H) → maybe aldehyde proton.
- 6.98 and 6.51 (d, 2H each) → para-substituted benzene.
- 6.27 (bs, 2H) → perhaps an enol proton or another group.
- 3.66 (d, 2H) → OCH2 group.

So maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let's say the benzaldehyde is linked to another benzene ring via a methylene group. Like Ph-CH2-CHO. But that's only 7 carbons (Ph is 6, CH2 is 2, CHO is 1). Wait, no, that's 6
