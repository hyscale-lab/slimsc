Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is about finding the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

First, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The problem says it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, which makes me think of common reagents like NaOH, KOH, NH3, H2SO4, or maybe something like HCl? Wait, but X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe it's an element that has significant isotopes, like chlorine (Cl), which has Cl-35 and Cl-37.

The reaction with liquid Y produces gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think: a molecule where protons equal neutrons. Water is H2Oâ€”no, protons (2) don't equal neutrons (in O, which is 8, but wait, the molecule as a whole? Wait, no, the molecule's total protons and neutrons. Let's think: maybe H2O has 2 H (each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons), and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule's total protons would be 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 0 (from H) + 8 =8. Wait, that's not equal. So that's not W.

Wait, another gas. Maybe CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8 each. So CO2: 6 + 2*8=22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (since C-12 is common), each O has 8, so 6 + 2*8=22. Oh, that's equal! So W is CO2? Or wait, another possibility is CH4? Let's see: C has 6 protons, H has 1 each. So 6 + 4=10
