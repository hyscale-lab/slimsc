Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule's energy states and photon momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy states. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe means it's in the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. They're asking what momentum a photon should have to move the molecule to the next lowest energy state.

The given data is:
- Mass of X, Mx = 20 amu
- Mass of Y, My = 2 amu
- Bond length, R = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency, ω = 4e14 rad/s

The options are four different momenta values.

Wait, so the molecule is currently in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state for a diatomic would be the state with the lowest vibrational energy (v=0) and the lowest rotational energy (rotational quantum number J=0). But I'm not entirely sure about the exact state definitions. Alternatively, maybe the fundamental state refers to the lowest energy state of either rotation or vibration. Oh wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state overall. But when they're talking about the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think they're referring to the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, whichever requires the least energy.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational motions. The energy levels are given by some formula that includes both. But I'm not too sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diatomic molecule which is treated as a rigid rotor and a simple harmonic oscillator. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which is more accurate for molecules where bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational energy isn't exactly like a rigid rotor anymore.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy levels for a diatomic molecule. For the rigid rotor (which is a simpler model), the rotational energy levels are given by E_rotational = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia, J is the rotational quantum number. For the vibration, it's a quantum harmonic oscillator, so the vibrational energy levels are E Vibrational = (ℏω)(v + 1/2), where v is the vibrational quantum number.

But wait, the non-rigid rotor model probably considers the bond length as variable, so the moment of inertia isn't a constant. But perhaps for this problem, we can treat it as a rigid rotor since the question seems to combine rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the problem's main point is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the fundamental state is probably the state where both v and J are as low as possible. So v=0 and J=0. The next state would be the next lowest energy, which would be either v=1, J=0 or J=1, v=0. Since the energy increases with higher J or v, whichever requires less energy would be the next state.

So I need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state and each possible next state, then see which one has the lower energy. The photon's energy should match the energy difference required for the transition.

Wait, but photons carry energy E_photon = hf = hν, and their momentum p is related by E = pc (since for photons, E = pc because their mass is zero). Wait, but wait, photons have energy E = hν and momentum p = E/c = hν/c. So if I find the necessary energy difference ΔE between states, the photon's momentum will be ΔE/c.

So maybe the approach is:

1. Find the energy of the fundamental state (both J and v at their lowest).
2. Find the energies of the next possible states (v=1, J=0 and J=1, v=0).
3. Calculate the ΔE for each possible transition.
4. The required photon energy is the smallest ΔE, because the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy". So the photon must provide the least energy needed to reach the next state.

But wait, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So we're looking for the transition that requires the least energy, which would correspond to the smallest possible ΔE.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest. The next state could be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. So which of these has a smaller energy difference? Because if ΔE_vib is smaller than ΔE_rot, then the photon would have to match ΔE_vib, and so on.

So I need to calculate both ΔE for vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) and rotational (J=0 to J=1), and choose the smaller one as the required energy.

Let's compute both ΔE values.

First, the vibrational energy difference.

ΔE_vib = (v=1) - (v=0) = (ℏω)(1 + 1/2) - (ℏω)(0 + 1/2) ) = ℏω (3/2 - 1/2) = ℏω (1). So ΔE_vib = ℏω.

Then, the rotational energy difference. For J=0 to J=1.

For a rigid rotor, the energy E_rot is (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia. So ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = [ (ħ² * 2 ) / (2I) ] - 0 = ħ²/(I) * (1) [since 2/(2I) is 1/I].

Wait, let's compute I. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let's compute that.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But we need to convert amu to kg because the Planck constant is in SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1.6605e-27 kg = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation:

20 amu * 2 amu = 40 (amu)^2. 20 +2 =22 amu. So μ =40/(22) amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert 1.818 amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot = (ħ²) / (I) * [ (J+1)J+1 - J J ] when J increases by 1. Wait, let me think again.

E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2I). So the difference from J=0 to J=1 is [ (1)(2) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = (ħ²) / I.

I have I as 1.207e-46 kg m².

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot ≈ (1.112e-68) / (1.207e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Now, compute ΔE_vib. ℏω is ħ multiplied by ω.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = ħ * ω = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 4e14 s^-1 = 4.218e-20 J.

Now, compare ΔE_vib (≈4.22e-20 J) and ΔE_rot (≈9.21e-23 J). The vibrational energy difference is much larger than the rotational. So the next lowest energy state is the rotational state, requiring ΔE_rot of 9.21e-23 J.

Therefore, the photon's energy must match ΔE_rot, so E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible
