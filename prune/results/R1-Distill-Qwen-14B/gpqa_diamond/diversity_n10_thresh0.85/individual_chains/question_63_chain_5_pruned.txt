Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule's energy states and photon momentum. Hmm, I remember from my studies that molecules can absorb photons and transition between energy states, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me try to break this down.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, that model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But how does the photon's momentum factor into this transition?

I remember that when a photon is absorbed, its energy is absorbed by the molecule, causing a transition between energy levels. The energy of the photon should match the energy difference between the current state and the next state.

But wait, the molecule is a diatomic, so it's undergoing both rotation and vibration. The energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. The fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), or maybe the next rotational state? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model includes both vibrational and rotational modes. The energy levels are given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be the next higher state, which could be either increasing J by 1 or increasing v by 1. But which requires less energy? Because the energy of vibration is usually higher than the rotational.

Vibrational energy levels are quantized and given by (n + ½) hν, where n is 0,1,2... And the rotational energy levels are (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the energy difference between the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) and the next state would be the smallest possible increase. The next state could be either v=1 and J=0, or J=1 and v=0. Which transition requires less energy?

Vibrational energy has a much higher frequency than rotational. Let me think: in the harmonic oscillator, the energy spacing is hν, while for rotational, the spacing between J levels is about (ħ²)/(2I) * (2J+1), which is much smaller for higher J. So the vibrational transition would require a much higher energy photon.

So the next lowest energy state after the fundamental would be the next rotational state, J=1, same vibrational state. So the photon's energy should cause the molecule to transition from J=0 to J=1, with v staying at 0.

So the energy required is the difference between the J=1 and J=0 states. Let's compute that.

The energy for rotational levels is E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So the energy difference between J=1 and J=0 would be E_1 - E_0.

E_0 is 0, since J=0. E_1 is (1*2 ħ²)/(2I) )= (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). So the energy difference ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I).

Now, I need to calculate I, the moment of inertia. I is given by μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but amu needs to be converted to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = (40/22) amu ≈1.81818 amu. So in kg, that's 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me compute that:

1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ (approx 1.818 * 1.66 is around 3.015e-27 kg? Wait, more accurately: 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27

Calculating: 1 *1.66e-27 is 1.66e-27. 0.818
