Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit for the stars they can observe.

Let me go through each star one by one. First, I need to understand whether each star's apparent magnitude meets the brightness requirement for both instruments.

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. Wait, wait, no, the question says stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17 (because lower numbers are brighter), it's observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So apparent magnitude less than 16.

Wait, wait, no. The way it's phrased is a bit confusing. The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO, while with HIRES, brighter than 16." Hmm, but in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 (so magnitude less than 17), then ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so magnitude less than 16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The brightness is inversely related to magnitude. So a star with V magnitude of 16 is brighter than one with 17
