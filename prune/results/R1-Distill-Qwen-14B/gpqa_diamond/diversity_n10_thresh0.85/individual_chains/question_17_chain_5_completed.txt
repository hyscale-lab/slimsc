Okay, let's try to work through this chemistry problem. So the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a Ca-EDTA complex is present. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Oh wait, and the formation constant, K_ca-edta, is 5x10^10. I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA form the complex. Right, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So, I need to find [Ca²+] in this solution. Let me think about the equilibrium expression. The formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, the solution contains the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. I guess that initially, the complex is formed. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the EDTA and Ca²+ are in solution as well, but because K is so large (5x10^10), the complex is very stable, meaning almost all the Ca²+ is bound by EDTA. Hmm, but wait, the question is about the free calcium ion concentration.

Wait, let's think again. At equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. But because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, it probably binds all the Ca²+ ions. So, assuming that the solution starts with only the complex, the free [Ca²+] would be very low because the K is so big.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M for the complex. Then, at equilibrium, the complex dissociates a little into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, no. Let me clarify: The solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, let me model the dissociation. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is given as 5e10, which is the same as the dissociation constant being 1/(5e10). Wait, no. Formation constant is the K for formation of the complex. So the K is [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA]).

But wait, in solution, the EDTA is present as the deprotonated form, right? Oh, the problem says pH is ideal, which I think refers to the fact that EDTA is in its deprotonated form (Y^4-), so we don't have to worry about the other protonation states of EDTA. So, [EDTA] here is [Y^4-].

So, the setup is:

Initial concentrations:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA^4-] = 0

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Wait, but that's assuming that x is the amount dissociated. But since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation will be very minimal, so x would be really small compared to 0.02. So approximating 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, the equation becomes:

K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So, 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-12 /5 → Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7. Oh wait, wait, wait. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * (1e-6.5) since 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options: option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer. The [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large value of \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions at equilibrium. At equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
