Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function given certain conditions.

Alright, the setup: There are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside that interval. That makes sense because in quantum mechanics, if the wave function is zero outside a region, the probability of finding the particle there is zero.

Wait, so the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, a wave function is usually a complex function, right? But the probability density is the square of the absolute value. Oh wait, maybe the given wave function is actually a probability amplitude. But wait, the expression has a real part and an imaginary part. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. 

But wait, the wave function should usually satisfy certain conditions, like being square-integrable and normalizable. But perhaps more importantly, the probability density is |ψ|^2. So let's think about that.

Wait, the problem states that when measuring the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. So, for x <1 and x>3, ψ(x) should be zero. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that expression is a function of x, but the only x in there is in the denominator. So when is this expression zero?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because a/sqrt(1+x) is a real number (assuming a is real), and subtracting 0.5i would make the whole expression a complex number. But for ψ(x) to be zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) = 0, and the imaginary part is -0.5i = 0, which is impossible. Wait, that can't be right. So maybe the given wave function is only valid in the region where the particle can be found, i.e., between x=1 and x=3. Outside that region, the wave function is zero.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, but the given form is only applicable within 1 <=x <=3. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is of the form ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * e^{iθ}, but the problem writes it as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that would imply a complex wave function with a real part and an imaginary part, but perhaps it's just a simplified form. Hmm.

But the key point is that the wave function must be zero outside the region [1,3], because the particles are only found there. So, the wave function is zero when x <1 and x>3. But the given wave function is only applicable between x=1 and x=3. So, perhaps the given expression is the form of ψ(x) in that interval, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but then the modulus squared of ψ(x) would give the probability density. Since the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must be 1 for normalization.

So let's calculate the normalization condition. The integral of |ψ(x)|^2 dx from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, the modulus squared is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + [ (-0.5) ]^2. Because for a complex number a + ib, |a + ib|^2 = a² + b².

So |ψ(x)|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

The integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

Similarly, integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

Putting it together:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] + 0.5 = 1.

Because ln(1+x) from 1 to 3 is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer would be B.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations:

Compute ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2). So ln(4) - ln(2) = 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2), which is correct.

So the integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So the integral becomes a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² = (0.5)/ln(2) ≈ 0.5 /0.6931 ≈0.7213.

a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B.

Wait, but let me check if the wave function is correctly integrated. The modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25. So integrating from 1 to 3:

Integral [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx 

= a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + ∫0.25 dx from 1 to3 

= a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] + 0.25*(3-1) 

= a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set equal to 1:

a² ln(2) +0.5 =1 → a² = 0.5/ln(2) → a= sqrt(0.5/ln(2)).

Let me compute that more accurately.

ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213475.

sqrt(0.7213475) ≈ 0.849.

Yes, so 0.849 is approximately 0.85. So option B is correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function is zero outside the interval \( x \in [1, 3] \), meaning the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The wave function must be normalized, so the integral of the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval must equal 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The probability density is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This separates into two integrals:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \)

For the first integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \), we use the substitution \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \). The limits change from \( x = 1 \) to \( u = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) to \( u = 4 \). Thus:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \), we compute:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \). Therefore, the numerical value of \( a \) is:

**Answer: B**
