Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ/(Δt2) = (1.055e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV. 

So ΔE1 is about 7e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 7e-8 eV. 

The total uncertainty when considering the two states would be the sum of these individual uncertainties, I think. Because if both states have some energy spread, the minimum energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be distinguishable. Wait, no, maybe it's the maximum of the two? Or perhaps the sum? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

Wait, when two states have their own uncertainties, the combined uncertainty for the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because for E1 and E2, each has their own ΔE, so the total uncertainty would be ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2. That makes sense because the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties for them to be resolved clearly. So, ΔE must be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2: 7e-7 eV + 7e-8 eV = 7.7e-7 eV approximately. So the energy difference must be greater than 7.7e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options: Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger. Option A is 1e-9 eV, smaller than the sum. Option B is 1e-11 eV, even smaller. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 1e-8. Hmm, but wait, 1e-8 is less than 7.7e-7. So option C is 1e-4. That's way larger than the required 7.7e-7 eV. So for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, it needs to be at least on the order of 1e-6 eV or higher. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Did I convert the units correctly?

Calculating ΔE1 again:
ħ is 1.055e-34 J·s.
Δt1 is 1e-9 s.
So ΔE1 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 J is 1 / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So 1.055e-25 J * (6.242e18 eV/J) = (1.055e-25) * (6.242e18) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Right, same as before.

ΔE2 is (1e-8 s) so 1.055e-26 J. To eV, that's 6.58e-8 eV.

So sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = (approximately) 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than about 7e-7 eV. Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7e-7. That would be 1000 times larger, so definitely resolvable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → which is about 1e
