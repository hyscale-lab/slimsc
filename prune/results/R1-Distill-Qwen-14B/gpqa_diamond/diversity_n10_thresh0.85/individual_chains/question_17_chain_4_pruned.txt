Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and complex ions can be a bit tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and since it's stoichiometric, I think that means the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1. So the complex is [CaEDTA]^2- or something like that.

Wait, the formation constant, K, is given. I think K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The general reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms. Oh right, but the problem states that the pH is ideal. Oh yeah, I think that's why they give K_Ca-EDTA because at the right pH, EDTA is in the form that can donate the Ca²+ ions properly. So maybe I don't have to worry about the different forms of EDTA here.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution, I need to find [Ca²+]. But how?

The formation constant equation is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the complex is 0.02 M, that's the numerator. But what about the denominator? The denominator is the product of the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the dissociation is complete (which may not be the case, but for a very high K, it's almost completely dissociated?), no, wait, high K means the formation is favored, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. Wait, no, formation constant K is large, so the complex is stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very low.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. The K is 5e10, which is a pretty large number. So the reaction tends to form the complex as much as possible. So when you have the complex in solution, it doesn't dissociate much. So [Ca²+] is low, which is what the question is asking for.

So, let's model the dissociation. Let’s set up the equation. The complex is [CaEDTA]^2- with concentration 0.02 M. Let’s denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x, and EDTA^4- as y. But wait, since
