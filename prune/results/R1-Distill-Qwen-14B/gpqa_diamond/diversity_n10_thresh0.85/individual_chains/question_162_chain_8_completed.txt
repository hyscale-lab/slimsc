Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm. Let me try to think this through. I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and from the metric, you can compute things like area, volume, etc., depending on the coordinates.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so it's a two-dimensional metric, right? Because I see dx² and dy². But wait, pseudosphere... pseudospheres are related to anti-de Sitter space, I think. Or maybe it's a hyperbolic space?

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but in higher dimensions, maybe it's part of a hyperbolic space.

Wait, but the metric here doesn't look like the standard hyperbolic metric. The standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dr² + dz² + r² dθ²)/z², but this is for 3D. Wait, in 2D, it's usually ds² = (dx² + dy²)/ (z^2) or something like that.

Wait, but the metric given is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Let me think about the form. It's similar to the metric of a sphere, but maybe in a different space. Oh wait, if I think of Rindler coordinates, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the area of the pseudosphere. Pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface, right? So we need to calculate its area. The area element in a metric is found by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy or something like that.

Wait, the metric tensor here is diagonal, right? Because ds² = g_xx dx² + g_yy dy². So g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant of the metric tensor is (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2. The square root of the determinant is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA would be (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but what is the region over which we're integrating? Because the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which is positive only when x² + y² <4. So the domain is the disk x² + y² <4. So the area would be integrating dA over that disk.

Wait, but the problem is to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, pseudosphere in 2D is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in 2D, the metric given might be that of a hyperbolic space. Wait, but hyperbolic space has an infinite area, doesn't it? Or is this a different case?

Wait, another approach: the area of a two-dimensional surface with metric ds² is computed by integrating the area element over the surface. So the area A = ∫∫ dA, where dA = sqrt(det g) dx dy.

In this case, as I said, sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So A is the integral over the region x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Hmm, that integral. Let's switch to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dx dy = r dr dθ. The integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the integral over θ is 2π, so A = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, let me compute the radial integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → r dr = -du/2. So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (u=4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2) / u ].

Which is the same as ∫ (u=0 to4) [32 * (du/2) / u ].

Which is (32/2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

Wait, but ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to 4 is divergent because at u=0, 1/u blows up. Oh wait, that's a problem. So the integral ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du is ln(4) - ln(0), but ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the area can't be infinite, can it? Or can it? Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Does it have finite or infinite area?

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a disk of radius r in 2D hyperbolic space is 4π sinh²(r/2). For r=2, it's 4π sinh²(1). Which is finite. So why does this integral give infinity?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric. Because the given metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, 4 is (2)^2. So perhaps this metric represents a hyperbolic space with a certain curvature but a cutoff at radius 2.

Wait, another thought: maybe this metric is for a hyperbolic plane, but it's only defined for r < 2. Because beyond that, the denominator becomes zero or negative, which would make the metric singular or imaginary. So the region we're dealing with is a disk of radius 2, but it's a finite area.

Wait, but when I integrated, the area came out as infinite. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine.

The area element is (32)/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ. So the integral is 32 * ∫(0 to 2π) dθ ∫(0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

The θ integral gives 2π, so 32 * 2π * ∫(0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute the inner integral. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr= -du/2. When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to2 is ∫ [ (r dr) / (4 - r²) ) ] = ∫ (-du/2)/u from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (du/u) from 4 to 0 → (-1/2)(ln(0) - ln(4)).

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) ) → (infty - ln4)/2, which is infinity.

So the area is 32 * 2π * (infinite) → infinity. So the area is infinite. That would mean the answer is option D) +infty.

But why is that? I thought a pseudosphere (which is a hyperbolic surface) has finite area. But perhaps the pseudosphere here is considered as a 2D surface embedded in 3D, but in this case, the question is about a 2D space with the given metric. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is not for the entire hyperbolic plane, but for a specific surface.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the given metric is a representation of a pseudosphere, but it's a different parametrization. Wait, the standard metric of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a 2D surface with finite area. So wait, that's a 2D surface in 3D space, like a surface of revolution. But the given metric is for a 2D manifold, perhaps embedded in a higher-dimensional spacetime?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts. Let's think about the metric given. It's a 2D metric with signature (+,+) because the denominator is positive when x² + y² <4. So it's a positively curved space? Or maybe negative? Wait, no. The metric is conformally flat, with a conformal factor of 32/(4 - r²). Conformal factors affect things like angles but not distances up to scaling.

Wait, in hyperbolic space, the metric is usually written as ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(z^2), where z is related to the radius. Alternatively, some other forms.

Wait, perhaps the given metric isn't a hyperbolic space but a sphere? No, because for a sphere of radius a, the metric is (a²/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, but that's for a sphere that's been cut off at radius r < a. Hmm, but in that case, the area would be finite if the integral converges.

Wait, but in this case, the denominator is (4 - r²), so when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the conformal factor blow up. That would make the area integral diverge, leading to infinite area. So perhaps the area is indeed infinite.

So the options are:

A) 0 → No, because the area is positive.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → No, that's a function, not a number.

C) 4π(x² - y²) → Also a function, not a number.

D) +infty → That's what I'm getting from the integral.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." So perhaps it's not the entire space, but a specific surface. Wait, but pseudosphere as a surface in 3D is of finite area. But in 2D, I'm talking about a 2D surface. Hmm, maybe I'm conflating 2D surfaces and 3D manifolds.

Wait, perhaps the metric is for a 2D space, and the "pseudosphere" is being treated as a 2D manifold. But the integral for area is giving infinity, so the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick. Because if the metric is ds²=32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), then the maximum radius is 2. So this is a model of hyperbolic space, but it's a conformally flat metric on the disk of radius 2. But hyperbolic space has infinite area, so the area here would be infinity.

So I think the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space with a conformal factor \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Metric Analysis**: The metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as \( g = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right) \). The determinant of the metric is \( \det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \), and the area element is \( dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy \).

2. **Integration Region**: The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) is positive only when \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius \( 2 \) in the \( xy \)-plane. Thus, the integration is performed over this disk.

3. **Switch to Polar Coordinates**: To simplify the integration, switch to polar coordinates:
   \[
   x = r \cos\theta, \quad y = r \sin\theta, \quad dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]
   The area becomes:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Radial Integration**: The radial integral is:
   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]
   Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_4^0 \frac{-16}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
   \]
   However, \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \frac{1}{u} \) blows up at \( u = 0 \). This indicates that the area integral diverges to infinity.

5. **Physical Interpretation**: The metric describes a space with infinite area because the conformal factor \( \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \) diverges as \( r \to 2 \). This is consistent with the fact that hyperbolic spaces, which this metric resembles, have infinite area.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (0)**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly positive.
- **Option B (\( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \))**: Incorrect, as this is a function, not a numerical value for the area.
- **Option C (\( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \))**: Incorrect, for the same reason as Option B.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\))**: Correct, as the area integral diverges to infinity.

### Conclusion:
The area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.

**Answer: D**
