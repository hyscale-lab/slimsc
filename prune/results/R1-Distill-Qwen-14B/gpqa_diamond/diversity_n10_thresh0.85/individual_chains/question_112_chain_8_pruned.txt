Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's equal up to a normalization factor, right? So I think the first thing I need to do is find the normalization constant. Because without that, I can't find probabilities properly.

So, the state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The normalization condition is that the inner product of |alpha> with itself should equal 1. So I need to compute the inner product.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i). Wait, no. Wait, let me think. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up>, which is the first component, and (2-i) for |down>, which is the second. So the conjugate transpose would be (1-i, 2+i), right?

Wait, when you take the inner product, you take the conjugate transpose of the first vector and multiply by the second. So |alpha> is (1+i, 2-i) as a column vector. The conjugate transpose would be (1-i, 2+i). Then, the inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the inner product is the sum of the products of each component. So the first term is (1-i)*(1+i) and the second term is (2+i)*(2-i).

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Wait, the vectors are |up> and |down>, which form an orthonormal basis. So the inner product is |(1+i)|^2 + |(2-i)|^2. Oh right, because |a|^2 + |b|^2 = (a)(a*) + (b)(b*).

So |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. Similarly, |2 -i|^2 is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Okay, so now, the next part of the problem is about the operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so this is a 2x2 matrix because we're talking about spin-up and spin-down. So the matrix would be:

Row 1: [0, ħ/2]
Row 2: [ħ/2, 0]

Because when i != j, it's ħ/2. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. That looks familiar—it's similar to the Pauli X matrix but scaled. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this is (ħ/2) times that.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually represented with σx as [[0,1],[1,0]], σy as [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz as [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So our operator A is (ħ/2) * σx.

So the operator in question is (ħ/2) σx. Now, the question is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of this operator, and then find the average value of the operator.

Wait, no, the question is a bit different. The operator is given by matrix A, and we're supposed to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So I think we need to find the eigenstates of A, and then calculate the probability of |alpha> being in each eigenstate of A.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is being measured, and we need the probabilities of getting each eigenvalue. But I think that's equivalent because the eigenstates are the possible outcomes, and probabilities are their squared amplitudes.

Wait, but wait. The operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 when i != j, and 0 otherwise. So as a 2x2 matrix, it's [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix will give the possible outcomes and the corresponding states.

Let's find the eigenvalues of A. The matrix is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0.

So det( [ -λ   ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2  -λ ] ) = 0.

Which is ( -λ )^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 = (ħ/2)^2 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Now, the eigenstates can be found.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I)|v> = 0 → 

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v1]   = 0
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ] [v2]

Which gives equations:

- (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]. But since the eigenvalues are for A, which is (ħ/2) σx, the eigenstates would be the same as σx's eigenstates. The eigenstates of σx are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σx flips the spin states.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me check the signs. Because when λ is positive, the eigenvector would be [1,1], so (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) is correct. Similarly, when λ is negative, the eigenvector is [1,-1], which is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, when I solve for λ = ħ/2, the eigenvector is [1,1]. So it's |up> + |down>, normalized.

So the eigenstate |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the eigenstate |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, the state |alpha> is given as (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

We can express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Let me write that:

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

To find c_+ and c_-, we need the inner products of |alpha> with |+> and |->, respectively.

Wait, or more accurately, c_+ is the inner product < + | alpha >, and c_- is < - | alpha >.

So let's compute c_+.

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
So <+| = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2)

Similarly, <+| alpha> = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) * |alpha> 

Which is ( (1/sqrt(2)) ) [ <up| alpha> + <down| alpha> ]

Compute each part:

<up| alpha> is the coefficient of |up> in |alpha>, which is (1+i)/sqrt(7).

Similarly, <down| alpha> is (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So <+| alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Combine terms inside the brackets:

(1 + i + 2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (3)/sqrt(7)

So c_+ = (3) / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, let's compute c_-.

c_- = < - | alpha> = ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ) |alpha>

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> - <down|alpha> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute the numerator:

(1 + i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = ( (-1 + 2i) ) / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Compute |c_-|^2: numerator is (-1 +2i), so magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5
