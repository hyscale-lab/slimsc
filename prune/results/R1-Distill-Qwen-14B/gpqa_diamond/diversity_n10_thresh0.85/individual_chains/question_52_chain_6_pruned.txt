Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, the problem says there's a star with certain parameters. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, they look at the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. Also, the photosphere is in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds. So, I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, n1 and n2, is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me think about that. When the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So, the temperature of the photosphere without spots is higher (6000 K) than when it has spots (5500 K). So, when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. 

Now, the ratio of n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = E2 - E1. So, the ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). 

Wait, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative because T is in the denominator. So, exp(-x) where x is (ΔE/(kT))... when T is lower, x is larger, so exp(-x) is smaller. That means the ratio n1/n2 would decrease when T decreases. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, that fits because when the spots are present, T is lower, so ratio is lower.

So, the question is asking about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the ratio without spots (T1 =6000 K) divided by the ratio with spots (T2=5500 K). 

Wait, no, wait. Let me rephrase. Let me denote the ratio without spots as R1, and with spots as R2. So, R1 is when T is 6000 K, R2 is when T is 5500 K. The problem
