Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when it's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly.

The given data are: the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Oh, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that affecting the EDTA's ability to chelate. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation here.

Wait, what's the dissociation equation here? I think it's something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Since the complex is stochiometric, the ratio is 1:1. So, the formation constant K is given, which is the equilibrium constant for this reaction.

Formation constant Kf is usually defined as [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}). But wait, what's the exact expression? Sometimes I get confused with the notation. Oh right, the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

Wait, but in this problem, the K given is KCa-EDTA. I think that's the same as Kf. So Kf = 5e10.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, assuming that the solution is at equilibrium, the complex dissociates a little bit into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions.

Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M initially. But, when it dissociates, let's say 'x' amount dissociates. Then, the concentrations would be:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

And the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] would be 0.02 - x. But wait, wait, because the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is x, so in reality, [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 - x. But since K is so large (5e10), which is a huge number, the dissociation x would be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So we can simplify.

So, Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10

So, 0.02 / x² = 5e10

Then, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-6 / 5e10? Wait, no. Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 0.02 / (5e10) = 2
