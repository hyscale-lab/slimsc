Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, what exactly are the symmetries that SMEFT operators must respect?

The question gives four options: Lorentz Symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The options are combinations of these.

Wait a second, Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, right? So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect both separately or is Poincare sufficient?

I think SMEFT is built on Lorentz symmetry because all the operators are written in a way that's Lorentz-invariant. But what about Poincare? Well, I'm not entirely sure, but Poincare includes translations. Since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it probably assumes that the UV completion respects Poincare, but maybe the operators themselves don't have to explicitly include translation symmetry because they are non-renormalizable and might not be Lorentz invariant without it. No, wait, no. Effective operators are Lorentz-invariant, but do they have to respect Poincare? I'm a bit confused here.

Another point: CPT symmetry. I remember that the Standard Model is CPT symmetric, right? So SMEFT, being an effective theory for the SM, should also respect CPT symmetry. Because any operator that violates CPT would be really exotic and not part of the SM. So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT.

CP symmetry is a different story. The SM has CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. For example, there are operators that change the CP properties, so the theory doesn't require operators to have CP symmetry. So point 3, CP symmetry, is not a must.

So looking at the options, which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? From what I gather, Lorentz symmetry (1) must be there because each operator is Lorentz-invariant. Poincare (2), since it's part of the framework, but wait, is Poincare more than Lorentz? Poincare includes translations and Lorentz. So operators in SMEFT are local, so they must respect translations as well, I think. Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory where the UV theory could have broken some symmetries, but the EFT itself must be Poincare-invariant. So both Lorentz and translations are part of Poincare. So if all operators respect Poincare (2), they must also respect Lorentz (1). But the question is, which of the symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a must, then Lorentz is automatically a must. So whether 1 and 2 are both required or just 2 is required.

Alternatively, perhaps SMEFT operators are required to respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily Poincare. Because operators are local, they can be written in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry, but maybe not necessarily the full Poincare. Wait, no, I think that the effective operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory. Because effective theories are formulated in a way that the symmetries of the underlying theory are respected. So the EFT must respect the same symmetries as the UV theory, like Poincare. So operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So if 2 is correct, 1 is automatically correct.

Wait, but the question lists 1 and 2 as separate options. So if 2 is correct, 1 must also be correct. So the options that include both 1 and 2 would have to be considered. Alternatively, maybe in SMEFT, operators are written to respect Lorentz but not necessarily Poincare, but that doesn't make sense because the EFT is meant to capture the low-energy behavior, which should include the same symmetries as the UV theory, which includes Poincare.

Wait, maybe the question is considering whether each operator individually must respect the symmetry. So for example, each operator must be Lorentz-invariant, but not necessarily Poincare-invariant because that's handled by the theory as a whole. Hmm, I'm not too sure about that. But from what I remember, in SMEFT, all operators have to be Lorentz-invariant, but they don't have to be invariant under translations because the EFT can have non-invariant terms handled by the background fields or something else. Or maybe that's not the case. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically respected because the operators are written in a way that's invariant under it. Because each operator is a Lorentz scalar and the theory is Poincare-invariant. So each operator must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, which are parts of Poincare. So if 2 is correct, then 1 is correct as well.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So an operator must be Poincare-invariant, but Poincare includes Lorentz. So 2 implies 1. So if the answer includes 2, it doesn't matter about 1. But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. So if the correct answer requires that operators respect Poincare symmetry, then 2 must be included. But I also recall that the SMEFT is constructed in a way that each operator is a Lorentz scalar, implying that each operator is Lorentz-invariant. So maybe 1 is a must. So whether the answer includes both 1 and 2, or just 2.

Wait, but Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. If an operator is a scalar, it's Lorentz-invariant, but does it necessarily have to be invariant under translations? Well, in the EFT, the operators are written in a way that includes all possible terms, and the theory as a whole is Poincare-invariant, but individual operators may not include all the terms needed for translation invariance. Hmm, maybe it's the other way around. Each operator must be a scalar (so Lorentz-invariant), but the theory's invariance under translations is handled by the presence of all possible terms, not each operator being translation-invariant. So perhaps each operator doesn't have to individually respect translation symmetry, but they must respect Lorentz symmetry.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about which symmetries are part of the Standard Model. The SM respects Lorentz, Poincare, CPT, but not necessarily CP.

Wait, the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory. It's also Poincare-invariant. And it's CPT-invariant. So SMEFT, as an effective theory for the SM, should respect the same symmetries. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3) because CP can be violated in the SM.

Wait, but the question is about the symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So if the theory must respect a certain symmetry, then all operators must respect it. Because if any operator violates a symmetry, the whole theory would.

So, for example, if an operator violates Lorentz symmetry, the theory isn't Lorentz-invariant, which would be a problem because the SM is Lorentz-invariant. So all SMEFT operators must be Lorentz-invariant. Similarly, all operators must be CPT-invariant because the SM is CPT-invariant.

Wait, but what about Poincare symmetry? Since the SM is Poincare-invariant, then SMEFT must also respect that. So each operator must be part of a Poincare-invariant theory. But do individual operators have to be Poincare-invariant, or is it that the sum of all terms is?

Hmm, maybe each operator must be Poincare-invariant. Because if you have an operator that isn't, then you'd have a non-invariant term in the Lagrangian, which would break the symmetry. So each operator must be Poincare-invariant.

So from that, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the options would include 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4, which would be the correct choice. But wait, I thought about whether 2 implies 1. So if 2 is correct, then 1 is automatically correct. So in the answer, if 2 is included, 1 is included as well.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So if the correct answer includes 1,2,4, it's option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that operators in SMEFT might not have to individually respect Poincare symmetry, but the theory as a whole does. Or is that incorrect?

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT is formulated such that each operator is a Lorentz scalar, but not necessarily a Poincare scalar. Because Poincare includes translations. So each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz, but not necessarily under translations, but wait, no, because the effective theory includes all possible terms that are allowed by the symmetries. So I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, another approach: the question is about which symmetries must be 'respected' by all operators. So each operator must be invariant under those symmetries.

If an operator is not invariant under Lorentz symmetry, then the theory isn't Lorentz-invariant. So SMEFT requires that all operators are Lorentz-invariant. Similarly, if operators are not Poincare-invariant, the theory isn't. So each operator must respect Poincare. Which includes Lorentz and translations.

So the correct answer would be that all operators must respect 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare), plus 4 (CPT) but not 3 (CP).

Wait, but wait. The question is a bit ambiguous. It says "must be respected by all operators." So which symmetries are operators required to have?

So for Poincare symmetry, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. Because if any operator isn't, then the entire Lagrangian would not be Poincare-invariant. So yes, each operator must respect Poincare. Which includes Lorentz.

So 2 is correct, thus 1 is automatically correct. Also, CPT symmetry must be respected, because if any operator violates CPT, the theory would too. But wait, the SM respects CPT, so SMEFT must as well. So all operators must be CPT-invariant.

So the required symmetries are 1,2,4. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I thought that in SMEFT, each operator is a Lorentz scalar, but not necessarily a Poincare scalar. Because the Poincare symmetry includes translations. But each operator is a scalar under Lorentz, but not necessarily under translations. Because the EFT includes terms of different orders, and the translations would be part of the symmetry of the full theory, not individual operators.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Each term in the Lagrangian must be translation-invariant, because the action is a functional of the fields and must be invariant under spacetime translations. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare, including translations. So each operator is a scalar under Poincare, which requires both Lorentz and translations.

So if 2 is correct, then 1 is included. So the answer would include 1,2,4.

So the correct option is C: 1,2,4.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators must respect certain symmetries that are consistent with the Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for the theory to be consistent with the SM, which is Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT must also respect it. This implies that all operators in SMEFT must be Poincaré-invariant. If Poincaré symmetry is respected, Lorentz symmetry is automatically included.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM allows for CP violation, as seen in phenomena like the CKM matrix. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry. Some operators in SMEFT explicitly violate CP.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT-invariant, and SMEFT, as an effective theory of the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT that violates CPT would be inconsistent with the SM.

From this analysis:
- Poincaré symmetry (2) implies Lorentz symmetry (1), so if Poincaré is required, Lorentz is automatically required.
- CPT symmetry (4) must also be respected.
- CP symmetry (3) is not required, as the SM allows for CP violation.

Thus, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
