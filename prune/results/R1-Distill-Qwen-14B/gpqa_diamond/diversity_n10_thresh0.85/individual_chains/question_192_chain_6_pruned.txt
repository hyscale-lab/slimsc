Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The setup is a spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small cavity inside it. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. They placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. Now, I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

So, point P is outside, at a distance L from the conductor's center. Oh wait, but the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both L and l are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. 

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, any internal charges will influence the charges on the conductor's surfaces. Oh right, when you have a charge inside a conductor, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, wait. The conductor is initially uncharged. When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the cavity is within the conductor. So, the conductor's inner surface must develop an induced charge. Because the conductor is neutral, the inner surface will have a charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q, right? Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q. But wait, no, wait. Wait, noâ€”if the conductor is initially neutral and then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor as a whole remains neutral (because the original conductor was uncharged), the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner is -q, the outer must compensate to keep the total at zero. Wait, no, wait. No, the conductor is neutral, so the sum of the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must be zero. The inner surface is -q (from the induced charge by +q), so the outer must be +q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, but the inner and outer can have charges adding to zero. Wait, no, wait. The conductor's charge is zero, so the total charge on it is the sum of inner
