Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and think about what I remember from my studies.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. So I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So for Co(II), the complexes would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, where n is the number of SCN- ions attached.

Wait, the complexes here are probably [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, right? Because each SCN- contributes a -1 charge, and Co is +2. So for each n, the charge of the complex would be 2 - n.

So the four complexes have n=1 to 4. And their β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait a second, that seems a bit odd because β3 is higher than β2. So the most stable complex is the [Co(SCN)_3]^- with β=63.

But wait, what's the question again? It asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions, so that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, right? So we're looking for the fraction of Co that's in the form with two SCN- ligands.

So the approach here is to calculate the fraction of each complex species present in solution. To do that, I think we need to use the formation constants and the concentrations to find the distribution of each species.

I recall that the fraction (f_n) of each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n * [Co] * [SCN]^n) / Σ(β_i * [Co] * [SCN]^i) for i=1 to 4.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the β values are for each step. So the overall formation constant for each complex is different. Let me think: for each complex, the formation constant is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point.

Wait, no, stability constants can be given for the overall complex. Oh, wait no, the β values here are the cumulative stability constants for each complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , β4 for [Co(SCN)_
