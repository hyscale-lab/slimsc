Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it through carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Let's note down the given information.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Its mass is also 1.5 times larger, so M1 = 1.5 M2. But wait, the problem is about luminosity, not mass, so maybe the mass part is a red herring or perhaps it's relevant for something else, like maybe the velocity or something else in the problem.

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmmm. I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature.

So if both stars have the same λ_max, that implies their temperatures are the same. Because T would be inversely proportional to λ_max. So T1 = T2.

Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us much, while Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh, right! So the observed wavelength is shifted because of the star's movement. Since Star_2 is moving, the observed wavelength might change. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, but wait—does this refer to their actual emission peaks or the observed wavelengths?

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Because if a star is moving, the wavelengths we observe are Doppler-shifted. So the actual emitted wavelength (λ_emit) is different from the observed wavelength (λ_obs). But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So for us, observers, the peak wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Star_1's radial velocity is zero, so its observed wavelength is the same as the emitted. So λ_obs1 = λ_emit1. For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, we have to calculate the Doppler shift.

But wait, what's the direction of the radial velocity
