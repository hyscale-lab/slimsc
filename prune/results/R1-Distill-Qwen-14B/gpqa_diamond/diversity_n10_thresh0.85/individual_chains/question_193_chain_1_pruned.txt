Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is inversely related to distance, right? So parallax (plx) is 1 over distance (r), because the closer something is, the larger its parallax.

The problem states that the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx^5). But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in would make it N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that.

Wait, (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Hmm, but wait, that might not be the whole story. Because the number of stars in a region also depends on the volume, since more distant regions have larger volumes. Oh wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps I need to think about the differential number of stars.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of density. Because the number of stars per unit volume in a region depends on density. But here, the variation is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is N ∝ r^5. But wait, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r would be the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell.

Wait, let's clarify. If the number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5, then N = k * r^5, where k is a constant. But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit distance. So if you have a small change in distance dr, how does the number of stars change? Or perhaps, it's about the number per unit distance.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Because plx is inversely proportional to r, so N ∝ r^5. So for a given region at distance r, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But how does the number change as you move along the distance?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the differential number of stars. Like, the number of stars per unit distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit distance is dN/dr. Let me compute that.

dN/dr would be the derivative of (r^5) which is 5*r^4. So dN/dr ∝ r^4. But wait, the options don't have 5, but the exponent is 4. So looking at the options, C is r^4. But wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a given volume depends on r^5. But the number of stars per unit volume would then be N/V ∝ r^5 / V. But the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3, so V ∝ r^3. So N/V ∝ r^5 / r^3 = r^2. So the number density (stars per unit volume) would increase as r^2. But that's the number density.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with
