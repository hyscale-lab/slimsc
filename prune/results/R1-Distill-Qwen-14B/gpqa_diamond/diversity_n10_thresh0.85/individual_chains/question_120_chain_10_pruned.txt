Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, they're spread out evenly in all directions, right? And the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/distance. That means as parallax increases, the distance decreases. So closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The problem is asking about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So like, if I have a range from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there? But since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, their density is the same everywhere, right? Wait, no, no, if they are uniformly distributed, their number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on that volume.

But wait, what's the relation between parallax and volume? Let me think. The parallax is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So higher plx means closer, smaller d. How does the volume depend on distance? Volume up to distance d is (4/3)πd³. But since d is 1/plx, the volume becomes proportional to (1/plx)^3. So, if I have a shell between d and d+dd, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, the volume in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 (dplx). So the number of stars in a shell would be the number density (n) times the volume.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax range. So imagine we have a range from plx to plx + dplx. The number of stars in this range depends on the volume corresponding to that range. Let me break it down.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (dd). Since d = 1/plx, substituting that in, the surface area becomes 4π (
