Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The problem states that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (ν + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I'm trying to parse that. Oh, maybe it's written as L = -λ ψ_f† X ψ_f multiplied by (ν + X), but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, no, probably it's written as L = -λ f ψ_f† X ψ_f (ν + X). Hmm, but I think the key point is that the boson X couples to fermion ψ_f with some coupling strength.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, kinematical allowance depends on the rest mass of the boson. For a decay to be possible, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. So, X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

So, first, I need to find all the fermion pairs where each fermion has a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV). Because each fermion in the pair contributes mass, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

Let me list the known fermion masses. Well, the standard model fermions:

- Electron (e⁻): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ⁻): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ⁻): ~1.777 GeV
- Up (u): about 0.003 GeV (but sometimes considered as around 2-5 MeV, so way below 3 GeV)
- Down (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

Wait, so for each fermion, we need to check if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

Let me list each fermion and see.

Electron: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV → okay.
Muon: 2 * 0.105 = 0.21 GeV → okay.
Tau: 2 * 1.777 = 3.554 GeV → wait, that's more than 6 GeV? No, wait, 1.777*2 is 3.55
