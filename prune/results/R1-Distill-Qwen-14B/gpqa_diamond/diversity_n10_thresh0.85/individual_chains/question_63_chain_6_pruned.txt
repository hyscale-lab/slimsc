Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They mention the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the same as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D, each with different momentum values.

Hmm, I remember that for diatomic molecules, especially in the quantum mechanical models, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so I guess that's the first vibrational level and the lowest rotational level.

Wait, the question says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy'. So the molecule would move to the next higher state. But wait, does it mean increasing either the vibrational or rotational quantum number?

I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotation and vibration. So the next state might involve a combination of these. But the problem says 'lowest possible energy', which makes me think that we're only promoting the vibrational state because increasing the vibrational state would require more energy than rotational? Or maybe the other way around?

Wait, no, I think the vibrational energy levels are higher in spacing than rotational ones. So the fundamental state is the first vibrational level (n=0) and the lowest rotational (J=0). The next state would be the next energy level, which could be either n=0, J=1 or n=1, J=0 or something else.

But wait, the question is about the photon causing a transition to the next state with the lowest energy. To find the minimum possible energy, it's probably the next allowed state, but I'm a bit confused on how that works. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from the fundamental state to the next vibrational state only, ignoring rotation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy levels. The total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational. The fundamental state is the lowest, which is n=0, J=0. The next state could be n=0, J=1 (first rotational state) or n=1, J=0 (first vibrational state). Which of these has a lower energy?

So the vibrational energy levels are given by E Vibrational = (n + 1/2) h w. The rotational energy is E Rotational = B (J (J+1)), where B is some rotational constant. The value of B is (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I c), where I is the moment of inertia.

But without knowing B, maybe I can compare the energy differences. Let's compute the energy needed for each transition.

Wait, but the photon must have enough energy to cause the transition. The energy of the photon would be equal to the difference between the two states. So the question is, what transition will require the least energy? Because the problem asks for the photon to cause the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, implying the smallest possible photon energy.

Hmm, but the question is about the momentum of the photon, not the energy. The energy of a photon is E = pc, since for photons, E = hf = pc (where f is frequency, h Planck's constant, p momentum, c speed of light).

So the photon's energy is E_photon = p_photon * c.

So to find p_photon, I need E_photon. But E_photon is the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. That must be the lowest energy state, which is n=0, J=0. The next possible states would be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. So the energy required for each transition would be:

1. From n=0, J=0 to n=0, J=1: Delta E = E_rotational(J=1) - E_rotational(J=0).
2. From n=0, J=0 to n=1, J=0: Delta E = E_vibrational(n=1) - E_vibrational(n=0).

Which of these two transitions is lower in energy? Let's calculate both.

First, E_vibrational for n=0 is (0 + 1/2) h w = (1/2) h w. For n=1, it's (1 + 1/2) h w = (3/2) h w. So the difference is (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w.

For E_rotational: E_rot(J) = B J (J+1). At J=0, it's 0. At J=1, E is B*(1)(2) = 2B. So the difference is 2B - 0 = 2B.

Now, we need to see which
