Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These infinities can mess up the calculations, so regularization helps to make them finite and manageable, usually by introducing a cutoff or some other method.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory deals with strings as the fundamental building blocks instead of point particles. Strings are one-dimensional objects. String theory incorporates supersymmetry, which pairs bosons with fermions. Because strings have a higher dimensionality (like in M-theory, which has 11 dimensions), maybe this helps in avoiding some of the divergences. I think string theories are finite because they don't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. Or wait, maybe they do in certain limits? I'm not entirely sure, but I think superstring theories are free from the need for regularization because they're background-independent and more consistent, leading to finite results.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a SU(3) gauge theory with gluons and quarks. I know that QCD calculations can lead to divergences, especially in loop diagrams. For example, when calculating things like beta functions or running coupling constants, you have to regularize. Plus, things like renormalization group equations are used, which are related to dealing with divergences. So QCD definitely requires regularization techniques.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. I remember learning that QED has some infinities, like the self-energy of the electron and the vacuum polarization. These lead to issues like the charge screening problem. Because of this, you need to use regularization methods, such as introducing a cutoff or using dimensional regularization. So QED requires regularization, but it's renormalizableâ€”meaning that after renormalization, the infinities cancel out, and you get finite results. But the process still involves regularization steps.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the Maxwell's theory, which describes electric and magnetic fields without quantum mechanics. Since it's classical, there are no quantum divergences. You don't have loop diagrams or virtual particles, so regularization isn't needed. Maxwell's equations are well-behaved in the classical sense, so this theory doesn't require any regularization.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So, looking back: QCD and QED do require regularization because they are quantum field theories. Superstring theory, as I thought earlier, might not require it because it's a theory that's supposed to be finite. But wait, string theory does have some regularization steps in certain contexts, like when dealing with worldsheet divergences or in certain quantization procedures. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, thinking again: some theories are free (non-interacting) and don't require regularization. But the options are all interacting theories except perhaps classical E&M.

Wait, classical electrodynamics is a classical theory, so it doesn't have the same divergences as quantum theories. For example, in classical E&M, point charges lead to issues with their fields at the location of the charge (like the infinite electric field), but that's more of a mathematical problem, not requiring regularization in the same sense as quantum field theories. So in the context of regularization in the quantum sense, classical theories don't require it.

So the question is about which quantum theory doesn't require regularization. Wait, no: the question is which theory never requires regularization. So all the options except D are quantum theories. So the only theory that doesn't require regularization is the classical one.

Wait, but the question is phrased: "which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?"

So high energies might refer to the behavior of the theory. For instance, quantum theories might have issues at high energies (like the cutoff in QFT), but a theory that is finite at all energies
