Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a little stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Compound X has specific IR and NMR data, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options A to D.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, probably indicating O-H or maybe N-H stretches. But since the compound is reacting with HI, I'm thinking maybe it's an acid or an ester or something with a carbonyl.

The other IR peaks are at 1720 cm-1 and 1610 cm-1. 1720 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H peak in IR around 2500–3000, but here the 3400–2500 is a broad range, not sure if it's O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Then the 1610 cm-1 could be an aromatic ring, maybe C=C stretching. The 1450 cm-1 is a bit lower, maybe C-O stretching or something else. Hmm.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's probably an aldehyde proton, since aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Or wait, could it be a carboxylic acid proton? But those are usually broad and around 10-12. But wait, the integration is 1H, which matches either an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carbonyl group, maybe it's an aldehyde. But let's see the other peaks.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. Probably part of an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted. If it's para, two doublets would make sense.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, again suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the aromatic region has two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the aromatic ring is probably 1,4-disubstituted.

Then the next peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, one proton. That could be a CH adjacent to something. Maybe a CH connected to a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, multiplet. Maybe another CH2 group, perhaps part of a chain attached to the ring.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet? Wait, the description says 'd' for doublet. So a doublet of 3H. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, a doublet would be two peaks. 1.4 ppm is a common shift for a methyl group attached to something, maybe a carbonyl or an oxygen. But wait, maybe it's a CH3 connected to a CH2, like in an ethyl group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a methyl group at the end of a chain, like a CH2CH2CH3. So a terminal methyl, suggests an ethyl or propyl chain.

Putting this together, the aromatic part is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, probably para-substituted. The substituents are likely a group with a carbonyl and another group which is an alkyl chain.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton. So if there's an aldehyde group attached to the benzene ring, that would make sense. Then, the aldehyde would have that peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but that doesn't have a proton. Another possibility is a carboxylic acid, but that would have a broad peak around 10-12, but maybe 10.5 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps it's an ester, but esters don't have an aldehyde proton.

Wait, perhaps it's a ketone. But then where's the carbonyl in the IR? 1720 cm-1 is more like an ester or aldehyde. Wait, aldehydes have strong absorption around 1700-1750. So maybe it's an ester, which has a carbonyl at around 1720. Or maybe a ketone? Wait, no, a ketone's carbonyl is around 1715 cm-1, which is close to 1720. So perhaps a ketone.

Alternatively, if the IR has a 1720 peak, maybe it's an ester. Let's think: compound X has an aromatic ring with substituents, and a carbonyl group.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, so perhaps an aldehyde. Let's say the structure is benzaldehyde with some substituents. But wait, the aldehyde would have that 10 ppm peak, and the rest of the peaks would be from the substituents.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene ring: the two doublets in the aromatic region suggest that the substituents are in para positions. So perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an aldehyde group (-CHO), and the other is some alkyl group.

But wait, the substituents can't both be on the same carbon. So it's more likely that the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group (like an ester or ketone), and the other is an alkyl group.

Wait, let me try to sketch this out. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like -CO-R), and the other is an alkyl group, perhaps with a branching.

Looking at the NMR downfield, the 10.5 ppm is the proton from the aldehyde. So if the structure is p-xylene with an aldehyde group, but that doesn't fit the other signals.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is directly attached to the ring, and there's another substituent that's an iso-butyl group or something.

Wait, looking at the other NMR peaks. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl. Then, 1.7 (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to CH. 1.4 (d, 3H) – wait, a doublet for 3H. That's a bit confusing because a methyl group would typically be a triplet or a singlet. Maybe it's attached to something else, like a CH(CH3) group. Wait, maybe a geminal group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with a sec-butyl group attached in the para position. Let me think, if the ring has a -CHO and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR signals again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely a CH that's connected to something else, maybe a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl chain attached to the ring. Let me think: -CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, but the 0.9 (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl. So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached.

Wait, let me consider the options
