Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So, first, I should probably write down what Ay looks like.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So I need to find the eigenvalues 'a' and the corresponding eigenvectors φ.

Wait, okay. Let me write out the matrix S first. S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So, then, Ay is c times S. Since c is h/(4π), that's a scalar. So multiplying each element by c gives Ay:
Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I is:
[ -a    (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))  -a ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h^2/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that term. (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i * i is i squared, which is -1, so negative i times i is +1.

So the determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) * (1) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute, because the matrix S is a 2x2 matrix, and possibly related to spin matrices. Oh, because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and this looks similar. Let me think: The Pauli sigma_y matrix is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] exactly as S. So S is σ_y.

So the eigenvalues of S (σ_y) are ±1. Because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1. So when you scale the matrix by c, the eigenvalues scale by the same factor.

So Ay = c * S, so the eigenvalues a will be c * (±1) → ± c → ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Because S has eigenvalues ±1, but when you multiply the matrix by a scalar, the eigenvalues get multiplied by that scalar. So Ay's eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * (±1), so a = ± h/(4π).

So the possible eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the real parts are either
