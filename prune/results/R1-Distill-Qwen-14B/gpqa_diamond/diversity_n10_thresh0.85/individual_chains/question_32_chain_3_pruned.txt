Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c? X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. The options are A to D, all in GeV.

Hmm, wait, Lithium with 3 neutrons. Let me think about the structure of Lithium. Lithium usually has an atomic number of 3, so it has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6, right? So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. I'll need its mass to calculate the energy.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with energies and speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use relativistic equations. Since the speed v is 0.96c, that's pretty high, so non-relativistic equations won't work here. I'll need to use the relativistic energy formulas.

The energy of a particle in relativity is given by E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh wait, right, that's the formula.

So first, I should calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c. So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma becomes 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is actually 0.28? Let me compute 0.28 squared: 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. Oh wait, wait, no. 0.28 squared is 0.0784? No, wait, 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. Yeah, that's correct.

So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. But let me get more precise with that. Let me compute 1 / 0.28. Let's see, 0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25. So 1/(7/25) =25/7 ≈ 3.57142857. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c², where m is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Now, I need to find the mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is something I should look up, but since I don't have exact values, I'll need to approximate. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it from the number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, yes. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated by summing the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, considering binding energy. But since the binding energy is usually small compared to the rest mass, maybe I can just use the sum of individual nucleon masses.

Wait, but no, that's not exactly right. The actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. But since we're looking for the rest mass energy, m*c², perhaps I can find the approximate mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the average mass of a nucleon. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3
