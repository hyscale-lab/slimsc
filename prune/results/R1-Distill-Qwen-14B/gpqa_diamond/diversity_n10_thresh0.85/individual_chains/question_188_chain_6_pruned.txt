Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the structure of the crystal, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think through this.

Rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, maybe they're part of the cubic system? Wait, no, rhombohedral is a separate system where all edges are equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the lattice parameters are a, and the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, wait, the question says α=β=γ=30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral lattice with all angles equal to 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter. So that would be 'a' in a cubic system, but since this is rhombohedral, maybe the lattice constant is a, which is 10 Angstroms? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a.

So for a cubic system, the interplanar distance (d_{hkl}) is given by the formula d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l²)), right? But wait, that's for a cubic system with 90-degree angles. But this is a rhombohedral system with angles of 30 degrees. So I think the formula is a bit different.

I remember that in a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is given by 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * (cos α + cos β + cos γ) + ... Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the formula for rhombohedral systems is more complex because the angles affect the distance.

Wait, another approach: For a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = [ a² (h² + k² + l²) - a² (hk + hl + kl) cos α ]^(-1/2) / (sqrt( ... )). Wait, no, perhaps I should refer to the general interplanar distance formula for a crystal lattice.

Oh right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * cos(π - γ) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that for the general case, the interplanar distance is calculated using the reciprocal of the square of the sum of the dot products of the reciprocal lattice vectors. Alternatively, maybe it's better to look up the formula for a rhombohedral system.

Wait, I found in my notes that for a rhombohedral lattice with all edges a and angles α (which are all the same in this case), the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that makes sense because in a cubic system, cos α would be zero (since all angles are 90 degrees), so the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct.

But in this case, α is 30 degrees. So cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2, about 0.866.

So for the (111) plane, h, k, l are all 1. So let's plug in the numbers.

First, calculate the denominator:

h² +k² + l² = 1 + 1 +1 =3.

Then, 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α = 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)*cos(30) = 2*(3)*(sqrt(3
