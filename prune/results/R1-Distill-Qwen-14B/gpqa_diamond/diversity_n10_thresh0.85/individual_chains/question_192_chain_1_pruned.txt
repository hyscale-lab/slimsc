Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to visualize it first. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. 

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and a distance l from the center of the cavity. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. But wait, this is a conductor with a cavity. Oh right, if the conductor is uncharged and there's a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Let's think about that.

When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface will have +q to balance it out. But wait, no, wait. The conductor is initially uncharged. So the total charge is zero. When you place +q inside, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have a charge +q to balance the inner -q. Because conductor as a whole is neutral, but the charge distribution is such that the inner is -q and outer is +q. Wait, no, wait. That might not be right. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces must sum to zero. So when you have +q inside the cavity, the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q, because the conductor's total charge is zero. So the total induced charge on the conductor is zero, which is correct.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would only be due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor, right? Because inside the conductor, the field is zero. But wait, the conductor is a spherical shell, but with a cavity. So the charges on the outer
