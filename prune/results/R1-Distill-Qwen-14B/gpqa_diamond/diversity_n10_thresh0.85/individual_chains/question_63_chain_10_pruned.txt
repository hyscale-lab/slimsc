Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can vibrate and rotate, and their energy levels are quantized. So the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state. 

The given data includes the masses of the atoms: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options for the momentum p are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I guess the molecule is currently in the ground state, which is the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. To move to the next state, it's probably either going to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But in the non-rigid rotor model, how does that work? Maybe the model treats rotation and vibration separately, or perhaps they are coupled? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and transitions between them are possible. But the non-rigid rotor model, I think, considers the bond length as not fixed, maybe allowing for some stretching and hence vibration. So maybe the molecule can have both rotational and vibrational transitions.

Wait, the question is about the fundamental state. The fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the molecule). But in the rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0 for rotation. However, the non-rigid rotor model might combine rotation and vibration. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

The problem mentions that the molecule is in its fundamental state, so I think that means the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So that would be v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But which transition requires less energy? Or perhaps the problem is considering absorbing a photon that causes a transition of either type.

Wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. So the photon's energy is related to its frequency, and the energy difference between the states. The momentum p is related to the photon's energy by E = p^2/(2m), but since for a photon, m=0, that's not directly applicable. Oh wait, no, photons are massless, but their momentum is p = E/c, where E is the energy and c is the speed of light. So the energy of the photon is equal to the energy difference between the two states. So perhaps I should calculate the energy difference between the current state and the next state.

But which transition is it? The problem states "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So that must mean the transition
