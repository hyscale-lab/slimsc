Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. 

First, the setup: We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, titrating that with 0.1 M NaOH. So I think I need to find the concentrations after mixing and during titration.

Wait, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration can be calculated using M1V1 = M2V2. 

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. So the moles of acetic acid are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, the volume is 0.04 L, so M2 = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, right, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001 as calculated earlier. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001, since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O). 

The volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point is moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So for 25%, it's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. 

Wait, but wait, the equivalence point calculation: The initial diluted acetic acid has 0.001 moles, so the volume of NaOH at equivalence is 10 cm³. So 25% titration is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

First part: pH at 25% titration. So, at 25% of the equivalence point, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. 

Let me think about the reaction. The NaOH will react with the acetic acid. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.002
