Okay, so I've got this question here about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance—right, the formula is distance = 1 / parallax (if I'm using parsecs and radians or something like that). Wait, no, wait, the formula is distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

So the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. Let me think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the same number of stars per unit volume. Oh wait, stars are 3D objects, so their distribution in space matters for how we observe them.

Parallax is a measure of distance. So, stars at a certain distance have a certain parallax. But when we look at a range of parallaxes, what does that represent? A range in distance. So if I consider a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a range in distance from d to d + dd, where d is 1/plx and dd is 1/(plx + dplx) or something like that.

Wait, but how does the number of stars in a given parallax range relate to the parallax itself? Let me think about flux or density. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space (so number density n is constant), then the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance r with thickness dr would be 4π r² n dr. Because the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per dr) is proportional to r².

But parallax plx is 1/r. So r = 1/plx. Substituting that in, the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to (1/plx)^2. But wait, we're looking for the number per unit change in parallax. So we need to relate dr to dplx.

Let me write down the relation between r and plx. Since plx = 1/r, then dr = - (1/r²) dplx. Because differentiating plx = 1/r gives dplx = -1/r² dr. So dr = - r² dplx. Since r is positive, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases.

So the
