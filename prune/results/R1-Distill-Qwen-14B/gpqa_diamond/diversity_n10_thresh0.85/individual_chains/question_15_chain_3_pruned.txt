Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Let me try to think through this step by step.

So, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which might be important because eccentric orbits could affect transit probability, but since they're both circular, that's not a factor here.

Also, the host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they match in size. But the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The bigger the star, the less likely the planet is to pass in front from our line of sight, but wait, no, actually, the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_orbital)^2, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, no. Let me think. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. For a circular orbit, the probability is roughly (R_star / a)^2, but wait, actually, the formula I remember is (R_star / a) squared times some other factors, or maybe it's (R_star / a) without the square? Hmm.

Wait, I think the transit probability P is approximately (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that simplifies to (R_star / a). So the probability is proportional to R_star divided by the orbital distance a.

Wait, but wait, no. I think the actual formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, R_planet can be neglected, so P ≈ R_star / a.

But wait, another source I recall says that the probability
