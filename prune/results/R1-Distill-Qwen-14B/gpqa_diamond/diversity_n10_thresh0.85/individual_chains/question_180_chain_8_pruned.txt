Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmmm, let's see. The setup is that there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. The options are given, so I guess I have to calculate it and pick the right one.

Wait, so all the particles have the same charge, right? 2e each. So each has twice the elementary charge. So e is 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so 2e would be about 3.204e-19 C.

The system is isolated, so I don't have to worry about external fields, I think. The potential energy here would be due to the charges interacting with each other.

So the 13th charge is fixed at point P. Let's call that charge Q. The other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from Q. But wait, what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Because they can move, but are constrained at 2m from P. So their positions are all on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. But since the system is isolated, the potential energy will be the sum of all the interactionsâ€”Q with each of the 12, and the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So they can't move closer to each other, but wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because each is at 2m from P, but they can be arranged in any position on that sphere. So their mutual distances can vary. But wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy. Hmm.

So to minimize the potential energy, I have to arrange the charges such that the potential energy is minimized. Because same charges repel, so to minimize the energy, they would arrange themselves as far apart as possible. In a system of identical charges on a sphere, the most stable configuration (minimum potential energy) is when they are equally spaced on the surface, like the vertices of a regular polyhedron. But for 12 charges, that's a bit tricky. Wait, no, the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m. So the minimum potential energy would be when the system is as stable as possible, which is when the 12 are equally spaced. But perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the potential energy due to each pair.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what contributes to the potential energy.

The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So for each charge, I need to calculate the potential energy from all other charges.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, so the distance between Q and each of the 12 is 2m. So each of those 12 charges contributes a potential energy term with Q.

Additionally, the 12 charges themselves are each at 2m from P, but their mutual distances vary depending on their arrangement. However, the problem says the system is isolated, so maybe the potential energy calculation includes all pairs. But since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, I think I need to compute the interactions between the 12 charges as well.

But wait, how? Because without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to compute the exact potential energy. So maybe the problem is simplifying it by considering only the interactions between the 12 and the 13th charge, not their mutual interactions. Because if not, the problem would have given more information about their arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions between the 12 can be considered negligible, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the way to minimize the potential energy is to have the 12 charges as far apart as possible. But for that, you arrange them in a way that each is as far as possible from the others, which would be the most stable configuration. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the fixed charge Q.

Wait, that might not be the case. Because the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges would depend on their arrangement. But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual energy is zero or that it's not to be considered. No, that doesn't make sense. Because the 12 charges are all at the same distance from Q, but their mutual distances vary, but the problem states they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps their mutual distances are all determined by their positions on that sphere, but without specific positions, it's impossible to compute exactly.

Wait, but the question gives me options, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the 13th charge, not their mutual interactions. Because that would make the calculation straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not between the 12 themselves. Let's see.

So let's proceed under that assumption. Let me calculate the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the 12 charges.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance r = 2 meters from Q. Since all 12 charges are identical and same as Q, each contributes an amount of potential energy.

Wait, but wait: Q is fixed at P, and each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So the potential energy between Q and each of the 12 is (2e)*(2
