Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars varies with distance based on their parallax. The given relationship is that the number of stars varies as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So, plx = 1/(distance in parsecs), I think. So if distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem says N varies with 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Substituting plx with 1/d, because plx = 1/d. Wait, no, plx is inversely proportional. So plx = 1/d, so 1/plx would be d. Let me write that down:

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → substituting plx = 1/d → 1/( (1/d) )^5 = (d)^5 → N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait a second. That would mean N is proportional to d^5. But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, so they're asking about the differential number of stars, like the number per unit distance.

Hmm, I think I need to consider how N changes as a function of r (distance). So let's model N as a function. N(r) = k * (r)^5? Because from the substitution, N is proportional to d^5, which is r^5 since r is the same as d.

Wait, but wait. No, the number of stars should be a cumulative quantity. Wait, the problem says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So maybe the number of stars within a certain distance r? Or the number per unit volume?

Wait, I'm confused. Let me think again. The number of stars as a function of parallax is given. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So, if plx is small (which means large distance), 1/plx is large, so N increases.

But how does the number of stars change with distance? Let's model this. Let's say we have a region of
