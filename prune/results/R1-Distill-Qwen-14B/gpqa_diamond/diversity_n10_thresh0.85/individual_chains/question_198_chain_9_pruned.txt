Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, so I'm a bit confused to start with. What do these stability constants mean? Oh right, stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it requires a higher concentration of products to dissociate.

Wait, but the problem is referring to different complexes. I think the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), where n is the number of SCN- ions attached. The different β values correspond to the different n values. Let me see: β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. But wait, the problem gives four β values, so perhaps the complexes have up to four SCN- ions?

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me clarify: The stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So, for each complex, the formation constant would be as follows:

- Co(SCN)^2+ → β1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])
- Co(SCN)2^2+ → β2 = [Co(SCN)2]^0 / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)
- Co(SCN)3^+ → β3 = [Co(SCN)3]^- / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3)
- Co(SCN)4^2- → β4 = [Co(SCN)4]^2- / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)

Wait, but then what about the complexes? Each higher β would correspond to a more stable complex. So, the most stable would be the one with β4=16? Wait, but wait, β3 is 63, which is higher than β4, so the third complex is more stable than the fourth? That seems a bit odd because typically, higher n (more ligands) would lead to higher stability, but maybe not always.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ions, right? Because di- means two. So that's the n=2 complex. So the question is about the fraction of Co(SCN)2^2+ in the solution.

So the problem is to determine the fraction (or percentage) of the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex relative to all possible Co species.

But wait, how do I approach this? I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then sum them up, then find the percentage for the dithiocyanato complex.

The general approach for such problems is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants (β) and the concentrations of Co and SCN-.

But wait, the problem gives the total cobalt concentration as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So, the sum of the concentrations of all Co species (Co^2+, Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3^-, Co(SCN)4^2-) must equal 1e-2 M.

The SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is quite high. So, the complexes are formed in a stepwise manner, and the higher-order complexes may form more.

But the key is to find the fraction of each complex. So, perhaps we can model the distribution of Co species using the given β values and the concentrations of Co and SCN.

Wait, but what's the exact method for this? I remember something about using the stability constants and the concentrations to calculate the fraction of each species.

Another approach is to consider the formation of each complex in sequence. The first complex (n=1) forms with β1, then the second with β2, and so on. So, each subsequent β is for the next complex formation.

But the problem is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 species. So, perhaps we need to calculate the fraction of the n=2 complex relative to all possible complexes.

Wait, but to calculate the fractions, perhaps we can use the concept of the fraction of each species in solution, given the β values and the concentrations of Co and SCN.

Let me think about the general approach. For a metal ion M and ligand L, the fraction of each complex can be determined by considering the stepwise formation constants and the concentrations.

The fraction of each complex (f_n) can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n * [ML_n]) / ( [M] + sum over all f_n * [ML_n] )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, I think the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula that involves the product of the formation constants up to that species, multiplied by the respective concentrations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the distribution using the cumulative formation constants.

Wait, another approach is to model the distribution of the species using the conditional formation constant.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me recall the formula for the fraction of each species.

Each step of complex formation is governed by the formation constant. For example:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)^2+ , with β1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])

Co(SCN)^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)2^2+, with β2 = [Co(SCN)2]^0 / ([Co(SCN)]+ [SCN^-])

Similarly for the other steps.

But considering all four steps, it's a bit involved because each step depends on the prior.

Alternatively, the overall formation constant for the fourth complex would be β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = [Co(SCN)4]^2- / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )

But wait, perhaps it's better to consider the stepwise formation, but also the concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction can be found by considering the relative contributions of each complex based on their formation constants and the ligand concentration.

Wait, maybe we can model the situation using the equation for the distribution of metal complexes.

The general formula for the fraction of the nth complex (fn) is given by:

fn = (βn * [L]^n) / ( [M] + sum_{i=1}^n βi [L]^i / βn ) )

Wait, not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, the fraction of each species can be determined using the following approach.

The fraction of Co in the nth complex is:

fn = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / ( [Co^2+] + sum_{k=1}^n (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN^-]^k ) )

But wait, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think.

Another method involves starting with the total concentration of Co, which is the sum of all species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)2^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]

And the SCN^- concentration is given by:

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M = [free SCN^-] + [CoSCN+] + 2[Co(SCN)2^0] + 3[Co(SCN)3^-] +4[Co(SCN)4^2-]

But solving this system of equations seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

I remember that when the ligand concentration is much higher than the metal concentration, the higher-order complexes can be significant. In this case, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M and c(Co) is 1e-2 M, so [SCN^-] >> [Co]. So, the higher-order complexes might be more populated.

But let's proceed step by step. Let me denote:

Let x = [Co^2+]

The formation of each complex can be represented as:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 x (0.1) 

[Co(SCN)2]^0 = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 

Wait, no. Wait, each step has its own formation constant. The first complex is formed with β1: [CoSCN^+] = β1 x * [SCN^-]

The second complex is formed from the first by adding another SCN^-: [Co(SCN)2^0] = β2 [CoSCN^+][SCN^-] = β2 (β1 x [SCN^-}) [SCN^-] ) = β1 β2 x (SCN^-)^2

Similarly, the third complex is [Co(SCN)3^-] = β3 [Co(SCN)2^0][SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 x (SCN^-)^3

And the fourth is [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 [Co(SCN)3^-][SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x (SCN^-)^4

So, the concentrations of the complexes are:

n = 1: β1 x [L]

n = 2: β1 β2 x [L]^2

n = 3: β1 β2 β3 x [L]^3

n =4: β1 β2 β3 β4 x [L]^4

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, the overall formation constant for the fourth complex would be β1*β2*β3*β4 = 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. So, K4=362880.

But wait, each β is a stepwise constant, so the overall constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn. So, the formation constants for each complex are:

K1 = β1 =9

K2 = β1 β2 =9*40=360

K3 = β1 β2 β3= 360 *63= 22680

K4=β1 β2 β3 β4 = 22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but that might not be correct, because each β is for the next step. So, perhaps K_n = product of β1 to βn.

Wait, but no. Let me think. The first complex CoSCN^+ has β1. Then, to form the second complex, you add another SCN^- and multiply by β2. So, the total formation constant for the second complex would be β1 * β2. Similarly for the third and fourth.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the stability constants are given as four separate β's. So, perhaps each β is the formation constant for adding one more ligand. So, the formation constants for the complexes are:

K1 = β1 =9

K2 = β1 * β2 = 9*40=360

K3 = β1*β2*β3=360*63=22680

K4=β1*β2*β3*β4=22680*16=362880.

But wait, the problem says "stability constants", which are typically the overall constants for each complex. So perhaps each β is the overall constant for the nth complex.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So, if β1 is the stability constant for the first complex (monodentate), then β2 for the second, etc., then each β is the overall constant for that complex, not stepwise. So, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+ with K1=β1=9.

The second complex is [Co(SCN)2]^0, and K2=β2=40. But wait, that would imply that the formation of the second complex is governed by a different overall constant, not the product of stepwise constants. That would complicate things, because then K2 isn't K1 multiplied by β2.

But I'm not entirely sure, but I think the question is presenting the stepwise formation constants. Because the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16."

Wait, no, if they are presenting all four stability constants, that's four different complexes. So, perhaps each βn is the stability constant (K) for the nth complex, not the stepwise formation. So:

For the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+ → K1=β1=9.

For the second complex, [Co(SCN)2]^0 → K2=β2=40.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second complex would require two ligands, and the K would be the product of the two stepwise β's. So, if K2 is 40, that would imply that β1 * β2 =40. But then the given β1 is 9, so β2 would be approx 4.44, but according to the problem, β2 is 40. So that can't be.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So perhaps the given β's are stepwise formation constants. That is, β1 is the stability constant for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. So:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)2]^0 = β2 [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-] = β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 [Co(SCN)2]^0 [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

And [Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 [Co(SCN)3]^- [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

So the concentrations of the complexes are:

[Co]^2+ = x

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN]^1 = β1 x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)2]^0 = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2

[Co(SCN)3]^- = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 = (9)(40)(63) x (0.1)^3

[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = (9)(40)(63)(16) x (0.1)^4

Wait, but that's a lot of computation. Let's compute each step.

First, compute each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of x.

Let me compute the coefficients:

For n=1: β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 → [CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 x

n=2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 → 9*40=360 → 360 * 0.01=3.6 → [Co(SCN)2]^0 =3.6 x

n=3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 → 9*40=360, 360*63=22680 → 22680 * 0.001=22.68 → [Co(SCN)3]^- =22.68 x

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 → 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880 → 362880*(0.1)^4=362880*0.0001=36.288 → [Co(SCN)4]^2- =36.288 x

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations:

n=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 → [CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 x → correct.

n=2: 9 *40=360; 360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6 → correct.

n=3: 360 *63=22680; 22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68 → correct.

n=4: 22680 *16=362880; 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288 → correct.

So, now, the sum of all the species is the total Co concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

So:

x + 0.9 x + 3.6 x +22.68 x +36.288 x = 1e-2

Let me compute the coefficients:

x(1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) = 1e-2

Compute the sum inside the parentheses:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So, 64.468 x =1e-2 → x= (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1e-2 is 0.01. So 0.01 /64.468 is approximately.

Let me compute 64.468 * 1.55e-4:

Wait, 64.468 * 1.55e-4 = 0.01 (since 64.468 * 1.55e-4 ≈ 0.01 )

So, x ≈ 0.01 / 64.468 = approx 1.551e-4 M.

So, [Co^2+] = x ≈1.551e-4 M.

Now, let's compute the concentrations of each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9 x = 0.9 *1.551e-4 ≈1.396e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)2]^0=3.6 x ≈3.6 *1.551e-4≈5.584e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^- =22.68 x ≈22.68 *1.551e-4≈3.52e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2- =36.288 x ≈36.288 *1.551e-4≈5.628e-3 M.

Wait, let me check each:

n=1: 0.9 *1.551e-4 = 1.3959e-4 ≈1.396e-4.

n=2:3.6 *1.551e-4=5.5836e-4 ≈5.584e-4.

n=3:22.68 *1.551e-4 = 22.68 * 0.0001551. Let me compute 22.68 *0.0001551.

22.68 *0.0001=0.002268.

22.68 *0.0000551= 22.68 *5.51e-5 ≈0.001247.

Wait, wait, maybe it's easier to compute 22.68 *1.551e-4.

1.551e-4 is 0.0001551.

22.68 *0.0001551 = ?

Let me compute 22.68 * 0.0001 = 0.002268.

22.68 * 0.00005 = 0.001134.

22.68 * 0.0000051 = approx 22.68 *0.000005 = 0.0001134. So, 0.0001134 + 0.001134=0.0012474.

So total is 0.002268 + 0.0012474 = 0.003
