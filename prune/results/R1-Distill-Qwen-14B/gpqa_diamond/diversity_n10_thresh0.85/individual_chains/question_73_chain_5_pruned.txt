Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so we've got two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the masses are 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when dealing with velocities in relativity, we can't just subtract them like we do in classical mechanics. Oh right, because velocities don't add linearly at high speeds. So I remember there's a formula for relativistic velocity addition. 

The formula, I think, is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, in this case, both astronauts are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the slower one from the faster one's frame would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²), assuming v1 and v2 are the speeds in the same direction. Or wait, maybe I mixed up the order. Let me clarify. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) right? So that would be (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²). Because 0.5 *0.6 is 0.3, so 0.3c². Dividing by c² gives 0.3. So denominator is 1-0.3=0.7.

So the numerator is (-0.1c) and denominator 0.7. So the relative speed would be (-0.1/0.7)c ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction. But since the question is about relative speed, the magnitude is 0.1428c, approximately 0.14c, which matches one of the options, like option C or D.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the other way around. If the question is about the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other, it depends on who's the reference frame. But since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference, but relativistically corrected. So yeah, I think the calculation is correct.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm. In relativity, the total energy is the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. Each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy.

So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8=1.25. So energy is 1.25 * (2m)c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut 2 (mass 3m,
