Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, so the setup is about a star similar to the Sun. It's got a radius the same as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so they're at 5000K. Because the star is rotating, these spots will come into and go out of view, causing changes in the brightness we observe. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of a star would cause a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: if this star didn't have spots, what radius (relative to the star) would an exoplanet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the light curve? So, we need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to what an exoplanet would cause.

Hmm. Let's break this down. The brightness variation (the change in flux) depends on the area blocking the light and the temperature difference between the star and the blocking object.

First, let's think about the star with spots. When the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, part of the star that's cooler is blocking some of the light. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. Wait, actually, the filling factor is the fraction of the visible surface covered by spots. So for one hemisphere, if the filling factor is 20%, that means 20% of the entire star's surface is spots? Or just the hemisphere? Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so a hemisphere is half the surface. If the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere, that means 10% of the star's total surface is covered in spots. Because 20% of half the surface is 10% of the whole.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think. Filling factor is the fraction of the stellar disk's surface area that is covered by spots, as viewed from Earth. So if one hemisphere is spotty and the filling factor is 20%, that means 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered. So 0.2 * (π R²) for a hemisphere, which is 2π R² (Wait, no, wait. The area of a hemisphere is 2π R², but the filling factor is 20% of that. So the area covered is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The star is a sphere, so the total surface area is 4π R². The hemisphere area is 2π R². If the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

But wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun. So R = R_sun.

Now, the star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are cooler, 5000K.

When the spots are facing us, the flux from the star is less because those spots are emitting less. The variation in brightness (the amplitude) is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when the spots are in view.

The total flux from the star without any spots is F_total = σ Teff^4 * 4π R², but wait, no. The flux from a star is usually given by F = σ Teff^4 * (R^2) / d², but when considering the star's disk, we can think in terms of the surface brightness. The surface brightness (flux per unit area) is F = σ Teff^4. So the total flux is F = F_surface * (π R²), since the area we see is a disk of area π R²? Wait, no. Wait, when considering flux from a star, it's the sum of all the surface elements' contributions. Each surface element emits with F = σ T^4. So the total flux is (number of surface elements) times F. But a star's surface is a sphere, so when you observe it, you see a disk.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the star's flux when spots are present and when they're not. Without any spots, the flux is F0 = σ Teff^4 * π R². Because the area we see is π R² (the disk), and each unit area emits σ T^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux drops. The spots have a lower temperature, so each spot emits less. The total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 - (F_spot), where F_spot is the flux lost due to the spots.

The area of the spots is A_spot = 0.2 * 2π R²? Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. The hemisphere is half the star's surface, so area is 2π R². So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R², so a hemisphere's area would be 2π R² (front and back each have 2π R²). So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Each spot emits with a lower surface brightness. So the flux from the spots is F_spot = (0.4 π R²) * σ (T_spot)^4.

Therefore, the change in flux (ΔF) when the spots are visible is F0 - F = F0 - (F0 - F_spot) = F_spot = 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

But wait, F0 is the total flux without any spots. F0 = π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the change in flux is ΔF = F_spot = 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

But wait, the area of the spots is 0.4 π R², so the flux that's missing is 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

Wait a second, but the star's total flux is F0 = π R² σ (6000)^4. So when the spots are covering part of the disk, the observed flux is F = F0 - (0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (6000)^4 ) ?

Wait, maybe not. Wait, no, because the spots are cooler. So the flux when spots are in view is F = F0 - (F_spot), where F_spot is the area of the spots times their surface brightness.

Wait, no, F_spot is the total flux from the spots. But because the spots are cooler, their flux is less than what the surrounding would emit. So the total flux when spots are visible is F = F0 - (F_spot_regular - F_spot_cool), where F_spot_regular is the flux the spots would have emitted if they were at Teff, and F_spot_cool is what they actually emit. So the difference is the loss in flux.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute the total flux when the spots are present. The total flux would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted area plus the flux from the spotted area.

Unspotted area is the area of the disk not covered by spots. The disk area is π R². The area covered by spots is 0.4 π R². So unspotted area is π R² - 0.4 π R² = 0.6 π R².

Flux from unspotted area: 0.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Flux from spotted area: 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

Total flux F = [0.6 (6000)^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ] * σ π R².

Without spots, F0 = (6000)^4 σ π R².

So the change in flux when spots are present is F0 - F = [6000^4 - (0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4)] * σ π R².

Let me compute the term inside the brackets.

6000^4 = (6^4) * 1e12 = 1296e12.

0.6 *6000^4 = 0.6 *1296e12 = 777.6e12.

0.4 *5000^4: 5000^4 = (5^4) *1e12 = 625e12. 0.4 *625e12 = 250e12.

So 0.6 *6^4 + 0.4 *5^4 = 777.6e12 + 250e12 = 1027.6e12.

So F0 is 1296e12 * σ π R².

F is 1027.6e12 * σ π R².

So the change is ΔF = F0 - F = (1296e12 - 1027.6e12) * σ π R² = 268.4e12 * σ π R².

So the relative change is ΔF / F0 = (268.4e12)/(1296e12) ) = 268.4 / 1296 ≈ 0.207, or about 20.7% reduction in flux.

Wait, but wait, that can't be. Because 20% of the hemisphere is covered, but the change is 20% in brightness? That seems high. Because the spots are cooler, so each spot reduces the flux by (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute the terms.

Wait, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5000^4 is 625e12 = 6.25e14.

Wait, wait, no, wait. 5000 is 5e3, so 5e3^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

Wait, but 6000^4 is 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e12? No, 1e3^4 is (1e3)^4=1e12, so 6^4 =1296, so 6000^4 is 1296e12.

Ah, okay, so:

6000^4 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = 625e12 = 0.625e15.

So F0 is 1.296e15 * σ π R².

F when spots are present is [0.6 * 1.296e15 + 0.4 * 0.625e15 ] * σ π R².

Compute 0.6*1.296e15 = 0.7776e15.

0.4 *0.625e15=0.25e15.

Sum is 0.7776e15 + 0.25e15 = 1.0276e15.

So F0 is 1.296e15, F is 1.0276e15.

So ΔF = 1.296e15 -1.0276e15 = 0.2684e15.

So the relative change is ΔF / F0 = 0.2684 / 1.296 ≈ 0.207, so about 20.7% dip.

Wait, that's a big dip. But the spot covers 20% of the hemisphere, so perhaps that's correct.

But wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So 20% of 50% of the star's surface. So 0.2 * 0.5 =10% of the star's total surface. Hmm, but the calculation shows a 20% dip.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the disk area.

Wait, the star's disk as viewed from Earth is a circle of area π R^2.

The hemisphere's area is 2 π R^2, but the disk is π R^2. So perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the disk area. Because from Earth, we only see one hemisphere. Oh, wait! Because we're seeing a star as a disk, which is a circle. The star's surface is a sphere, so when we look at it, we see a hemisphere. So the hemisphere that's facing us is the one we see. So the spots are on this visible hemisphere.

So the filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere that's covered by spots. So 20% of the area of the hemisphere we see.

The area of the visible hemisphere is 2 π R^2. So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R^2.

So when the star is rotating, and the spots are on the visible side, the flux decreases by the amount of the spots' area times the difference in their surface brightness.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - (A_spot / A_disk) * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

Wait, no. Because each spot contributes less flux. So the total flux is F = F0 * (1 - (A_spot / A_disk) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) ).

Wait, let me think again. The unspotted area still emits at F0 per unit area. The spotted area emits at F_spot = sigma T_spot^4.

So the total flux when spots are present is F = [ (A_disk - A_spot) * sigma T_eff^4 + A_spot * sigma T_spot^4 ] / A_disk.

So F = sigma [ (A_disk - A_spot) T_eff^4 + A_spot T_spot^4 ] / A_disk.

Divide numerator and denominator by A_disk:

F = sigma T_eff^4 [ (1 - A_spot/A_disk) + (A_spot/A_disk) (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

So, F = sigma T_eff^4 * [ 1 - (A_spot/A_disk) (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

Thus, the relative change in flux is:

(F - F0)/F0 = - (A_spot/A_disk) ( (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)/T_eff^4 )

So the fractional change is:

delta = - (A_spot/A_disk) * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4 )

Wait, but to get the amplitude, we take the absolute value, so it's (A_spot/A_disk) * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4 )

In our case:

A_spot = 0.4 π R^2

A_disk = π R^2

So A_spot/A_disk = 0.4.

T_spot =5000K, Teff=6000K.

So (T_spot / Teff)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So delta = 0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.207.

So about 20.7% dip in brightness when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but that's a large dip. So the amplitude of the light curve variation is about 20.7%.

Now, the question is, what radius of an exoplanet would cause the same amplitude if it were transiting the star.

An exoplanet transiting in front of the star blocks some of the star's light. The flux dip is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star.

The flux dip when the planet transits is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

So, for the exoplanet to cause the same dip (20.7%), we would have:

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.207.

So R_planet = R_star * sqrt(0.207).

Compute sqrt(0.207):

sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.454.

So the planet radius is about 45.4% of the star's radius. But wait, that can't be right because Jupiter's radius is about 10% of the Sun's radius, and that causes a dip of about 1%. Wait, let's check.

Wait, Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun. So (0.1)^2 = 0.01, so a 1% dip. So if the dip here is 20%, then the planet radius would be sqrt(0.2) ≈ 0.447 R_star, which is about 45% of the star's radius. That would be a very large planet, much bigger than Jupiter.

But wait, the options given don't have such a high value. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So 0.45 isn't an option, but the closest is A) ~0.39.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach to calculate the fractional change in flux for the star with spots is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another approach is to compute the ratio of the flux from the star with and without spots.

Wait, when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4 )) ), where f is the filling factor (but wait, wait, f is 20% of the hemisphere, but the hemisphere is the disk we see. So f=0.2.)

So, F = F0 * [ 1 - 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ]

We have (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 ≈0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355.

So F = F0 * (1 - 0.10355) = F0 * 0.89645.

So the flux drops by about 10.355% when spots are visible.

Wait, that's a different result. Now the dip is about 10.355%, so the amplitude is ~10%.

Wait, why the discrepancy earlier?

Ah, perhaps because in the first approach, I considered the flux from the spots as 0.4 π R^2 * (5e3)^4, but that's incorrect because that's the total flux from the spots if they were emitting at 5e3 K. But the actual flux from the spots is less than that. So the correct approach is to compute the average surface brightness.

Alternatively, the correct approach is to compute the ratio of the flux when spots are present to when they're not.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to model the star's flux as being made up of two components: the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The total flux when spots are visible is:

F = (A_unspotted * F_unspotted ) + (A_spotted * F_spotted )

F_unspotted = σ Teff^4.

F_spotted = σ T_spot^4.

A_unspotted = A_disk - A_spotted.

A_spotted = f * A_disk, where f is the filling factor (0.2).

So,

F = ( (1 - f) * A_disk * σ Teff^4 ) + ( f * A_disk * σ T_spot^4 )

Divide by A_disk * σ Teff^4 to get the ratio:

F/F0 = (1 - f) * 1 + f * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )

So,

F/F0 = 1 - f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

So, the fractional change is (F0 - F)/F0 = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Ah, so that's where I went wrong earlier. The correct fractional change is f*(1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So for our case, f=0.2, T_spot=5000, Teff=6000.

Compute (T_spot / Teff )^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 -0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, so about 10.355% dip.

Which is about 10.36% change in flux.

So the amplitude of the light curve is approximately 10.36%.

Now, the exoplanet would cause a dip equal to that. The dip caused by a planet is (R_planet / R_star )^2.

Set that equal to 0.10355.

So,

(R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.10355 → R_planet = R_star * sqrt(0.10355).

Compute sqrt(0.10355): sqrt(0.1) is ~0.316, sqrt(0.1024)=0.32 (since 0.32^2=0.1024).

So sqrt(0.10355) is approximately 0.3218.

So R_planet / R_star ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which fits.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Spot temperature: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The fractional change in flux (\( \Delta F / F_0 \)) when the spots are visible is given by:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.4823
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \times (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.10355
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux is approximately \( 10.36\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The fractional change in flux caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - Set this equal to the fractional change caused by the spots (\( 0.10355 \)):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
   - Solve for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The closest option to \( 0.322 \) is \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots is approximately \( 0.32 \).

**Answer: D**
