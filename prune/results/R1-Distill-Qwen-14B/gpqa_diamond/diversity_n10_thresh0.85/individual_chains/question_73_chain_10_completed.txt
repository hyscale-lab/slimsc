Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because relativistic effects come into play. 

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give different relative speeds and energies, so I need to calculate both.

First, let me tackle the relative speed. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting their velocities like in classical mechanics. I recall the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, I think it's (v1 - v2) for the numerator part, but I'll need to plug in their speeds.

So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. The relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c -0.5c= 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So denominator is 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c. So about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, for the total energy. The total energy in relativity is given by gamma times mc² for each object. So I'll need to calculate the relativistic gamma for each astronaut and sum their energies.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for astronaut 1: v=0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The mass is 2m, but in relativity, when we talk about energy, it's the relativistic energy which is gamma times rest mass energy. So for each astronaut, the energy is gamma * m_i c², where m_i is their rest mass.

So astronaut 1's energy is gamma1 * (2m) c².

Similarly, astronaut 2's energy is gamma2 * (3m) c².

So let me compute gamma for each.

Astronaut 1: v=0.6c. So gamma1 is 1.25 as I calculated.

Astronaut 2: v=0.5c. So gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy for astronaut 1: 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Energy for astronaut 2: approximately 1.1547 * 3m c². Let me compute that: 1.1547 *3 ≈ 3.4641, so about 3.4641 mc².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower.

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Let me double-check the calculations. For the relative speed: (0.6c-0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c/(1 -0.3) = 0.1/0.7= about 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Correct.

For the energy, the first astronaut: 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 mc². Second: 3m * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464 mc². Sum is 5.964, which rounds to 5.96. So yes, option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). For each astronaut:

1. **Astronaut 1**: \(v_1 = 0.6c\), \(m_1 = 2m\)
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
   \]

2. **Astronaut 2**: \(v_2 = 0.5c\), \(m_2 = 3m\)
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
   \]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations, the relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), and the total energy is \(E = 5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
