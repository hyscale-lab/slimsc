Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning the ropes. But I'm going to try to think it through step by step.

Let me start by reading the question carefully. The problem involves a series of reactions leading from compound A to E, and I need to identify E based on the given options and hints.

So the reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

There are also two hints provided. Hint a says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms a specific cyclopentane derivative. Hint b compares the IR spectra of A and E, noting strong peaks around 1750 and 1715 cm^-1, respectively.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I'll tackle each step and see what I can figure out.

First, let's think about the reactions one by one.

Step 1: A + HCN → B
HCN is a nucleophile and typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is reacting with HCN, A might be a ketone or an aldehyde. The product B would then be a cyanohydrin—so a compound with an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that A is a ketone, and HCN adds to it to form a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group. So B would be a secondary alcohol nitrile? Or maybe a ketone cyanohydrin. Let me think. Yes, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it adds across the carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol with a nitrile group? No, wait. Wait, no. The cyanohydrin formation adds an -OH and a -CN to the same carbon. So the carbonyl (C=O) becomes a CH(OH)CN group. So B would have a cyanohydrin structure.

Step 2: B → C via H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably catalytic hydrogenation. So if B has a nitrile group, maybe it gets reduced. I know that nitriles (R-CN) can be reduced to amines (R-CH2-NH2) under certain conditions, but more commonly, they are reduced to alkanes. Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the reduction conditions. H2 and Pd. Oh, wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated under these conditions to primary amines, but perhaps in the presence of a catalyst like Raney nickel, but sometimes, under certain conditions, they can be hydrogenated all the way to the corresponding methylene group. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is converted into an amine, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction B → C. If B is a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol nitrile, but wait, no, no. Wait, no: A is a ketone (since it reacts with HCN to
