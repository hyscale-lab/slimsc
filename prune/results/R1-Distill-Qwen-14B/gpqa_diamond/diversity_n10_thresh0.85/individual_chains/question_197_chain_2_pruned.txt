Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably due to O-H or N-H stretches. Wait, but looking at the other IR peaks: 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester or acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 areas are around where aromatic C=C stretches appear. So, the compound has an aromatic ring. Combining this, maybe it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong signal, probably an -OH proton, but wait, in an acid it's usually around 10-12 ppm. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid. But then again, sometimes a phenolic -OH can also be around there, but phenols usually have a broader peak and might be split due to coupling, but here it's a singlet. Hmm.

Looking further, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are typical for a para-substituted benzene. So two doublets, each integrating for 2H, meaning the substituents are in the para positions. So maybe the structure is something like para-substituted with a carbonyl group and another group.

Wait, so the 10.5 ppm peak could be from a carbonyl group. Wait, no, that's a proton signal. Oh, wait, maybe it's a ketone adjacent to an aromatic ring? No, wait, carbonyls don't have protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid. So, a para-substituted benzoic acid.

Wait, but let me think. If the compound is a benzoic acid, the IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm-1, which matches with the 1720 here. Also, the broad peak around 3400-2500 could be the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which fits a carboxylic acid proton. Then the aromatic region is two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted ring. So, the substituents could be a methyl and a carbonyl group in para positions.

Wait, but wait. Benzoic acid would have a carbonyl group attached directly to the ring. So maybe the structure is 4-substituted benzoic acid. Let's see the other NMR peaks.

At 2.9 ppm, there's a multiplet integrating for 1H. That could be a CH group next to an electronegative atom, like maybe adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (m) for 2H, and 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. Lastly, 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H. These seem to indicate a chain attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's an ethyl group or a propyl group. Let's see: 0.9 as a triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. But the triplet is usually for the end CH3. Let me think. The triplet at 0.9 with 3H is like a terminal CH3. The 1.4 doublet with 3H could be a CH(CH3), perhaps. Wait, 1.4 doublet (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH which is perhaps attached to another CH2.

Wait, maybe it's a
