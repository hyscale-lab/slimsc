Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's think it through. Alright, the question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh wait, maybe the interaction is something like X coupling to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the interaction term probably looks like λ X ψ ψ, meaning that the boson X can decay into a fermion and its antiparticle.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. To find the possible decays, I need to look at all possible fermion pairs that can be produced with the total energy being less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, each fermion has its own mass. For a decay X → f f̄, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to the X mass.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions. Let's see:

- Electron (e): negligible, practically zero for these purposes, so 0 GeV.
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV.
- Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). 
Their masses are roughly:
u ≈ 2 MeV (so ~0.002 GeV),
d ≈ 5 MeV,
s ≈ 100 MeV,
c ≈ 1.5 GeV,
b ≈ 4.5 GeV,
t is way heavier, like 173 GeV.

Wait, but for pair production, we have to consider the sum of the masses for each possible fermion pair. Because when X decays, each fermion (and its antiparticle) must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So for each fermion f, 2m_f <= 6 GeV? Or wait, no, because for the decay to happen, each fermion must have a rest mass such that 2m_f <= m_X. Because the minimal energy needed is when the two particles are at rest in the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, no, that's not entirely correct. The condition is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the parent particle. So for X → f f̄, the rest mass of f is m_f. So 2m_f <= m_X. Because each f has mass m_f, so together 2m_f.

So m_X must be >= 2m_f for the decay to be kinematically allowed.

So for each fermion, check if 2m_f <= 6 GeV.

Let me make a list:

Electron (e): 2m_e ~ 0 GeV → yes.
Muon (μ): 2m_mu ≈ 0.2 GeV → yes.
Tau (τ): 2 * 1.78 ≈ 3.56 GeV → yes.
Up quark: 2*0.002 ≈ 0.004 GeV → yes.
Down: same as up, negligible.
Strange: 2*0.1 → 0.2 GeV → yes.
Charm: 2*1.5 = 3 GeV → yes.
Bottom: 2*4.5 = 9 GeV. Oh wait, X is 6 GeV. So 9 >6. So that's not allowed. So X can't decay into b b̄.
Top: way too heavy, 2*173 ≈ 346 GeV, way above 6. So no.

So the allowed fermion pairs are those where 2m_f <=6 GeV.

Which fermions satisfy that? Let's see:

e: yes (mass ~0)
mu: yes (0.1 GeV sum 0.2)
tau: yes (3.56)
u: yes
d: yes
s: yes
c: yes (3 GeV)
b: no (9>6)
t: no.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

e+, e-
mu+ , mu-
tau+, tau-
u, ū
d, d̄
s, s̄
c, c̄

Wait, but the problem is about the decay X → f f̄. So which ones are possible? Let me look at each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but for b b̄, 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass 6 GeV. So this decay is not allowed. So option A would include b b̄, which can't happen. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So c has 2m_c=3 GeV ≤6, so yes. So c c̄ is allowed. This option includes all except b. So B includes c, which is allowed. But wait, in the interaction term, which fermions are coupled to X?

Wait, the interaction term given is L = -λ f f̄ ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, perhaps I'm getting the notation wrong. Maybe the term is λ X ψ ψ, meaning that X couples to any fermion ψ. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass allows it.

But wait, perhaps the term is written as something else. Let me re-read. The term is given as:

\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi} f (y) ( \upsilon + X(y) ) \psi_{f}(y)

Wait, perhaps the notation is a bit confusing. Maybe it's written in a way that X couples to each fermion ψ_f. So X can interact with any fermion species, so in principle, any fermion could be a decay product, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

So in that case, the allowed decays are all the fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

Which ones are those? e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the allowed decay channels are:

e+ e-,
mu+ mu-,
tau+ tau-,
u ū,
d d̄,
s s̄,
c c̄.

So looking at the options:

Option A includes b and s, u, d, tau, e. But b is not allowed, so A is incorrect.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All correct except that option B includes c, which is allowed. So this seems correct.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy, so C is incorrect.

Option D includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, all these fermions have 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The mass of tau is about 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78=3.56 ≤6: yes.

Charm quark: 1.5 GeV, 2*1.5=3 ≤6: yes.

So yes, all in option B are allowed.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, meaning \( X \) can decay into any fermion species \( f \) and \( \bar{f} \), provided the mass condition \( 2m_f \leq m_X \) is satisfied. Here, \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( m_f \) is the rest mass of the fermion \( f \).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The rest masses of the fermions are approximately:
- \( m_e \approx 0 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_u \approx 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_d \approx 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \).

For each fermion pair \( f\bar{f} \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) must hold. Checking each fermion:
- \( e^+e^- \): \( 2m_e \approx 0 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( \mu^+\mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( \tau^+\tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( u\bar{u} \): \( 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( d\bar{d} \): \( 2m_d \approx 0.01 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( s\bar{s} \): \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( c\bar{c} \): \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( b\bar{b} \): \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (exceeds \( m_X \)).
- \( t\bar{t} \): \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (far exceeds \( m_X \)).

Thus, the allowed decay channels are \( X \rightarrow e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
