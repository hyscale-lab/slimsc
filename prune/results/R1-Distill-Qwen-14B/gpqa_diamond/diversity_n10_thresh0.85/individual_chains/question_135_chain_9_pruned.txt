Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf ψ̄f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, okay, so the boson X is interacting with some fermion fields. I remember that in the Lagrangian, the term involving X would determine what kind of interactions the boson has.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to consider the possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy of X should be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair, right? Because each fermion would need some energy, and you can't have rest mass without enough energy. So, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair with a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV is allowed.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. I remember that the electron is super light, like 0.0005 GeV. The muon is heavier, around 0.1 GeV. The tau is much heavier, about 1.77 GeV. The quarks: up and down are light, but their masses are tricky because they're in hadrons, but I think for this problem, it's more about the current masses. The up and down are like a few MeV, so about 0.003 GeV or so. The strange quark is heavier, around 95-100 MeV, so about 0.095 GeV. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, and the bottom is about 4.7 GeV. Oh wait, top is way heavier, around 173 GeV, but since X is only 6 GeV, top quarks are out of the question.

So, X can decay into any fermion and its antiparticle as long as 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV. Let's list all the possible fermions:

- Electron (e⁻): 2 * 0.0005 ≈ 0.001 GeV → allowed.
- Muon (μ⁻): 2 * 0.1 ≈ 0.2 GeV → allowed.
- Tau (τ⁻): 2 * 1.77 ≈ 3.54 GeV → allowed because 3.54 <6.
- Up quark (u): 2*0.003 ≈ 0.006 GeV → allowed.
- Down quark (d): same as u, about 0.006 GeV → allowed.
- Strange quark (s): 2*0.095≈0.19 GeV → allowed.
- Charm quark (c): 2*1.5≈3 GeV → allowed.
- Bottom quark (b): 2*4.7≈9.4 GeV → which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because 9.4 >6. So b and anti-b are not allowed.
- Top quark is way too heavy, so no need to consider.

Wait, but wait. The fermions in the problem statement's Lagrangian: looking back, the term is λf ψ̄f (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). So f must be a fermion that couples to X. So, each fermion f that couples can decay from X.

So the possible fermion types are the ones that X couples to. The problem's interaction term is for all fermions f, because the Lagrangian is written as a sum over f.
