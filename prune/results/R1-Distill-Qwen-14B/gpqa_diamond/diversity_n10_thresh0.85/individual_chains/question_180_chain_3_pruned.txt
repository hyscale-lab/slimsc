Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about the minimum energy of an isolated system of particles. There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of twice that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just the potential energy maybe?

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So I'm picturing point P with one charge, and then 12 charges arranged around it, each 2 meters away. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that for electrostatic systems, the potential energy is related to the work done to assemble the charges. Since the system is isolated, I think the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But since the 13th charge is fixed at P, maybe I don't have to consider the work done to bring it there because it's already in place. So I should focus on bringing the 12 charges from infinity to their positions 2 meters away from P.

Let me think about how to calculate the potential energy. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

So each of the 12 charges is 2e at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge. So the potential energy between each of these 12 and the fixed one would be U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m). Let me compute that.

But wait, the fixed charge is at P, so when I bring each charge to 2 meters, I'm adding each one and calculating the work done against the electric field. Since each charge is 2e, the fixed charge is 2e. So for each of the 12, the potential energy is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2k e².

Wait, but I need to sum that for all 12. So 12
