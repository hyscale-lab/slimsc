Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. 

Hmm, both have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since the period is shorter. Got it.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. So, even though Planet_1's star is more massive, they're the same size. That probably affects the transit probability somehow.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative sizes of the planet, the star, and the distance of the planet's orbit. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) over (a_planet * (1/R_star)) ) or something. Wait, maybe I should think more clearly.

Oh right, the transit probability P is given by the formula: P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (R_s / a)) )? No, wait, maybe the formula is more like (R_p + R_s) over the semi-major axis, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the geometry of the situation.

The probability of a planet transiting is the ratio of the area of the star's disk that the planet can cover when aligned edge-on, which is when the transit occurs. More accurately, the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (in terms of the star's size) and the distance at which a transit is possible. Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_s / a) * (R_p / R_s), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) / a, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. I found in my notes that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)Â², but that seems off because it doesn't involve the orbital distance. Wait, no. Another approach: the transit probability depends on the size of the
