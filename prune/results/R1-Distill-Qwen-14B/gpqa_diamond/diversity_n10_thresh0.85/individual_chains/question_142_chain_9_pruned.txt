Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it. The problem is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The options are r=(1,1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,0), or (1,1,1). Wait, I remember that qubits are two-level systems, so their state space is a qubit space, which is a two-dimensional complex vector space. But when we talk about the geometrical position, I think it refers to the Bloch sphere representation.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write this out more explicitly. So, |0> is the vector [1; 0], and |1> is [0;1]. So |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is a matrix with 1 in the (2,2) position. Adding these gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

Wait, what's the significance of this matrix? I remember that a density matrix must be positive semi-definite and have trace 1. This one does have trace 1 (0.5 + 0.5 =1) and is diagonal with positive entries, so it's definitely a valid density matrix.

But how does this correspond to a point on the Bloch sphere? Oh right, the Bloch sphere represents mixed states as points within the unit ball. Pure states are on the surface (radius 1), and mixed states are inside (radius less than 1). The density matrix ρ here, since it's a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal, represents a completely mixed state. Because in each basis, the diagonal entries correspond to the probabilities, and off-diagonal terms relate to coherence.

Wait, the general form of a qubit state on the Bloch sphere is written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (x,y,z) with |r| ≤1. So for a general state, density matrix ρ can be written as (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. 

Let me compute the components. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute each term. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (|0><0| + |1><1|) is actually I, right? Because |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]] which is I. Wait wait, but the given rho is (I)/2. So rho = (I)/2. 

So when I write rho in terms of the Bloch sphere parametrization, I have (I + r·
