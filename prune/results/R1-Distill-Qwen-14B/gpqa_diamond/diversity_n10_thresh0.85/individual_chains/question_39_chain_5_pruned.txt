Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measure the position of the particles, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. The question is to find the value of 'a' from the options provided.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Oh wait, but since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside that region. Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because if the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, then inside the region, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me read again.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, but the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero elsewhere. So, the given wave function is valid only in the region from x=1 to x=3, and zero elsewhere? Or maybe the given wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, but outside, it's zero. So the entire wave function is non-zero only in that interval.

Wait, but the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function. So the wave function Ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, but the wave function must be normalizable. So the integral of |Ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 should be equal to 1.

Wait, the modulus squared of Ψ is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] , since the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5), so the square would be each part squared, added together.

So, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me be precise. The wave function is Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2.

Which simplifies to (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Yes, because the wave function is zero elsewhere.

So I can split this integral into two parts.

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First part: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so evaluated from 1 to 3:

At 3: ln(4)
At 1: ln(2)
So the first integral is a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), subtracting ln(2) gives ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, the equation becomes:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Solve for a²: a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What is ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a is the square root of that. Let me compute that.

Square root of 0.7213 is about 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make any mistake in the setup? Because sometimes the wave functions are given as real functions, but here it's complex.

Wait, in the given wave function, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function is a constant imaginary part plus a real part that depends on x.

But in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, but the modulus squared is what's important for the probability density.

So the steps I took should be correct.

Wait, but wait another thought. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the entire expression is the function. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.
