Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts. The techniques used were FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's very broad, maybe it's a strong hydrogen bond, which could suggest something like a carboxylic acid. Also, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are important. The 1700 is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe like an ester or conjugated carbonyl. Or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the Hs attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe in a conjugated system with a carbonyl. That might suggest something like an ester or a ketone with an adjacent double bond, or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the Mass Spectrometry data: a fragment peak at m/z = 45. What could that be? Well, 45 is a common mass for fragments like C3H7O or maybe (CH2)2O. Or perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group? Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of methyl acetate's fragment? Or maybe it's the (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, but that's 58. Hmm. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)2O, but that's 45? Wait, (CH3)2O is 2*(15) + 16? Wait no, (CH3)2O is 2*(15) [since each CH3 is 15] plus 16 (O), so 2*15=30+16=46. Hmm, that's 46, so not 45. So maybe something else. Oh, wait, 45 could be the fragment from a ketone. Let me think: when a molecule breaks, maybe the loss of a certain group. For example, if it's an ester, the ester group could break off, leaving a smaller fragment. Alternatively, maybe a toluene-type structure? Or perhaps it's a fragment from a substituted acetone or something. Wait, another possibility: the CH2O group is 44 (12 + 2*1 +16=30, no wait 12+2=14, 14+16=30? No, wait, C=12, H2=2, O=16: 12+2+16=30. So 30 isn't 45. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's think about possible structures for each.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2: Could be an ester, like methyl something. Esters usually have a carbonyl and an ether linkage. Or maybe a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure.

B) C6H10O: A ketone perhaps, like cyclohexanone but that has 12 H. Or maybe a diene with a ketone.

C) C6H10O2: Could be a diester or something with two oxygen-containing groups, like an ester and an alcohol, but that's less likely. Alternatively, a cyclic ester with another oxygen.

D) C6H12O: Maybe a diol or something with a ring and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. Vinyl hydrogens suggest a double bond. So the structure probably has a double bond.

The IR has a strong peak at 1700 and 1650. So 1700 is a carbonyl. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or conjugated. For example, in an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. The 1650 could be an adjacent double bond, like if there's conjugation between the carbonyl and a double bond. So maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would explain both the carbonyl and the peak around 1650, which could be the C=C stretch.

In FTIR, a broad peak around 3000 suggests O-H stretch. But wait, if the compound is an ester, there's no O-H. So maybe that's a mistake. Wait, wait, but the IR shows a very broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that doesn't fit the options as well. Wait, let me think again. The options don't include everything. The options are for the molecular formula.

Wait, looking at the options: the molecular formulas are:

A) C6H12O2: Degrees of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let's compute for each.

Wait, perhaps degrees of unsaturation (DoU) can help. DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N.

Let's compute for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU= (12 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2. Two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So two double bonds or rings.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU= (14-12)/2=1.

Wait, in the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the structure has at least one double bond.

If the compound has a carbonyl group (from IR), that's another DoU. So for each option:

A) O2, H12: DoU=1. So if there's a carbonyl group (which is a double bond), that's one DoU. Then the structure could have either a ring or another double bond. But wait, the DoU is 1, so can't have more than that. So maybe a carbonyl plus a ring?

But wait, if it's a carbonyl (double bond) and a ring, that's two DoU, which would make the DoU value 2. That can't be because option A has DoU=1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the DoU is 1, and the compound has a carbonyl (which is a double bond, so one DoU), then it can't have another ring or double bond. So the structure must have only one DoU: either a ring or a double bond, but not both.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So if the compound has a double bond (one DoU), and the IR shows a carbonyl (another DoU), that's two DoU. But the DoU from the formula must account for that.

So let's recheck:

Option A: DoU=1. So a carbonyl (one) and a double bond would make two, which is more than the DoU. So that's impossible. So option A can't be the correct formula if it has both a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option B: DoU=2. So it can have two double bonds or a double bond and a ring. So it's possible.

Option C: DoU=2. So same as B.

Option D: DoU=1. So can only have one double bond (like the carbonyl) or a ring.

Wait, but the problem states that the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the structure must have at least one double bond, which is one DoU.

The IR shows a carbonyl, which is another DoU. So the total DoU is 2.

So the formula must have a DoU of at least 2. Let's check each option:

Option A: DoU=1. No, can't have both a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option B: DoU=2. Possible.

Option C: DoU=2. Possible.

Option D: DoU=1. No.

So the correct formula must be either B or C.

Now, let's think about the Mass Spec. The fragment at m/z=45. What could that be?

Looking at possible structures. If the compound is an ester, maybe something like methyl acrylate. Let's think about the structure. Acrylic esters have the structure CH2=CHCOOR. Molecular formula for that would be Cn+3 H2n+2 O2 (if R is methyl, n=3, etc.), but let's not get stuck on that. Alternatively, the mass of 45 could come from a fragment like a ketone.

Wait, let me think about the possible molecular formulas. For the compounds in options B and C.

Option B: C6H10O. If it's a diene with a ketone. For example, cyclopentenone? Wait, cyclopentenone would have the formula C5H8O, so that's not C6. Maybe something else.

Option C: C6H10O2. Esters have the formula RCOOR'. Let's see. Suppose it's an ester like methyl cyclopentene carboxylate? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, think about the molecular weight. The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol.

In mass spec, a fragment at m/z=45. Let's see what could have a mass of 45.

45 is 29 (CH2CH2) plus 16? No. Wait, 45 is 12*3 + 1*6 +16*0= 36 +6=42. Hmm, no. Alternatively, 45 could be C3H7O. 3*12=36, H7 is 7, O is 16. 36+7+16=64. No. Hmm.

Wait another approach. 45 is the mass of CH3COO- (acetate group). Wait, CH3COO^- has a mass of 12*2 + 1*3 +16 = 24 +3 +16 =43? No, wait 12*2=24, H3=3, O2=32? No, wait, the formula for acetate is C2H3O2^- which is 2*12=24 +3*1=3 + 2*16=32. Total 24+3+32=59? No. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)2O, but earlier I thought that was 46. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is the methyl group from an ester. Wait, the ester group is OCOOR. If it breaks off, maybe the R is a methyl group, and the remaining part could have a mass of 45. Let's think: the ester RCOOR' would break into RCOO+ and R' as a fragment. So if R' is methyl (15), then the RCOO+ would be (12* n + 1* (2m +1) + 16*2). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternative approach: the molecular formula of the compound. Let's consider option C: C6H10O2. The degree of unsaturation is 2. So it could have a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and something else. But more likely a double bond and a ring.

If the structure is an ester with a cyclic structure, like cyclohexene ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a diester. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a peak at 1650 cm^-1. That's lower than 1700. Maybe that's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. That's a conjugated system, where the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond. That would explain the lower wavenumber.

So for an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOR. The IR would show a strong peak for the carbonyl (maybe around 1700) and the conjugated double bond might show a peak around 1650.

In that case, the structure has a conjugated diene and a carbonyl. Wait, but perhaps it's a conjugated enone (double bond and ketone). So for example, something like CH2=CHCOCH2CH2OR. Hmm.

Alternatively, the structure could be an aromatic ring with a substituent, but the molecular formula doesn't have enough carbons for benzene. Wait, C6H10O2 would have six carbons. Benzene is C6H6. If there's a benzene ring, that's three DoU (the ring counts as one, and each double bond in the ring is another). But in the formula, the DoU is two. So that's not possible. So probably not an aromatic compound.

So back to the ester scenario. Let's think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at 45. If the ester breaks, maybe the R group is something that gives a 45 mass.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let's think about possible fragments. Maybe a ketene? Or a smaller ester fragment. Wait, 45 could be the mass of (CH3)2CO (acetone). Acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has a molecular weight of 58 (12*3 + 1*6 + 16= 36 +6 +16=58). Hmm, that's not 45. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group. Wait, CH2CH2O is not possible. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group is 30. No, that's 30. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The molecular formula of the compound is C6H10O2. Let's compute its molecular weight: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 72+10+32=114.

In mass spec, the molecular ion would be around m/z=114. But the fragment is at 45. So 45 is almost 40% of the molecular weight. That suggests that the fragment is a part of the molecule, perhaps a cleavage product.

If the molecule is an ester, perhaps cleavage occurs at the ester group. So the ester group (RCOOR') could break into RCOO+ and R' as a separate fragment. If RCOO+ is a larger fragment, then R' would have a lower mass. Let's say R is CH2CH2COO- (which is 58), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if R' is something like methyl (15), then RCOO+ would be 114-15=99. But 99 isn't a common fragment, and 45 is lower than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in esters with conjugated double bonds. The McLafferty rearrangement produces a gamma,delta-unsaturated ketone, which can fragment. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a 45 fragment.

Wait, another possibility. The fragment at 45 could be a ketene ion. A ketene is O=C=O, but that's more like 44 (O is 16, C is 12, another O is 16, so 12+16*2=44). Hmm, close but not exactly 45. Or perhaps it's an acyloxy fragment.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be the mass of a propyl group with an oxygen. Propyl is C3H7, which is 39. If it's C2H5O (45?), let's compute: C2=24, H5=5, O=16. 24+5+16=45. Yep! So C2H5O would have a mass of 45. Could that be a fragment from the compound?

If the compound is an ester like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3, then perhaps a fragment could break off the ester group and leave the R' part. If R' is CH2CH2CH3, that's a propyl group. But the mass of propyl is 57 (12*3 + 1*7=36+7=43? Wait, no, 3 carbons: 3*12=36, 7 H:7, 36+7=43. Plus O? Wait, no. If it's a propyl group attached to an O, then the fragment would be OCH2CH2CH3. The mass would be 16 + (12*3 +1*7) = 16 + 43=59. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe the fragment is a smaller part. Like ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). That's 16 + 2*12 + 5*1=16+24+5=45. Oh! Yes, that's 45. So the fragment would be OCH2CH3, which is the ethoxy group. So if the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, then the ethoxy group could break off as a fragment of 45 (m/z=45).

So, that would suggest the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group. The structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's check the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2. Wait, but our options are C6H10O2, which is two more carbons. Hmm, so maybe the structure is larger. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a longer chain.

Wait, let's compute the formula for CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be C6H10O2. Let's see:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3:

Carbon: 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (from COO) + 3 (from CH2CH2CH3) = 7? Wait, no. Wait, CH2=CH is two, COO is two, and CH2CH2CH3 is three. Wait, no, the structure is:

CH2=CH-C-O-O-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR'. So R is CH2CHCOO-? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is methyl propenoate. Wait, propenoate is CH2CH2COOOR. For example, methyl propenoate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. But our option is C6H10O2. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach. If the formula is C6H10O2 and the structure is an ester with a double bond, maybe it's something like methyl cyclopentene carboxylate. But cyclopentene is a five-membered ring with a double bond. So the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: the cyclopentene ring (5 carbons, 8 H?), plus the ester group (O2) and a methyl group.

Wait, cyclopentene has the formula C5H8. Then, if it's a carboxylate
