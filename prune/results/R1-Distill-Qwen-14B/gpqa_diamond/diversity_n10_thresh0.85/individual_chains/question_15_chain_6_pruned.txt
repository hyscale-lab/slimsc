Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, transiting method, right? I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. So their radii might be similar, but wait, does mass directly translate to radius? I guess for Earth-like planets, same mass implies same radius. So Planet_1 and Planet_2 have the same radius.

The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But since the star's radius is the same, the surface gravity might be different... but wait, I'm not sure if that matters for transit probability.

The transit probability is given by the formula, I think, (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a/(2R_star))^2 / (a/(2R_star)) + (R_planet)^2 )? Or is there a better way to think about it. Wait, maybe another approach.

The probability P that a planet transits is approximately (R_star / a)^2, but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think. The transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet, and the orientation of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2), but more accurately, it's (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by ( (R_star / a)^2 ), but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think the standard formula for the probability that a randomly oriented orbit would produce a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s) * sqrt(1 - e^2)) )) ), but since these are circular orbits, e=0, so it simplifies. Wait, no, maybe the probability is (R_p/(R_s))^2 multiplied by ( (R_s)/(a) )^2. Or wait, perhaps I should think geometrically.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the alignment. The formula I remember is that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (
