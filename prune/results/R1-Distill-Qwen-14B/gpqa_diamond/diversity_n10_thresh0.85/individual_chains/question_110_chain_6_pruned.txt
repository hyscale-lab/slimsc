Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. The question involves some astronomy concepts I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the main point is that both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect certain stars. The key here is understanding the brightness limits of each spectrograph. From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 by HIRES. Wait, no, wait. The question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, which probably means magnitude less than 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag <17 are observable. Similarly for HIRES, V mag <16. So the star must be visible by both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, no, wait: because if the star is brighter than 17, that's V mag less than 17. So the star's apparent V mag must be less than both 17 and 16? Wait, no, because if a star is brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17. Because 16 is brighter than 17. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17, and also brighter than 16. Wait, but if a star is brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17, so the limiting factor would be the lower brightness limit. So the star's apparent magnitude must be â‰¤16 because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, no: Let me clarify. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, which means V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have V <16, because if it's less than 16, it's automatically less than 17. So the apparent magnitude must be <16.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Because in astronomy, a magnitude scale where lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V magnitude 17 is dimmer than one with 16. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, V <17. For HIRES, V <16. So a star must have V <16 to be detected by both. So any star with apparent V mag less than 16 can be seen by both.

So our
