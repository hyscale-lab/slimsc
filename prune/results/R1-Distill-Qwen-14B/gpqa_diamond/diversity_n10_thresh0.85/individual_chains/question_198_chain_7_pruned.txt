Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants have to do with how stable a complex is, right? The higher the constant, the more stable the complex.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) are given for each complex: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, what do these betas represent? Oh right, each β corresponds to a different complex. So Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, up to Co(SCN)_4, each with their own stability constants.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2- or something like that, but I'm not exactly sure which complex it refers to. Wait, the question mentions "blue dithiocyanato," which I think corresponds to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2- complex. So that's the third species, right? Because β2 is 40, but wait, maybe each β is for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) or something.

Wait, no, stability constants are ordered. Let me think. For the complexes, the first would be [Co(SCN)]^+, second [Co(SCN)_2]^0, third [Co(SCN)_3]^- and fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}? Or maybe the numbering is different. I'm a bit confused here. The stability constant βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, but the problem is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I remember that [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is a blue complex. So that's the second complex, corresponding to β2=40. Or wait, maybe it's the third. No, wait, the first
