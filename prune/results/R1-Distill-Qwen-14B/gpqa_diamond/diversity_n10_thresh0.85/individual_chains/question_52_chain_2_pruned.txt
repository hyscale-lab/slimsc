Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star normally has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, okay, so the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2, respectively. And this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when it has spots. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Hmm, I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Oh, so that's the wavelength of the emitted photon when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1. So the energy difference between the levels is E2 - E1 = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So we can compute E2-E1 using that.

But wait, the problem says the star's photosphere is in LTE, so we can use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio depends on temperature. But wait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. But wait, are the spots affecting the temperature of the entire photosphere, or is the temperature of the unspotted regions higher? Hmm, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the average Teff is 5500 K. But I'm not sure if the temperature of the photosphere is uniform. Wait, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature. Hmm, perhaps the photosphere's temperature is lower when spots are present. Or does the star have varying temperatures in different regions? Oh, wait, the spots are cooler regions, so the rest of the surface (60%) is hotter? Because when spots are present, the average Teff is lower, implying that the unspotted areas must be hotter to compensate. Because the spots are cooler, and the star's overall luminosity is less. Wait, but the problem says when the star's surface isn't
