Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as a 2x2 matrix. 

First, let me read the problem again. The muon's intrinsic angular momentum operator's Y-component is Ay, which is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The equation given is Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. 

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix whose first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, so matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]?

I remember that angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh wait, right! The Pauli matrices are often used in spin-1/2 systems. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. 

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh wait, that's exactly the structure of matrix S here. So S is the Pauli y matrix, σy. So, S = σy.

So operator Ay is c * σy. And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but wait a second. The usual angular momentum operator for spin is given by ħ times the Pauli matrices. Because ħ = h/(2π). So, for example, S_y = ħ σy / 2? Or wait, let me think. Oh right, actually, the spin angular momentum operator S is (ħ/2) σ, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, and the spin has quantum numbers ± ħ/2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here because in this problem, the operator is already given as c multiplied by S, which is the Pauli matrix.

So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) times σy. Let me compute that matrix explicitly. 

σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So each element is multiplied by c.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So to find the eigenvalues a, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So let me write Ay matrix:

Ay = [ [ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
        [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

The matrix for (Ay - a I) is:
[ [ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

Wait, determinant is (top left * bottom right) minus (top right * bottom left). So:

determinant = (-a)*(-a) - [ ( (-i h)/(4π) ) * ( (i h)/(4π) ) ) ]

Simplify each part.

(-a)^2 is a^2.

The other term: (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (i*(-i)) h^2/( (4π)^2 ) * 1.

Wait wait, wait, let me compute each part step by step.

The product of the off-diagonal terms is [ (-i h/(4π)) ] * [ (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Multiply the terms:

(-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

h/(4π) * h/(4π) = h²/(16 π²).

So the product is 1 * h²/(16 π²) = h²/(16 π²).

So the determinant is a² - [h²/(16 π²)] = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²).

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. So the options mentioning imaginary parts might not be correct.

Now, looking at the options. Let's check each one.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or ∓2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π) or ∓h/(4π). But our calculation shows eigenvalues are purely real, so this can't be right. So A is incorrect.

Option
