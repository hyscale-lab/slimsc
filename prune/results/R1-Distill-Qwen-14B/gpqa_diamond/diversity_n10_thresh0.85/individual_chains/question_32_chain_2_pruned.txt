Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus X when its speed is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas.

The question states that nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons and typically 4 neutrons for Li-7. But here it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons make Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

I need to find the energy of the nucleus, which I think relates to relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh right, because v is 0.96c, so v over c is 0.96.

Let me calculate gamma first. So gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.571428... about 3.5714.

Now, the energy is gamma multiplied by m c squared. But wait, what's the mass m here? Oh, it's the rest mass of the nucleus. Nucleus X is Li-6. So what's the mass of a Li-6 nucleus?

The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.6605e-27 kg. Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6 u. Wait, but I should check the exact value. From what I remember, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 u. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li is around 6.941 g/mol, but that's for Li-7. For Li-6, the exact mass is about 6.0141 atomic mass units. Yeah, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, I can look up the exact value, but since I don't have that, I'll proceed with 6.0141 u.

So m = 6.0141 u.

But wait, converting u to kilograms. 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So m = 6.0141 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Let me calculate that. 6 *1.6605e-27 is about 9.963e-27 kg. 0.0141 * 1.6605e-27 is approximately 2.341e-29 kg. So adding them gives roughly 9.963e-27 + 0.0002341e-27 = 9.96534e-27 kg.

Wait, but maybe I should be precise. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the rest mass energy in MeV and then convert to GeV.

Wait, wait. The rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.0141 atomic mass units. The atomic mass unit in energy terms is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy is (6.0141 u) * (931.5 MeV/c²/u) )= 6.0141 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that: 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.0141 *931.5 ≈ 13.13 MeV. So total is approximately 5602.13 MeV. Wait, 5589 +13.13=5602.13 MeV, which is 5.60213 GeV.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, the actual rest mass energy of a Li-6 nucleus is (6 * 931.5) ≈ 5589 MeV, but the exact value would be a bit higher because 6.0141 is more than 6. So 6.0141 *931.5=?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589. Then 0.0141 *931.5: 0.0141 *900=12.69, 0.0141 *31.5=0.44415, sum is 13.13415. So total is 5589+13.13415=5602.13415 MeV, which is 5.60213 GeV approximately. So m c² is about 5.60213 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The rest mass of the nucleus is needed. But wait, in particle physics, when you calculate the energy for a nucleus moving at high speeds, you need to use its rest mass. So for the energy, E = gamma * m c².

So gamma is about 3.5714, and m c² is 5.60213 GeV. So E = 3.5714 *5.60213 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 *5 is 17.857. 3.5714 *0.60213 is approximately 3.5714 *0.6=2.1428, 3.5714 *0.00213≈0.0076. So 2.1428 +0.
