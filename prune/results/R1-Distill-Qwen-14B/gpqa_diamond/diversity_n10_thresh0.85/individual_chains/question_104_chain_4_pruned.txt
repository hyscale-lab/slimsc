Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet detection methods, but I'll try to think this through.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets, and I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble.

So, the key here is the Doppler shift. The shift is given for both planets. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the orbital period of the planet? Oh right, the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, among other things.

I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) ) * (1/( ( (P/(2π) )^(1/3) ) * c )) )... Hmm, maybe I should simplify it. Oh wait, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is much less than Sun's mass), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so we can approximate it as M_*.

Wait, but the formula for the semi-amplitude is K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) / c, right? But since the eccentricity e is probably small (they have circular orbits), and M_p is much less than M_*, so M_* dominates. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_*^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (2π / (P c))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's think about the dependency. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * ( (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) ) / (something). Wait, maybe more accurately, the formula is K ≈ (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Since both planets have the same mass (Neptune masses) and same star mass, and assuming same inclination (i=90, sin i=1) and same eccentricity (e=0), the RV semi-amplitude K should be inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P.

Wait, because K is proportional to (G * M_p) / (M_*^(2) )^(1/3) ) * (
