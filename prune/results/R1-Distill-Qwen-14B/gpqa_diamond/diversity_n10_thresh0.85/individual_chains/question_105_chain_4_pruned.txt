Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

Alright, the question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when observed over time, the brightness variations due to rotation will look similar to those caused by an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same light curve amplitude as these spots.

Wait, the question is a bit tricky. It's saying that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would be the planet's radius to create the same brightness change. So I need to compare the brightness dip from the planet to the dip from the spots.

Let me think about what I know. When a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of their radii. The formula is (R_planet / R_star)^2. But this is for a planet blocking part of the star's light.

In this case, the star has spots. When the spots rotate into and out of view, the star's brightness changes. The spots are darker, so when they're on the side facing us, the total brightness is less. The problem is that this variation is compared to a planet transiting, so the question is how to model the brightness change from the spots.

First, let's figure out the brightness change caused by the spots. The star's total brightness is based on its surface area and temperature. The spots are cooler, so each spot emits less flux.

The star's total flux without spots would be F_total = 4πR_star² * (σ * Teff^4), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and R_star is the radius.

But when the spots are present, a part of the star's surface is emitting less. The spots cover a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered? So 20% of each hemisphere's area is spots. Since the hemisphere is half the star's surface, total area with spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) ?

Wait, the star has radius R, so surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². Filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere, so area with spots is 0.2 * 2πR².

But wait, the effective temperature of the spots is Teff - 1000 K, so 5000 K. So each spot contributes less flux.

So the total flux when the spots are facing us (i.e., when the spots are on the hemisphere we're seeing) would be different.

Wait, but the star's rotation causes the spots to come into and out of view. So the maximum brightness change would be when the spots are fully visible, and the minimum when they're on the opposite side.

But the problem says that the brightness variation over time (as the star rotates) would resemble a planet. So we need to model the brightness change from the spots as a function of rotation and compare it to the brightness change from a
