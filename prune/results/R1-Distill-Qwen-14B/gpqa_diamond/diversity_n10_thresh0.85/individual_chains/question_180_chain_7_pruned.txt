Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. They have negligible mass. So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So I think this is a problem about electric potential energy. Because all the charges are fixed except the one at point P, which is fixed there.

Wait, but wait. The setup is that there are 12 charges at a distance of 2m from P. The 13th is at P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and they're all at 2 meters from the fixed charge. 

I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. The formula is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, summed over all unique pairs.

But wait, in this case, all the 12 charges are identical and located at 2m from P. So the charge at P is fixed and has a charge of 2e as well.

So, each of the 12 charges at 2m will interact with the fixed charge at P. So for each of those 12, their potential energy due to the fixed charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m), right?

But wait, since the 12 charges are identical and placed at 2m, do they interact with each other as well? Because the problem says the system's energy is to be calculated, which includes all interactions.

So I think the total potential energy U is the sum of all the pairwise interactions. So each of the 12 charges at 2m will interact with the fixed charge, and also with each other.

So let's break it down. Let's calculate the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the 12 charges, and then the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

First, the fixed charge at P is 2e, and each of the 12 charges is 2e. So the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge is (k * (2e) * (2
