Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. The problem says it's Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons, right? If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the atomic mass number A is 6. Got it.

Now, the question is about relativistic energy. The formula that comes to mind is the total energy of a particle, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, I can calculate gamma.

Gamma is equal to 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, v is 0.96c. Let me compute that. Let me square 0.96, which is 0.9216. Then 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is approximately 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, does that sound right? Because at 0.8c, gamma is about 1.666, so 0.96 should be higher. Yeah, 3.57 sounds correct.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is needed. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/cÂ². Wait, more accurately, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 g/mol. But wait, for a single nucleus, the mass is approximately the number of nucleons multiplied by the mass of a nucleon. Oh wait, but actually, the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found in tables.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value. Alternatively,
