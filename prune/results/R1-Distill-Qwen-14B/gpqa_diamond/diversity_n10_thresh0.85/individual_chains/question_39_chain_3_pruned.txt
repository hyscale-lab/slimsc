Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So we need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. I remember that the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since all the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the probability outside this region should be zero. So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3. Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So that's a complex function.

Wait, but wait. The wave function can't be zero everywhere except 1-3. Because the wave function inside 1-3 is non-zero, but outside it must be zero? Or maybe the given function is only valid between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Because otherwise, integrating the probability over all space would be infinite or something.

But the way the question is phrased says that the wave function in a part of space where it can exist is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, and non-zero between 1 and 3. So the normalization condition would require that the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Wait, but normalization is about the total probability being 1. So the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1. Because all the particles are found between 1 and 3, so the probability there is 1.

So I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1 to solve for 'a'.

Let me write down ψ(x). ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, wait a minute, wait. Because ψ is a complex function, the modulus squared is the product of ψ and its complex conjugate. So ψ* is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Then |ψ|^2 is ψ multiplied by ψ*, so:

(a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 - [because the cross terms would be imaginary and cancel out when multiplied out? Wait, let me compute it more carefully.

Wait, (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) multiplied by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) equals [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25. Because when you multiply it out, you get (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)(-0.5i). The middle
