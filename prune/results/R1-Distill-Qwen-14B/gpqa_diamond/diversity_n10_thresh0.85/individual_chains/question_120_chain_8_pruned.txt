Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think about what it's asking. Okay, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed. So, if I imagine looking up at the sky, stars are spread out evenly in all directions. Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverses of plx raised to different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx (in arcsec) = 1/distance (parsecs). That means as distance increases, parallax decreases. So more distant stars have smaller parallax values.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that the number density doesn't change with direction, but it might change with distance. Let me think about this. If I consider a thin shell at a certain distance, the number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume and the distribution.

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed, so the number density (n) is constant. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in the shell would be n * 4πr² dr. But how does this relate to parallax?

Oh, right. Parallax plx = 1/r (since r is in parsecs and plx in arcseconds). So r = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the number of stars.

So, the number of stars per unit parallax (Δplx) would be the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr, divided by the change in parallax Δplx. Wait, but I need to relate dr and dplx. Let’s see: plx = 1/r → dplx = -1/r² dr. So dr = -r² dplx. Since plx is positive and decreasing with r, maybe we can take the absolute value. So dr = (1/(plx)^2) dplx, where dplx is a small change. 

So, the number of stars in a shell is n * 4π r² dr. Substituting r=1/plx, r² = 1/(plx)^2. And dr is (1/(plx^2)) dplx.

Putting it all together: number of stars in shell = n *4π (1/(plx^2)) * (1/(plx^2)) dplx) → n*4π (1/(plx^4)) dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so that would be (number of stars) / (dplx). So the number per unit plx is (n *4π (1/(plx^4)) dplx) / dplx = n *4π (1/(plx^4)).

So it's proportional to 1/(plx)^4. That would mean the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as plx^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. Hmm, but wait a second. Did I get the substitution right? Let me double-check.

Wait, the number of stars in a shell is n * 4π r² dr. Then, dr is the change in r corresponding to a change dplx in parallax. Since plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. So, when plx changes by dplx, r changes by dr = (d(1/plx)) = -1/(plx^2) dplx. So dr = -(1/plx^2) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, but since we're considering a small shell, the magnitude is what matters. So, dr = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So the number of stars is n *4π (r²) dr = n *4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2 dplx) ) → n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx (d) is n *4π/(plx^4). So it's inversely proportional to plx^4. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but another approach: the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. For a given parallax range, the volume depends on the distance. So for a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, the volume is 4π ( (1/plx)^2 - (1/(plx + dplx))^2 ) (approximately, for small dplx, it's 4π (1/plx^2) (dplx) * (2/(plx))) → No, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential volume.

Wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. So for a given parallax (i.e., a given r), the number of stars in a thin shell is 4π r² dr
