Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reactions, and I need to figure out the products. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C. Each involves different reactants and conditions. I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? Because it's an enolate equivalent. The other reagent is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So in the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (the enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta carbonyl.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if we count from the ester group). So, the structure is something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, I think the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, the substituent (p-tolyl) is at the 3 position. So, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-... Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, substituting at the 3 position would be the middle carbon of the three in the acrylate. So, the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no, because acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, the 3 position would be the second carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally as the double bond being at the 2 and 3 positions. So, for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, the 3 position would be the COO group's adjacent carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with a p-tolyl group on C2. Then the COOCH3 is on C3.

So, when dimethyl malonate (which is (CH3COO)2CH-) acts as the nucleophile, the enolate would attack the beta carbon (C3) of the acrylate. Because the Michael addition is when the nucleophile attacks the beta position, which is the carbon next to the carbonyl.

Wait, in the acrylate, the carbonyl is at C3, so the beta carbon is C2. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the beta position is the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl substituent on the middle carbon. So, the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C-C(p-tolyl)OCH3, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH
