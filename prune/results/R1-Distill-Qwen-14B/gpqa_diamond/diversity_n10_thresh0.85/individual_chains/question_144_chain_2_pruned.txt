Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down.

The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so it's a very small distance.

I remember that the mean lifetime (or proper lifetime) of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, that's the proper time, which is the time measured in the rest frame of the particle. To find the mean decay distance, I think I need to find the lifetime in the lab frame and then multiply by the velocity of the particle.

Right, because particles moving at high speeds will have their lifetimes dilated due to time dilation in special relativity. So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is γ times the proper lifetime τ. Then, the decay distance would be the velocity v multiplied by the lab lifetime, so L = v * γ τ.

Wait, but how do I find v? The velocity can be found using the energy and mass of the particle. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and kinetic energy. The relativistic energy-momentum relation might help here. Oh, right, the energy squared is (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Solving for p, the momentum, gives p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c.

But wait, in natural units where c=1, this simplifies. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So p would be sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) in GeV/c. Let me compute that: 8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91 GeV/c.

Now, the velocity v can be found from the relation beta = v/c = p c / E. Oh wait, because beta = (p c) / (E). So beta = p c / E. Wait, but p is in GeV/c, and E is in GeV. So p c would be GeV. So let me plug in the numbers.

p c is 7.91 GeV/c * c = 7.91 GeV. E is 8 GeV. So beta = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c. That's a very high speed, close to the speed of light.

Now, I need to find gamma. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, given by gamma = E/(m c²) because E = gamma m c^2. Wait, no, wait. Actually, gamma is E/(m c^2) when E is the total energy. So E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Wait, let me compute that: 8 divided by 1.2. 1.2 times 6 is 7.2, 1.2 times 6.666 is 8. So yes, gamma is about 6.6667.

So the lab lifetime τ_lab is gamma times τ. But tau is ħ / Γ. So τ_lab = gamma * ħ / Gamma.

Wait, but let me make sure about the units. Gamma is in GeV, and ħ is in units that need
