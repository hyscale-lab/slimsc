Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it carefully.

The question is about the decay channels of a boson X. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, wait, I think that might be a typo in the way it's written. Oh, wait, probably it's L(y) = -λ ψ_f^\dagger (y) ( \upsilon + X(y) ) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, no, because the original expression has f and f bar, which are probably Dirac notation. Maybe it's more like L = -λ f \bar{ψ}f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the interaction term involves the boson X and fermions ψ_f. So X is a boson field that couples to some fermion ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So, the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV because energy and momentum must be conserved. So the rest mass of the X must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

I remember that in particle physics, a boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the energy is sufficient. The possible decays are determined by the available energy and the masses of the possible fermions.

Wait, but the interaction here is between X and a specific fermion. So the X can only decay into that fermion and its antiparticle, right? Because the interaction term determines the possible couplings. So if X couples to, say, a top quark, it can decay into top and anti-top. But if it couples to a lighter fermion, like a muon or electron, then it can decay into those.

Wait, but the way the Lagrangian is written, it's probably coupling X to a fermion ψ_f. So the decay products would be ψ_f and ψ_f-bar. So for example, if ψ_f is a quark, like up, down, strange, charm, or bottom, or top, then X can decay into a pair of those quarks. But wait, each quark has a mass, so the X's mass must be at least twice the quark mass for the decay to be possible.

Wait, but I'm not sure which fermion ψ_f is. The problem doesn't specify. Oh, wait, the problem says "the interaction is given by" that Lagrangian. So the form is L = -λ f ψ_f^\dagger (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe it's written as L = -λ ψ_f^\dagger (y) X(y) ψ_f(y) plus some mass term. So the interaction term is X ψ_f^\dagger ψ_f. So X is a scalar boson (since it's a field
