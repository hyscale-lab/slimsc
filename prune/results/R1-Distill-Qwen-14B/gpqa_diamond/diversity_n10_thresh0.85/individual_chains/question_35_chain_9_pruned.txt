Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y. The setup is a muon's intrinsic angular momentum. I remember that for angular momentum, we often deal with Pauli matrices or something similar. Oh wait, the problem gives me the matrix S for the operator A_y. 

The operator A_y is given as c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. Looking at S, the first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, that matrix looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, maybe. Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix? Or wait, no, Pauli Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S is that. So S is σ_y.

So A_y is c multiplied by σ_y. So first, let me write out A_y. c is h/(4π), so:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. But the question isn't asking for the exact values, but which statement is correct among the options. So perhaps I should think about the properties of the matrix.

Eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix satisfy the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0. So let's compute that.

Wait, A_y is a 2x2 matrix with elements (h/(4π)) times [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So let me write out A_y:

A_y = [ [0, -(h/(4π)) i ],
         [ (h/(4π)) i, 0 ] ]

So the matrix is:

Row 1: 0 and -(h/(4π)) i
Row 2: (h/(4π)) i and 0

The characteristic equation is determinant (A_y - a I) = 0.

So, writing the matrix (A_y - a I):
