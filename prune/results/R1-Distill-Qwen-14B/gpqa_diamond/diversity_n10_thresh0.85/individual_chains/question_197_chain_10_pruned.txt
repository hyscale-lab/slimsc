Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's start by analyzing the spectroscopic data.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, often indicative of O-H or N-H stretches. But since there are other peaks, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, which makes me think of either esters, ketones, or carboxylic acids. Another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be C=C stretching, possibly aromatic rings.

The 1H NMR data: Let me break it down.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an exchangeable proton like an alcohol, but the broadness might suggest it's a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an acidic environment, like an aldehyde? But aldehydes are around 9-10 typically, but more upfield. Wait, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The 8.0 ppm is upfield, so maybe electron-withdrawing groups, while 7.2 ppm is downfield, maybe electron-donating. Wait, or it could depend on substituents. Alternatively, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a benzene ring attached to a ketone or ester, that would cause the ring protons to split into doublets.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm. Maybe a CH that's adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a CH2 group next to something like an oxygen or
