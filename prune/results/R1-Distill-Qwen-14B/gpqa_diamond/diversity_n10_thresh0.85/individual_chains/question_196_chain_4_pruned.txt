Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let me think through this.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a 1D oscillator. The setup says it's relativistic, so I can't just use the classical formulas. Oh right, in the classical case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. But relativistically, energy is different because of the gamma factor.

So the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The maximum amplitude is A, and the mass is m. We need to find v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy U is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic question, so option C is probably not the correct answer.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change. The total energy isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential in the same way. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure how the potential energy factors in here.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is part of the total mechanical energy. So perhaps the total mechanical energy E is the sum of rest mass energy plus kinetic plus potential? Or is it that the spring's potential is part of the mechanical energy, separate from the rest mass energy?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to model it.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy E is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies at any point. At maximum displacement (x = A), the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)kA². At
