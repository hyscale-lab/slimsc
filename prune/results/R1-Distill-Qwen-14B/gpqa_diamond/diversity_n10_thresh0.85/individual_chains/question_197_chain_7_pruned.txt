Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me start by looking at the IR data. The peaks mentioned are between 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which I remember usually corresponds to O-H or N-H stretches, but since there's no mention of N, maybe it's an O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which sounds like a carbonyl group (C=O). The other peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, putting that together, Compound X probably has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. The 3400-2500 range could be due to an aliphatic O-H, maybe in a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches around 2500-3300 and a carbonyl around 1700.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably around 10 ppm, which is typical for an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a bit lower than a carboxylic acid's carbonyl (which is around 1700-1725). Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone, but the O-H in the IR suggests it's a carboxylic acid because esters don't have O-H. Wait, but wait, if it's a carbonyl and an O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So 10.5 ppm for the -COOH proton is about right.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Those look like two doublets which are likely from a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, if it's para-substituted, maybe with two substituents on opposite positions. The coupling here suggests that the aromatic protons are split into doublets, which would happen if each set is adjacent to one substituent. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with substituents at the 4-position and another group. Wait, but if it's a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, each pair of protons (ortho to substituents) would be as doublets. So maybe the substituents are in para positions. For example, a substituent at position 4 and another at position 1? Or maybe each substituent is in a para position relative to each other.

Wait, but the aromatic region in NMR can sometimes indicate the substitution pattern. Let me think: if there are two doublets each integrating to 2H, that suggests a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Like, for example, a substituent at position 4 and another at position... Wait, no, actually, if it's a para-substituted benzene, like with two substituents in the para positions relative to each other, then each set of protons would be two each. Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is at opposite ends. So maybe it's a 4-substituted benzene with another group, but perhaps the substituents are such that each causes the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents, one at the para position relative to each other, but maybe only one substituent (like in a 4-methyl group), but then the other substituent is a carbonyl group. Hmm, not sure yet.

Looking at the non-aromatic signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. That could be a methylene or methine group attached to something, maybe a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Or perhaps a CH group in a chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to 2H. Maybe a CH2 group next to something, like a carbonyl or an oxygen.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to 3H. A methyl group attached to something that splits the signal into a doublet. Maybe a CH3 connected to a CH group, which is then connected to another group. For example, a CH2CH(CH3) structure.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. A terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe CH2CH2CH3, but as a terminal group.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents that include a carbonyl group (like a COOH) and some alkyl chain. Let's try to sketch a possible structure.

Let me think about the substituents. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which are typical for a para-substituted benzene. Suppose the substituents are a COOH group and an isobutyl or something similar. Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH2CH3 group, perhaps as part of
