Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to get the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step. Alright, the problem says:

We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's just proportional, not necessarily a unit vector.

Then, we're asked to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think that matrix is an anti-diagonal matrix. For a 2x2 case, it would look like [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0], right? Wait no, because if i ≠ j, like row 1 column 2 is ħ/2, and row 2 column 1 is ħ/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. That's the operator's matrix.

Wait, but wait, what are the eigenstates of this matrix? Because to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in the corresponding eigenstates.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A. Let me think about 2x2 matrices. The matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI)=0.

So the matrix is:
[ -λ   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  -λ ]

The determinant is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → λ² = (ħ^2)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. Let's take λ = ħ/2. The equation (A - (ħ/2) I)|v> =0.

So the matrix becomes:
[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ]

Which simplifies the equations to:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the matrix would be:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Which gives (ħ/2)v1 + (ħ/2)v2=0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, -1).

Wait, but these are for the operator A. So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because usually, the spin matrices in x-direction have these as eigenstates. Wait, because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which has eigenvalues 1 and -1, with eigenvectors (1,1) and (1,-1), respectively. So yes, these are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. So operator A must be proportional to the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So operator A is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is (ħ/2) σ_x. So its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's, which are |+x> and |−x>.

So, our state |alpha> is given in the z-basis (|up> and |down>), but we need to express it in the x-basis (|+x>, |−x>) to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. Alternatively, since the operator A's eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, the probabilities are the square of the projection of |alpha> onto each of these states.

Wait, but before that, I think I should normalize |alpha>. The given state is proportional to that, so first, find the normalization constant.

|alpha> = C ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> )

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> =1. So compute |C|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2 ] =1.

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2−i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2=4+1=5.

So |C|^2*(2 +5) =1 → |C|²=1/7 → C=1/sqrt(7) as a positive real.

So |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ].

Now, express |alpha> in the |+x> and |−x> basis.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

To find a and b, we can compute the inner products:

a = < +x | alpha > 

b = < −x | alpha >

So compute a:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2−i) <up|down> 
+ (1+i) <down|up> + (2−i) <down|down> ]

Wait, but <up|down> =0 because they are orthonormal.

So simplifies to:

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)(1) + (2−i)(0) + (1+i)(0) + (2−i)(1) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) + (2−i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+2) + (i -i) ) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) (3 +0) → 3/sqrt(14)

Similarly, compute b = <−x | alpha>:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(
